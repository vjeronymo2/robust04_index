			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: SWISS TRADING PLACE VENDS QUALITY  </P> <P> This center of intellectual achievement and cultural refinement has a history  of progressive thought and free enterprise. It has been a trade center since  Roman times.  </P> <P> Because of this, Basel merchants have traditionally had access to the finest  material goods from throughout Europe; a situation that continues to this day.  This characteristic gives Basel shopping a quality unlike other cities around  the world. While the items for sale aren't necessarily inexpensive, quality is  the standard and it is applied to one-of-a-kind items that make excellent  gifts.  </P> <P> Situated at the intersection of Switzerland, France and Germany, Switzerland's  second-largest city and among its richest, borrows the best from all three  cultures.  </P> <P> Further, Basel's position straddling the Rhine River, makes it Switzerland's  only major port.  </P> <P> The Spalenberg area, a reflection of the city's character, features unusual  merchandise in an ambience of superb and subtle charm.  </P> <P> Located near the Mittlere Rheinbrucke, a bridge that has spanned the Rhine  since 1225, and the Marktplatz, a town market since the Middle Ages, the  Spalenberg is a winding, hilly, little street with a unique selection of  specialty shops occupying the ground floors of centuries-old buildings. Many of  those shops specialize in gifts for the home.  </P> <P> Here are some of the highlights:  </P> <P> Atelier Baumgartner (No. 8) is a home decorating shop filled with contemporary  furniture, rugs and lamps, many of which are handmade and produced either in  limited editions or as one-of-a-kind pieces.  </P> <P> Of particular interest are the easy-to-pack gift items, especially the  collection of glass objects, including etched Swiss-made perfume bottles (from  $35).  </P> <P> Equally attractive are glass carafes in simple modern shapes (from $20) and a  variety of vases and drinking glasses designed to suggest the smoky look of  antique Etruscan glass (from $20 to $50 each). There are also vases that have  been carved out of solid rock (from $23) and matching napkin rings (about $6  each).  </P> <P> Henri Robert (No. 10) rounds out the home furnishings scene with top  luxury-label crystal, porcelain and silver. The range of merchandise includes  French-made table settings by Bernardaud, silver platters and flatware from  Cristofle and Lalique vases and goblets.  </P> <P> Several stores can help you shop for kitchens.  </P> <P> Stocklin Basel (No. 15) specializes in copper and pewter pots, pitchers,  platters and other objects from around the world. Included are Swiss-made  copper cooking vessels (from about $70) and Holland-made pewter platters made  in rectangular or oval shapes and priced from about $400.  </P> <P> Wohnshop Bazar (No. 25) is an outlet filled with kitchen gadgets. A wide  variety of plastic containers (from $3), plates and platters (from $4 each),  and bathroom and desk accessories (from $4) come in coordinated colors.  </P> <P> Looking for cutlery of distinction? Toni Ottenburg Messerschmeid (No. 33) is a  cutlery shop that was founded about 150 years ago and has been at this location  since 1950. The shop features a wide range of distinctive table service. There  are reproductions of antique patterns (about $8 and up per piece), including  delicate bone-handled spoons.  </P> <P> Inexpensive and easy-to-carry kitchen gifts are found at London Tea Company  (No. 26), which stocks more than 80 types of tea, from high-grade Sumatra or  Darjeeling to exotic China Rose or Anis. Priced from about $2 and up per 100  grams, they are stored in huge, red, antique tins with gold lettering. Aromas  inspire shoppers to sample a little of everything, and afterward re-order  favorites by mail.  </P> <P> For antiques, look in Bum unteren Wildenstein Antiquitaten (No. 18). There you  will find rustic, antique Swiss farm furniture and home accessories. Everything  in the store is at least 100 years old. Stock includes a hand-hewn chest (about  $2,765) made in Central Switzerland during the 1650s to vintage coffee grinders  (about $80) and pewter pitchers from the 1850s (about $125).  </P> <P> It also has wooden rocking horses ($1,250 to $3,970) and huge multicompartment  sideboards (from about $6,000). The shop offers a glimpse at life in peaceful  Switzerland in decades past.  </P> <P> Johann Wanner (No. 14) outfits customers for two seasons only: Easter and  Christmas. For the first several months of each year, the Wanner shop  celebrates Easter with stuffed bunnies (from $10) and straw baskets (from $6).  </P> <P> The shop is then transformed into a bower of Christmas decorations and other  delights, displayed in theme arrangements. Wanner's chocolates and Christmas  tree ornaments ($2 and up) are made specially for the shop. The ornaments are  hand-blown and hand-painted glass fashioned into a variety of shapes.  </P> <P> While books may not furnish a house they do help make a house a home.  </P> <P> Buch &amp; Kunstantiquariat (No. 29) is a tiny gallery that's crammed full of  old prints and rare books, dating from the 14th Century to the end of the 19th  Century.  </P> <P> The owners rely on extensive catalogues to help patrons locate and buy any  title on any subject. A sale box is filled with 19th-Century decorative prints  of landscapes, town scenes and historical events and maps, many of which are of  old Basel, and which cost as little as $12.  </P> <P>  Prices in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of writing.  </P> <P> </P></p>

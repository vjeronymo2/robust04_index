			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Barbour Index shows 2% decline BARBOUR INDEX, the specialist information services group, yesterday reported a 2 per cent decline in half-year turnover, pre-tax profits and earnings per share, but is increasing its interim dividend. Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 slipped to Pounds 2.71m (Pounds 2.78m) on turnover of Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.17m), reflecting the depressed state of its primary market, professionals in the construction industry. Earnings per share at 10.9p were down from 11.1p, but the interim dividend is increased to 2.55p (2.4p) 'in view of the company's financial strength and our confidence in the future,' said Mr Patrick Barbour, chairman. The balance sheet remained strong with net cash increasing by Pounds 760,000 to Pounds 4.4m compared with a year ago. Mr Barbour said the group's strategy under depressed economic conditions has been to increase its investment in the development and launch of new services, while keeping tight control on costs. In the past 12 months the company has launched five new services, three for health and safety and two for construction. Mr Barbour said this had helped the group replace lost construction subscribers, where many architects were either out of work or under-employed. Health and safety now accounted for about 25 per cent of Barbour's business.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Philips' lighting division back in the black in North America PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, said yesterday that its lighting division managed to make an operating profit in North America in 1992 for the first time since 1984 Mr Einar Kloster, president of Philips Lighting, also said that the company had 'caught up' with the competition in new lighting products such as halogen lamps after falling behind by about two years at the beginning of the 1990s. Mr Kloster declined to give further details of the lighting division's 1992 results ahead of the scheduled release of group results March 4. Philips has been involved in a reorganisation in the US after acquiring Westinghouse's light bulb factories in 1983. He predicted that 1993 would prove to be a 'very tough' year for lighting. Philips' lighting business put in a strong performance in 1992, resuming its traditional role of 'cash cow' after faltering briefly in 1990. In the first nine months of 1992, the division posted a 63 per cent increase in operating profit to Fl 602m (Dollars 325m) which helped to compensate for part of the downturn in the group's key consumer electronics business. Mr Kloster described the world lighting market as stable, with Philips, General Electric of the US and Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens of Germany, holding roughly equal shares of the market for conventional light bulbs. Mr Kloster said Philips must use the 'window' opened by its competitors' efforts to digest recent acquisitions to concentrate on becoming a low-cost producer. The Dutch company's aim is to equip its European factories to produce at least 200m light bulbs a year. It has already announced plans to close its light bulb factory in Dijon, France, and redistribute this capacity among the group's five other European plants.</p>

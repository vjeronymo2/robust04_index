			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Holderbank to increase share capital HOLDERBANK, the Swiss cement group, plans an increase in share capital after posting a 27.6 per cent decline in net consolidated earnings to SFr311m (Dollars 210m) in 1990. Group turnover rose 5.5 per cent to SFr5.25bn. Holderbank Financiere Glaris, the parent company, reported a 5.1 per cent advance to SFr78.9m in 1990 net profit and the board proposes to pay unchanged dividends of SFr125 per bearer share, SFr25 per registered share and SFr12.50 per participation certificate. Shareholders will be offered a rights issue as part of an increase from SFr231m to SFr280m in the nominal share capital. In a first tranche 46,200 bearer shares with a par value of SFr500 will be offered at a price of SFr2,500, almost exactly half the price at which the bearer shares traded in Zurich before the announcement. The allocation will be 1 for 10 for bearer shares, 1 for 50 for registered shares and 1 for 100 for participation certificates. The board will also seek authority to issue at its own discretion a further 51,800 bearer shares without rights attached, of which a limited number would be earmarked for employees. The declines in group net profit and cash-flow, down by 8.6 per cent to SFr869m, in 1990 are steeper than those forecast by Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, the chairman and managing director, in November. Negative currency movements reduced group turnover by SFr428m, newly-acquired companies added SFr410m while internal growth contributed SFr290m. Weak construction markets in North America and South Africa, low profit margins in some newly-acquired companies and unfavourable currency movements are given as the main reasons for the setback in earnings. In addition, Holderbank maintained a high level of capital spending. Investments in property, plant and equipment grew by 13 per cent to SFr641m.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sabena relaunches with modest profit SABENA, the Belgian national airline, yesterday relaunched its corporate and financial image with a surprise announcement that it had returned to modest profit after years of heavy losses. The company attributed its recovery to the 11-month-old partnership with Air France, the French national carrier. Mr Pierre Godfroid, chairman, said the group expected a consolidated net profit of BFr6m (Dollars 180,000) for 1992, against a loss of BFr2.44bn in 1991 and a loss of BFr5.17bn in 1990. Group results cover the performance of the scheduled airline, centralised operations and regional and charter services. Mr Godfroid said more details would be released in April. Mr Godfroid said Sabena could not have achieved such results without Air France's support, particularly on fleet management, which he said saved the Belgian company about BFr500m last year. The modest recovery has not come cheaply. Air France and a Belgian consortium agreed last April to inject BFr6bn into Sabena in the years up to 1994, and take a 37.6 per cent stake. The Belgian government contributed a further BFr9bn on top of earlier heavy investment. Further state aid would almost certainly be banned by the European Commission.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bangkok Land tumbles 83% at midway Bangkok Land, Thailand's second biggest property company, has reported a worse-than-expected 83 per cent drop in half-year net profits to Bt497m (Dollars 19.86m), compared with Bt2.9bn a year ago. Earnings per share dropped to Bt0.83 from Bt4.85. In the second quarter alone, to end-September, profits fell 89 per cent to Bt164m from Bt1.5bn in the same period last year. Bangkok Land said the unusually long rainy season had delayed its construction schedule. It also made a Bt350m foreign exchange loss in the first quarter. The company's ambitious 640 hectare new town, Muang Tong Thani, on the northern outskirts of Bangkok, so far appears to be a poor seller and a drain on resources. Earlier profits are thought to have been boosted by the sale of development land. This can be booked as a profit when only a down-payment is made, because land counts as a finished product even under stricter new Thai accounting rules. However, property companies are no longer allowed to book full profits on partially-paid property, which previously has been used by some developers to prop up results. In the full year to March 1994, Bangkok Land reported net profits of Bt5.02bn.</p>

Because of this, the Russian Foreign Ministry would like to  state the following. As far as interstate relations between  Russia and Belarus are concerned, they are still a priority for  us with the objective of strengthening friendship and developing  in-depth mutually advantageous cooperation in the military,  political, trade, economic, humanitarian, and other spheres.    A good foundation has already been laid for moving toward  the  strategic objective of bringing our two countries closer  together in accordance with decisions made by the  highest-ranking leaders of Russia and Belarus.    There is no doubt that rapprochement of this kind would  encourage a carefully prepared amalgamation of the monetary  systems of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus on  the basis of the intergovernmental agreement of 8 September  1993. The statement by the Russian and Belarusian heads of  government dated 5 January 1994 states that the work that has  been done to implement this agreement includes tasking the two  countries' ministries and departments with preparing additional  documents which will define the mechanism whereby the monetary  system will operate once it has been amalgamated, the single  mechanism for administering the budget systems of both states,  and also questions connected with foreign economic, trade, and  customs policy.    The fastest possible coordination of these documents would  suit the interests of the people of both countries.    Commenting on this statement for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA,  Grigoriy  Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry  Information and Press Department, said: "The process of  establishing bilateral relations is multidimensional and  multilayered, and Russian ministries and departments have been  directly instructed by the president and the government to work  intensively and dynamically in this area."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Text of communique issued by the Mexican National Defense </F> Secretariat, SDN, on 4 January; place not given; from the "Good  Afternoon From Mexico" newscast]    [Text] The clashes between the transgressors of the law and  Mexican Army troops continue. On 3 January the aggressor groups  tried several times to recover the city of Ocosingo by staging  intermittent attacks which were repelled by the troops.    The military personnel are currently -- at 1300 -- receiving  sporadic fire from snipers in some buildings and on rooftops,  mainly the Church and the Municipal Presidency. It is known  that some other groups are still hidden on the outskirts of  Ocosingo.    Up to this moment, the number of casualties inflicted on the  said group amount to 35 dead and an undetermined number of  wounded. As has already been reported, they evacuate their  wounded and their corpses when possible. Furthermore, 35  weapons, 15 grenades, a large amount of ammunition of diverse  calibers, and knives, as well as silencers, gas masks, and radio  equipment have been seized.    In the military field of the 31st Military Zone, located 10  km southeast of the city of San Cristobal [De Las Casas], the  military personnel have endured constant harassment from  isolated shots and have captured, on those occasions, eight  armed individuals who form part of the aggressor groups. These  men, including a minor, were immediately delivered to the  authorities of the Federal Attorney General's Office. During  the night of 2 January, the aforementioned military  installation, including the housing areas, received intermittent  rifle fire from snipers.    In San Cristobal [De Las Casas], the situation is completely  calm.    Up to this moment and since the beginning of the military  operations, two officers and five soldiers have died and two  officers and 14 soldiers have been wounded. On the other hand,  59 dead have been counted among the members of the transgressor  groups, and eight of them have been captured.    To these [numbers] we have to add the 27 deaths inflicted by  the aggressor group on the civilian population and the local  police during the takeover of the four municipal capitals on the  first day of the year.</p>

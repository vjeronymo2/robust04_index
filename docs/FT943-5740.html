			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Property: Returns fall Retail and industrial property rates of return fell in July with total all-property returns declining by 0.2 percentage points to 0.7 per cent for the month, according to Investment Property Databank, a research group. Capital values managed only a marginal increase over the month while total rental values fell by 0.2 per cent. This was disappointing following the recent stabilization in rental values. However, the long-term slide in rental values has slowed. Rental values of all types of property during the 12 months to end-July have fallen by 3.5 per cent says IPD. The year-on-year total return on all properties fell from 26.1 per cent to 25.4 per cent between June and July. Retail remained the best performing sector with total returns of 0.9 per cent in spite of a half-point fall in July. Industrials were in second place with a return of 0.7 per cent down from 1 per cent in June. Offices, in spite of improving from 0.3 per cent to 0.4 per cent, remained in third place in terms of total returns. IPD said that net investment was the only indicator which remained buoyant having been positive across all three sectors for nearly a year and rising to Pounds 94m in July, close to the peak levels achieved in February and May this year.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Alcatel in Egypt-Jordan deal - Contracts &amp; ventures Alcatel Kabel Norge, the Norwegian subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom, has signed a Dollars 70m contract with the power ministries of Egypt and Jordan to supply and install submarine cables to link their two electricity grids by 1997. The company will supply four cables to run 13km under the Gulf of Aqaba from the Egyptian resort of Taba to Aqaba on the Jordanian coast. The Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development is providing full financing for the deal. The deal is the first phase of an eventual plan to link the power grids of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey and possibly also Israel, at a later stage in the present Middle East peace process. The Egypt-Jordan cable contract was agreed as a submarine link when it was signed in August, before the recent peace agreement between Israel and Jordan. Egyptian electricity ministry officials have left open the possibility that Israel could join the shared grid later.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: AB Consulting Pounds 0.85m in the red AB Consulting, the engin-eering consultancy, blamed the recession in the construction industry for a fall into pre-tax losses of Pounds 849,000 in the six months to October 31. There were profits of Pounds 327,000 last time. The company, however, said that it expected to be back in profit in the last quarter of the current year following cuts in staff and overheads last October and November. Turnover improved to Pounds 6.29m (Pounds 5.36m) helped by the acquisition of Brian Ford Partnership. Losses per share came out at 5.4p (earnings 2.7p). The interim dividend has been cut from 2.2p to 0.3p.</p>

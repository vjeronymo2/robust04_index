While the country's political affairs continue along their  course, often in an uncontrolled struggle of ideas of thoughts  set forth by the defenders of both the government and  opposition, there is a specific, everyday matter that is always  put on a back burner; that issue is Peru's economic reality.    While the news media, politicians, and leaders discuss human  rights, the Cantuta law, the sentences in the La Cantuta case,  and other legal and political issues, the Peruvian people's  pockets remain a source of concern.    I would like to know what economic progress can be expected  in 1994. Will there be any improvements in our economic  indexes, apart from inflation, which is something tangible that  can be seen by all Peruvians and by other countries also? How  is the recession unfolding; are we defeating it? Is there  economic reactivation in Peru? Can we say there is light at the  end of the tunnel? What will happen with pending disbursements,  international loans, bilateral relations, and relations with  private commercial banks?    I would like to know if indeed this year, as has often been  said, the economic situation will have any bearing on the  Peruvian people's pocketbooks. Should this fail to be the case,  the entire problem will boil down to speeches and theories. I  would also like to know the terms of Peru's new agreement with  the IMF. To discuss these and other issues we have invited  Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camet, to whom we are  grateful for his appearance on this program. Good morning, Mr.  Minister. Welcome to "Saturday Focus."    [Camet] Good morning.    [Vargas] [passage omitted] Let's take the bull by the horns  right away. Mr. Minister, I would like to start off with recent  information and gradually address the country's everyday  problems. What, exactly, are the terms of Peru's new agreement  with the IMF, and why is there talk of a new agreement? Does it  mean there was a discussion or debate over the previous  agreement which led to changes? Why is the agreement called a  new agreement with the IMF?    [Camet] We have a three-year agreement with the IMF which is  called an Extended Facility Fund [three previous words in  English]. However, a program is created every year; therefore,  we had a 1993 program, and this year we negotiated and discussed  the 1994 program. The 1995 program will also be discussed.    [Vargas] What is the scope of this new program? Has the  entire program been modified? We all know that the government's  economic program is executed under the IMF's strict  surveillance. Are there any conditions in this new agreement?    [Camet] We establish goals for the program and we discuss  them with the IMF. This time our target was inflation of 20  percent, a growth rate of 4-5 percent, increased international  reserves of approximately 576 million [no currency specified],  zero net domestic credit at the BCR [Central Reserve Bank],  continued fiscal austerity marked by spending from our income,  and a deficit that can be covered by foreign loans of  approximately 2.5 percent; I cannot remember the exact figure.    The fact of the matter is that the IMF has agreed to all  our main targets. We discussed differences we had over the use  of privatization funds and concluded that we could spend 450  million [currency not specified] on anything we wanted, while  the remaining funds available to us would be held in reserve,  because we need to have a certain amount for a Brady Plan down  payment, which we hope to have by the end of the year.    [Vargas] Now it is Augusto Alvarez Rodrich's turn on  "Saturday Focus." How are you, Augusto?    [Alvarez] Good morning, how are you? There are two topics I  would like to discuss regarding the 1994 program, and one of  them is taxes. It is clear that Sunat [National Superintendency  of Tax Administration] has made an effort, but it is also clear  that the effort is still insufficient compared to what is needed  and that there is still a knotty side to our economic outlook.  I would like your impression of how much headway can be made in  the field of taxes, and what can be changed this year --  specifically in terms of those things that have not worked that  well?    [Camet] Augusto Alvarez has broached a very important topic,  and I appreciate the question. Just as last year, when we  devoted much attention to inflation, because we believed we  needed to reduce it as well as reduce expectations of higher  inflation -- which, in our opinion, was one of the main causes  of inflation following the cutbacks my predecessors had made --  this year the issue is tax collection. Tax collection is  fundamental. In Peru we have a saying: You cannot have belts  without leather. Tax collection is critical and basic. Last  year, tax collection amounted to about 10.5 percent of the GNP;  this year we estimate it at 12.1 percent. Half-jokingly I have  said that if Sunat Director Sandro Fuentes only collects 12.1  percent, I will give him a top grade of 10. Nevertheless, Sunat  needs to collect considerably more. As a practical measure, we  have provided Sunat with two new international experts who are  already working -- one in verification and the other in  detection -- to cover the most important sources of tax evasion.  It is not a matter of raising taxes, which are already high; it  is a matter of reducing tax evasion. [passage omitted]    [Alvarez] Mr. Minister, I would like to discuss another  large  issue which, like the fiscal issue, is complex -- namely,  negotiating the foreign debt. According to experts, in the next  two years the foreign sector could become a source of great  pressure for the development of the economic plan. My question  is this: What will the banks be told? Sometimes it seems  commercial banks expect results that exceed Peru's capacity to  pay. We are talking about whether Peru can enter a scheme to  service the debt. The way it stands now, Peru should assign  about 45 percent of all exports to debt repayments, which is  impossible. Therefore, what will the banks be told?    [Camet] As you all know, we began negotiating with the banks  in November 1993. We had not been able to do this earlier  because of the great number of creditors. This forces us to  assign priorities and enter into agreements with them one at a  time. We Peruvians should not forget that on 18 March 1992 we  seriously began to rejoin the world economic system when we  signed an agreement to update our debts with the IMF and the  World Bank, thanks to the support received from Japan and the  United States -- support we should always be grateful for. For  nearly a year, we have been doing effective and realistic work  in this area. We do not have the money to repay the banks, and,  therefore, an honest debtor must offer assets if there is no  money. Consequently, we offered the banks the ability to  convert the debt into investments -- an offer that was well  received in principle after our auditors, such as the IMF,  certified that it was indeed true that we had no money. It is  easy to say I have no money, but it is important that this be  true.    [Alvarez, interrupting] Excuse me for interrupting. The  first point is that there is no possibility of giving the banks  any money. Was the only option left to exchange debt for  privatization?    [Alvarez] There is no money whatsoever. We have offered them  the ability to participate in privatizations in part with bonds  [papeles], because we also need cash, and therefore we will make  a mixture. We have informed them that case by case,  privatization by privatization, we will indicate what we feel is  convenient on how much should be in cash and how much in bonds.  So far, the only case is Centromin [Central Peru Mining  Enterprise] with $60 million in bonds against $280 [million] in  cash. [passage omitted]    [De Leon] Mr. Minister, I would like to refer to a specific  issue with regard to the National Bank. Numerous leaders, among  whom for example is former President Fernando Belaunde, have  expressed their concern over the fate of the state bank. As far  as I know, the government has only made general statements  regarding the bank's restructuring. Nevertheless, I have some  information here. I would like to know how you responded to  Defense Minister Victor Malca last year when he asked you in an  official note not to close the Puerto Inca banking agency.  After noting that this is a banking agency that serves the  people and public employees in this region, Malca asked you to  reconsider reopening this agency because it is important for  this region's development. I believe that Minister Malca's  concern is similar to that of many Peruvians.    Continuing with the National Bank issue, I would like you to  tell us what advantage there was for Peru in withdrawing $33  million from the Nation Bank's accounts and transferring these  funds to the Bank Wiese in an operation with Switzerland  regarding the foreign debt. What is Peru's gain in this, Mr.  Minister? What is the government's policy in terms of the  National Bank?    I understand that the word restructuring is only a figure of  speech. Is the bank being closed? Are the bank's powers being  taken away? Is it no longer a state financial institution? It  is also almost no longer the institution that collects taxes....  What is the government's policy with regard to the National  Bank?    [Camet] Monopolies are never convenient; for starters I will  take up the tax collection issue. For some time now -- it is  not measure I implemented, but one that I agree with -- for the  benefit of the taxpayers, taxes can be paid to the financial  system in general. Notwithstanding, the National Bank collects  70 percent of the taxes. The other 30 percent fall within an  agreement between Sunat with several private banks that have  accepted the conditions to carry out this task.    The National Bank is not going to disappear. The National  Bank was created during a time convenient for its creation; this  was the work of Mr. Belaunde. Mr. Belaunde, unfortunately for  the nation, closed the Deposit and Consignment Bank. The  National Bank, like many state enterprises, has on one hand  distorted part of its duties, while on the other it is in a very  difficult financial situation. This is the main reason why we  are restructuring the bank, and not as a matter of speech, as  you may have been informed, Mr. De Leon.    We want to preserve it as the Treasury's bank. It has  fundamental duties, and this is why the National Bank will not  disappear. Of the 430 branches, 230 are located in remote  places where it is the sole institution that deals with  financial matters, although it may only act as tax collector and  cashier in very poor places where there are no other economic  activities.    [De Leon] Nevertheless, the Puerto Inca agency was closed  down. General Malca mentioned this in his official note.    [Camet] Since the National Bank is the only institution that  represents the state in those areas, the offices will not be  closed in those areas. At the same time, however, the National  Bank must be efficient. At the National Bank there is not only  a very serious situation concerning where it belongs; it can  almost be said that the institution is bankrupt to a certain  extent. I cannot categorically say this; we have people  analyzing the bank. The National Bank's credit to the public  enterprises, its enormous passive... [pauses] the bank's passive  assets total 9 million soles per month, while its active assets  only total 4 million soles per month. Do you realize the  magnitude of these figures I am presenting to you? I do not  want to give you any more figures because I do not yet have the  final report. [passage omitted]    [De Leon] [passage omitted] Once again I ask you, what is  the  advantage for the National Bank to have $33 million withdrawn  from its funds upon orders of Mr. [name indistinct] to be  subsequently deposited -- it specifically says here -- in the  Wiese Bank.    [Camet] Look here Mr. de Leon, I have known you for some  time, you are an excellent reporter....    [De Leon, interrupting] Thank you sir.    [Camet] I know you from Confiep [National Confederation of  Private Business]. I am going to explain to you this specific  case because I see you have been given information -- not  distorted but definitely biased. I am going to explain to you  this case. In the Donors Club in Paris we were offered by the  consulting group loans or donations for two years to the amount  of $900 million to address poverty. A fundamental aspect of our  program is to diminish poverty. We were offered through  donations that are already being made effective. [sentence as  heard]    The case you mentioned is related to Switzerland's forgiving  of our debt of $130 million. This pardon demanded the deposit  of approximately $30 million by Peru. The donor demanded that  this sum be deposited in a private bank. Well, if the donor  forgives us $130 million conditioned to the deposit of $30  million in a private bank, I will most certainly deposit this in  a private bank sooner rather than later. This is what has been  reported to you in a biased fashion.    [De Leon] I do not seen that it is so biased. [Words  indistinct, Camet and De Leon speaking simultaneously] I  understand that a negotiator is precisely that. I believe that,  for example, the Continental Bank and the Interbank are state  banks but legally they can operate as private banks....    [Camet, interrupting] If the donor [words indistinct with de  Leon and Camet speaking simultaneously]. If the donor demands  that the funds not be deposited in a mixed bank either, well,  for a $130-million donation to Peru, we place $30 million in a  private bank, just as is demanded by the donor. Mr. [name  indistinct] only chairs a four- to five-member committee which  oversees the negotiations with the donor.    [Salazar] Mr. Minister, I would like to ask you about a  couple of specific things. I believe there are two main  stabilizing elements in the economy: interest rates and the  exchange rate. What plans are there for 1994 in these areas? A  second question: You have said you will fire Sunat Director  Sandro Fuentes if the GNP does not grow from 10.5 percent to  12.1 percent, which is really a 1.6 percent GNP growth. If you  are expecting the GNP to gain five points during 1994, as you  have predicted, why make the statement in the first place?  Last, sir, you say you would like to hire international experts  to prevent tax evasion. Perhaps you are not aware, but reports  I have seen just recently state that tax evasion is on the rise  all over the world. In the United States, particularly, evasion  is growing enormously. What kind of international experts are  you planning to bring in?    [Camet] Thank you. Regarding interest rates, unfortunately  these are still high. I believe the financial system in general  took a while to adjust and readapt. This area did take a lesser  beating from the economic readjustment plan than other areas  did, and interest rates are slowly but surely falling.    I have several studies on the exchange rate situation I am  examining at this time. They demonstrate that, if in fact there  has been some degree of dragging in this process, the difference  has been no greater than 10 points. This is a very  controversial issue. This year we expect to gain three points  with respect to parity, and I hope we do. The exchange rate at  this time is seasonably stable. This has become quite a regular  thing for this time of year. I remember that in 1992 we lost a  lot of ground with respect to parity. This loss, however, came  because of the excessive increases we had during 1992, when we  gained 10 percent, which led us to heavy inflation in the first  quarter of 1993. I believe it is rather conservative to speak  of a 4 or 5 percent growth of the GNP. I think it will be more  than that. I hope it will be more.    Regarding the international experts on controlling and  reducing tax evasion, we are not going to hire them. They are  already working. These are people with great experience. One  had extensive experience in Chile. His specialty is auditing.  This individual is a very good adjunct. We also have experts  working on internal organizations and preparing control systems  for interagency communications via computer. Our people also  worked well to establish the taxpayer registration number.    [Salazar] What I meant was this: If the overall GNP is  going to grow more than 5 percent, then the 10.5 percent  increase in tax collection would provide greater income. An  increase from 6 percent to 10.5 percent would mean greater tax  collection. Why does the state need greater tax collection if  you said the budget will be kept within austerity limits?    [Camet] Better tax collection means more solutions for  poverty than what we are able to provide now. We will be able  to increase public investment.    [Salazar] Public investment perhaps, but there is not very  much room for ending poverty or for improving social spending,  right? This would mean programs that are not currently  included in the budget.    [Camet] If you add loans, certain figures in the budget, and  social spending coordination -- which Alfonso Bustamante started  and we will continue -- you will find that at least 3 percent of  the GNP is dedicated to poverty within the budget's current  parameters.    [Salazar] That is really not all that impressive, you know.    [Camet] When seen by the one who collected that 10.5 percent  last year, it is almost one-third. That is a significant effort  in itself. We could only have achieved this now that the  economy is beginning to move in the direction you all are  witnessing.    [Salazar] There have been greater allotments for other types  of spending than social spending.    [Camet] We have cut back on basic expenditures, but this  area still represents 7 percent.    [Salazar] Defense, for example, is much greater than social  spending, is it not?    [Camet] No, it is not greater. Please bear in mind that  Peru no longer buys a single tank or a single fighter plane.  Peru is only buying equipment for its domestic needs, which is  all light equipment. [passage omitted]</p>

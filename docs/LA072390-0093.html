			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> LONG REPORTS TO CAMP, SAYS HE HAD PERSONAL BUSINESS  </P> <P> Saying it was just a case of miscommunication, Howie Long reported to the  Raiders' training camp late Saturday night after a one-day unexcused absence.  </P> <P> Why did Long fail to report to training camp on Friday, the first day veterans  were due?  </P> <P> "Not to be sarcastic, but it's personal," Long said. "I just had to take care  of some family business. It was just a case of something popping up at the last  minute, and I had no choice."  </P> <P> Why didn't Long inform Coach Art Shell of his absence?  </P> <P> "I didn't speak to Art, but I spoke to management and everything was fine,"  Long said.  </P> <P> But Shell apparently never got the message.  </P> <P> Shell said everything was fine.  </P> <P> "I met with him and I was satisfied with everything he had to say," Shell said.  "This chapter is closed."  </P> <P> While the case is closed on Long, who practiced for the first time Sunday, the  cases remain open for the Raiders' eight holdouts: quarterback Steve Beuerlein,  tailback Marcus Allen, fullback Steve Smith, cornerback Mike Haynes, safety  Vann McElroy, tight end Mike Dyal, defensive end Greg Townsend and defensive  end Anthony Smith, their No. 1 draft pick.  </P> <P> Has there been any progress in negotiations?  </P> <P> "I'm just waiting for them to tell me when they're coming in," Shell said.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> The Raiders released safety Russell Carter, a seven-year veteran. "We're going  in a different direction and we feel comfortable with the younger players we  have," Coach Art Shell said. "We released him early to give him an opportunity  to catch on with someone else." . . . The Raiders also cut Anthony Grove, a  rookie wide receiver from LaVerne. . . . Defensive end Lyle Alzado, attempting  to make a comeback at 41, didn't practice Sunday. Shell said that Alzado had  suffered a strained calf muscle. Alzado's status is listed as day to day. . . .  Linebacker Bruce Klosterman sat out Sunday's practice because of a hamstring  injury, and running back Leon Perry was sidelined because of a shoulder injury.  </P></p>

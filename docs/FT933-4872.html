			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Taxing time for Germany The value added tax regime introduced at the launch of the single European market on January 1 is causing problems for German business. This is the conclusion of a survey* by the German industry association, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie. The survey found that the tax regime has placed a considerable burden in terms of cost and bureaucracy on German business. Its findings back up complaints made by British companies and business organisations. The new tax regime has imposed additional costs on business equivalent to 0.3 per cent of the value of intra-EC trade, the survey calculates. This has resulted from the need to update computer programmes, train staff in the complexities of the tax system, collate trade data and employ additional administrative staff. The single market VAT system has transferred responsibility for reporting VAT liability and the collection of trade data from customs posts to businesses. The EC still hopes to introduce a simplified system, taxing all intra-EC shipments in the country of origin, in January 1997. In the meantime, the transitional system has led to a marked complication of trade activities, the German industry association says. Companies must maintain three separate systems for dealing with VAT, for domestic sales, for intra-EC sales, and for sales to customers outside the EC. Businesses handling large volumes of deliveries frequently have difficulty identifying invoices from suppliers within the EC on which no VAT has been paid. Discrepancies between the data required for tax and for trade statistics purposes impose an additional burden. German businesses have also had problems confirming customers' VAT registration numbers from the tax authorities. This puts them at a disadvantage compared with their French counterparts, which can call up numbers on the Minitel database. *Erfahrungen Deutscher Unternehmen mit dem Umsatzsteuerlichen Ubergangssystem.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from the Sergey Komissarenko, Ukrainian Ambassador </F> to London: "The Causes of Crisis in Crimea"]    [Text] Sir, Your editorial, "Troubled Crimea" (May 23),  shows a marked support for Crimean separatism in Ukraine and  may, unintentionally, give irresponsible politicians in Crimea  the impression that you are encouraging secession.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has more than once  spoken  in favour of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The United  Kingdom endorsed the tripartite statement in January of Ukraine,  the United States and Russia, which guarantees Ukraine's present  borders. We hope that the British public will share the same  view on this complicated issue.    The Republic of Crimea already enjoys considerable autonomy  within the Ukraine constitution.    It is not fair to blame Ukraine for delays in the division  of  the Black Sea Fleet, not least because the negotiations have not  yet been completed.    In spite of rather strong internal opposition to nuclear  disarmament, Ukraine has never backtracked from its obligations  to remove nuclear weapons and consistently fulfils them.    Finally, Max van der Stoel, who is High Commissioner for  National Minorities for the Conference on Security and  Co-operation in Europe, stated in February that the situation of  minorities in Ukraine can be regarded as exemplary, especially  in comparison with some other areas in the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Property price bubble blamed on bank technology THE SPECULATIVE bubble in property prices, which today is at the heart of many countries' economic problems and has led to big losses for hundreds of banks, was to a large extent caused by advances in banking technology. That is the view of Mr Gerald Corrigan, who is one of the most influential spokesmen on banking regulation as chairman of the Basle-based committee on bank supervision and president of the New York Federal Reserve. In an agenda-setting speech, Mr Corrigan said that technological change was the 'missing link in terms of efforts to explain why credit-induced asset price bubbles have been able to move with such relative ease from one spot on the globe to another'. He said that common economic influences, such as inflationary expectations, did not provide a sufficient explanation of why developers and others in so many countries borrowed vast sums to invest in property in the last decade. The effect of this borrowing in the US, the UK, Japan, France, Spain, Scandinavia and other regions was to push up property prices very sharply, until a slowdown in economic growth led to a collapse in prices. Mr Corrigan said that advances in the technology of processing information and executing transactions have 'made it easier and 'cheaper' for borrowers and lenders to tap fresh sources of capital and finance'. This new technology can, as one example, reduce the risk for a bank of operating in a foreign country, thereby increasing the capital available to borrowers in that country. Mr Corrigan also said that the ability of a financial institution to collate and process vast amounts of financial data rapidly using computers has allowed the institution to 'arbitrage' - or shift funds to take advantage of price disparities - in property markets as well as in foreign exchange and securities. Financial innovation, especially the creation of derivative products, also facilitated these cross-border flows of capital. Institutions could, for example, use derivative products to reduce the exchange and interest rate risks of investing in the UK compared with Japan. However, the Basle committee has no simple remedy to reduce the risk of the new technology. He urged banks to 'tame' the technology by developing 'risk management and management information systems that will provide the top management of financial institutions with the tools and the information to ensure that applied technology is being used in a safe, sound and prudent manner'. Mr Corrigan was speaking last week at the international conference of banking supervisors in Cannes and has been delivering this message in a series of private meetings over the past month with senior bankers and regulators.</p>

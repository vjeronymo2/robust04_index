			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / India attacks foreign banks MR S. Venkitaramanan, India's central bank governor, yesterday sharply criticised unnamed foreign banks which he accused of fraudulently making profits on their Indian operations. In an interview for Eyewitness, an Indian video news magazine, Mr Venkitaramanan said that among those who would have to bear losses of the Bombay financial scandal were 'the banks from outside who have defrauded us in order to make profits'. He did not spell out which banks he had in mind. Earlier, he said Standard Chartered, the British bank which is one of two foreign institutions so far officially implicated in the scandal, had been 'responsible for part of the system's failure; its own systems failed, its management did not know'. The bank had 'brought in Dollars 800m (Pounds 432m) already' to cover its losses or strengthen its liquidity in India. The bank, which has not been charged with any offences, declined to confirm this figure, far exceeding the Pounds 50m provisions Standard Chartered had earlier announced. It is known to have brought in further funds to strengthen its liquidity in the event of a run on its branches. Mr Parvesh Nat, Standard Chartered's chief executive, was suspended by the bank on Friday. Four expatriate employees also face possible questioning, Central Bureau of Investigation officials said. Mr Venkitaramanan's remarks came on a day when the Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays announced it was making Rs5.06bn available against anticipated losses by its Indian branch. In making provisions, it was following Reserve Bank directives. Grindlays had credited the account of Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker now under arrest, with cheques for over Rs5bn (Pounds 96m) made out to National Housing Bank. The Australian bank, in dispute with NHB, claims it was following normal securities trading practice in crediting Mr Mehta's account. Mr Venkitaramanan said he believed banks in India would recover over two-thirds of the Rs30bn they are officially said to have lost. He declined to accept moral responsibility for the scandal, claiming credit for uncovering it.</p>

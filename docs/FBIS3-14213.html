			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F> unidentified correspondents at B'abda Palace on 23 March -- live  or recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you said....    [Samahah, interrupting] Just a minute. Ask your questions  one at a time.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you said that [words  indistinct] by the Council of Ministers to study the draft law  on organizing the media. Since the media are still capable of  broadcasting, is there a public pledge regarding a specified  period of time for the draft to be finalized?    [Samahah] First and foremost, there is a pledge regarding  the security of the homeland. There is a pledge regarding the  security of the citizens. There is a pledge on freedoms. If  you followed the statement properly, the printed media still has  all its rights safeguarded by the law on printed media. The  government's concern at this point in time is for our homeland  to weather the storm blowing over it now. This storm takes us  back to dark days. The government wishes to put an end to these  dark days in every possible way. The government guarantees the  rights of citizens to acquire information through the printed  media at this stage and affirms that it will finalize the law on  audio and visual media during its session on Tuesday, 29 March,  and refer it to the Chamber of Deputies. This will give all  media organizations that wish to continue broadcasting within  the law the possibility to do so and practice their concern  about freedom and the security of the citizens and the homeland  within the framework of the laws that are being applied.    [Correspondent] Do you expect any security reactions from  the parties that have been harmed by these decisions?    [Samahah] As a government, it is only natural for us to  expect everything. This is why we have instructed all security  forces, the Lebanese Army, the Internal Security Forces, the  State Security Forces, and the Public Security Forces to  continue their efforts in keeping peace and stability in the  homeland and for the citizens.    [Correspondent] Is there any intention to arrest some  officials? [question is not answered]    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] to stop the newscasts of  audio and visual media due to one issue to [word indistinct].  However, there are some media organs that are abiding by the  state's laws....    [Samahah, interrupting] That is very true, but the law  applies to all equally. We are at a very crucial stage now. We  will finalize the law and within the framework of this law,  media organs will resume their operations, provided they agree  to function within the limits of the law. They will then  continue informing the public through the audio and visual media  by abiding to the audio and visual media law. While waiting for  this to happen, the experiences of the past weeks and the  attempts at shaking the stability in our homeland at this  sensitive stage prompts us all to become more aware, open our  eyes wider, join our ranks closer, and review all the methods we  have thought about or practiced previously. We should go back  four years in our memory to see where our homeland was and where  it is now. The project for stability and unity in the homeland  is worth our best shot and not sacrificing it for the sake of  things, which though important, are not as important as the  stability we are enjoying in our homeland.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] the public  media [words indistinct] the private media that are disrupting  the march of the homeland.    [Samahah] The private media that is disrupting the march of  the homeland has no place in this homeland. There is no point  in responding to it, because it has no place in the homeland.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what were your personal  feelings when you announced measures stopping all newscasts and  political programs?    [Samahah] My real feelings were a sense of responsibility  before the danger that is threatening all of us. Have you not  had enough of dodging shells? Have you not had enough jumping  from one catastrophe to the other? Have you not had enough  going from one sad mother to another? Let us handle this  situation at this stage and we will all emerge in the light with  greater joy.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, with respect to the security  measures you have taken in Kasrawan, [words indistinct]. Today  the security situation in the south is going through many [word  indistinct]. Some circles have conjectured that perhaps there  is pressure on the government not to declare the results of the  investigations?    [Samahah] The same conspiracy is moving from one area to the  other. The same Israeli enemy is moving, along with its shells  and mines, from the south to the inside. We all have to  demonstrate solidarity in confronting this scheme wherever it  may be.    [Correspondent] Are there any practical steps to confront  this situation?    [Samahah] I believe there are some steps that we have  announced. There are some issues that will be implemented and  the security units have been instructed to do so. In addition,  the judiciary is proceeding with its measures. We shall not  interfere in its business. The judiciary is performing its  duties within the framework of the Lebanese law that allows a  defendant to have a defense lawyer and to be tried publicly  within the framework of the applicable laws. We have heard  requests for public trials. All trials in Lebanon since  independence have been public and will remain public. Before  the law, all citizens have the right to engage lawyers to defend  them. They have equal rights before the applicable  legislations, which guarantee the personal rights and public  freedoms.    [Correspondent] With the issuance of the law, what do you  have to say to the representatives of the media organs?    [Samahah and correspondents speaking at the same time]  [Words indistinct]    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] This is a decision taken by the Council of  Ministers and I would prefer not to delve into the details of  setting dates. I hope we will overcome what we are going through  quickly. We hope the law on audio and visual media will be  issued speedily, and we will come back and meet with you before  these cameras. We shall not miss you in the meantime because  you work in the audio and visual media as well as in the printed  media.    [Correspondents speaking at the same time] [Words  indistinct].    [Samahah] Would you please listen to each other?    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you expect any popular  reaction to the decision that you have taken?    [Samahah] I think the people are concerned about having  their children go to school in the morning and return home  without fears of explosions and without the various distortions  we have been hearing recently, such as rumors and nerve-racking  stories. Let the people have a peaceful time. People in  Lebanon want to live in peace. A citizen is born in Lebanon to  live in peace, freedom, and quiet, not to have the nightmare of  explosions, fears, and terror follow them from district to  district and region to region.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Samahah] I cannot hear you.    [Correspondent] [Word indistinct] in the south [word  indistinct] for everyone. Radios and televisions provide  greater coverage than the official station.    [Samahah] Who says so?    [Correspondent] I can see and hear.    [Samahah] I am also minister of information and can see and  hear.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] geographically, the  radios are very useful. If there is the possibility regarding  the issue of the south only, [words indistinct].    [Samahah] Let us not delve into this subject. No one party  cares more than another about confronting the enemy and  informing the citizens about the dangers of events in the south.  The official radio, if you have been listening to it, and  Lebanese television are covering all these issues. We call on  you to cooperate with them in covering these events.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] former Prime Minister  'Umar Karami regarding gathering light-caliber weapons. Has the  implementation of such measures been discussed?    [Samahah] I believe that one of the duties of the Army,  which has been deployed in all areas, is, as was noted in the  text of the statement, to control all violations, including  gathering weapons. Upon request from the specialized ministers,  some new laws have been proposed to take into consideration all  these abnormal events in Lebanon and make the citizens live with  the legitimate government under the protection of the Lebanese  security forces, not security islands and individual security  measures. It should be known what sort of licensed weapons each  individual has and how it is moved from one place to another.    [Correspondent] Has the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies  been contacted and his opinion sought regarding these measures?    [Samahah] Are you new here? Don't you know that there is a  separation of powers and that the executive authority was  meeting today? If the legislative authority has a different  opinion, it is the master of its own domain and will express its  opinion on it.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the four of five who are  said to be responsible of the crime?    [Samahah] The Cabinet has not issued arrest warrants. The  arrest warrants were issued by an investigative judge trusted by  everybody. Only two days ago, those who are now saying these  things expressed confidence in him. Therefore, as part of the  separation of powers, the judiciary is independent of executive  authority, which the Cabinet represents, and so we cannot  interfere in such matters and I have no authority to answer such  kinds of questions. There is a judge who is doing his job and  all Lebanese must comply with his orders. Once things reach the  court, and I hope this will be soon, every defendant will have a  lawyer to defend his case before the judicial council.    [Correspondent] You have not spoken about the situation in  the south. Is there anything new in the message that the U.S.  ambassador handed to Prime Minister al-Hariri?    [Correspondent] There is a reiteration of the U.S. position  on the need to calm things down and a reiteration of the  Lebanese position--namely, that calming things down will come,  first and foremost, from ending the occupation of Lebanese  territory and, consequently, regaining the territory and the  having the occupiers depart.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Samahah] The judiciary is pursuing all matters, including  the issue you just mentioned, and no obstacles are stopping the  judiciary. Today's measures prove that there will be no  cover-up in anything whatsoever, that there is a functioning  state, and that there is a state that has a responsibility  toward its citizens and before history for the future of the  homeland, and it will not shirk this responsibility.    [Correspondent] Did you discuss the 19 September [words  indistinct] in today's meeting?    [Samahah] We discussed all issues. If you wanted to score a  point before being stopped from going on the air, you just did  it. Thank you all.</p>

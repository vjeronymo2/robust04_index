			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher/Darty There are two starkly different interpretations of Kingfisher's takeover of Darty. The first suggests it is taking a wild punt in paying Pounds 560m for a French service sector company currently toying with recession. The dangers are heightened by Kingfisher assuming a further Pounds 477m of debt, writing off Pounds 900m of goodwill, and increasing gearing to 66 per cent even after a Pounds 313m rights issue. The alternative view is that Kingfisher is acquiring a well-managed business with market leadership and considerable scope for expansion. Darty's strong income stream will quickly enhance Kingfisher's earnings. The price is attractive at just 16 times Darty's forward earnings. Which version is right depends on one largely unpredictable factor: how well the two managements co-operate. The history of recent Anglo-French mergers is poor. In this case, there are genuine grounds for optimism. First, Darty's management has a firm financial interest in success, having been paid mainly with Kingfisher paper. Second, Kingfisher is a flexible parent more akin to a holding company than a traditional retailer, though this approach also implies less immediate synergy benefit for Comet than the market originally assumed. Third, the deal's architect is Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy who has proved the near-personification of caution. His record should win him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

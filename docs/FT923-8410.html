			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Lonrho asked to clarify Libyan links: London Stock Exchange reacts to reports of joint venture THE London Stock Exchange has asked Lonrho, the international conglomerate, to clarify its relationship with the Libyan government. The request follows an interview in the Sunday Times with Mr Omar Muntasser, the Libyan minister of finance, who was quoted as saying that Lonrho and the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico) had established a joint-venture company to develop their combined interests in Africa. In May Lonrho told the exchange that it had not had any discussion with Libyan concerns to sell its African interests and described reports suggesting otherwise as 'malicious, irresponsible and unfounded'. Exchange officials want Lonrho to clarify its relationship with Lafico, the main investment vehicle of Col Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. In order to avoid a false market being created in Lonrho's shares, exchange officials want to know whether there is any more information concerning Lonrho's operations with Lafico which could be put into the public domain. The exchange is to monitor the situation closely over the next few months. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, declined to comment. Lonrho's shares yesterday fell 4p to close at 76p. Meanwhile, Mr Sam Jonah, managing director of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (AGC), denied reports that Lonrho had any intention of transferring its 45 per cent stake in the company into a joint venture with the Libyans. Mr Jonah said: 'Let me state categorically there is no short-term, medium-term or long-term intention to divest the Lonrho stake in AGC. In fact we would like to acquire further equity if the Ghana government (which owns the other 55 per cent of the company) thinks it in the interests of the economy.' A senior government official in Ghana yesterday confirmed its plan to float up to 20 per cent of the company in London and other international stock markets. Any equity participation by Libya in AGC would probably rule out such an international sale. A senior official in the office of the president of Ghana said that under Ghanaian law any transfer of shares in a mining company would require the prior consent and approval of the government. He said the government had not been informed of any change in Lonrho's holding in AGC.</p>

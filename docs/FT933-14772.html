			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour deputy leader 'nervous' about pension privatisation scheme MRS MARGARET Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said yesterday she would be 'very nervous' about any move to enable people to opt out of the basic state pension scheme. Campaigning in Christchurch, she said private pensions were 'admirable as long as they are something that give people the freedom to top up' the basic state scheme. While Labour favoured improving the current system to take account of contemporary family and work patterns, it was not looking for savings at the expense of 'people already struggling with their pensions'. Her remarks came after Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, welcomed proposals by Labour MP Mr Frank Field - chairman of the Commons' social security committee - for privatising state pensions. Mr Lilley said the basic pension would remain as a 'building block'.</p>

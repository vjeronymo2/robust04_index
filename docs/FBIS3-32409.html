			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Economic Panorama" column by Miriam Leitao] </F>   [Text] According to one of President Itamar Franco's  frequent advisers and interlocutors, Planalto Palace views the  current crisis as follows:    Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is admirable. He  has fought courageously. "He has been a man of dialogue" but he  should have submitted to Congress a permanent reform and not a  provisional measure on reducing cuts on taxes collected by  states.    The economic team is highly criticized. There are  "philosophical conflicts among them" said the presidential  adviser adding ironically: "You cannot put too many peacocks in  one room because they are unable to show off their feathers."    If Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso leaves the  government, there will be chaos with an escalation of the  inflation rate, falls in the stock markets, and recession.    The Federal Revenue Department secretary "is good at  collecting taxes" but because of ethics, he cannot be finance  minister. The presidential adviser said: "He would not have  sufficient elbowroom which would transform his administration  into a permanent arm wrestling match with powerful businessmen."    Professor Mario Henrique Simonsen's warnings to the effect  that the stage in which the URV [Real Value Unit] will serve as  the economy's leading reference index should be skipped are  being studied.    Accusations heaped on Congress over the last few days have  been exaggerated. The finance minister's party [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party, PSDB] is also blamed, especially [Ceara]  Governor Ciro Gomes [PSDB] -- "an impulsive man." Moreover, the  whole government is blamed for paying no heed to "the silent  majority in Congress" made up by deputies who are totally  ignored by ministers, even when the former's requests do not  involve an increase in government spending.    The blame for the passing of the decree on the agricultural  debt is mainly laid on government leaders in Congress and  parliamentary advisers. "No minister or president is  omniscient. They must be kept informed by government leaders  and advisers about projects that are of interest to the  government."</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Man in the News: A novice in deep water - Tomiichi Murayama At the age of 70, Mr Tomiichi Murayama has just discovered he has a lot to learn - and fast. To his own surprise and everyone else's, the former fishing union official was on Wednesday night chosen as Japan's first Socialist prime minister since 1947, and its fourth leader in the past year. Rather than celebrating with his favourite meal, fried marinated horse-mackerel, Mr Murayama will spend the weekend doing homework. Today, he will receive the first of many hours of briefings from government officials on what to say to puzzled world leaders, when he faces them next weekend in Naples for the Group of Seven summit. It will not be easy. This formerly obscure back-bench politician has never held a cabinet job until now, never met the officials who will brief him and has no experience of international affairs. He will be out of his depth in Naples. Mr Murayama, who hates pomp, speaks not a word of any foreign language, according to his secretary. He has travelled to Europe only three times, to the US never, and to China only once, 30 years ago. When Mr Helmut Kohl met Mr Murayama's capable predecessor, Mr Tsutomu Hata, two months ago, the German chancellor joked he could not keep up with the names of the high-speed succession of Japanese prime ministers. He may now feel Japan's political instability is no longer a joking matter. His bushy eyebrows twitching nervously under television spotlights, Mr Murayama confessed last week he was unqualified for the job. Most of Japan agrees with him, evinced by the Social Democratic party's paltry 15.4 per cent showing in last summer's general election. Yet on closer examination, Japan's unlikely new leader may not be the disaster he may seem. He is an eccentric, unrepresentative figurehead, yet the ship of government has a professional crew. His administration is dominated by the experienced Liberal Democratic party, which ran Japan for 38 years, with the SDP in opposition, until last summer. The LDP decided to put its old foe on top because it needed the votes of Mr Murayama's Social Democratic Party to oust the previous coalition and make a comeback after a humiliating year in opposition. The SDP was only too keen to get back to power, after breaking with the former coalition two months ago. Sensibly, Mr Murayama accepted the reality of the deal and wasted no time in stepping smartly to the right, by handing most of the top jobs in his new cabinet to the LDP and adopting conservative policies. Mr Murayama's job, therefore, is to keep the peace between the SDP, half of which are on the far left, and the LDP until the new government is ready to face a general election under a new electoral system due to be ready by the autumn. 'The question is not so much whether he can hold the government together, but for how long the LDP will hold it together for him,' says Mr Dan Harada, a political lobbyist. On past performance, Mr Murayama has a good chance of delivering his part of the strange LDP-SDP pact. Peacemaking between squabbling left and right factions in the SDP and arcane parliamentary tactics are two areas where he has useful experience. Mr Murayama is a relative beginner as a peacemaker, since he has led his party for less than a year, since last September. He was chosen then, as now, as a compromise candidate. But he skilfully guided the SDP into two of the toughest sacrifices in its life: accepting the end of a ban on rice imports and agreeing to political reforms that will destroy the influence of the party's traditional support groups. As a broker of compromise deals, Mr Murayama's main assets are a lack of firm policies and a kind, old, gentlemanly image. Mr Murayama's SDP colleagues call him Ton-chan, or Young Tom, in affectionate reference to his grandfatherly appearance. Privately, some LDP members admitted yesterday they liked their new boss. Despite his sell-out on rice and reform, Mr Murayama is also liked on the left, where his roots are. The fifth son of a fisherman in Kyushu, southern Japan, he graduated in political science and economics from a red-brick university and started work in a union spon-sored by the left wing of the then Japan Socialist Party. At 31, Mr Murayama was elected to the council of his home town, Oita, later rising to the prefectural assembly. His wife, Yoshie, a former wartime nurse, ran the prefectural dining room until her retirement eight years ago. In his younger days, Mr Murayama used to do early morning motorbike shopping runs for Yoshie's restaurant. Mr Murayama's background in local politics, and perhaps his wife's cooking, assured him loyal support from the voters of Oita, which have re-elected him seven times to the lower house of parliament over the past 22 years. During that time, he became expert at parliamentary tactics, such as the famous 'ox-walk', in which the opposition used to drag out votes for days by approaching the ballot box at snail's pace. SDP ox-walkers delayed a bill, two years ago, to allow Japan to send troops to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, the first use of Japanese forces abroad since the end of the second world war. Mr Murayama promised to give up ox-walking when the SDP joined the former coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa last July. But the kind old gentlemen later showed his tactical horns when he pulled the SDP out of the next coalition, in April, in protest at a backroom plot to marginalise it from policy-making. That deprived the government of a majority, starting the chain of events that brought Mr Murayama to the prime ministership. The big risk, of course, is that Mr Murayama's prickly and erratic party might find working with its former enemy, the LDP, just as hard as with the previous coalition, with the same disastrous results. But the first signs are encouraging. In his first days in power, Mr Murayama has done his best to co-operate with the LDP rather than impose his party's will. So far, there has been not a murmur of dissent from his SDP followers</p>

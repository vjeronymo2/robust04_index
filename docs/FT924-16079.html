			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Utilities failing on complaints PUBLIC utilities are unacceptably bad at handling consumers' complaints, according to the latest issue of Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine. A survey of subscribers that had complained to utilities found that British Telecom and British Rail were worst at handling complaints, but no utility came out well. For every utility more people were dissatisfied with the handling of their complaint than were satisfied.</p>

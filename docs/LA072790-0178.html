			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MORE OUTPUT, HIGHER PRICES FROM OPEC;  </P> <P> ENERGY: OIL MINISTERS VOTED TO RAISE THE CARTEL'S PRODUCTION CEILING. THEY ALSO  SET THE TARGET COST OF A BARREL AT $21.  </P> <P> OPEC oil ministers reached swift, unanimous agreement today on raising the  cartel's production ceiling from 22.1 million barrels a day to 22.5 million and  increasing the target price by $3 a barrel to $21.  </P> <P> "We have finished everything," Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh told  reporters after a series of intense private talks among the 13 oil ministers at  their key midyear conference.  </P> <P> "The main issue is that the new reference price is $21 and the ceiling is  22.491 million barrels a day."  </P> <P> The $21 price is an average of what OPEC members want to be paid for their  seven principal crude oils. Prices actually paid by the market depend on  production -- going down if there is cheating on the output quota but rising if  OPEC members honor their individual agreements.  </P> <P> Aghazadeh said the new production and price levels would remain in force until  the end of the year and OPEC would set up two groups to "control" production --  something the cartel has tried but failed to do in the past.  </P> <P> The ministers agreed that if some members are unable to meet their production  allocations, their quotas will be reduced at OPEC's conference in December,  while others will then be given higher quotas.  </P> <P> Delegates and officials said a compromise on the $21 base target price was  reached first by powerful OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iraq and then endorsed  by the 11 other members.  </P> <P> The agreement, which also was confirmed by Saudi and Iraq oil ministers,  emerged in only two days -- an extraordinarily short session by OPEC standards.  </P></p>

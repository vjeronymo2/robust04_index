			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: US Shoe board against spin-off US Shoe yesterday said its board of directors will recommend that shareholders vote against a proposal to spin off two of the company's businesses that would result in three smaller, publicly held companies, Reuter reports from Cincinnati. Citing financial and business risks that outweigh potential for financial reward, the board of directors said the proposed spin-off would derail current initiatives as they are turning round the company's apparel and footwear operations, increase financing and operating expenses, eliminate leverage in real estate, and pose solvency risks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 25 (ANTARA) -- It is now time to allow  100 percent foreign ownership of shares in Indonesia's stock  exchange following a ruling stipulating that foreign investors  are allowed to control 100 percent of the shares in companies  set up under a foreign investment scheme, a senior stock  exchange director has said.    "It is my hope that portfolio shares can also be 100 percent  controlled by foreigners," president director of Jakarta Stock  Exchange Hasan Zein Mahmud told ANTARA during a break in a  gathering organized by WARTA EKONOMI [ECONOMIC NEWS] Business  Club here Friday.    Malaysia, he said, has proved that such a practice can also  benefit domestic investors provided that certain rulings are  issued to regulate it.    "In Malaysia, 100 percent foreign ownership of shares in a  stock exchange is allowed only in the secondary market. In the  primary market this is subjected to certain limitation. This  practice is profitable to domestic investors because they have a  greater chance to buy primary shares at a lower price to be sold  later in the secondary market at a higher price," he explained.    Replying to a question whether or not 100 percent ownership  of shares in a stock exchange will lead to foreign investors  taking over the share issuers, he maintained that this is  unlikely to occur provided that certain limitation rulings are  effected in this respect.    "This is an unnecessary worry because a capital market  ruling  can, for example, stipulate that although foreign investors may  control 100 percent of shares in stock exchange, foreign  participation in managerial matters should remain limited to 49  percent. As such a ruling is common in other countries, why  can't Indonesia follow suit?" he said.    He added that this ruling will not disadvantage foreign  investors as other commercially profitable rights such as  dividend, right issue, and bonus share rights will remain theirs.    In the meantime, in his lecture on the occasion entitled  "The Concept of the Development of Jakarta Stock Exchange  (JSX)" he expressed his optimism that market capitalization of  JSX in 1994 may reach some rp [Rupiah] 100 trillion, up from rp  69.3 trillion registered in 1993.    He said this estimate was based on three factors, namely,  the  large number of new issuers entering JSX, the expansion of many  old issuers at JSX and steady increase of share prices.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Jobs: Much ado about little of real importance - Controversy over vitamins and intelligence resembles disputations about angels on pinheads RIGHT then, as Jobs-column readers are evidently so clever, perhaps you would like to have a try at this puzzle. Like the one I printed eight weeks ago - which many of you said was too easy  -it is a coded division sum, the task being to find the original numerals. But there is a noteworthy difference. Last time, each figure was represented by a particular letter of the alphabet, which always denoted the same figure wherever in the sum it occurred. Today, except for a single occurrence in the 'answer', all the numerals are represented by the symbol X. If any of you can't wait to try the problem, however, please read on afterwards because it has a bearing on serious questions raised by a controversial trade descriptions case being heard by magistrates in Shrewsbury. XX 7 XX XXX XXXXXXXXXXX XXX XXX XXXX XXXX The link with the trade descriptions case lies through something many people clearly think highly important, not least in selecting people for desirable jobs: the gauge of mental ability known as Intelligence Quotient. Although the problem does not appear in any IQ tests as such, it calls for the same sort of reasoning that they assess. In this case, since no words are involved, the reasoning required is of a non-verbal kind. Non-verbal reasoning is also at the hub of the Shrewsbury case, which originates with a study by psychologist David Benton of University College, Swansea. After IQ testing two groups of 12-year-olds, he fed one set pills containing a mixture of mineral-vitamin supplements, and the other set pills which while they looked alike were just placebos, with no real substance. On being re-tested eight months later, both groups scored higher in non-verbal IQ. But the average gain of those given the supplements was about seven points greater than the gain of the placebo group. The findings, revealed in 1988, were featured on TV. Parents flocked to buy the same mix of supplements, enterprisingly marketed as 'Tandem IQ' by Larkhall Laboratories of London. Then, although Dr Benton's results were supported by other studies, there appeared further research denying that such supplements increased IQ. And now, since Larkhall has gone on marketing its product in much the same style, it is being accused in Shrewsbury of infringing the Trade Descriptions Act. But, while sympathising with the magistrates trying to judge between clashing researchers, the Jobs column is not concerned with the case itself. The only question that bothers me is what - apart from achieving it in an IQ test - does an extra seven or so points on the scale enable anyone actually to do? Try as I might, I cannot find anything. For example, although IQ-type testing is evidently one of the better tools for recruiting for jobs requiring mental skill, I'm authoritatively assured that a seven- or eight-point difference would be within the margin of error, and not enough to count. So if any of you who've solved the puzzle can cite instances where a bit more or less of the requisite reasoning power makes a decisive difference in life, I'd be glad to hear. Otherwise, however, all the fuss typified by the Shrewsbury case would seem to have no more real importance than medieval disputations about angels on pinheads. NOW to the table alongside, indicating managerial pay-levels in Britain as measured by the Reward consultancy's latest survey. Anyone wanting more data should contact Steve Flather at Reward House, Diamond Way, Stone, Staffs ST15 0SD; tel 0785 813566, fax 0785 817007. My extracts focus solely on executives ranked immediately below director, except in small firms where they could be on the board, and show both salary and total cash pay including bonuses. The lower quartile section refers to the manager a quarter up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same type of job, the median to the one ranked mid-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter down from the top. To allow for recent rises, all pay figures should be upped by 0.33 per cent, and by a further 0.25 per cent for each month from November 1. Regional variations from the overall median salary of Pounds 30,000 were: Higher - London by 20 per cent, and Scotland by 10.8. No variance - South-east England. Lower - Northern Ireland by 3.2 per cent, west midlands by 3.3, south-west England by 6.1, east-ern counties by 6.7, north-east by 7.6, and north-west by 8.3. Variances from the median by company sales were: Higher - Pounds 100m-plus by 22.1 per cent, and Pounds 40m-Pounds 100m by 2.5. Lower - Pounds 15m-Pounds 40m by 3.2 per cent, Pounds 5m-Pounds 15m by 7.6, and up to Pounds 5m by 16.7 per cent.</p>

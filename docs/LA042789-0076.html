			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA TERESITA DECIDES TO KEEP FULL EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES  </P> <P> The emergency room at Santa Teresita Hospital will remain open to all patients,  its board of directors decided this week.  </P> <P> The hospital had warned it might stop accepting patients brought to the  emergency room in ambulances unless state and county officials approved a plan  to convert 23 hospital beds to more profitable use in an affiliated nursing  home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expect Acceptance  </P> <P> Hospital officials are now convinced that the plan will be accepted by all the  licensing agencies. Approval has been received from one county and one state  agency. That will allow Santa Teresita to begin making necessary changes,  including construction of four restrooms and a dining room in the nursing home  next to the hospital.  </P> <P> Once the additions are completed, final approval must be received from the  county Health Services Department.  </P> <P> The 283-bed hospital proposed the bed conversion plan last year to help  subsidize its financially ailing emergency room, said Executive Vice President  Mike Costello.  </P> <P> In 1987, Santa Teresita lost $400,000 in operating costs for the emergency  facility, which receives 1,000 patients a month from eight cities. Losses  climbed to $600,000 last year. The losses were blamed on an increase in  patients without insurance, insufficient reimbursement from state insurance  programs for the poor and rising costs.  </P> <P> The hospital never planned to totally close its emergency room. Walk-in  patients or those arriving by ambulances without paramedics on board would have  been admitted.  </P> <P> After "a long bureaucratic stalemate," Costello said the Los Angeles Office of  Statewide Health Planning and Development has approved architectural changes  required by the county Health Services Department. The health services  department has also approved the plan, but will not decide whether to issue a  license until after the additions are made.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusually Long Wait  </P> <P> County officials had said that it is unusual to take so long to act on this  kind of application, which was made in August. Robert Carp, program manager of  acute ancillary services for the health services department, said he did not  know the reason for the delay.  </P> <P> The 23 hospital beds have not been used recently because of a lack of  personnel. Costello said the beds can be used in the nursing home because that  facility is not required to be as intensively staffed.  </P> <P> If the license is granted, the nursing home will have 156 beds. The additional  23 beds would raise an estimated $800,000 a year, which could be used to offset  emergency room losses, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Costello said a community task force formed in February to save the emergency  room had helped to speed up the application process by contacting state and  county officials. The group included representatives from the hospital, county  Supervisor Pete Schabarum, state Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale), Assemblyman  Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia), and city officials from Duarte, Monrovia and  Bradbury.  </P></p>

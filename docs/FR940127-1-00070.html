Vaccines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the NCVIA) requires health care providers who administer certain vaccines and manufacturers of those vaccines to report to the Government specified adverse events (42 U.S.C. 300aa-25). All reports are made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is maintained by FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). FDA strongly encourages health care providers to report all suspected adverse events related to vaccines, in addition to those required to be reported by law, to VAERS. Reports submitted to VAERS are evaluated by FDA and CDC to identify vaccine-specific incidence and adverse event trends. For reports made pursuant to the NCVIA, the identity of the patient or the patient's legal representative cannot be made available to the public. However, for such reports, the identity of the health care provider is available to the public (42 U.S.C. 300aa-25(c)). For vaccine adverse event reports not submitted pursuant to the NCVIA, for example, for vaccines other than certain childhood vaccines, the identities of the patient, reporter, and institution involved are not disclosed to the public under FOIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The MEDWATCH Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goal of FDA's new MEDWATCH program is to underscore the important role of health care providers in identifying and reporting serious adverse events that may be related to FDA- regulated products. The program will make it easier for health care providers to report adverse events, clarify the type of reports that should be made, more widely disseminate information on FDA actions that have resulted from adverse event reporting, and increase physician awareness of drug- and device-induced disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the MEDWATCH program, several separate forms previously used to report adverse events and product problems with various products have been consolidated into a single, one page reporting form. Health professionals can use this form for reports on drug products, biological products, devices, and special nutritional products (dietary supplements, medical foods, and infant formula). The unified reporting form will be more readily available to providers in several publications and from a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week toll free number operated by FDA. There is also now a single receipt point for these reports; no longer will providers be expected to send different reports for medications and devices to different places in FDA. Health professionals can send the reports to the agency via facsimile or can report electronically by computer, responding to questions that appear on the monitor's screen. Health professionals can also send reports to manufacturers, who in turn will transmit them to FDA. Device manufacturers, user facilities, and distributors subject to mandatory reporting requirements will continue to submit their reports as specified in the applicable regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The important message of the MEDWATCH program is that health professionals should report any event that is suspected to be related to an FDA-regulated product and is associated with a serious outcome such as death, a life-threatening condition, initial or prolonged hospitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, or an event that requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. The object is to capture as many reports of serious adverse events as possible in order to use that information to enhance the safety of FDA-regulated products. In general, the agency does not care whether the voluntary report goes directly to FDA or to the manufacturer_as long as the event is reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many segments of the health care community have long supported agency efforts to increase voluntary reporting of adverse events by professionals. The practice standards for the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists contain a statement that ``pharmacists in organized health-care settings should develop ongoing programs for monitoring and reporting ADRs'' and should ``[r]eport serious or unexpected ADRs to FDA'' (Ref. 5). The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has standards for monitoring and reporting adverse medication and device events (Ref. 6). These standards require hospitals to report unexpected or significant adverse reactions promptly to FDA and to the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further support FDA's voluntary MEDWATCH program, the American Medical Association's (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs recently released an opinion memorandum in 1993 that it is a physician's ethical responsibility and obligation to communicate any suspect occurrence of an adverse reaction to a drug or device to the medical community, including FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

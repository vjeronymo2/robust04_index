			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Portugal's premier turns his talents to the EC: Anibal Cavaco Silva talks to Patrick Blum as his country takes over the Community's presidency MR Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's professor-turned-prime minister, is undaunted by the tasks facing his country's presidency of the EC. A technocrat and stickler for detail, he will be very much in charge of Portugal's efforts during the six-month rotating presidency - the country's first since it joined the Community in 1986. His cabinet has been restructured with two working groups set up specifically to deal with the presidency. Another group, consisting of himself and a small team of key ministers, will handle political developments, while a special group will deal with technical matters. 'I will follow everything closely throughout the duration of the presidency,' says Mr Cavaco Silva, who has a reputation among colleagues for briefing himself thoroughly on the issues. Critics have accused him of being authoritarian and arrogant, but he brushes aside the suggestion that his plans for the presidency may involve an excessive concentration of responsibilities. His critics confuse authoritarianism with resolution, he says. 'I don't run away from responsibilities, and I am firm in my determination to do what must be done.' After six years as prime minister - the first two in 1985-87 as head of a minority government - and four more to come following his victory in last October's general election, he is more relaxed than previously. 'I wasn't educated to be a politician, but to be a university professor. I had to learn a lot about the way to lead on political issues and among politicians. When I arrived here (in the prime minister's residence), my adversaries said I wouldn't last six months.' He had to adapt and there were mistakes. He faced a general strike over reform of labour laws, and considerable resistance over fiscal reform, both of which have been implemented and have since died down as political issues. 'I underestimated the difficulties. Fiscal reform, for example, was promised to the Portuguese people in 1974 at the time of the revolution, and by all the subsequent 16 governments, but they never did it.' We realised it, but I underestimated the attacks, I never thought they would reach such a pitch. Had I anticipated this maybe I would have changed the way I presented the reform, but the reform itself was basically correct.' His policies remain a social democratic mix of market-oriented economic reform with a safety net sufficiently large to avoid conflict and excessive social hardships. He says redistributing wealth on its own will not achieve lasting prosperity. 'I want to build a more just society. Poverty still exists in Portugal and it is shocking, but as an economist I know the solution isn't to distribute a social security cheque.' He says it is more important to encourage individual responsibilities and rewards, greater efficiency and social cohesion through dialogue. While at York University in Britain studying for a doctoral thesis in 1971-74, he was struck by the 'endless labour conflicts' in the UK and the power cuts that eventually led to the fall of Edward Heath. Naturally cautious, he is anxious to avoid the type of shock therapy that sent unemployment rocketing under Mrs Margaret Thatcher, though he admired her decisiveness. The worst thing, he says, is not to be decisive through fear of making a mistake. 'I received a country in a state of backwardness, of many speeches about all the things that needed to be done but were never done. I introduced a new style in Portuguese politics. I resolved to move to practical action, not just to make speeches but to act, to confront vested interests, to analyse problems and take the correct decision.' He liked President John Kennedy and admired General De Gaulle. But he says he has no model, and he remains suspicious of politicians. 'People used to say I was anti-politician because I didn't like verbalism (and) flowery speeches. I still don't like that. I don't see politics as a game. For me politics has only one meaning: practical action, the possibility of doing things which serve the country.'</p>

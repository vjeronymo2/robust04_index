			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul]), the rapporteur of  the constitutional revision, on 17 February blamed President  Itamar Franco for the possible problems he may encounter in  getting the parties that guaranteed the passage of the Social  Emergency Fund [FSE] in the first round of congressional  balloting to support it in the second round. Jobim termed the  president's launching of a ticket with [Finance] Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso as the presidential candidate and  Deputy Antonio Britto (PMDB-RS) -- former social security  minister -- as his running mate most untimely.    Jobim did not hide his annoyance with the president's  position because all his efforts to lobby for the FSE in  Congress -- and especially the PMDB (which vies with the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] for the same portion of the  electorate) -- are centered on keeping support for the FSE  separate from Cardoso's possible candidacy.    He said: It was not the right moment to talk about that.  From a strategic standpoint, the president ought to have  realized that he should avoid referring to candidacies now.  During the first round of voting on the FSE, Jobim denounced  the actions of Education Minister Murilio Hingel's advisers, who  nearly sank the agreement worked out between Cardoso and the  PMDB, the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the PSDB.    Jobim stated: Parties also have to decide whether they are  interested in the country's situation or how they will fare in  the election.    Jobim will not modify the text passed in the first round of  voting last week. He commented that he intends to have the  original FSE text voted through. He thus will propose rejecting  the amendments introduced to the plan. The deadline for  submitting amendments to the FSE, which would entail some  modifications to the text approved in the first round, expired  on 17 February.    Jobim said: There may be negotiations between parties, but  we are very well disposed.    The majority of the 31 amendments introduced changes in the  articles that deal with appropriations for education, housing,  and health care. Jobim believes there is no need to modify the  original text because Congress will be able to define new  percentages to be appropriated for education when it votes on  the law that will regulate the use of the FSE. He expects that  the second round of voting on the FSE will take place on 23  February.    He said: This is an odd struggle because congressmen may  decide that afterward and they may even appropriate a  considerably higher amount for education.    Jobim believes the FSE may be enacted at the end of the  month  if its text is not amended. He also agrees that the  constitutional revision will have been concluded by 30 May.  According to Jobim, there are enough proposals to establish an  agenda for the constitutional revision; "only the political will  of political parties is needed."</p>

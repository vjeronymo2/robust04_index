			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Observer: Send for the mandarins The reshuffles at the top of the investment banking arms of Barclays and National Westminster Bank may look exciting, but they are just another round in an expensive game of musical chairs. It is far from clear why a couple of ex-Treasury mandarins should be any better than anyone else at investment banking. Strip away the public relations and here are a couple of businesses which have not been doing at all well. Because of the problems over the Blue Arrow affair, NatWest Investment Bank has looked most vulnerable. But Barclays' BZW has not done all that much better. It has been obvious for some time that it was going to have to look outside for a successor to Sir Martin Jacomb, if Barclays insisted on trying to keep up with the big boys. The suddenness of the departure of NatWest's Howard Macdonald is more surprising. He was always regarded as a stopgap but no one expected him to go this quickly. Given his undoubted credentials as an oil man, he should at least have been allowed to retain a seat on the main NatWest board. The argument that there were no vacancies, because NatWest's new chairman Lord Alexander wants to reduce the size of his board, does not sound convincing. Coming after last month's abrupt departure of the chairman of the loss-making NatWest Bancorp, it seems to indicate a more ruthless streak at the top of Britain's most comfortable clearing bank. This is not before time. But there is still plenty of deadwood left near the top of the core clearing bank, my Lord. As for the idea of bringing ex-civil servants into the top management positions, the case to date is far from encouraging. Midland Bank is the prime example of a bank that has tried this route and failed. It says something about the paucity of good management in the clearing banks, and their traditional deference to Treasury civil servants, that the experiment is being tried yet again.</p>

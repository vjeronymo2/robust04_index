			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Citicorp creates post of head of credit cards Citicorp, the US's biggest credit card issuer, has handed responsibility for its US and European cards business to a new executive, marking the latest senior-level reshuffle in the international credit card industry. In recent months both Visa and MasterCard have replaced long-serving chairmen. The moves signal growing competition between banks and other issuers in the credit card industry, as well as a shift in focus away from the mature US market. Citicorp said it had created a new position of head of credit cards for the US and Europe. Previously, responsibility for credit cards had rested with regional managers, who had responsibility for all retail banking products. Citicorp named Ms Roberta Arena as the first head of the cards business, catapulting her into one of the most prominent positions in the industry. She is currently general manager of the US cards business, and was previously in charge of European credit cards. The bank has been engaged in a largely successful strategy to defend its market position in the US against new entrants in recent months. The reshuffle in part indicates an intention to shift emphasis to other markets with better growth prospects. Citicorp has 29m cardholders in the US, compared with 600,000 in Europe. American Express is to concentrate the administration and processing of its European charge card operations in Brighton in the UK over the next 18 months, resulting in a net loss of 900 jobs. It said the move would speed up its operations and cut costs. Visa International said its 1993 worldwide sales volume rose 16.9 per cent to Dollars 542.2bn, the first time sales have topped Dollars 500bn.</p>

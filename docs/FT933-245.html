			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / India to end telephone monopoly INDIA has approved a US company's Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) plan to build a telephone network in a south Indian town, in a move which would end the state's monopoly of telephone services. The decision to allow US West, the telecommunications group, to install a network in the industrial town of Tirupur will set a precedent for opening up India's cash-starved telecommunications network to private investment, including foreign capital. The government hopes to achieve a dramatic improvement in India's telephone services which are among the world's worst, with only five telephone lines for every 1,000 people, compared with a global average of 100. 'In telecommunications we are on the verge of a revolution,' said Mr N Vittal, chairman-designate of the government's Telecommunications Commission, which supervises the industry. Mr Vittal, a market-oriented reformer who has been dubbed 'the telecommunications tsar', was speaking at a business conference in Delhi yesterday. He said private companies, including multinationals, were welcome in the telecommunications sector. The challenge is enormous: the Telecommunications Ministry estimates that India must expand its network from 7m lines to 40m lines by the year 2000. But the ministry can afford to install only a maximum of 2m lines in the current year to March 1994. The ministry is creating openings for private capital despite opposition from public sector trade unions, fearing job losses, and the deep-seated reluctance of many MPs who stand to lose patronage as the public sector shrinks to countenance the privatisation of an essential public service. Both privatisation and foreign investment are sensitive subjects in India, as demonstrated by the decision this week by Cargill, the US trading company, to abandon a proposed salt manufacturing scheme following bitter opposition from salt farmers, MPs and unions. The Telecommunications Ministry first invited proposals from private companies a year ago, when it announced its intention to allow private investment in new industrial townships and in rural districts, which are particularly poorly served by public utilities. US West bid for two networks  -Tirupur and the fast-growing industrial estate of Noida, on the outskirts of Delhi. The government's Foreign Investment Promotion Board this week cleared only the Tirupur project. The board will take longer to decide on Noida because 44 companies have submitted applications. Mr Vittal said the technology existed to make rapid improvements in telecommunications without relying on the slow work of expanding land-based lines. US West's scheme involves establishing a wireless system for business users and for public call offices within the first year of operation in a core area of Tirupur. The company would also start laying fibre-optic lines in the same area. Once the fibre-optic network was ready, the wireless equipment would be moved further out, linking new areas to the core. The system would operate in parallel with the existing public network and the call charges would be the same. US West would take a 50 per cent stake in a joint venture with Indian partners, which, over 10 years, could install up to 1m lines at a total cost of over Dollars 350m, including an initial Dollars 100m investment.

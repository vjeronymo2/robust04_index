			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: The Jordans' experience Kenneth and Dilys Jordan discovered, to their dismay, that even where you follow the complaints procedure to the letter, things may not go smoothly. Their complaint, against retirement investment adviser Knight Williams, is still under consideration after two years. In February this year, the Jordans set up the Knight Williams investors' action group and face the latest in a series of meeting with regulators when they meet SIB, the chief watchdog, on Thursday. Jordan says: 'The process of complaint is daunting in the extreme, and few have the energy or resources to pursue the matter.' He talks calmly about verbal complaints and written complaints to the local adviser's office, then the same details repeated to the company's headquarters, followed by endless rounds with Fimbra and its arbitration system. 'Persistence may convince Fimbra that there is a case for arbitration, in which case they send a leaflet explaining that the complainant has to submit two copies of all relevant documentation,' says Jordan. He adds: 'In some cases, this might involve searching through documentation as thick as a telephone directory and selecting what one feels is apposite, without any assistance.' Dilys Jordan feels that retired investors often do not have the resources and experience to present a businesslike case - hence the reason for the action group.</p>

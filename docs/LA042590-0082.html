			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER'S UNION CENSURES COMPTON SCHOOL  BOARD  </P> <P> The state's largest teachers union has censured the Compton school board and  called on state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig to appoint a commission  to investigate working conditions in the district, where teachers have worked  this year without a contract.  </P> <P> According to the recent California Teachers Assn. resolution, Compton's refusal  to bargain in good faith is causing teacher salaries to fall far below those in  neighboring districts. More than 150 teachers -- about 13% of the teaching  staff -- left last year.  </P> <P> This is the first time in at least 15 years that the CTA has censured a  district, a spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

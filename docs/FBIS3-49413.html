			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Members of local government bodies, mayors, and  deputies of legislative bodies from southern Slovak met in the  sports hall in Komarno this afternoon. [passage omitted] Also  present at the meeting was our Radiozurnal, represented by  Jarmila Tosecka and Peter Rohac. Despite difficult conditions,  they have prepared a comprehensive report. [passage omitted]    [Tosecka] During the debate, the organizers acquainted the  participants in the meeting with the open letter addressed to  the president of the Slovak Republic and the citizens of  Slovakia:    [Begin unidentified voice recording] We are sorry that  solutions that concern a further intensification and application  of the principle of self-administration, civic freedoms, and  human rights in the case of minorities provoke hatred,  intolerance, and political arrogance. The state belongs to each  citizen; no more to some than to others just because they speak  a different language. Let us seek a path to each other, but on  the basis of equality. We will find stability only when a  community will not want to interfere, on the basis of vindicated  privileges, in a restrictive way, in the rights of another  group. We are convinced that democracy is indivisible. It is  either for everyone, or it will cease to be democracy. As  citizens of the Slovak Republic, we hope that you will  understand our sincere endeavor to achieve more democracy for  all citizens of Slovakia because only from them any sovereignty  arises. [end recording]    [Tosecka] All those present approved by acclamation the  final  statement issued by the participants in the Komarno meeting. It  is divided into three parts. [passage omitted] The first part  contains a statement on the territorial administrative  reorganization of Slovakia, and I quote: The participants in the  meeting state that the present system of public administration  in the Slovak Republic does not tally either with European  requirements or the demands of the local population. Since 1990,  the government has been planning a reorganization of the public  administration system. The participants declare first that the  government proposal does not suit the majority of the local  government bodies in Slovakia and is unacceptable to the  Hungarian community because the area in which the Hungarian  community lives will, according to that proposal, be divided  into five territorial administrative units that would promote  organized assimilation.    Second, in setting up administrative areas and organs of  state administration, it is necessary to proceed from the  principle that will ensure that the law prevails, and from a  two-tier system of public administration. In our view, there  exists two possibilities of reaching a solution--that is, to  form one continuous territorial administrative unit, a region,  stretching from the territory south of Bratislava up to Kosice,  broken by a corridor, and then continuing to include Juzny  Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica; furthermore, to  create three territorial administrative units, regions,  stretching from Bratislava to Sahy, from Sahy to Kosice, and  then Juzny Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica. The  Hungarian language island south of Nitra should form an  individual area that would consist of 18 villages with almost  13,000 inhabitants of Hungarian nationality.    Furthermore, the opportunity should be embodied in the law  of  bilingual dealings both in verbal and written form with official  matters at offices, within the framework of territorial  administrative units of the first and second tier, endowed with  particular powers.    Further, from the viewpoint of authorities and powers, the  system of institutions within the framework of territorial  administrative units should be compatible throughout the  territory of Slovakia, with the exception of the territories  inhabited by Hungarians or members of other national minorities.  These territories should have a special legal status.    Second, there is the statement on the jurisdiction of local  government bodies. The participants in the meeting state that,  in the Slovak Republic, the rights of local government bodies  are inadequate. The development of local government bodies meets  with obstacles. Their rights are deliberately restricted.  Central power is getting more powerful, to the detriment of  local government bodies, and the superiority of state  administrative bodies is asserted against them. For this reason,  the Slovak Republic should sign, as soon as possible, an  association agreement with the European Charter of Local  Government Bodies, and it should embody the rights of local  government bodies in the Constitution and the law. Furthermore,  the vast majority of public matters should be tackled at a local  level.    I can quote, furthermore, the right of local governing  bodies  to form associations and their right to join international  associations. In the interest of legal certainty, the  Constitution should define for taxation purposes the system of  local government bodies, their authority, and their powers.  Before the implementation of the new system of the territorial  administrative division of the country, within the sense of  Section Two of Article 64 of the Slovak Constitution, it is  necessary to create, on the basis of a voluntary association of  local government bodies, larger territorial units that would  come under the jurisdiction of future territorial self-governing  bodies, while paying regard to the recommendation of the Council  of Europe No. 1201. In the interest of the decentralization of  power, the rationalization of state administration, and the  strengthening of public accountability by transferring powers  from the state administration organs to local government bodies,  it is necessary to bring administration closer to citizens and  to broaden constitutional powers of local government bodies, in  particular in the field of education, culture, health, public  security, and environmental protection.    Third, there is the statement on the constitutional status  of  Hungarians. The participants in the meeting state that the  Hungarian population in Slovakia, despite a number of repressive  acts and oppression during the totalitarian regime after World  War II and other attempts to bring about ethnical homogenization  of the population, has preserved its capacity to express itself  again as a political entity, organize its community, and  preserve the original population structure on the lands where it  has been living for the past thousand years and, in the majority  of cases, where it forms a majority of the local population.  [passage omitted] ...as a national community, it fights with  resolve to ensure that, apart from individual rights to which  everyone has the right, community rights are also acknowledged  to it and that its status as a community is embodied in the  Constitution.

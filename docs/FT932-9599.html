			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Review to consider structure of NHS THE ability of the National Health Service management structure to satisfy the requirements of public accountability are to be examined in a review announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday. The review, due to be completed by July, will take place at a time when MPs are raising severely critical questions about mismanagement and mishandling of public money in parts of the service. Mrs Bottomley said in February that she was reviewing NHS structure above local level, to ensure that the internal market introduced by the 1991 reforms was able to work to full effect. Since then, however, highly publicised financial problems have added to pressure on the health secretary to widen the scope of the review. Sir Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, has faced critical questioning from the Commons public accounts committee over inadequate management controls in the West Midlands and Wessex regional health authorities. The committee has been told that management problems in the West Midlands led to expenditure of at least Pounds 10m for which little or no value was received, while in Wessex at least Pounds 20m was wasted. Four people face conspiracy to defraud charges arising from Wessex computer contracts.</p>

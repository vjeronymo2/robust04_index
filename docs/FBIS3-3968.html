The southwestern region is one of the regions in our country  having the greatest potential for economic development.  However, in the early 1980's its per capita gross industrial  and agricultural production output value was 320 yuan less than  other parts of the country. Since the establishment of  southwestern economic cooperation in early 1984, the vast  southwestern region has made great achievements in jointly  acquiring and exploiting markets. In 1993, gross industrial and  agricultural production output value of the region was more than  230 percent higher than 10 years ago. At present, southwestern  region has become one of the regions in China whose economic  development is most active.    Over the past 10 years, the five provinces and regions and  seven areas have removed restrictions and customs barriers, and  opened up their markets to one another. They have cooperated in  more than 6,000 economic projects of all kinds. In the  transport and telecommunications field, they made joint  investments of more than 200 million yuan to build 49  interprovincial and interregional highways, which are 918  kilometers in length. They have built 40 gigantic bridges or so  in Sichuan and other places. They have opened up more than 100  new provincial-level passenger-cargo transportation routes.  Thanks to the support unanimously provided by various quarters,  the projects of electrifying the Chendu-Chongqing,  Guiyang-Kunming, and Chongqing-Guiyang railways have been  completed ahead of time. Key postal and telecommunications  projects, microwave communications station projects in important  cities like Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming and others, and the  television satellite communication station project in Tibet have  been brought into operation. Various parties have also made  great progress in their joint exploitation of resources.</p>

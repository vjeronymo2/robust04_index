			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Milan's anti-corruption magistrates face inquiry Mr Alfredo Biondi, the Italian justice minister, has ordered an inquiry into a series of complaints made about the behaviour of Milan's anti-corruption magistrates. The move comes at a time when the higher magistrates' council, the governing body of the judiciary, looks set to shelve a complaint lodged by the Berlusconi government over a newspaper interview given by Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli on October 9. In the interview Mr Borrelli said the investigative net was closing round Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and he also attacked Mr Biondi. The complaints are understood to cover seven separate aspects of the Milan magistrates' activities during the course of the year but mostly since the Berlusconi government took office in May. Two of the complaints concern the conduct of investigations into the activities of Berlusconi's Fininvest business empire. The first incident relating to Fininvest was the very public search of its offices on March 9 and attempts to secure the arrest of top Fininvest managers before the general elections. Mr Berlusconi complained at the time that the action was politically motivated. The second complaint was about the inquiries into the ownership of Telepiu, the cable TV channel 10 per cent owned by Fininvest. Mr Fidele Confalonieri, Fininvest chairman, has complained this is a vindictive effort to smear Fininvest's name rather than a serious inquiry. 'The desire to put all the complaints against Milan together and to carry out this investigation just when the higher magistrates' council is moving to shelve the Borrelli affair does not seem to be a correct use of authority,' said Ms Elena Paciotti, head of the magistrates association. While the government appeared determined to open a new front in their long-running confrontation with Milan magistrates, the right-wing coalition yesterday signalled its readiness to soften its position on another - cuts in pensions contested by the trades unions. The government held a day-long meeting of all key members of the coalition and economic ministers to find an agreement on concessions to be made to the unions. Mr Berlusconi signalled in advance his willingness to make changes in the plans for pension reforms. But he insisted any changes involving extra spending would have to be compensated by alternative cost-cutting measures. The populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance have pressed for amendments to ease hardship cases. The government has been obliged to soften its stance on pensions after the widespread observance of last Friday's four-hour general strike, which saw more than 3m persons demonstrating in the major cities up and down the country.</p>

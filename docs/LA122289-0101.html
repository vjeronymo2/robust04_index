			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH LAKE TAHOE;  </P> <P> MORE DATA NEEDED ON PIER, AGENCY SAYS  </P> <P> State fisheries agencies have thrown a curve at the Tahoe Regional Planning  Agency by saying there is still not enough data to justify an easing of rules  on Lake Tahoe pier construction. The comments from California and Nevada state  biologists followed release of a $240,000 agency-sponsored study which  concludes that piers do not seem to have a detrimental impact on Lake Tahoe's  fish. The biologists said that because the 16-month study took place while the  lake was at a low level, more research is needed to study habitats that were  dry during the drought. A draft ordinance change would allow piers to be  constructed in areas mapped as fish habitat during summer months. Currently, no  piers can be built in such areas, which cover 80% to 90% of the lake's  shoreline. Consultant Dena Schwarte, who represents many shoreline property  owners, said she was disappointed with the biologists' comments.  </P></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Single market fears on weapons NEW EC rules to prevent a weakening of controls over exports of militarily-useful goods are not expected to be ready in time for the start of the single internal market on January 1. Concern is growing that free movement of goods within the EC will enable 'dual-use' items (having both civilian and military applications) to be exported via members such as Greece and Portugal with the least rigorous controls. The Brussels-based Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (Unice) said yesterday it was anxious to see free movement of these goods within Europe and a harmonised system of external border controls, but did not expect an early EC agreement to implement such a system. The UK is due to put compromise proposals to an EC Council high-level working group on Monday. The issue was discussed recently between Unice representatives and Mr John Meadway, head of the export trade division at the UK Department of Trade and Industry. A confidential minute of the meeting raised the prospect of 'licence shopping' by manufacturers trying to exploit weak points in member states' controls to sell to forbidden destinations. It said member states seemed 'reluctant to have a Community export controls policy'. They favoured an 'inter-governmental agreement' with 'informal exchanges of information on sensitive destinations'. The aim would be to agree on a common list of friendly countries eligible for simplified export procedures. 'The idea of a common list of sensitive projects is more problematic,' the report said.</p>

In an exclusive statement to MENA, Subayh said that such  remarks contradict every official position espoused by former  U.S. Presidents and the U.S. commitment to the UN Security  Council that holy Jerusalem is an occupied territory.    He added: The Palestinian people and all the peoples of the  Islamic nation are astonished and denounce the U.S. President's  remarks, which come on the heels of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre. These remarks raise fears about U.S. credibility and  commitment to the peace operation.    Subayh noted that these remarks show total bias toward  Israel, violate international law and UN and Security Council  resolutions, and provoke the feelings of faithful Muslims and  Christians worldwide, who can never accept the Judaization of  this holy city.</p>

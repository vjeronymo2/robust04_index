			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two Palestinian prisoners at a desert detention camp were stabbed to death by  other political detainees, the Israeli army said. It was not clear if the  slayings were politically motivated. An army spokesman said the bodies were  discovered during a count of prisoners at the Ketziot Detention Center. "They  were killed by fellow inmates," an army spokesman said. Palestinian inmates  have killed several other detainees accused of collaborating with Israeli  authorities in the Negev Desert camp, which holds Palestinians in connection  with the uprising against Israeli control of the occupied territories.  </P></p>

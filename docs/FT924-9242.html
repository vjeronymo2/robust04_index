			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Agricultural superpower throws weight into war: Paris and Brussels are at odds over world farm trade talks and how to respond to US demands Who really conducts the European Community's negotiations on world farm trade - its executive commission in Brussels, or France, its one agricultural 'superpower'? It was probably inevitable that, in the first multilateral Gatt negotiations for more than 30 years to tackle the issue of farm trade, this question would arise sometime. And now, in the wake of this week's collapse of US-EC talks in Chicago, it has. Overall, the Community is blaming the defeated Bush administration for failing to deliver its side of any possible farm trade bargain in the Gatt. Mr John Gummer, the UK farm minister who currently presides over the EC Council of Ministers in this sector, left Chicago highly critical of American intransigence. But through the smoke and fire of this transatlantic battle, fierce recriminations have broken out between Paris and Brussels, reflecting a similar struggle inside the European Commission itself. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's agriculture minister, yesterday went on French radio to accuse Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC farm commissioner, of going 'beyond his mandate' in some of the concessions the latter tabled in Chicago. Mr Soisson modified this to say that Mr MacSharry had 'respected his (EC) commitments', but only after he, Mr Soisson, had telephoned him in Chicago to remind him of these commitments. Later in the day, Mr MacSharry resigned as the Bush administration announced its intention to impose tariffs on Dollars 300m of European imports from December 5. His resignation reflected a long-simmering dispute within the European Commission whose president, Mr Jacques Delors, has been criticised for adopting a less-than-enthusiastic attitude towards a deal with the US. Before resigning, Mr MacSharry hit back at suggestions circulating in Paris that he had strayed beyond this summer's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and that he had been on the point of caving in to most US demands. 'The negotiations that are being conducted are in the context of the impact of the CAP reform, and any provisional issues I have agreed are within the impact of the CAP reform', the EC commissioner said. Mr MacSharry recalled his long fight against the US demands for cuts in subsidised EC grain exports, its attacks on the EC's income supports to its farmers, and its refusals to accept limits on American cereal substitute shipments to Europe and to give the EC a 'peace clause' against the kind of transatlantic farm trade war that broke out yesterday. Under the Treaty of Rome, the Commission is the Community's sole negotiator, and France is just one government among 12 in the Council of Ministers which initiates and concludes any EC negotiation, Mr MacSharry stressed. But that is precisely France's problem at the moment. It clearly hates being just one of 12 back-seat drivers in a negotiation that concerns it so much. Disliking the course along which Mr MacSharry appeared to be taking the Community charabanc and unable to grab the steering wheel directly, France is evidently pleased the vehicle has stalled. Mr Soisson expressed himself happy the Chicago talks had foundered, because France 'would have opposed' their upshot. In contrast again to its EC partners, France seems not to want any resumption of Gatt farm talks until, as Mr Soisson put it, 'the Clinton administration settles in'. This may well be realistic, though President-elect Clinton has reminded the world that until January 20 the US has only 'one president', the outgoing George Bush, to deal with, particularly on the urgent Gatt issue. Yet, France's weak Socialist government has its own reasons to play for time - to do nothing to add to its considerable unpopularity before next March's parliamentary elections. It believes that a Gatt deal, on any terms that Americans - Republicans or Democrats - could easily swallow would seal its political doom next spring. Part of the French government's problem is tactical. It has sold CAP reform, with great difficulty, to its farmers as a 'shield' against further American demands in Gatt. But there are genuine difficulties in gauging the CAP reform's impact on future EC exports. Mr MacSharry estimates it will cut EC grain exports to 19-20m tonnes by 1997-98 (compared with more than 30m tonnes in 1991-92). Paris smells a Brussels' sell-out to the US here, because, using different assumptions, it forecasts that CAP reform will of itself result in a smaller reduction in cereal shipments. But the real problem is pure politics. One senior French official privately admits the power of France's farm lobby to be 'out of all arithmetic proportion' to its electoral or economic importance, quickly adding that US farmers exert the same disproportionate clout in Washington. France's 1m working farmers may contribute 16 per cent of the country's exports, but they account for only 6 per cent of the electorate. Yet, as every tourist knows, much of France's population is spread out across the country in small towns and villages, making up the treasured monde rurale whose well-being is dear to the French psyche. This monde rurale, including all those whose livelihood depends indirectly on farmers' incomes, makes up nearly 20 per cent of the electorate. Their political loyalties, too, are very effectively divided. While about 80 per cent of country-dwellers vote for the political right - making a likely right-wing government next year unlikely to soften France's stance in Gatt - there is, particularly among smallholders in the south, also a tradition of supporting the radical and communist parties. For a Socialist party, which now depends on Communist support to keep it in power even until next March, this is very important. In June, the government of Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy came within three votes of falling to a censure motion over CAP reform, because the communists voted against the government. That is not an experience Mr Beregovoy wants to repeat over Gatt, where the communists - more than any other political grouping - can be counted on to vote against anything they sniff might be in the American interest. Precisely for fear of being seen to do Washington's handiwork, France's manufacturing sector and, even more, its service sector - both of which could expect to do well out of an overall Gatt deal - barely raise their voice against the farm lobby. The French patronat piously repeats the virtues of a Gatt accord, but does not put pressure on the government. Over time, this will change. CAP reform will, according to government forecasters, reduce the number of French farmers to 700,000 by 1996, and to half a million by the year 2006. But no one expects the Uruguay Round to last that long.</p>

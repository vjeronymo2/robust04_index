The Serbian police raided the building of the Kosova Democratic  Alliance [LDK] Presidency. There are reports of other raids in  Gjakove, Klin, Peje, Podujeve, Vushtrri, and Ferizaj. Let us  listen to a telephone report by our correspondent Mehmet Haziri:    [Haziri] In a press communique, the Kosova Information  Center reports that large police forces have been surrounding  the building of the LDK Presidency in Prishtina since 1200 [1100  GMT] today. Meanwhile, groups of policemen raided its others  offices and halls. An LDK administration employee, who was in  the building with three other people, said that the Serbian  police gave no explanations at all about this intervention. The  raid lasted over an hour and, as we were informed, the police  confiscated many belongings and various reports of this party,  the biggest party of Albanians in the former Yugoslav territory.    During the last 10 days, police interventions in cultural  manifestations and in the seats of political parties have been  more frequent.    The LDK, as the biggest real and organized force, is the  target of the Serbian attacks. Several days ago, the Kosova  branch of the so-called Party of Serbian Unity, led by  ultranationalist Velko Rasnjatovic Arkan, publicly requested the  imprisonment of president of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim  Rugova. This fact clearly testifies to Serbia's stance against  the international demand to cool the nationalist fanatics, whose  craziness is applied by the police in the field with raids,  maltreatments, and arrests of Albanians.</p>

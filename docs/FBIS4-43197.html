			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [The "Views" column: "Toward Dialogue"] </F>   [Text] What would the prerequisites be for a meeting  between Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Turkish Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller, when it appears to be prepared with the  Greek side showing "goodwill" and the Turkish side continuing  its provocations and intransigence?    Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said that a meeting  "would  be desirable only if it would create a good climate." But could  this good climate be created given the U.S. position, which is  openly in support of Turkey as can be seen from the  "recommendations" made only to Greece?    Could obedience to "suggestions" and "recommendations" lead  to subjection and an outcome that would be against us on  critical national issues?    According to accurate ELEVTHEROTIPIA information, the  "recommendations" toward Greece are: a) to show "goodwill,"  understanding, and moderation in the approach to Turkey by  putting aside the Cyprus issue, b) to show generosity toward  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as a  strong power in the Balkans and c) not to consider the United  States an alternative for solutions on which we can depend,  given that we belong to the European Union [EU].    Interpreting and complying with these "recommendations"  cannot bring results favorable to the national interest.  Unless--as we stressed yesterday--Papandreou is aware of things  that other Greeks--people, parties, and press--do not know about.    But, is it correct and nationally useful not to be aware of  what is being played--if it is being played--under the table?  Where can secret diplomacy, which Papandreou criticized when he  was in the opposition, lead?    The facts of the public aspects of our national issues, as  well as recent Turkish provocation--with U.S. encouragement--do  not allow for any reasonable optimism.    On the contrary, they raise a number of concerned questions  about what may happen if we get involved in "goodwill" moves,  which will essentially mean subjection, after following the  recommendations. Therefore, open answers and open diplomacy are  needed because citizens have a right to know.</p>

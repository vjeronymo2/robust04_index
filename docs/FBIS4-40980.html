			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Specialists from the Russian  Ministry for Nuclear Power Engineering are sure that North Korea  does not have nuclear arms, head of the ministry's department  Georgiy Kaurov told a news conference here today. At the same  time, he stressed that every state that has a nuclear reactor is  potentially able to make an A-bomb.    The North Korean nuclear center was created with the use of  technical documents and the assistance of Soviet nuclear  specialists, Vladislav Kotlov, the ministry's leading expert and  supervisor of the North Korean center's construction, told the  news conference.    In his words, the center is meant for exclusively economic  and scientific purposes, it produces isotopes for medicine and  industry, processes the results of physical experiments,  develops technologies and trains specialists. Today the center  does not have a single Russian specialist.    "Any nuclear installation is capable to produce plutonium",  said Kotlov. But it is necessary to build a number of  facilities, train specialists and have kilos of plutonium to use  the installation for the defence.    The expert said that North Korea is building the facilities  and has nuclear specialists. But it has produced several dozens  or hundreds of grams of plutonium which is not enough to make a  nuclear bomb, he added.    In his turn, Kaurov thinks that one cannot say the nuclear  arms are ready before they are tested. It is up to a sovereign  state whether or not to admit IAEA inspectors to its secret  facilities. Russia also has a number of centers which foreign  specialists are not allowed to visit, he added.</p>

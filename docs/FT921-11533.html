			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A single EC energy market THE NEW energy directive put forward by the EC Commission is supposed to be one of the fundamental building blocks of the European single market. But it will have to uproot deeply entrenched interests if it is to achieve the desirable objective of removing barriers between member states' markets for electricity and gas. In few areas do state monopolies maintain such dominance as energy. Few also suffer from such distorted price structures, the result of decades of subsidy and government manipulation. The directive challenges, head on, many members' long-established energy policies. The measure proposed last week by Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the Portuguese Energy Commissioner, would open the EC's gas and electricity distribution networks. Under the directive, large energy consumers could buy electricity and gas from suppliers anywhere within the EC, starting next year. Three years later, this permission would be extended to smaller consumers. By letting competitive forces into the market in this way, the EC hopes to expose the Community's high-cost energy producers. But merely opening taps or throwing switches would not yield the desired results, which is why the directive also contains provisions that would remove less visible barriers to energy trade. For example, the mono-polies, whether state-owned or otherwise, would be required to unbundle their various components - generation, supply and distribution - and make them conform to accepted accounting standards. This should reveal cross-subsidies that give any unfair advantages. Member states would also have to let incoming suppliers reach domestic consumers and local fuel supplies, if necessary by building plant. One step It is an indication of the size of Mr Cardoso's task that only one country - the UK - remotely approaches the kind of free market he envisages, and then only in electricity. Yesterday's decision by the UK to lift the ban on gas imports is only a step, if an important and belated one, in a long march towards a liberalised UK gas market. It is from the continental countries that the greatest resistance is expected. In France, where the state-owned Electricite de France enjoys a monopoly, the plan would not merely allow in competitors, but would also expose the subsidy enjoyed by its substantial nuclear power industry, because it does not bear the cost of future decommissioning of plant. In Germany, electricity prices have been kept artificially high to help the country's inefficient coal industry. Mr Cardoso's plan would force Germany to review this policy. Special problems Indeed, each member state has a special set of problems, and will seek special treatment as the directive makes its way through the Brussels machine. Much of the resistance will come in the form of warnings about the threat to security of supply. These should not be dismissed, but combined with appropriate regulation an open market - stimulating trade in energy - is potentially more secure than a closed one. Opponents may also point to the evidence of UK power liberalisation - limited though it is - to argue that a free market does not necessarily bring the desired benefits. The British record has been disappointing so far because prices have tended upwards rather than down. But this is partly because the UK market contains vestiges of the monopolies and price distortions which adherence to the principles behind the directive would remove. Apart from pointing the way ahead for the EC energy market, the plan would create an opening for increased gas imports from Russia and reinforce the EC's efforts in resolving that country's financial problems. Just as with farm produce, it is not in the interest of either the EC consumer, not to mention the desired stability of eastern economies, for the EC to resist Russian gas imports. In reverse, a more flexible EC energy market should also facilitate the much needed export of electricity to eastern Europe. Mr Cardoso has launched a bold plan. It is worth fighting for.</p>

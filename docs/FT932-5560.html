			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bridging the divide  -Doing business in Japan is bound up in ritual and customs. Walter Bruderer offers a 10-point guide If your company is planning to do business in Japan for the first time, prepare for a shock. Modern, high-tech and sophisticated it may seem; but in many respects it remains an old-fashioned country, clinging to ancient business practices and bound by traditions that mystify outsiders. After 10 years of living in Japan, I have found 10 keys to getting off to a good start: Establishing a good relationship. The Japanese tend to be rather formal in the rituals of beginning a relationship with a foreigner. It is a slow process - the introduction, exchange of business cards, the gradual beginning of business talks, drawn-out decision-making. The Japanese believe this is a judicious way to launch a long-lasting business relationship. Most Japanese expect to remain with one employer for life. If they choose to do business with you, they expect the friendship to generate loyalty on both sides and endure into the future. Such a valuable business relationship requires careful cultivation - sales calls, courtesy visits, perhaps an occasional lunch or other social event. Describing your organisation. Besides wanting to get to know you, the Japanese believe getting to know your organisation in some detail is time well spent. On your first visit your host will welcome pamphlets, brochures, anything that describes your organisation, where it operates, what it sells and what you hope to accomplish in Japan. These may have been published originally in English or another language, but it would be courteous to have the main points printed on a separate piece of paper in Japanese and inserted in each document. Meetings. For a first meeting, try to get a mutual acquaintance to introduce you by letter or telephone. The Japanese are accustomed to this. Request a time for your appointment and, once made, don't change it. This demonstrates that you respect the other person's time and that you are reliable and well organised. Do not make so many appointments for the day that you have to rush. Tokyo and Osaka are enormous cities, so make allowances for traffic delays that could disrupt a schedule. Bring a small gift for your Japanese counterpart. A good choice is a modest novelty item made in your country. A bad choice is an item from your firm, which is viewed as a paltry giveaway and not as a gift. Knowing how decisions are made. Decisions in Japan are usually made by middle management, not by the president or chief executive officer. When you first call on a firm, you may meet the president, but only to exchange greetings. With that formality out of the way, you will make your proposal at a lower level, probably to the head of a department or division. Waiting for a 'yes' or 'no'. If you are accustomed to a prompt 'yes' or 'no' after making your sales pitch to a prospect, the deliberate decision-making of the Japanese may shock your sensibilities and shake your ego. No matter how attractive your product, how thorough and convincing your presentation, how flexible and accommodating your position, do not expect to come away from your first meeting with a 'yes' or 'no'. The Japanese will assure you that they will consider the matter and see what action can be taken. It is partly a matter of courtesy - not offending you as a foreigner with a hasty 'no'. It is also a matter of the Japanese wanting time to evaluate your proposal, your organisation and you personally. They anticipate a long, loyal relationship and this rules out precipitate action. This is the way of doing things in Japan. And, once the decision is made, it will usually be final and carried out expeditiously because the middle manager has consulted everyone, effectively cutting off further dissent. Being patient, patient, patient. Traditions, customs, rituals are evident everywhere in the Japanese way of conducting business. They have a tendency to slow things down. But they add a certain charm and tend to venerate long-lasting, loyal relationships. The best virtue you can display in the face of traditions is patience. It may be the key to your success in Japan. Using the Japanese language. You would be wise to use Japanese in sales materials and every kind of promotional effort. Using the language helps give you the look of belonging and you increase your chances of reaching and persuading the Japanese by using their language. To make sure no misleading or offensive nuances find their way into your copy, hire a native-born writer to translate your copy into Japanese. If you cannot escape using English instead of Japanese, be warned this will do some measure of damage to your image as a newcomer to Japan. Speaking English. For all practical purposes the Japanese are not fluent in English. But they are not total strangers to the language and many have a limited vocabulary. If you have to use English, speak slowly; use simple words and sentences; be direct and uncomplicated; write down key words and numbers and display them in a meeting. If you can at least learn some common Japanese expressions, the Japanese will admire your effort to fit in. Even a meagre vocabulary will help you catch the meaning and flavour of what is being said. While language at first appears to be a significant barrier, it is not an insoluble problem. When there is a lot at stake it is remarkable how a way can be found if both sides make the effort. Adopting a moderate approach. The Japanese prefer your sales efforts to be in keeping with their customary pace - moderate, low-key, deliberate. In this unhurried atmosphere, the Japanese view the hard-driving, argumentative, slam-bang type of presentation as self-centred, ostentatious and confrontational. It is the wrong way to nurture a relationship. The Japanese have as much competitive fire as anyone. But they believe a moderate manner works best for them, as it therefore will for you as well. Dressing. In Japanese offices, individuals rarely wear clothing that makes them stand out. They favour plain, conservative dress. So should you. You are better off blending in quietly than loudly standing out. The author is a specialist on east and south east Asia and is presently living in Switzerland.</p>

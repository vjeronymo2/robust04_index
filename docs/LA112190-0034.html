			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE FARM SEEKS RATE CHANGES;  </P> <P> CAR INSURANCE: POLICIES WOULD BE BASED ON DRIVING RECORDS. A GILLESPIE  SPOKESMAN HINTS THAT NEW STRUCTURE MAY BE APPROVED.  </P> <P> State Farm, the largest seller of auto insurance in California, told its agents  at a series of closed briefings Tuesday that it intends to shake up rates for  its 3.3 million state policyholders beginning Jan. 1 -- lowering most good  drivers' premiums slightly and raising almost all bad drivers' premiums by a  third or more.  </P> <P> Good drivers are generally those with no more than one minor traffic violation  and no at-fault accidents in the last three years. Bad drivers have two or more  violations or one or more at-fault accidents.  </P> <P> State Farm officials who conducted the briefings said the company will act  after approval -- expected "any day" -- by outgoing Insurance Commissioner  Roxani Gillespie.  </P> <P> The new pricing plan submitted to Gillespie and the subject of a formal rate  hearing, was prompted by Proposition 103. It does away with the territorial  rating, or neighborhood pricing, system, in auto insurance and replaces it with  pricing zones based on the costs and frequency of claims.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Gillespie, Karl Rubinstein, said the insurance commissioner has  not promised State Farm and other companies that she will approve their plans.  He said because no objections were raised in recent rate proceedings, it is  fair for State Farm to surmise that she will give her approval.  </P> <P> Newly elected Commissioner John Garamendi declined comment except to say that  he has not been told of Gillespie's plans.  </P> <P> A State Farm counsel, Judith Mintel, said from company headquarters in  Bloomington, Ill., that State Farm is confident enough of Gillespie's decision  that it has decided to train agents to handle the new rate structure.  </P> <P> With about 18% of California's auto insurance business, State Farm has often  led the way in the industry.  </P> <P> Mintel said State Farm will not disclose rates under the new structure, but  that they will be "revenue neutral," meaning that for every new dollar  collected from one customer, another customer will get a dollar decrease.  </P> <P> Mintel said that Ina Becraft, the State Farm actuary who drafted the new  California pricing plan, estimated that overall rates for good drivers in  Central and South Los Angeles will decrease 7%, while rates for most bad  drivers throughout the state will rise more than 33%.  </P> <P> Mintel said there would be "limited areas," such as the San Gabriel Valley,  where all drivers, including good drivers, would get an increase. She said this  would be based on the cost and frequency of claims to the company from that  area.  </P> <P> An agent who attended a State Farm meeting said they had been shown a chart  indicating that average rates for all drivers would mount 35% in the San  Gabriel Valley, while declining 3.5% in Pomona and rising 3.4% in Ontario and  Montclair.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's briefings, according to agents who attended, State Farm also  announced that it will no longer charge previously uninsured drivers with good  driving records any more for insurance than previously insured drivers in the  same areas with the same records. In the past, State Farm has been placing  uninsured drivers with good records in a less preferred status and often  charging them 60% more.  </P> <P> Under the new system, the previously uninsured drivers will not be able to  secure State Farm coverage immediately, the agents were told. They were  instructed to take no money and to submit the uninsured drivers' applications  for a monthlong company review of the drivers' records.  </P> <P> The agents were told not to discuss the new rate schedule outside the company,  but two agents informed The Times on condition they not be identified.  </P> <P> One of these said he was disappointed in the plan. Names for pricing zones have  changed from "territory" and "ZIP codes" to "rating zones" and "experience  factors" covering about the same areas, he said, but real change has been  small.  </P> <P> "Take a horse, paint it brown, and call it a cow," he said, contending that  basing prices on where a policyholder lives will not really change.  </P> <P> Mintel and State Farm senior Vice President Roger Joslin said the changes will  be real and are an attempt to comply with Proposition 103.  </P></p>

The two countries decided against holding the high-level  talks this weekend in Tokyo as originally planned because the  prospect of an early breakthrough is dim, the sources said.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor met Japanese Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata and International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai on Wednesday, but the two sides failed  to narrow the gap over the U.S. demand that numerial targets be  set to measure progress in opening Japanese markets to foreign  products.    Japanese and U.S. officials are supposed to draw up a  progress report on the framework trade talks before Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet  February 11.</p>

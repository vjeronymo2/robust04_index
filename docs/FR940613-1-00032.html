			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to &sect;51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and &sect;51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is subject to the requirements of section 182(b) of the Act. As of November 13, 1992, the date West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request for the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area, the Charleston, West Virginia area was required to meet the provisions of section 182(a)(2)(A) to correct its Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements in effect prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act. The State of West Virginia submitted those RACT corrections as SIP revisions to EPA on June 4, 1991. A final rule approving these RACT corrections was published on September 17, 1992 (57 FR 42895). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for its ozone nonattainment areas. On January 18, 1994, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% rate of progress plan SIP revision for its ozone nonattainment areas. Upon the effective date of a final approval by EPA of West Virginia's redesignation request, these findings will be automatically rescinded in the Charleston nonattainment area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated previously, EPA has approved the RACT corrections noted above. Therefore, the State of West Virginia has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above. Therefore, the redesignation requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) has been met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the 1977 Act, EPA approved the State of West Virginia SIP control strategy for the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. EPA determined that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable. Since enactment of the 1990 amendments, the State of West Virginia submitted corrections to its RACT regulations as identified above. EPA finds that these additional measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reductions in ambient ozone levels in the Charleston, West Virginia area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between 1988 and 1990, because of permanent and enforceable state and federal provisions, emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were reduced by 8.14 tons/day and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) were reduced by 3.1 tons/day in Charleston. Most of the reductions came from mobile sources and gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketing-related activities. The Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), of gasoline marketed for use in the Charleston, West Virginia area decreased from 10.5 RVP to 9.5 RVP in 1990 and was reduced to 9.0 in 1992. In addition, due to automobile fleet turnover, there was an increase in the percent of automobiles operated in the Charleston area meeting more stringent emission standards as required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP). It must be noted here that since 1992 the federal RVP requirement of 9.0 has been the applicable standard in the Charleston, West Virginia area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

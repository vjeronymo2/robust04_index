			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Rao outlaws five religious militant groups INDIA yesterday acted further to suppress riots which have swept the country since Hindu militants stormed the Ayodhya mosque, though the death toll continued to mount. The government last night outlawed three Hindu groups - the militant Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, or National Service Corps) and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, or World Hindu Council) as well as the nationalist Bajrang Dal. An official in Delhi said the ban followed their participation in Sunday's attack. Two Moslem fundamentalist groups, Swayam Sevak and Jamait-e-Islami, were also prohibited. All five were accused of 'promoting disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religions.' The move follows a pledge by Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, to place a ban on religious militant activist groups. He has not yet indicated how he plans to fulfil a second commitment, to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque. Speaking before the bans were imposed, Mr Rao said reports indicated 'a perceptible change for the better' in communal unrest. Mr Rao pledged that the crisis would not derail the country's wide-ranging economic reform programme. 'The speculations that the reforms are being shelved are absolutely unfounded.' Sunday's assault on the mosque in Ayodhya, northern India, took place during a mass rally organised by the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition party. Mr L K Advani and Mr M M Joshi, the two top BJP leaders, who are under arrest for allegedly inciting religious conflict, were yesterday remanded in custody for a week. By late yesterday 950 people were reported to have been killed, according to the Press Trust of India, up from 760 on Wednesday. Reports from Bombay, the country's commercial capital and scene of the worst violence earlier this week, indicated the authorities had managed to reimpose order in many districts, though sporadic street fights continued. In Calcutta, however, the army was called in for the first time, to take control of six of the city's 35 police districts.</p>

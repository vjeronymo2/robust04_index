			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 1 (XINHUA) -- U.S. consumers have  to pay 14 billion U.S. dollars a year more for costlier  substitutes if China loses most favored nation (MFN) status in  trading with the U.S., a World Bank study said today.    The 334-page report, compiled by World Bank staff in Beijing  and Washington, said the loss of MFN trading status will have  consequences for the U.S. and China ranging "from the dramatic  to the disastrous."    The report said China's exports to the U.S. could be reduced  by between 42 and 96 percent, depending on how readily Chinese  exports can be substituted by others. "American consumers will  be penalized," it said.    In 1992, the U.S. imported almost 27 billion dollars worth  of  goods from China, making the U.S. China's single largest trading  partner, the study said.    China's top exports to the U.S. include yarn, cotton  fabrics,  telecommunications equipment, travel goods, handbags, footwear,  watches, clocks, toys, sporting goods and clothing.    "In actuality, the impact of MFN loss is likely to be closer  to the lower bound, but even that is a substantial dislocation  of trade," the bank's senior economist for China Country  Department, Rajiv Lall, said.    The report said time is right for China to significantly  liberalize its trade with such steps as reducing tariffs,  replacing import quotas and licenses with simpler taxes, and  removing remaining export control.    The U.S. first granted provisional MFN status to China in  1973. Domestic legislation in the U.S. requires the review of  China's MFN status on a yearly basis. The next such review is  expected in June.    The report said that "complete MFN loss would lead to severe  dislocation of China's exports to the U.S.," at least halving,  and possibly wiping out, China's export of clothing to the U.S.</p>

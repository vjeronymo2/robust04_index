"In their current form, the inter-bank and  inter-governmental  agreements will undoubtedly inflict colossal economic damage on  Russia, spur inflation, and sharply bring down the Russian  citizens' living standards," says the faction's statement  circulated on Monday.    The document says, however, that Russia's Choice favors  Russia's economic integration with Belarus and other former  Soviet republics on clear-cut terms. The terms on which the two  states' monetary systems might be united are as follows:    1. The unification of the budget, taxing, crediting,  financial, customs, foreign-trade and monetary legislation;    2. The levelling of the two states' economic indices, above  all the budget deficit, and the rates of credit emission and  inflation;    3. The Belarusian national currency shall be exchanged for  the ruble at a rate fixed on the free currency market;    4. Credits and cash shall come strictly from one emission  center.    Only on these terms will integration be equitable and  mutually advantageous for the states concerned, says Russia's  Choice.</p>

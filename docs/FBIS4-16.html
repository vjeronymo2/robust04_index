			<p>In   an apparent effort to modernize and expand its Arabic-language  news programming, state-run Jordan TV recently inaugurated a weekly  news magazine entitled "60 Minutes," which replaces the station's  30-minute nightly newscast on Fridays. According to an official  announcement, the new program is intended "to develop the ordinary  newscast into a comprehensive, objective, and accurate news magazine  to keep up with media technology, which is progressing  continuously" (Jordan TV, 25 March).  To date, programs aired have  included a "special news report" on Jordanian-Arab relations in the  wake of King Husayn's recent visits to Oman and Qatar; reports on  the impact of the UN inspection of ships bound for al-'Aqaba port;  segments on domestic issues, including features on crime and human  rights; and a general mix of economic, regional, and international  news (Jordan TV, 25 March, l April).     In an apparently unrelated development, Information Minister  Jawad al-'Anani announced the retirement of Jordan Radio and  Television Corporation Director General Radi Alkhas--without further  comment or explanation--and named Ibrahim Shahzadah as acting head.  Shahzadah, previously director of Jordan Television, has been  associated with Jordan radio and television since 1957 (Jordan  Times, 22 March).  (AUTHOR:  MURRAY.

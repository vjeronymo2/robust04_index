			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Smoke of battle masks gains for EU contenders: The stormy membership talks Uproar among the four countries negotiating entry to the European Union over the Commission's plans to deal with their higher farm subsidies is obscuring the benefits of the proposed scheme for both sides - as Brussels officials anticipated and some negotiators for the four applicants are coming to realise. The Commission last week said it wanted to align farm prices in Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway with EU levels immediately they enter the Union. Agriculture subsidies among the four applicants range from 25 per cent higher than EU prices in Austria, to nearly 100 per cent more in Norway. The difference would be paid through direct compensation to farmers, with the bill picked up by the applicant countries, the Commission says. The sensitive farm issue could make or break the accession negotiations, especially for Finland, Austria and Norway. All the applicants insist on special treatment for their Arctic and Alpine farmers for a mixture of social, national security, cultural and environmental reasons as much as for economic considerations. The Nordic countries, in particular, are determined to keep as much of their population as possible in their empty and inhospitable northern territories, through lavish farm and regional subsidies. With the partial exception of Sweden, which has already brought its farm subsidy regime closer to EU levels, the applicants reject EU suggestions that alignment should be immediate and that they alone should pay their farmers the difference without help from the Union budget. The row has already swung Finnish public opinion marginally against EU entry (41 per cent opposed, 36 per cent for and 23 per cent undecided) for the first time since the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty at their first referendum on it in June 1992. This turnaround is particularly alarming because Finland is the only one of the four countries which EU negotiators were practically certain would get entry past its voters. Yet negotiators on both sides in Brussels seem hardly fussed by the controversy, and there are good reasons why. Neither the Commission nor the Council of Ministers of the Twelve could have been expected to go into a negotiation essentially about money by proffering a cheque up-front. Senior EU officials know full well that the Brussels budget will have to pick up a portion of the farm compensation costs - estimated at Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for the four countries as a whole. The only question is how much, and that will be for negotiation, in relation to how much the four rich applicants put into the EU budget. As things stand, taxpayers and consumers in the applicant countries foot the entire bill for their expensive food. Under the Commission proposal, consumers stand to gain from lower prices, and treasuries will gain from an EU subvention, however much it is. The four applicants and the Twelve had nothing to gain from the alternative scheme, used in all previous European enlargements. This was to iron out all price differences through levies raised at the border until alignment was completed. But that route, defended by DG6, the Brussels agriculture directorate, requires the retention of borders for the new entrants, and would compromise the EU's single market. Moreover, if the Uruguay Round is concluded this month, the four applicants will have to cut their level of farm subsidy by about a third over the next six years. The Commission's proposal for direct compensation payments to farmers - exempted from the Gatt cuts under last year's EU-US Blair House accord - would by contrast protect Nordic and Alpine farmers' incomes from the cuts, Brussels officials say. These arguments, in the Brussels view, should be saleable to the applicant countries' electorates. In presentational terms, a persistent worry throughout the accession negotiations has been that applicant governments would be seen as selling out their national interests if they fell in too readily with EU requirements. The way the farm subsidy controversy has now been set up should suit their purposes: not only will they almost certainly win tangible concessions, but they will be seen to have given battle and to have won.</p>

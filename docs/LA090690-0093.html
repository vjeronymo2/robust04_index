			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQI SEES GORBACHEV, MAY WANT A MEDIATOR;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: KREMLIN ANGER APPEARS TO GROW OVER BAGHDAD'S REFUSAL TO OBEY U.N.  ORDER ON KUWAIT.  </P> <P> Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz met with Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev on Wednesday amid suggestions that Baghdad wants Moscow to mediate  the crisis in the Persian Gulf region.  </P> <P> But the Soviet Union appeared increasingly angered by Iraq's refusal to obey  the U.N. Security Council's call for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal  from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Aziz's discussion of the situation with Gorbachev was described as frank by the  official Soviet news agency Tass, which had earlier reported Moscow's acute  frustration that its diplomacy and that of other countries had failed to bring  about an Iraqi withdrawal.  </P> <P> Although Tass provided no details of Aziz's meeting with Gorbachev, the Iraqi  ambassador to Moscow, Ghafil Jassim Hussein, told the newspaper Komsomolskaya  Pravda that Baghdad hopes the Soviet Union can help mediate the conflict.  </P> <P> "We have common viewpoints directed at the peaceful solution of the conflict,"  the ambassador said. "We still hope that the Soviet Union will be able to  perform the role of peacemaker and remain the loyal friend of the Arabs."  </P> <P> Noting the Soviet commitment to resolve the crisis through political rather  than military means, Tass quoted senior Foreign Ministry officials as  emphasizing, before the Aziz-Gorbachev meeting, Moscow's desire "for the  moment, at least, to maintain permanent diplomatic contact with Iraqi leaders."  </P> <P> Until now, these contacts, including a visit to Moscow in mid-August by Iraq's  deputy prime minister, Saddoun Hamadi, have not produced "the desired result --  the immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the restoration of  that country's independence and sovereignty."  </P> <P> Aziz was sent to Moscow by President Saddam Hussein in advance of the meeting  this weekend in Helsinki of Gorbachev and President Bush, who will discuss the  Persian Gulf crisis and other international issues. Aziz will address a press  conference here today.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev is the best pipeline to Bush that Saddam Hussein could have," a  senior European diplomat commented. "He not only is authoritative as a  messenger, but his comments as the leader of the other superpower will have to  be listened to and weighed carefully. . . .  </P> <P> "But I think the Iraqis are misjudging Gorbachev if they expect his sympathy,  let alone his support. This is a crisis that the Soviet Union wants no more  than the West, for it destroys the 'peaceful international environment,' as  they put it, for their domestic reforms."  </P> <P> A commentator in the government newspaper Izvestia, Leonid Koryavin, said  Wednesday that Hussein, misjudging the fundamental changes in international  relations, had probably expected to force a split between the Soviet Union,  long an ally, and the United States.  </P> <P> "Had all this happened several years ago, we certainly would have taken a  different stand," Koryavin said. "Baghdad apparently assumed that we would  declare as aggression not its attack on Kuwait but the landing of U.S. troops  in Saudi Arabia."  </P> <P> The crisis, in fact, has strengthened trust between the two superpowers,  Koryavin continued, noting that neither Moscow nor Washington tried to take  advantage of it and that both were cooperating to find a peaceful solution  </P> <P> Soviet officials said earlier that Gorbachev will press Bush in Helsinki to  undertake new efforts through the United Nations to secure Iraq's withdrawal  from Kuwait and will renew Moscow's longstanding proposal for a Middle East  peace conference that could address all the problems of the region.  </P> <P> Meeting with a congressional delegation led by the Senate minority leader, Bob  Dole of Kansas, Gorbachev said he will report on his discussions with Aziz, but  he reaffirmed the Soviet commitment to ensuring the Iraqi withdrawal from  Kuwait through U.N. sanctions and other political means.  </P></p>

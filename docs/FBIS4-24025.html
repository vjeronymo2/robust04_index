			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 21 June (AFP) -- A French military  "assessment" team has arrived in Goma, in eastern Zaire near the  Rwandan border, to prepare for a humanitarian mission in Rwanda,  sources close to the operation said Tuesday [21 June]. The  sources said that the group of about 15 French soldiers  preparing for the Rwandan mission code-named "Operation  Turquoise" were holding talks with ranking Zairian officials to  decide how the French-led intervention force could transit via  Zaire.    The report came as two Belgian newspapers said Tuesday that  some French troops had already arrived in Rwanda from Zaire,  without waiting for the green light from the UN Security  Council. According to the LE SOIR newspaper, "the French have  apparently already crossed the border and are at Cyangugu where  the Kamembe runway has already been repaired, as the Kigali  airport was judged to be unusable," LE SOIR said. Cyangugu lies  in southwestern Rwanda, across the border from Zaire. The  Flemish-language GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN also reported that French  soldiers were already in Rwanda, quoting reliable sources, but  did not say where they were or give their number.    A French draft resolution introduced in the UN Security  Council on Monday said the French deployment, expected to  involve 1,000 to 2,000 troops, would last until the UN mission  in the central African state could muster reinforcements. It  would end in mid-August at the latest.</p>

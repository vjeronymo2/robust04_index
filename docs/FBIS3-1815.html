			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Executive Yuan has completed an assessment  report about the impact which the nation's agricultural sector  will have when the Republic of China [ROC] seeks to join the  GATT. It was disclosed, however, that the results of the  assessment are so negative that the government so far is afraid  to publicize it. The assessment report was immediately recalled  even after it was read by ministers and council heads attending  a ministerial meeting called by the Executive Yuan not long ago.    A scholar participating in the assessment pointed out that,  in accordance with the assessment report, after the ROC joins  the GATT, it will not be able to attain its zero-growth target  in its agricultural development, and the nation may have  negative agricultural growth -- and even a substantial decline  -- for a long time to come.    The scholar indicated that, since the bottom line set in the  assessment report for opening up ROC's agricultural sector is  one based on a relatively optimistic assumption, and yet the  assessment results are still negative, he thought the set bottom  line is merely a wishful thinking, considering the nation's  eagerness to join the GATT by the end of the year, the U.S.  side's unyielding attitude, and the lack of bargaining chips on  the part of the ROC during the negotiations.    Moreover, in view of the prospects that agricultural  associations have planned to organize farmers to demonstrate in  streets next month to demand the government to come up with  measures to deal with agricultural problems arising after the  ROC becomes a GATT member, (Sun Ming-hsien), chairman of the  Executive Yuan Agricultural Council, indicated that ROC's  countermoves will be adjusted periodically, based on the results  of the negotiations, as well as the terms set for ROC's GATT  membership. He indicated that he has begun dialogues with  farmers for this reason.</p>

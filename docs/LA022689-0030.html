			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRKED BY HIGH AIR FARES? TAKE FREEWAY TO S.F.  </P> <P> The Feb. 13 story, "Firms looking for Alternatives on L.A.-S.F. Run," missed  the most obvious alternative, Interstate 5.  </P> <P> I started flying regularly to Southern California in 1985 when the air fares  dropped to $29 between San Jose and LAX because of a promotion started by  Continental Airlines. But since every major airline matched Continental's fare  and consumers showed Continental no preference, Continental was unable to  maintain the volume needed to sustain such a low fare.  </P> <P> As fares to LAX gradually rose, I started driving to Los Angeles more  frequently. When the speed limit was 55 miles per hour, this drive was tedious,  but since the 65 m.p.h. limit was established, it is tolerable. Catering trucks  at rest stops offer refreshment and snacks to break the monotony. A trip from  my home in Fremont to Wilshire and La Brea usually takes 5 1/2 hours. Counting  airport time and car rentals, flying takes only one hour less!  </P> <P> If our state government in Sacramento is concerned about high intrastate air  fares harming commerce within California, it should consider raising the speed  limit on I-5 to the limit that highway was initially designed for. Business  travelers using I-5 will reduce demand for air travel and fares will drop  correspondingly.  </P> <P> JIM SWINT  </P> <P> Fremont  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WINFIELD DENIES TRADE RUMOR  </P> <P> New York Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield, who missed all of last season because  of back surgery, fielded questions Sunday about reports that he may be traded  to the Angels for pitcher Mike Witt.  </P> <P> The Yankees have had talks with the Angels about Witt, 9-15 with a 4.54 ERA  last season, but they deny Winfield is involved.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything about that," principal owner George Steinbrenner said.  </P> <P> "They can't just trade me," Winfield said. "I have rights, and no one has said  anything to me." As a player with 10 or more years in the majors and five or  more with the same club, Winfield may veto any trade. His home is in Beverly  Hills, so there is speculation that Winfield might accept a trade to  California.  </P> <P> "I won't comment because people will read too much into it," he said. "Any  decisions have to come between George and me. Other than Jackie Robinson, I  don't know a player who has been badgered more than me. I'm not going to let  anything distract me from my comeback trail."  </P></p>

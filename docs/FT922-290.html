			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand praised for daring visit to Sarajevo: Shelling erupts after French president seeks to bring hope to embattled Bosnians FRENCH president Francois Mitterrand flew out of the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo yesterday evening after a daring visit by helicopter to the city's 300,000 starving inhabitants. The dramatic six-hour stopover ended with the 75-year-old head of state in a flak jacket, taking shelter in a building near Sarajevo airport after Serb tanks and heavy machine guns on the runway renewed their assault on the suburb of Dobrinja. As the president's helicopter took off, Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army based at the airport began shelling Dobrinja, under siege for more than 50 days. Mr Mitterrand said a second helicopter carrying aides and French security men was hit during the skirmish, in which Moslem snipers wounded five Serbian fighters. Last night Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, reported that the Bosnian-Serb leaders had handed over control of the airport to United Nations peacekeeping forces. This could pave the way for humanitarian aid but Gen Lewis MacKenzie, UN commander in Sarajevo, said his troops could still not claim full responsibility for the airport because the Serbs were still there. President Mitterrand finally flew out of the airport in his helicopter at 14.40 GMT to Split, where his Falcon 900 jet took him to Paris. One of its wings was taped up after being damaged by a police vehicle at Sarajevo's Butmir airfield. His visit to what was once one of the finest cities in the Balkans started soon after the European Community heads of state summit ended in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, on Saturday. His EC colleagues were apparently kept in the dark about his intentions. But Mr Mitterrand told Portuguese president Mario Soares and German chancellor Helmut Kohl about his plans by telephone before leaving. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'It's a brave act by an elderly president . . . I take my hat off to him.' In Paris, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, deputy secretary-general of the conservative Rally for the Republic, the main opposition party, saluted the panache of Mr Mitterrand's 'beau geste'. French officials said the president had wanted to fly on Saturday directly to Sarajevo, whose airport has been blockaded by Serb forces for nearly three months, but it was too dangerous. The airport has no lights, and the runway was strewn with military equipment and shells left from weeks of heavy fighting. Instead, on Saturday night, Mr Mitterrand flew to the Croatian city of Split, on the Adriatic coast. Officials there advised him against travelling to Sarajevo. Undaunted, the president, apparently deeply affected by an impassioned plea of help and support last week by Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, refused to abandon his mission. 'I hope to contribute to the opening of Sarajevo to the outside world,' Mr Mitterrand said as he left Split for Sarajevo. 'I want to see, witness, observe and hear.' Two Transall transport aircraft of the French air force, each carrying 6.5 tonnes of food and medicine, set off for Sarajevo immediately after Mr Mitterrand's visit. But last night they were unable to proceed beyond Split. Mr Mitterrand's mission began as the white presidential helicopter touched down at Butmir airfield, about 15km south of the city centre. Armed UN peacekeeping troops fanned out across the runway as the president emerged from the aircraft. He was bundled into a UN armoured vehicle and driven at high speed through the centre of Sarajevo to UN headquarters. Undaunted by snipers, Mr Mitterrand made an impromptu walk through the city with Mr Izetbegovic. Both presidents laid a red rose on a makeshift altar at the central street where at least 16 people were killed in a Serb mortar attack last month. Mr Mitterrand held talks in the pock-marked presidency building with Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Stjepan Klujic, a senior Croat member of the Bosnian government. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, and a close ally of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, flew in from Pale, his headquarters east of Sarajevo, to talk to Mr Mitterrand.

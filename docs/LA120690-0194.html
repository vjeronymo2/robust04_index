			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL WOULD LIST SECOND-HAND SMOKE AS CARCINOGEN  </P> <P> Second-hand cigarette smoke should be declared a known cause of lung cancer and  workplace smoking policies should reflect that hazard, according to a panel of  scientists that concurred Wednesday with two Environmental Protection Agency  reports.  </P> <P> The professional advisory board agreed with a draft EPA report which concluded  that cigarette smoke causes 3,800 lung cancer cases a year in nonsmokers. In  fact, the panel said, the EPA had understated the dangers of respiratory  illness among children whose parents smoke.  </P> <P> The scientific board's approval gives credibility and backing to future efforts  by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- the federal agency with  the power to regulate smoking in workplaces -- to ban or restrict smoking in  businesses and offices.  </P> <P> "OSHA regulates hazards in the workplace, and that would include whatever  impact smoking has," OSHA spokesman Doug Fuller said. The agency is currently  gathering data in preparation for issuing regulations on indoor air quality,  Fuller said.  </P> <P> "If anything, the evidence suggests there is more risk than previously  thought," said Morton Lippmann, chairman of the 16-member advisory board asked  by the EPA to review its conclusions.  </P> <P> More specifically, he cited the dangers to children and said that the EPA  should try to determine whether parts of the human body other than the lungs  are affected by passive smoke.  </P> <P> The tobacco industry criticized the EPA draft report. Brennan Dawson, vice  president of the Tobacco Institute, charged that the EPA data is incomplete as  well as unreliable because the studies involved did not show enough association  between cancer in nonsmokers and second-hand smoke.  </P> <P> The American Lung Assn., American Cancer Society and American Heart Assn. all  declared Wednesday's statement a victory and predicted a spate of state laws  restricting smoking in public and private workplaces.  </P> <P> Fran Du Melle, chairman of the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, predicted that  the board's support will spur more states to develop smoking restrictions in  workplaces.  </P> <P> The coalition plans to push for state requirements that day-care centers be  smoke-free in light of the long-lasting affects of second-hand smoke on  children.  </P></p>

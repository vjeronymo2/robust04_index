			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Plea for Craxi jail term A Milan public prosecutor asked a court yesterday to sentence Italy's former prime minister Bettino Craxi to 11 years in jail for fraudulent bankruptcy in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, the Italian bank, court sources said. The prosecutor asked for 10 years' jail for Mr Claudio Martelli, former justice minister and once Mr Craxi's deputy in the Socialist party, and seven years each for Mr Leonardo Di Donna, former vice-president of state energy group Eni, and Mr Licio Gelli, former grandmaster of the banned P2 Masonic lodge. Mr Craxi and Mr Martelli are accused of having accepted several million dollars from Banco Ambrosiano before it collapsed in 1982. Mr Craxi, who has been at his holiday home in Tunisia for months, faces numerous investigations in connection with alleged corruption. Yesterday, a Rome judge ordered him to stand trial for graft over contracts to build the city's metro system. Charges were dropped in the same case against Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti and finance director Francesco Mattioli.</p>

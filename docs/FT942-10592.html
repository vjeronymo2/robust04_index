			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Banking gloom for small businesses - in a Nutshell Britain's smallest businesses are unlikely to have an easier time dealing with their banks in the coming years. Their loan applications will be more carefully scrutinised; the interest margins they pay may well rise; and they will increasingly pay a commercial and visible level of fees for services like arranging loans. Small businesses will remain a core market for most banks already focusing on the sector but customers must expect to pay more realistic rates for the service. These predictions emerge from a report* into the banking industry's appetite for servicing small businesses with sales of up to Pounds 1m, commissioned by National Westminster Bank and compiled by Graham Bannock &amp; Partners, the consultancy. 'The lending decision is going to have to involve a fuller exchange of information between banker and customer,' says Terry Bryan, of NatWest's small business service unit. 'We increasingly will want to lend against the viability of the business plan. Progressively there is recognition that the lending has been underpriced in this sector,' he says. From a macro-economic point of view, the report recognises that banking has become closely linked to the property cycle, with a high proportion of lending to companies and individuals secured on property. 'This accentuates the tendency of bank lending to fuel booms and deepen recessions,' the report says. The main challenge banks face is to reduce bad debts. * The Future of Small Business Banking - Available from NatWest Small Business Services. Tel 071 454 6925</p>

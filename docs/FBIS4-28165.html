			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Responsibility of Aggravating the North </F> Korean Nuclear Situation and the Share of the United States]    [Text] The moves to implement sanctions on North Korea are  an indication of the general trend in which there is no more  room for theoretical discussion. The next step is to see when,  what, and how sanctions will be imposed. While shouldering the  national task for peaceful reunification, we are again heading  toward taking a step which may propel confrontation and hatred  instead of reconciliation, exchange, and cooperation, without  presenting a self-reliant [chuchejok] resolution.    North Korea may be blamed for darkening the nuclear issue  with its tenacious use of its nuclear card. However, the  pushing of North Korea, which is already in a dilemma, into a  tight corner by the United States, can not be overlooked. The  United States once alleged that the radiochemical laboratory was  the key to ascertaining the status of North Korea's nuclear  development and strongly charged North Korea of blocking  inspections. North Korea eventually allowed inspections at the  laboratory, and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspectors reportedly extracted samples. Nothing has been  reported about the result of the examination or analysis.  Judging from recent developments in the situation, it is  speculated that nothing substantial was discovered to prove that  North Korea had secured enough plutonium to develop nuclear  weapons. The United States and the IAEA's repeated demands for  inspections on the two undeclared nuclear facilities strongly  backs up this rumor.    The IAEA is refuting North Korea's assertion that sampling  and examination is still possible because the removed fuel rods  have been numbered. We do not have any scientific grounds to  judge which side is right. Even if we accept the IAEA's  assertion, we still doubt that this justifies the demand for  inspections on undeclared facilities as the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty stipulates inspections on declared  facilities only. Moreover, the United States and North Korea  came to an agreement that inspections on the two undeclared  facilities would be discussed at the third round of U.S.-North  Korea talks.    North Korea seems to be preoccupied with the concern that  the  nuclear card has lost its effectiveness prior to a third-round  of talks without guaranteeing the establishment of diplomatic  relations with the United States. North Korea should realize,  even at this late stage, that it was wrong from the start to  think of using the issue of the development of nuclear weapons,  which is invariably linked to national issues, as its bargaining  card.    Reviewing developments in the North Korean nuclear issue  during the past 15 months, it becomes apparent that the United  States is partly responsible for the tense situation. Thus, it  should not raise its voice for sanctions but do its best to seek  a more effective measure to completely solve the problem. An  unconditional third round of talks would be a desirable step  toward this end, but if this is difficult, then at least  conditions should be made more accessible to being accepted by  North Korea. If, by saying "No concessions can be made,"  President Clinton meant that he does not care about any tragedy  concerning the Korean peninsula, we who live on this land cannot  accept this. A strong leader is more apt to have room for  flexibility and should work toward goals flexibly.</p>

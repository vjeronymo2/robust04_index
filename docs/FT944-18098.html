			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Arts: Cash in on misfortune, American style - Television You need not spend long in an American hotel room, wearily zapping the control button of the television, to discover that, despite a score of channels, there are basically only two programmes on offer. Both pander to the American love of hunting. One involves hapless victims - abandoned women, impotent men, beaten children - who are publicly confronted with their presumed predators while a bossy woman presenter, cheered on by the audience, tries to extract blood. The other shows a professional man-hunt: a mobile police team travels the freeways, preferably in California, with a TV crew in the back of the car, primed to record crime on the hoof. Now we can receive a cathartic boost from the misfortunes of others without the hassle of travel. On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, Vanessa, presented by Vanessa Feltz, combines chutzpah and chest in prodigious quantities, confronts sad cases and gets them to tell all, while on Monday The Nick had cameras dogging the footsteps of the Leeds constabulary. Unfortunately, British reticence and sense of fair play make Vanessa a pale charade of the American template. There, a typical programme would include a woman who has exploded into a 20-stone monolith surrendering to the urges of the braying crowd and publicly casting off the quivering husband by her side, who reacted to her weight gain by playing around. 'I'm beautiful; I'm beautiful' she yells through her tears, while he wonders what has hit him. In contrast, Vanessa is fudge. In her first show the curiosities for public humiliation were a couple of virgins. The species has apparently disappeared from our shores, so examples were flown in from the US. During the show more virgins stood up to be counted, reducing night club owner Peter Stringfellow, who is not a virgin, to stunned silence. Just to sort out who's who, Stringfellow had his own caption: 'Peter can't remember how many women he's bedded'. With the audience contributing platitudes, and Vanessa the cosy folk wisdom of her Jewish grandmother, the programme is totally dependent on the eccentricity of the participants for its beef. Vanessa struck gold with Sarah-Jane, a 37 year old virgin who has a doctor's certificate to prove it. Sarah-Jane also likes to flounce around in sexy undies, which confused the audience. Programmes like Vanessa only offer a little afternoon escapism (it is appropriately sponsored by Death by Chocolate) when they could be bringing light to relevant issues and or help to a TV audience which is likely to be in need. In most of the world virginity before marriage is accepted: a debate on why it arouses such outrage in the west would be worthwhile. At least Vanessa is lively, and decorative, thanks to a make-up policy which ensures that everyone on screen comes up looking like roses (in the US the audience doubles as a lynch mob), and loosely democratic. It is a step on from the traditional chat show featuring oleaginous hosts and stars wanting a plug which is fast becoming a moribund art form. The BBC's attempt to resuscitate it late Saturday with Danny Baker, a Vanessa lookalike, only succeeds in digging its grave deeper. Baker's Jack the Lad personality is a fine background diversion on early morning radio, but finds itself cruelly stretched around midnight. You need more than manic laughter and obsequious guying to make entertainment out of interviews with Malcolm McClaren and Timothy Spall. McClaren's prepared anecdotes meandered into silence while Spall, with attractive subversion, said he was bored with switching on the television and always seeing himself. Still, Baker is trying. Clive Anderson's on-screen persona in Clive Anderson Talks Back is one of scarcely controlled panic, which infects the audience with contrived hysteria. It is like a gaggle of the condemned trying to cheer themselves up on the way to the gallows. Consciously or not, Anderson subverts the format by constantly reminding his guests, this week John Prescott and Griff Rhys Jones, of the conversations they had last time they were on his show. This was jolly useful for Jones, who seemed to think he could earn his fee just by grinning. Only Patrick Moore, as loony as only a moon-gazer can be, added a glimmer of spontaneity to a sad 40 minutes. You know chat shows are dead because those traditional artistic vultures, the satirists, are feeding off the corpse. In Knowing me . . . knowing you Steve Coogan, through his alter ego, Alan Partridge, perfectly captures the tetchiness that often lies just under the smooth veneer of the hosts, along with their vanity and the phoney matiness. His show has taken time to gel, but last week was spot on with a reproof for the bandmaster who attempted a little improvisation; a dire medley duet of Abba songs with the visiting American 'star'; and a well set up climax as Partridge, lounging in the jacuzzi awaiting the raunchiest team of dancers in Europe, was confronted by five male strippers. Sometimes Partridge is too subtle for the format and there is no obvious way for the programme to progress. He could follow the lead of the American precursor, The Larry Sanders Show, where actor Garry Shandling has opened the programme out to portray Sanders, a tub of indecisiveness, tussling with his manager, his feed, and his wife. After an excess of crime programmes, both factual and fictional, The Nick finally looks like the real thing. Producer Paul Berriff may have marked his card by taking his cameras to one of the busiest police stations in the country, Gipton in Leeds, but for once it all rings true - the role of the police as social workers, the terrible impact of crime on the victims, the alienation from society of the submerged tenth. There is no attempt to build up heroes. Indeed, the first programme revealed the unglamorous working conditions of the police and the mundane sordidity of most crimes. There was also no attempt to show the Force as particularly successful - after a hair-raising chase the driver of a stolen car got clean away. The Nick was worth a forest of newsprint about crime and the causes of crime. The main purpose of the police comes across as bandaging the scars of society, and the villains are shown for what they are, destroyers of the lives of ordinary people.</p>

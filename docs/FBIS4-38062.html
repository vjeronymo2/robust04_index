			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel and Tunisia are discussing a possibile  opening of representation offices next month, for the first  time. Our correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that Deputy  Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin left for Paris this morning for a  working visit, in the course of which he will meet with the top  echelons of the French Foreign Ministry. Among other things, he  will try to promote the Israel-Tunisia relations. In some two  weeks, Beilin will travel to Tunisia as head of the Israeli  delegation for the steering committee of the multilateral peace  talks. In his meetings with top Tunisian officials, he will  attempt to conclude the establishment of relations, perhaps a  mutual opening of interest offices.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PICUS DEFENDS RECORD IN 1ST DEBATE WITH RIVALS  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus, appearing for the first time with her  five challengers in Tuesday's election, defended her record on development and  police protection at a debate Wednesday night at El Camino Real High School in  Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Picus, 58, was first elected to the council in 1977 and is running for  reelection representing the 3rd District.  </P> <P> Challenger Jeanne Nemo, 60, a Republican activist who lost to Picus in 1985,  accused the councilwoman of pursuing a liberal political agenda at the expense  of added police protection. Nemo cited Picus' sympathy for the Sanctuary  Movement, which helps smuggle illegal aliens from Central America across the  Mexican border and hides them in churches.  </P> <P> "Joy Picus, who has never supported an increase in police strength, strongly  supported making L.A. a sanctuary city," Nemo said.  </P> <P> Picus responded that she supported bringing the Los Angeles Police Department  to 7,900 members, a strength it is expected to reach in July. She also supports  increasing the police force to 10,000 officers by 1993, she said.  </P> <P> "I am on your side in fighting against these negative forces," she said,  referring to crime.  </P> <P> In the past, Picus has managed to win reelection in the conservative west San  Fernando Valley district despite her reputation as a liberal Democrat.  </P> <P> Challenger Peter Ireland, 42, an aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane  Dana, criticized Picus for supporting the proposed development of an arts park  in the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> "If Mrs. Picus is reelected, I guarantee you there will be large-scale  development going on in the Sepulveda Basin," Ireland said.  </P> <P> Picus countered that the arts park would occupy only 60 of the basin's 3,000  acres and would enhance public enjoyment of the area.  </P> <P> Picus' other challengers are Morton Diamond, 57, a hot dog vendor; Paul M.  McKellips, 30, who quit his job as vice president of an executive search firm  to run for the council, and Ron Rich, 40, truck fleet manager for Metro Ford in  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The debate was attended by about 150 people.  </P></p>

Faysal al-Husayni, official in charge of the occupied  territories, said: We hope that matters will continue to  proceed well but we have not finished the talks yet.    Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry,  said that the clauses of the Davos document are being discussed  one by one and it is too early to talk about results. He  stressed that the atmosphere during the negotiations was good.  He added that all the issues raised were discussed during the  talks, which lasted all last night and today.    The members of the Israeli and Palestinian delegations made  these statements at the end of the meeting in al-Andalus Palace,  Heliopolis, which lasted more than seven hours, and while they  were on their way to the working luncheon given by Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa at the hotel across from the palace.</p>

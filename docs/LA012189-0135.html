			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BARNES MAKES THE RIGHT MOVE AT THE RIGHT TIME;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA VALLEY RUNNER'S DECISION PAYS OFF IN RELAY VICTORY AT SUNKIST MEET  </P> <P> Kenny Barnes of Santa Ana Valley High School saw the slightest of openings, so  he took it and passed a pack of runners on the inside of the track. He had to,  there wasn't time to waste waiting for a bigger, or safer, opening.  </P> <P> And never mind that his move into the lead violated every rule of track  etiquette. There's nothing illegal about it, it's just considered bad form.  </P> <P> But Barnes could be excused for his overeager move. He was running the fourth  leg of the boys' rated 8 x 160-yard relay for in the Sunkist Invitational  Friday in the Sports Arena. The race requires each runner to complete just one  circuit of the track before handing off to a teammate.  </P> <P> It's such a short race, one contested only indoors, that there isn't a moment  to waste. And Barnes knew it, so as soon as he saw his chance, he blew by a  runner from Eisenhower and into the lead.  </P> <P> When he handed off to the next runner, Eddie Jones, the Falcons were on their  way to victory in 2 minutes 20.1 seconds. Leuzinger was second in 2:20.4 and  Eisenhower was third in 2:20.9.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Valley provided one of the highlights for Orange County athletes in  the high school portion of the Sunkist Meet.  </P> <P> "He (the Eisenhower runner) was in my way," Barnes said. "I had to do what I  had to do. I was anxious to take the lead."  </P> <P> The only remaining question after Barnes made his move was whether Leuzinger  would be able to catch the Falcons.  </P> <P> But Brennan Lowe, Santa Ana Valley's anchor runner, held on to win.  </P> <P> "I knew we had it," Barnes said. "I just had a lot of confidence."  </P> <P> Corona del Mar's Eddie Lavelle found smoother sailing in his boys' seeded mile  race, but the race proved to be a bittersweet experience, nevertheless.  </P> <P> He finished second behind Andy Samuelson of Rampart High in Colorado Springs,  Colo. Lavelle ran 4:23.2 to Samuelson's 4:23.1.  </P> <P> Lavelle took the lead after 4 laps of the 160-yard track and moved swiftly  ahead. Only Samuleson and Jimmy Rodriguez of Santa Ana Valley stayed close, and  they trailed by 10 and 20 yards, respectively.  </P> <P> But with a little less than 80 yards to go, Samuelson pulled abreast of Lavelle  and powered ahead to win.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was third in 4:25.8.  </P> <P> "I was looking to run around 4:20," Lavelle said. "I just have to be happy with  how I did and congratulate the guy from Colorado."  </P> <P> Sunkist Notes  </P> <P> Santa Ana Valley's winning boys' 8 x 160-yard relay team was made up of: Ivan  Dang, William Dancy, Daniel Kemp, Kenny Barnes, Eddie Jones, Justin Mills, Hung  Chau and Brennan Lowe. Dancy also was second in the long jump with a leap of 22  feet 8 inches. ... The Capistrano Valley boys' 2-mile relay team of Neil  Stevenson, Brian Tucker, Bill Gould and Sean Douglas won race two in 8:25.3,  beating Eisenhower (second in 8:27.9) and Camarillo (third in 8:30.4. . . .  Corona del Mar's Greg Shryock won the boys' rated mile in 4:29.1. Shryock  waited until there were 3 laps to go before moving into the lead, then held off  Jamie Lugo of Valencia. Lugo ran 4:29.2 for second. . . . Kaci Keefer of  Woodbridge came from behind on the last lap to win race two of the girls' 500  in 1:11.9. . . . Laurinda Mulhaupt of Capistrano Valley, fourth a year ago, won  race two of the girls' 880 in 2:26.9. Allison Franke of Canyon, favored to win  the girls' long and triple jumps, did not compete because of a pulled leg  muscle. In her place, Canyon sophomore Claire Whetlan jumped 15-7 1/4 for  second.  </P></p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (1): At the mercy of the markets - Predictability is important in an economy as volatile as Spain's, and reaction to the thought that the Maastricht treaty changes might not now be implemented was swift. As the Danish referendum clouds the investment climate and interest rates firm up, there seems little prospect of the peseta's entering the ERM narrow band this year THE DANISH referendum of June 2 may well help the Spanish government to bring home to the country the fact that it is not the complete master of its own destiny. The vote rejected the changes to the European Community's 'constitution', the Treaty of Rome, decided last December in Maastricht, and sent Spain's equity and bond markets into a tailspin. Maastricht was important to Spain, not because it contained the seeds of new sources of EC funds, but because it served - before being thrown into doubt by the Danish 'no' vote - to lock Spain more tightly into the Community and to increase its chances of becoming, economically, as stable as its stronger EC partners. For Spain, the framework of economic convergence agreed at Maastricht was a sort of guarantee to the people that buy its shares, its currency and its industries that its economy had become predictable. It is hard to overstate the importance of predictability in an economy still as volatile as Spain's, and the reaction to the Danish vote, and the prospect that the Maastricht treaty changes just might not now be implemented was swift and horrible. While the Spanish authorities, bankers and businessmen know that the country's fortunes are at the mercy of the markets, ordinary Spaniards may still not appreciate it. Spain has big public deficits - an accumulation of spending overruns on central and regional government, as well as institutional - which last year totalled Dollars 25bn. In the first four months of this year alone, those deficits totalled Dollars 6.5bn, a 54 per cent increase on the same period last year. To finance them, the government has three main sources of funds. It raises taxes, borrows from the central bank, and sells bonds and Treasury bills. But tax income has fallen as the economy, responding to government efforts to beat inflation, has cooled. And central bank borrowing is essentially a mirage, as the state has to end each year with a zero balance at the Bank of Spain. efforts to secure stable financing have concentrated on trying to end its dependence on Letras del Tesoro, one-year T-bills, which were popular with local and foreign investors when interest rates were even higher than they are now, but placed a heavy burden on the Treasury every 12 months when the bills matured. For the past two years, building on the promise of stability in the EC's programme of economic and monetary union and the longer-term confidence of formerly speculative investors, Madrid has been increasingly successful in selling longer-dated paper. Its long bond is a 10-year obligation, which has proved especially popular with the state and the markets in which it is traded. For the state, selling longer-dated bond at the lower interest rates that Emu implies, means cheaper financing. For the markets, the promise of interest rates falling keeps the bond price buoyant. In all, the Treasury has managed radically to shift the burden of financing from short to medium and long term in the past few years. At the end of 1989, 73 per cent of outstanding debt of Pta13,722bn (Dollars 136.8bn; Pounds 74.6bn) matured in a year. By February this year, with outstanding debt at Pta16,606bn, one-year instruments accounted for just 55 per cent of the total. When the Danes said 'no' to Maastricht, yields rose nearly a full point, and prices collapsed as the markets charged out of the long bonds, like a matador suddenly separated from his cape, and showed no sign, at least in the two weeks after the Danish vote, of coming back. If market sentiment continues to depress this bond for a long time, the consequences for Spain could be quite serious. It could force the government to begin depending again on short-term debt, which would increase its financing costs just at the time when it is trying to demonstrate to its EC partners that its ambitious deficit-slashing convergence programme for Emu is credible. But even this might not have alarmed Spaniards until the finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, mentioned that he was thinking of raising withholding taxes on personal incomes, in an effort to boost the state's coffers and drain liquidity out of the system. Mr Solchaga is a master of the political game in Spain, and it may have been that he was merely trying to frighten his own free-spending cabinet colleagues (and welfare enthusiasts in the Socialist party machine) into a more realistic understanding of what, ultimately, the deficits could involve if they are not addressed. With a general election now just over a year away at the most, taking money out of the pockets of voters earlier than it would normally could be a direct threat to the government's chances of being re-elected with a majority. Of course, a cheap equity market and cheap public debt might eventually be seen as an investment opportunity by the markets, and there are other ways to trim the deficits. The government, for all its orthodoxy, remains ambivalent about privatisation, and is loath to do much more than sell off, piecemeal, stakes in highly profitable companies with rock-solid markets. It could also simply stop spending as much as it does; but it is hostage to a slew of special interests, particularly in the 17 autonomous regions. Nevertheless, Mr Solchaga had been able to draw a straight line between the Danish vote and Spanish pockets. Anything that threatens the slow fall of Spanish interest rates will have an impact on ordinary people. One of the things that does so is the prospect of EC economic union not happening. Theoretically, one way out of that dilemma may be to opt out of the commitment to try to be a founding member of Emu in 1997 or 1999, to take some of the deflationary pressure off the economy and, without renouncing the drive to lower inflation and interest rates, try to arrive at convergence at a pace the country - its unhappy unions and its nervous businessmen - can deal with without having it imposed on them. But it would take another government to do that. Any turning back by the Socialists would be regarded, inside and outside the present administration, as a failure. The aftermath of the Danish referendum, then, is clouding the investment climate in Spain. As interest rates firm up in secondary markets, there seems little prospect of the peseta entering the narrow band of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism - where it could fluctuate only 2.25 per cent against the other member currencies - this year. That, in turn, raises some doubts about whether it could be done by the end of next year, by which time Madrid is committed to narrow band membership. Many economists believe that, with existing currency parities in the ERM, Spanish interest rates would need to fall from an official 12.4 per cent to around 10.65 per cent in order to be able to remain, without support, within a 2.25 per cent band. The problem Madrid faces is time. None of its difficulties is insurmountable. The government and the Bank of Spain will no doubt do their utmost to prevent rates rising as a result of the current uncertainty, and may well succeed in holding the ring. But market nervousness could delay progress in lowering interest rates. If this situation continues, the prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez, may begin to think about calling an election before his deadline in October next year. Any very tough action to cool inflation further and to force interest rates down may, of necessity, be extremely unpopular and difficult to implement before an election. But this year's political schedule is already very full, and Mr Gonzalez's instincts would be to play out his full third term. A budget has to be presented by October, when the trade unions are also threatening to hold their second general strike of the year, in protest at cuts in unemployment pay. Moving soon after October would mean a winter election, when the country's mood is traditionally grey. Spring 1993 is possible, but by then much will depend on whether the unions have been able to mobilise support against the government's benefit cuts. If Mr Solchaga does, in fact, raise retained taxes, winning that public support might not be so difficult, and Mr Gonzalez will then be facing an extremely tight schedule for entry into the narrow band of the ERM as the second phase of economic and monetary union is triggered on January 1, 1994.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / The De Benedetti who shunned the limelight: Obituary MR Camillo De Benedetti, the Italian financier and cousin of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, died at the weekend after a long illness. Unlike his cousin, Camillo De Benedetti, 60, tended to shun the limelight, although he was one of the leading figures in Italian finance, especially insurance. For many years, he was deputy chairman of Generali, Italy's biggest insurance group, in which he was also one of the biggest individual shareholders. More recently, his attentions switched to Fondiaria, the big Florentine insurer, of which he was chairman until his death. Camillo De Benedetti took joint control of Fondiaria, then majority-owned by the Ferruzzi group, in December 1989, in a complex deal arranged with Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian financier. The transaction divided control of Fondiaria between Ferruzzi, run at the time by Mr Gardini, and Camillo De Benedetti's Gaic holding company. His chairmanship sparked a period of sharp growth for Fondiaria, especially abroad. However, the rise of Fondiaria, and the more recent pressure on its profits, rekindled a sometimes heated relationship between Camillo De Benedetti and Mediobanca, the powerful merchant bank which is one of the biggest shareholders in both Generali and the Florentine company.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Skanska advances 16% SKANSKA, the largest construction and property company in Scandinavia, turned in 1990 profits before extraordinary income up 16 per cent to SKr2.37bn (Dollars 380m), in line with forecasts, writes John Burton in Stockholm. However, the Swedish group predicted that profits in 1991 would drop back to the 1989 result of SKr2bn, reflecting a slowdown in the Nordic construction market. It proposed that the dividend be increased by SKr1 to SKr6.25 per share. There would also be a stock dividend, in which shareholders would receive a bonus issue of one new share for each old share. Sales increased by 25 per cent to SKr37.2bn, with sales outside Sweden accounting for SKr4.2bn. The order backlog at the end of 1990 totalled SKr31bn, up 7 per cent. Although Skanska reported a 98 per cent occupancy rate for its properties in Sweden, it noted difficulties in leasing some US properties, as well as its Oslo City complex which it acquired in February. Only 20 per cent of the Trinity Tower project in London, which will be completed this spring, has been leased or sold.</p>

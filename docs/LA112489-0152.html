			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'MERMAID' IS A DELIGHT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY  </P> <P> "PIGLET SIDLED up to Pooh from behind. 'Pooh,' he whispered. 'Yes, Piglet.'  'Nothing,' said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. 'I just wanted to be sure of you.' "  </P> <P> This is from A. A. Milne's "Winnie The Pooh" and is probably the thing that  made Dorothy Parker, the "Constant Reader" of The New Yorker, write, "Tonstant  Reader frowed up!"  </P> <P> AS LONG as we are in a positive vein, let's send up a post-Thanksgiving hosanna  for the Walt Disney guys and their new production, "The Little Mermaid," the  first traditional fairy tale of its kind from the Disney animators since 1959,  when they released "Sleeping Beauty." What a winner for the coming Christmas  season! And if you have noticed that some Disney commercials appeal to kids,  while others appeal to grown-ups, well, that's how the film goes as well. This  wonderful experience is a treat for everybody in the family.  </P> <P> I loved the crab impresario, Sebastian (voice by Samuel E. Wright), and his  Jamaican and calypso and reggae styles. Then there is Ursula, the sea witch,  looking divine and with the voice of actress Pat Carroll. Kudos to "Little Shop  of Horrors" songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. Their songs are catchier  than anything new on Broadway.  </P> <P> H-E-R-E-'S EDDIE! The "Tonight Show" sidekick, Ed McMahon, is going to wed his  new girlfriend, Joanna Ford, in July. By then, he assumes his tempestuous  divorce from wife, Victoria, will be all over and done with. Ed already told  Joanna to go out and buy them a new house in the $5-million range. Joanna has  found a place in the $8-million category. Not bad for a restaurant maitre d'  from Ma Maison in Hollywood.  </P> <P> SOCIAL SPLITS from the nation's capital: Muffy and Henry Brandon have separated  and split -- amicably. She was Nancy Reagan's first White House press  secretary, leaving that job to go into international public relations. He was  the former Washington correspondent for the London Sunday Times, now retired.  </P> <P> IF YOU think Kathleen Sullivan looks better and acts happier these days on "CBS  This Morning," it's most likely because she IS. Kathleen had some rough times  earlier this year, particularly when her parents were seriously injured in an  automobile accident. I believe Kathleen had trouble finding a sympathetic ear  at CBS for her personal problems. But now her parents are doing well. And  Kathleen is "working out" these days with a fabulous new trainer. And, she has  a new executive producer, Eric Sorenson of L.A.'s KCBS, who has helped smooth  her path.  </P> <P> "THE LISBON TRAVIATA" is another reason to go to the Big Apple. This wonderful  Terrence McNally play will slay you if you love opera; but even if you are like  Jiggs of the comic strips, you'll enjoy it. Beverly Sills celebrated her 33rd  wedding anniversary a week ago by dropping in to see it with hubby Peter  Greenough. The opera diva just adored it; "It knocked me out," says she.  </P></p>

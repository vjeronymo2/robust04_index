Addressing a GATT seminar here, the minister highlighted  that  the accord had extended freer trade provisions to sectors like  agriculture, services, and textiles, where the scope for  negotiation -- especially with newly industrialised countries --  "has always been extremely limited." Under the Final Act of the  Uruguay Round, he pointed out, most of the fastest-developing  economies of the world have committed themselves to lowering  tariffs by 40-45 percent.    "In Europe, meanwhile, customs duties will fall by an  average  35- 40 percent," he reminded his listeners, "and tariffs on  goods coming into the European Union from the United States will  be halved. Japan's tariff system will be slashed by 60 percent,  South Korea's by 40 percent, while tariffs in Singapore will  drop 10 percent, in South America by 25-35 percent, and Hong  Kong will apply zero tariffs on 35 percent of goods."    Baratta said these were "important markers that can offer  certainty to investors...it's just a question of grabbing these  new opportunities."    He said that Italy would have an edge in the export market  because of the competitive level of the lira, a "modest"  inflation rate, and last summer's cost-of-labour accord. But it  had to spend more on research and development and training,  bridge the tax gap between Italian firms and their European  competitors, and foster the overseas expansion of Italy's  dynamic small and medium firms, said.    Baratta was cool on proposals to create a beefed-up, unified  Foreign Trade Institute -- "it would only create confusion" --  and said he had instructed the Institute to do more to promote  Italy's economic image abroad.    On the ongoing reform of the export credit agency Sace, he  said the main issue was "for the government to decide where and  how much it wants to spend, set ceilings, so that then -- but  only then -- Sace can intervene, in the fullness of its powers."    Finally, Baratta responded to recent protests by Italian  farmers by saying that a range of Mediterranean products "have  not been penalised by the GATT accord but by the European Union  itself," referring to the EU's decision not to include the  products in the revised Common Agricultural Policy that was a  reference point for the GATT accord.</p>

The accord signed with the Bulgarian Energy Committee and  the  Bulgarian state-owned power company NEK identifies areas and  modalities of Franco-Bulgarian cooperation over the next three  years. In addition to the Kozlodoui plant, it provides for  continuation of cooperation agreements in the domain of power  system management.    Among other things, the agreement provides for creation of  permanent structures for dialogue and for bilateral financing of  high-priority nuclear safety improvements. This financing will  come in addition to funds put at the Bulgarians' disposal by  international agencies.    Franco-Bulgarian cooperation, launched in 1991 with the help  of European Community funding, has facilitated rehabilitation of  the Kozlodoui 1 and 2 generating units, which started up again  recently and are now "operating within acceptable safety  parameters." NEK has benefited from constant organizational and  management support since early 1993.    The Kozlodoui plant generates 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours  per  year, accounting for all of Bulgaria's nuclear energy production  and 33 percent of the country's electricity. Kozlodoui has six  generating units equipped with Soviet pressurized-water (VVER)  reactors; the first four of them had safety problems, according  to international experts.</p>

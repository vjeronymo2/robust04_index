			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IMPORTED WORKERS EXIT GERMANY  </P> <P> The new united Germany is using every available plane to send home Third World  workers hired by the east's former Communist leaders, officials said today.  </P> <P> More than 2,000 unwanted Mozambican and Vietnamese workers are returning home  every week on charter planes from Berlin's Schoenefeld airport.  </P> <P> "We just haven't got enough planes to cope and are looking for more," said  Manfred Knack, head of charter sales at Interflug, the flag carrier of the  former East Germany.  </P> <P> About 85,000 workers came to East Germany from socialist Third World countries  under bilateral accords. Germany, which unified last week, has ended the  agreements, leaving it up to individual companies how long they want to keep on  foreign workers.  </P> <P> Germany is offering $2,000 and a flight home to foreign workers, many of whom  have suffered racial attacks as scapegoats for East Germany's economic  collapse.  </P></p>

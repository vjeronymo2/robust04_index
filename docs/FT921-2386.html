			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Peru cuts interest ratesto curb sol THE PERUVIAN government and five leading banks have reached agreement on a cut in interest rates as part of a strategy to depress the overvalued local currency. For the past three months the sol has continued to strengthen against the dollar, to the detriment of exporters and local manufacturers, increasingly unable to compete with cheap imports. Interest rates will fall by an average of 3 per cent, discouraging capital from abroad, which has been flooding into Peru at over Dollars 100m a month. The participating banks  - comprising about two-thirds of Peru's banking system  - will now charge 18 per cent annually to customers borrowing in dollars and 7 per cent a month for local currency. The new rates 'are not obligatory', explained Mr Carlos Bolona, economy and finance minister, 'but other banks are invited to co-operate'. The government has taken steps to reduce banking costs by temporarily suspending a 0.4 per cent tax on all cheques written. The central bank appears to be planning to play a bigger role in exchange rate regulation. Its president, Mr Jorge Chavez, announced that daily dollar purchases would be increased to a maximum of Dollars 3.5m a day.</p>

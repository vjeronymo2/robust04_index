Cardenas met with students from the  Science and Humanities College during the afternoon hours.    During the morning meeting with the students, he said it is  not only necessary to remove those Chiapas State high-level  officials such as the governor or [words indistinct] but also to  remove those state municipal presidents who it was proven have  contrived with land owners and local bosses [caciques] to  humiliate the Indian groups.    The PRD presidential candidate addressed the students of the  Eastern Science and Humanities College during the afternoon. On  this occasion, he said the Mexican Government had coincided for  the first time with the PRD and its way of thinking concerning  the arrangement of a cease-fire in Chiapas State, followed by an  amnesty, and afterward by dealing with this issue politically.  He said: This is the first time the government and I have  agreed on something.    In expanding on this issue while addressing the students at  a  PRD organized meeting, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas stated:    [Begin Cardenas recording] If a political solution is not  found and the state continues to believe the solution lies in  military measures, we will be going through a long-term and  prolonged conflict that will surely affect the country's public  life. [end recording]    The PRD candidate was asked later if the presidential  candidates should intervene in meetings planned to learn of the  EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] problems. In this  respect he answered that as far as he is concerned, he is not  going to go to where he has not been invited. He added that  that issue is the responsibility of the coordinator appointed by  the president of the republic to try and solve the problems of  Chiapas.</p>

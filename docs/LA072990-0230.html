			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A CRITICAL LOOK AT CABLE'S FILM CHANNELS  </P> <P> Movies may not be better than ever but, through the last decade, TV movie  watching definitely is. Cable and the proliferation of new channels have  shattered the old norms, turned the average TV set into a potential home  cinematheque.  </P> <P> For a plucky movie buff, with a cable guide and a VCR, there's almost no end to  the cinematic riches available. Following: a critical guide to the best cable  channels for the movie specialist.  </P> <P> NO. 1  </P> <P> The Rainbow Service: Bravo and American Movie Classics. Bravo and AMC are not  uniformly accessible on all cable systems. But they should be. This is the  premier service for movie buffs.  </P> <P> Together, they show a broad variety of classics, uncut, uninterrupted by  commercials. AMC specializes in what's usually called "the Golden Age" -- the  Hollywood Studio period from the early sound era through the late '40s-with a  liberal sampling of post-'40s movies as well.  </P> <P> AMC movies are usually introduced by a charming host, Bob Dorian, whose  intimate, avuncular manner and witty backstage anecdotes provide a perfect,  relaxed background for the movies, both the good and mediocre.  </P> <P> Bravo serves an even more vital function. It's often the only major outlet for  foreign language film classics-or was until recently, when the station made an  unfortunate experiment: temporarily downplaying foreign movies in favor of the  kind of American or British medium-budget film often described as "quirky" or  "offbeat."  </P> <P> Perhaps Bravo was bowing to current trends; perhaps it felt it was recycling  too many films. In any case, it is back to a solid foreign and American  independent lineup with movies by Mizoguchi, Bunel, Herzog, Pagnol, Kurosawa,  Eisenstein and Jim Jarmusch-and that, one hopes, is where they will stay.  </P> <P> Of the remaining options, here are the best.  </P> <P> PREMIUM CHANNELS  </P> <P> Cinemax. This choice may seem surprising, but Cinemax is far superior to its  sister channel, HBO, and the other HBO clones such as Showtime. As much as AMC,  Cinemax is a station for movie lovers. Its policy: Try to annex everyone else's  territory-except, unfortunately, foreign films, which it tends to ignore.  </P> <P> Cinemax shows Hollywood classics, usually from the post-'50s era, a variety of  genres, recent Hollywood hits and, in the late evening, even a little soft-core  porno to steal some of the blue thunder from the Playboy Channel. (Parents with  tireless children should be aware of this.)  </P> <P> In addition, Cinemax regularly screens film noirs, and it has a monthly  "director's chair" series that will appeal to incipient auteurists: William  Wyler, Don Siegel and Frank Tashlin have been recent retrospective subjects.  </P> <P> The Disney Channel. Obviously, the premium channel for families who want a wide  variety of good children's programming. But a cavil: I have never understood  why a network that owes its entire existence and heritage to animation would  program cartoons so sparingly-and not only Disney's own. For the Fleischer,  Warners, MGM or Paramount backlog one has to go to other cable channels; recent  or classic foreign animation is generally unavailable everywhere.  </P> <P> Of the other premium channels, there's little to say. The Movie Channel has  much more variety and adventurous spirit, but Showtime and HBO spend too much  energy and strategy trying to beat each other to the latest over-hyped smash  hit. The Playboy Channel seems fairly hapless right now: a flavorless stew of  breasts, thighs and soft-core gravy.  </P> <P> BASIC CHANNELS  </P> <P> TNT. Nothing is black and white-and wonders never cease. Ted Turner, film buff  bete noir for his colorizing antics and cavalier attitude, partially has  vindicated himself by establishing TNT: a haven for all the great old black and  white movies we thought colorization would destroy. TNT books classics or  curios from every era of American film-concentrating on the MGM-Warners films  from Turner's hard-bought catalogue-and juxtaposes them imaginatively.  </P> <P> There is even, on Sunday, an excellent foreign classic series, hosted by Roddy  MacDowall, which shows crisp new prints in the proper format: letterbox for  wide-screen. TNT, even more than AMC, also ferrets out that rich, neglected  part of our heritage, silent movies-though usually only on rare occasions or  wee-morning hours. So what's the story on Ted Turner? Is this guy Jekyll and  Hyde or what? If he's paying obeisance for his sins, TNT is a splendid act of  contrition.  </P> <P> Arts &amp; Entertainment. Along with Bravo, Arts &amp; Entertainment is the  bulwark for foreign film devotees. And, in recent months, while Bravo was  trying to awaken us to the delights of "Crazy Moon" or "Julia and Julia,"  A&amp;E, still booking films like "Death in Venice," "Danton" and "La Nuit De  Varennes," seemed to be carrying the torch almost alone. Happily, it's now part  of a general group-including Bravo and the non-cable channel KCET. In addition  to its small monthly foreign language complement, A&amp;E also offers a diverse  range of generally sophisticated films: from British comedies to Hollywood cult  movies.  </P> <P> Another Turner station, TBS, is only a step behind these two: it's particularly  strong on Westerns and comedies. The other basic channels-including Lifetime,  Family, WOR, WGN and USA-have their moments.  </P></p>

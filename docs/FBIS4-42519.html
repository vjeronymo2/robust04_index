			<p>BFN     [Text] In an office at the Innsbruck University Hospital,  Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock answered questions from  correspondents on the European Union [EU]. After an  intervertebral disc operation, Mock is still undergoing hospital  treatment.    The EU referendum in one week will be the decision on a  historic chance, Mock said.    [Begin Mock recording] There are certain windows of  opportunity in history, and if they are not opened at the right  time, one misses historic chances for one's country. There was  such a window in 1955. Everyone knew that after October 1956 --  after the Hungarians' crushed struggle for freedom against the  communist regime -- it would no longer be possible to get the  Soviet Union to agree [to the State Treaty]. There is such a  window again today. [end recording]    Foreign Minister Alois Mock also made a personal appeal:    [Begin Mock recording] I will ask the Austrians to say yes.  The country is at stake. If the government is to be taught a  lesson, which is, quote, part of democracy, unquote, there will  be the elections in October. Everyone will then be able to  express his opinion on the party that provided a minister with  whom he is not satisfied. The important point to be stressed is  that this country and the continuity of its success is now at  stake. [end recording]    All in all, however, Mock concluded that the majority of the  population will say yes to the European Union.</p>

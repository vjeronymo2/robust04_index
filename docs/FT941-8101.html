			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch to trade in gilts Merrill Lynch, the US Securities house which pulled out of dealing in UK government bonds (gilts) in 1989 after incurring heavy losses, said yesterday that it had won approval from the Bank of England to start dealing in gilts again with effect from February 28. Merrill was one of several foreign houses to pull out of the gilt market in the late-1980s, a time when the various gilt-edged market makers - known as Gemms - faced tough competition in an overcrowded market. Merrill had incurred accumulated losses of more than Pounds 20m (Dollars 29.2m) by 1989, following the Big Bang reorganisation of the gilt market in 1986. However, conditions in the gilt market have improved dramatically for the Gemms in recent years: the UK government started to borrow again in the gilt market, issuing large, liquid gilt issues, and inflation was brought under control again, allowing interest rates to decline. Combined operating profits for the Gemms have risen and reached bumper levels in 1992 and 1993, according to figures compiled by the Bank of England. While the Gemms made a total operating loss of Pounds 190m between October 1986 and the end of 1988, combined profits soared to Pounds 64m in 1992 and were Pounds 59m last year. The more favourable trading environment has encouraged speculation that other houses may be considering applying for Gemm status. Hoare Govett recently hired Mr Chris Anthony, a gilt analyst at UBS, leading to speculation that it would seek permission to set up as a Gemm. Other houses frequently rumoured to be considering applying for Gemm status include Chemical Bank, Societe Generale, and Morgan Stanley. After Big Bang, 12 market-makers pulled out of gilts either because the business was no longer profitable or because they were taken over by another house.</p>

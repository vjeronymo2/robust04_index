			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tomkins reassures shareholders over currency hedging arrangements Tomkins, the diversified industrial group, has written to its institutional shareholders and to stockbrokers' analysts describing its policy on currency swaps. It uses the swaps to hedge the currency risk on its overseas assets. The group, which has about half its assets outside the UK, mostly in North America, has met some criticism for using swaps which create off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Some investors fear that Tomkins could be exposed to large 'invisible' liabilities. They recall that Allied-Lyons, the drinks and food group, lost Pounds 150m in March 1991 by speculating on the dollar. Tomkins believes the criticism stems from a misunderstanding of its currency swaps and the tight management controls it has instituted, which were lacking in the Allied-Lyons case. It hopes to clear up this misunderstanding through its letter. Swaps are set up between two parties wishing to exchange exposures. In a currency swap one side might have a dollar debt but prefer a sterling liability. It would swap the exposure with a counterparty with the opposite aim. When the swap expires the money is swapped back at the new exchange rate. Because Tomkins uses such swaps to hedge its assets, if the exchange rate moves so that it loses on the swap, it will automatically make an equivalent gain on the assets. Tomkins' annual reports show the fluctuations in its net assets due to foreign exchange movements have been minimal. Other companies have suffered relatively larger falls. In addition, Tomkins usually receives income from its dollar/sterling swaps, which amounted to Pounds 10.6m in the year to end-April 1993, which it discloses each year. Most companies with subsidiaries overseas match the assets with a similar amount of debt. However, Tomkins has always preferred to be ungeared. If it borrowed in dollars to match its dollar assets it would then have surplus cash to invest in the UK. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has taken this route and made money on the interest differential between dollars and sterling. In its letter Tomkins said it used to follow this policy but found it 'ballooned' both sides of the balance sheet, which Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, said made the balance sheet unrepresentative of the underlying business. Further there is a concern that the US tax authorities are increasingly unwilling to allow US subsidiaries to offset interest on an abnormal amount of debt against US profits since this reduces the tax take. Tomkins said it takes a number of steps to minimise risk. It has a number of swaps running at any one time, it only deals with counter-parties with strong credit ratings, the swaps are 'marked to market' every 90 days, and Tomkins re-evaluates its exposure to each currency to within Pounds 500,000 each month so that it is never significantly over or under-hedged. Mr Duncan supervises the swaps, and the banks the group deals with are instructed to check with him before Tomkins' treasury staff can arrange any unusual deals.</p>

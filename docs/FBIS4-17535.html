			<p>BFN     [Text] During their talks in Geneva, the Georgian and  Abkhaz delegations "adopted mutually exclusive positions,  backing farther away from the commitments they signed in the  political declaration of 4 April." Feliks Kovalev, the roving  ambassador who is heading the Russian delegation, said this in  an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. Summing up the  results of the Geneva round, he disclosed that, on behalf of the  United Nations and the Russian Federation, "options for a  compromise were proposed, and the parties expressed readiness,  in essence, to adopt them as a basis for further discussions."  "The next session will be held in Moscow on 10 May, and we may  be able to make a little more progress there than we have  managed on this occasion."    Two documents proposed by the mediators will be discussed at  the meeting in the Russian capital. The first deals with  "political and legal elements of a comprehensive settlement of  the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict." The second concerns "proposals  on the establishment of a coordinating commission." The  documents were jointly prepared by UN and Russian diplomats.  Kovalev said that the Russian delegation "made a substantial  contribution."    Is there any chance the two sides will reach an agreement?  "It is very difficult to answer this question," F. Kovalev  noted. "Judging by their drafts, they have not budged from their  original positions. In fact, they are going backward rather than  forward." The main problem is connected with Abkhazia's  political status. "One side wants to regard itself as an  independent state entering into a treaty relationship with  another state. That is the Abkhazian starting point. The  starting point of the Georgians is to keep everything roughly as  it was before the conflict started," the diplomat said.    The United Nations and Russia are proposing a "union state."  Their proposals also say that the parties recognize the  territorial integrity of the entity they might establish as a  result of the talks, Kovalev concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The central Vietnamese city of Hue suddenly  suspended airing of the BBC TV news in mid-May, apparently in an  effort to block out possible reports that several imprisoned  local Buddhist monks had mounted a hunger strike. Since late  last year, the city's TV channel had surprised Hue residents by  relaying the BBC's satellite news service free to anyone with a  TV set. Shortly before the broadcasts were cut, Vietnamese  exiles in France had said that several monks had stopped eating  to protest against their arrest in May 1993 for blocking traffic  during a demonstration in which they were demanding greater  independence for the Buddhist church.</p>

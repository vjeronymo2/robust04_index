These levels are 13 grams (g) of fat, 4 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving size, and, only for foods with reference amounts customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. For dehydrated products that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in &sect;317.309(g)(1), of all nutrients, the per 50-g criterion refers to the prepared form. Any one of the levels, on a per reference amount customarily consumed, a per labeled serving size or, when applicable, a per 50-g basis, will disqualify a meat or meat food product from making a health claim unless an exception is provided for in &sect;317.371, except that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The levels for a meal product, as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;317.313(l), that weighs at least 6 ounces (oz) but less than 10 oz per serving (container), are 20 g of fat, 6 g of saturated fat, 95 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per labeled serving size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The levels for a meal product, as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;317.313(l), that weighs 10 oz or more per serving (container), are 26 g of fat, 8 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of sodium per labeled serving size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disease or health-related condition  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition and, thereby, claims pertaining to such diseases are not subject to &sect;317.314 or &sect;317.370.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a substance to be eligible for a health claim:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The substance must be associated with a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population, or an identified U.S. population subgroup (e.g., the elderly) is at risk, or, alternatively, the labeling application submitted by the proponent of the claim otherwise explains the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in context of the total daily diet and satisfies the other requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the substance is to be consumed as a component of a meat or meat food product at decreased dietary levels, the substance must be a nutrient that is required to be included in the label or labeling as set forth in &sect;317.309(b); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the substance is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The substance must contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in 21 CFR 170.3(o), to the food and must retain that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim to be safe and lawful under the applicable food safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Validity requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator will approve the use of a health claim only when he or she determines that the claim is not false or misleading, because it is supported by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

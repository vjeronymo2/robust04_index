			<p>BFN     [Text] Dortmund (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  (Free Democratic Party of Germany) hopes that the NATO ultimatum  to the Bosnian Serbs will relieve Gorazde and the other Muslim  enclaves in Bosnia of the "murderous stranglehold." "The  community of states had to act," said Kinkel, referring to the  NATO threat of air strikes against Serbian positions at the FDP  land party congress in Dortmund on Saturday [23 April]. The FRG  Government supports NATO's decisions, he said.</p>

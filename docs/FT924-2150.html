			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Mitterrand blunders on EC job PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday renominated Mrs Christiane Scrivener as France's junior EC commissioner, in a quick move to recover from a blunder at the Edinburgh summit when he announced she would be succeeded by Mr Edmond Alphandery, who then promptly refused the job. Mr Alphandery, a centrist politician, said he preferred to seek re-election to the French parliament in March, but is also tipped as a possible finance minister in the centre-right government which is expected to emerge from next spring's election. What Mr Alphandery described as an 'unfortunate misunderstanding' resulted from the fact that he was ready to go to Brussels, provided he could combine Mrs Scrivener's EC tax portfolio with the EC monetary job at present in the Danish hands of Mr Henning Christophersen. He was still vainly trying to negotiate this - through Mr Jacques Delors, France's other commissioner, who heads the EC executive - when Mr Mitterrand, believing the deal was done, prematurely announced his appointment. The president seems to have been attempting domestic political manoeuvring with the job of Mrs Scrivener, a Giscardian liberal, by offering it to various Christian Democrats, including Mr Alphandery. The ploy did not work, as opposition politicians now have national office in their sights. There is the extra disincentive that, if the Maastricht treaty enters into force, the next EC Commission's tenure will only be two years. Mrs Scrivener was yesterday said to have taken the president's reluctant renewal of her mandate philosophically, commenting that it was the end result which mattered. She has showed the same pragmatism in getting, against considerable odds, EC governments to remove fiscal checks at EC internal borders from January.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fitzwilton just in the black as profits collapse Profits of Fitzwilton, the Dublin-based holding company, dived from IPounds 10.4m to IPounds 200,000 (Pounds 182,000) pre-tax for 1991. Turnover improved by 13 per cent to IPounds 453m. Main interests are in cash and carry and car distribution in the UK. It also has a 9 per cent holding in the troubled Waterford Wedgewood crystal and ceramics group. Mr Ken McGoran, chief executive, said: 'It has been a very tough year, both because of the recession and the reorganisation of the cash and carry business, but we are positioned to come back strongly once the economy picks up.' Market analysts described the results as 'extremely disappointing,' and expressed surprise at the extent of the collapse in profits. Mr McGoran said the company had no immediate plans for geographic diversification to reduce its heavy dependence on the UK market. The immediate target was to get back to a strong level of profitability. New car sales in the UK fell by 15 per cent although turnover was only marginally down at Pounds 187m (Pounds 189m). Cash and carry turnover rose to Pounds 201m (Pounds 154m), but the recession affected sales of non-food discretionary items, a feature of that business. There was an exceptional charge of IPounds 1.5m for integrating four cash-and-carry operations into one, and an extraordinary IPounds 2.7m for writing down the holding in Atlantic Resources. Losses per share emerged at 0.63p (earnings 7.11p). A final dividend of 2p makes a same-again 3.5p total.</p>

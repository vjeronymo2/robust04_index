			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Mercedes changes gear on way to less luxurious future MERCEDES-BENZ, one of the world's leading luxury carmakers, is to produce a people's car. Yesterday's announcement by the company that it was planning a small city car is part of a radical overhaul to its range foreseen during the 1990s. Other models to be developed include a 'people carrier' or multi-purpose vehicle and a four-wheel drive leisure/utility model. Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive-elect of the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, said Mercedes-Benz's current models had been 'over-engineered' and warned that future ranges could be 'priced out' of the market if such 'over-engineering' was allowed to continue through the 1990s. He heralded sharp price changes for future models, implicitly accepting they must compete more closely with Japanese-made luxury cars. Mercedes-Benz is also to be drastically reorganised with a reduction in management layers from six to four, a substantial cut in the 7,200-strong central staff in Stuttgart and the introduction of decentralised 'performance centres'. The company will accelerate plans to assemble passenger vehicles outside Germany and to search for partners in the development of components. Mr Werner said Mercedes would be transformed from a traditional maker of exclusive luxury cars into an 'exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market'. The company has plans for: A 'people carrier' or multi-purpose vehicle to rival products such as Renault's Espace and Chrysler's Voyager. It will be produced in Spain and launched in late 1994 or early 1995; A four-wheel drive vehicle to rival Land Rover's Range Rover and Discovery, Chrysler's Grand Cherokee and the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero/Shogun; A small city car to be introduced during the second half of the 1990s. This could be similar in size to the Twingo recently launched by Renault.

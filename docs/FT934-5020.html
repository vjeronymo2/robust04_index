			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The distributor Glyn Davies, 44. Has one daughter grant-less at university and two younger sons at private school. Job: runs Russell-Davies, the East Anglia-based distribution company he set up 20 years ago with his brother-in-law. The company has grown to 700 trucks and 1200 employees. Politics: votes Conservative. Did not want: any increase in the price of DERV or road fund tax. Verdict: 'I was quite pleased with the road tax issue, with nil on trucks. However, we are concerned about the commitment to motorway tolls. That has quite a serious impact on the costs of transport and distribution. The increase of 3p a litre on diesel is going to increase the costs of our vehicle operating costs by around 2 per cent. That will naturally affect our profitability.'</p>

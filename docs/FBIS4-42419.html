			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Franco Papitto report: "Waltz of Candidates for New </F> European Power"]    [Text] Brussels -- The negotiations have been going on for  a number of weeks, involving the most important countries of the  industrialized world. Coming up for renewal are the top  positions in some of the fundamental institutions for the  "government" of the West. According to various indiscretions,  yesterday in Mulhouse Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand are  said to have agreed on a sort of organizational diagram of  international power. Maybe it is not quite like this, also  because the German chancellor and the French president are not  the only ones to decide. But it is certain that the question  has been discretely debated, also that Western chancelleries  have entered into a period of feverish activity. Time is  pressing as the first stage in this appointments marathon is  scheduled to take place in Paris on 7 and 8 June, at the OECD  ministerial meeting which ought to appoint the organization's  secretary general. Then the EC's heads of state and government  will be seeing each other at Corfu on 24 and 25 June, to appoint  Jacques Delors' successor at the European Commission. This will  be followed by the appointment of the director of the WTO (World  Trade Organization), destined to succeed GATT, and the successor  to the seriously ill Manfred Woerner as NATO secretary general.    The problem worrying Kohl and Mitterrand is the presidency  of  the European Commission. They got themselves into trouble by  prematurely promising to support Netherlands Premier Ruud  Lubbers. Kohl's liking for Lubbers vanished when Lubbers  criticized German reunification. Mitterrand has never been an  enthusiastic supporter of the Netherlander, whom he also chided  for showing a "scant spirit of solidarity" during the Uruguay  Round trade negotiations. To undermine Lubbers, the two did not  nip in the bud the candidacy of Leon Brittan, the British  Conservative currently in charge of EC trade policy. They had  him advance, with vague promises, then suggesting the name of  Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a sanguine Fleming who  has rarely put his foot outside his country's borders.    Lubbers put his foot down: to torpedo his candidacy would  represent an "unacceptable affront to the Netherlands." Leon  Brittan has not backed off, even if he has become aware that he  is losing punches. A difficult discussion is looming at Corfu,  a blockage to be avoided at all costs because it would transform  into a quarrel an appointment which traditionally takes place by  general consent. And then Lubbers could be kept quiet by  granting him the function of NATO secretary general. The OECD  could be offered to Great Britain, leaving it to the London  government to choose between former Chancellor of the Exchequer  Nigel Lawson, the present candidate, and Leon Brittan. Dehaene  would then get the job at Corfu for lack of opponents.    But, for the OECD, the game is more complex because it  includes not just European players. The United States is  supporting the candidacy of Canada's Donald Johnston, whilst the  French have not lost hope that the job will finally go to their  Jean-Claude Paye. From Washington the idea has been flown of  possibly supporting a European candidate at the WTO in exchange  for the EC countries supporting Donald Johnston for the OECD.  In this complex scenario, the FINANCIAL TIMES about two weeks  ago launched the name of former [Italian] Foreign Trade Minister  Renato Ruggiero for the WTO secretaryship. The best tipped  candidates, according to the English newspaper, are "the Italian  Ruggiero and Brazilian Minister Ricupero." For the OECD  secretaryship too, Ruggiero would be a possible compromise  solution between Johnston and Paye.    As a result, this matter has also been taken up with  [Foreign] Minister Martino in his first international contacts.  Martino, who has been supporting the suitability of an Italian  presence at the top of one of the organizations regulating world  trade and world economy, apparently has begun to ask for  guarantees on the jobs to be given to the two Italian members of  the next European Commission, for which have been put forward  the names of Enrico Vinci, the present Secretary General of the  European Parliament, and [Radical leader] Marco Pannella.</p>

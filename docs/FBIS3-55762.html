In his view, Russia alone can guarantee  stability in the region. "The Crimea cannot be rescued outside  an alliance with Russia or peaceful reintegration into our  historic Motherland," he said.    Bagrov also said that a campaign designed to discredit the  Russian Party of the Crimea and himself as a candidate had been  launched in the runup to the presidential elections that are  scheduled to be held in the Crimea on January 16.    He complained that once he refused to drop out of the  presidential race or call on his supporters to vote for another  candidate, "certain political forces resorted to psychological  terror" against him threatening to kill him, his family and  friends.    The Russian Party leader thinks that the opponents of a  Russian Crimea will not stop at criminal methods. He said: "I  had to call officially on the state authorities of the Crimean  Republic, Ukraine and the Russian Federation to prevent turning  the Crimean general elections into a pretext for political  terror or violence which could provoke an explosion or armed  conflict."</p>

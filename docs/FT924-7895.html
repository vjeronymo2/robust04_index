			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Gap stock rises despite slide in after-tax earnings SHARES in The Gap, one of the most highly regarded US specialty store groups, rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 at close of trading yesterday, despite news of a tumble in the third-quarter earnings to Dollars 62m after tax. In the same period of 1991, The Gap - which takes in the Banana Republic and GapKids stores as well as its namesake chain - recorded a net profit of Dollars 70.8m. At the earnings per share level, the figure drops from 50 cents to 43 cents. The third-quarter profits slip means The Gap has now produced after-tax profits of Dollars 145m in the first nine months of 1992, compared with Dollars 145.9m in the same period of 1991. The company blamed the profits fall principally on additional advertising expenditures and reduced merchandise margins, but it pointed out that all of its divisions had been profitable during the three-month period. The company, which is heavily committed to denim product, cut prices of jeans during the summer, in an effort to cling on to market share. Its stepped-up promotional programme resulted in a same-store sales rise of 7 per cent during the third quarter, and one of 5 per cent in the nine-month period. With the total number of stores operated by the company rising to 1,295 by the end of the third quarter, compared with 1,201 a year earlier, The Gap's sales were Dollars 827.2m, up from Dollars 702m in the latest three months. For the nine months, sales advanced to Dollars 2.03bn, against Dollars 1.72bn last time. The Gap's shares have fallen sharply this year after the heady gains scored in 1991. However, having feared the worst, analysts seemed reassured that The Gap's management's commitment to protecting market share was paying off.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial report] An article in the 4 March Lisbon weekly  TAL &amp; QUAL reports that Socialist Party (PS) official Mario  Sottomayor Cardia, a former deputy and former minister of  education who recently announced his candidacy for the  presidency of the Republic, "disregarded the rule that a  candidate should not reveal his intentions until the last minute  to avoid attracting premature partisan support that may later be  withheld, or spare himself the ridicule of a quick preelectoral  defeat." According to the article, he is now beginning a "long,  lone road without the protective embrace" of the party he helped  found and lacking the benefit of President Mario Soares'  blessing. While a "polemical and disturbing" Sottomayor Cardia  may never become president, by announcing his candidacy the PS  official is compelling parties and politicians to "question  themselves" and prove that "individual initiative is not dead in  Portugal."    According to an article by Isabel Oliveira in the 25  February  Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE, friends of former President  Ramalho Eanes "have convinced him that he meets all the  conditions to be a presidential candidate again." The former  president even received the conditional support of PSD [Social  Democratic Party] luminary Alberto Joao Jardim, Madeira regional  president, and Center Social Democratic (CDS) party official  Nuno Abecasis, a former mayor of Lisbon, Oliveira notes.  Additionally, "awareness-raising dinners" are held around the  country to bring together Ramalho Eanes's old partisans and  define strategies. Oliveira also affirms that the former  president has met alone with Cavaco Silva. While she cites  sources close to the prime minister as saying that the subject  of presidential elections was not raised during the meeting,  Oliveira comments that Cavaco Silva, now certain that Ramalho  Eanes will run, was especially pleased when his interlocutor  "confided" to him that his first step will be a strong attack  against Mario Soares, a strategy Cavaco Silva indeed  "appreciates," she concludes.    Writing in the 1 March Lisbon weekly O DIABO, Nuno Rogeiro  reviews the possible presidential candidacy of Lisbon mayor and  PS luminary Jorge Sampaio. The mayor is the first to "cross the  Rubicon" of the presidential elections by "tactfully" implying  in an interview in the Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO that "if [Prime  Minister] Cavaco Silva is a man, let him face me for Belem  [presidential palace]." According to Nuno Rogeiro, it must be  acknowledged that Sampaio is presently the sole candidate "able  to attract [votes] and indeed to increase [them]." Sampaio can  attract because he possesses "impeccable" antifascist  references, because he was "never tempted to give in to  `Cavacoism,'" and because he is an efficient counterweight to a  renewed majority of the PSD. Similarly, Sampaio can increase  votes because he can point to his accomplishments in Lisbon,  "possesses the puritan stance appreciated by Portuguese  conservatism," and can discuss "practical and palpable"  subjects, Nuno Rogeiro continues. However, Sampaio can only  prove a winning candidate if, on the left, there are no other  strong and divisive candidacies such as Eanes's, and if there is  a "logic of bipolarization" with the right through a possible  Cavaco Silva candidacy. However, bipolarization can fail if the  prime minister consolidates his power in the legislative  elections, a victory that may obviate his "presidential  appetite," Nuno Rogeiro concludes.    The results of a presidential preference countrywide  computer-assisted telephone interview poll conducted by  Euroteste-VISAO on 23-25 February among 1,427 individuals  appeared in the 3 March Lisbon weekly VISAO. Respondents were  asked to name their choice for president. Prime Minister Cavaco  Silva headed the list with 29.7 percent of the vote, followed by  Ramalho Eanes with 17 percent, Jorge Sampaio with 15.7 percent,  Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes with 7.5 percent, and former Prime  Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao with 3 percent. Coimbra  University Rector Rui Alarcao and PSD luminary Eurico de Melo  received 1.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Some 6.2  percent chose none of the candidates, 1.5 percent would not  vote, 12.7 percent did not know, and 4 percent did not answer.  Despite Cavaco Silva's success, however, the Portuguese would  prefer him to remain prime minister. In fact, 51.6 percent of  the respondents would not want him to be a candidate for the  presidency whether he wins or loses the legislative elections,  while only 15.2 percent would like him to run.    The importance of the 1995 presidential elections is rather  small, and is derived from the legislative elections, themselves  of an "alarming simplicity," writes Jose Pacheco Pereira in the  5 March Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. The PSD either wins an absolute  majority and Cavaco Silva remains as prime minister, or it loses  the majority and a melee ensues. The issue of the candidates is  equally simple, he adds. If the PSD holds an absolute majority,  it can govern with any president, it being "irrelevant" if the  Left captures the presidency. All leftist parties would then be  "convulsed," mainly the PS, "where heads would roll," Pacheco  Pereira argues. On the PSD side, the party has no interest in  choosing a candidate "who would create more problems for the PSD  than he could solve," as Ramalho Eanes would. In fact, the  former president would cause deep internal divisions in the PSD  even with the "direct or disguised" support of Cavaco Silva, a  support that Pacheco Pereira, however, thinks is highly  unlikely. In contrast, were the PSD to lose its absolute  majority and become the opposition, the presidential issue would  be so different that long-term predictions are of little help at  this time, he observes.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Management: Going to work on the unemployed - Executives behind one initiative / Training Are we being radical enough in our approach towards training, demanded Edward Roberts, chairman of Central England Training and Enterprise Council? Roberts, chief executive of a medium-sized spring manufacturer, was presiding over the regular monthly board meeting of Reddich-based Centec. A couple of years ago Roberts, an enthusiastic businessman committed to training in his own company, Heath Springs, knew little about the government's training scheme for unemployed adults and young people. Now he is one of a commited band of private sector executives trying to push the scheme forward. Centec, one of 82 Tecs in England and Wales, last April took over from the Department of Employment the running of publicly funded training schemes and shouldered responsibility for the stimulation of 'enterprise'. The agenda of its three-hour board meeting, held in the evening and attended by eight of the 14 senior executives who are its members, gives a glimpse into the challenges and problems of running a Tec. With little preamble, the members settled down to well-informed discussion of the main aspects of a Tec's work. The need for more government cash was apparent and concern was repeatedly expressed over Centec's management of some training schemes inherited from the government last April. Links with local employers, crucial to the success of Tecs, were seen as relatively weak and relationships with organisations such as chambers of commerce were also revealed to be less than perfect. However, the tone of the discussions showed a strong commitment by the board and some real optimism that Britain's poor training record could be improved. Centec is asking for Pounds 1.5m more public money for 1992-93 than last year, when it received Pounds 11.6m. 'We are having to ask for more in order to do all the things you have decided you want to do,' Roddy Skidmore, chief executive, told the board. 'We have not massaged the figures. We are telling the government that this is what we need.' Given that the government does not want to increase its spending on training, the board was aware that any requests needed to be well presented. Richard Lacy, chief executive of the Independent Mortgage Corporation, wanted to know why 50 per cent of the budget was spent on Youth Training. Other board members questioned a proposed 22 per cent increase in administration costs for stimulating local companies own training programmes. Like most other Tecs, Centec applied for funding for training credits - a pilot scheme in which individuals receive a 'credit' - on average Pounds 1,500 - which they can exchange for training with a local employer or a training company. The objective is to give individuals greater responsibility for their training. Centec's application was rejected, and a post-mortem took place. Terry Morgan, managing director of Land Rover Vehicles, impatiently asked: 'Why did we not succeed when it was something we desperately wanted to do? What should we do differently next time we apply?' Skidmore suggested two reasons for the failure. First, Centec was still too orientated to Youth Training through training intermediaries and was not sufficiently involved with local employers. Second, some Tecs that had been successful may have been over optimistic in what they said they could deliver. John Turnbull, chief education officer of Hereford and Worcester council, suggested that the scheme itself might be flawed. Nobody on the board spoke well of the scheme inherited from the Department of Employment, in which long-term unemployed adults sign on for training that bears no relationship to local job vacancies. Take-up of the scheme in the Centec area was low, the board was told. 'A lot of unemployed people consider it a way to remove them from the unemployment statistics,' muttered one board member. Centec is experimenting with training tailor-made for specific employers who guarantee the individual a job interview. Ten placements have been found. Centec decided in its early days that it should be a facilitator, not a provider, of services. In practice this meant pulling together existing organisations and giving them a sharper focus. But now it has discovered it needs to be more flexible. Skidmore proposed that Centec lead an employment project in Chelmsley Wood, a 1950s housing estate on the edge of Birmingham with one of the highest unemployment levels in the country. Skidmore said he believed existing initiatives in the area were not meeting the need and that the Tec should pursue an offer of sponsorship and appoint a full - time manager on the site who would concentrate on developing small businesses and skills. 'We are changing our tack,' said Scampion, who believed the Tec should not take the practical lead in the project. He asked whether the Tec was not losing its strategic direction. 'Not at all - we are seeking to meet local needs,' said Roberts. Centec has responsibility for the Management Charter Initiative (MCI) which seeks to improve the quality of management training. Centec asked local chambers of commerce to run the scheme for it. At a previous board meeting it had been agreed that the MCI needed to be speeded up, and doubts were expressed over whether chambers would be able to do this. Skidmore told his board that chambers now had seized the initiative. A new head had been appointed and positive results were expected in the future. Skidmore said: 'The key to the MCI is getting the management of it right. We need to drive the scheme through with big companies and then we will have a cascade effect on smaller ones.' It was a comment typical of Skidmore, a former army officer who brings an engaging enthusiasm to his new job. Likewise his board, while coming from very diverse backgrounds, all demonstrated a strong grasp of the strategic issues coupled with an understanding that the haul would be a very long one.</p>

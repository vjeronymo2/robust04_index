			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) on 4 April  said that it will be prudent in applying the recently revived  Super 301.    Peter Collins, assistant deputy representative of the USTR,  said this at the ROK-U.S. trade talks held in Washington that  day. He said that regarding international unfair trade  practices, the United States will first make an effort to solve  the dispute through the World Trade Organization (WTO) and will  be as prudent as possible in the application of the Super 301.  In the first-day sitting, the two sides discussed the pending  issues, such as the easing of regulatory measures for the ROK  automobile market, the term of distribution for heat-treated  refrigerated sausage, the annual antidumping investigation of  ROK-made television cathode-ray tubes by the United States.    The U.S. side positively appraised the action taken by the  ROK Office of National Tax Administration deleting the space in  the taxation data form requiring the foreign car owners to fill  in the type of their cars, and demanded again that the tariff be  lowered for foreign cars. The U.S. side also claimed that  because of the ROK Health and Social Affairs Ministry's  alteration of interpretation of regulations on the heat-treated  refrigerated sausage, $1 million worth of U.S. sausage awaiting  customs clearance at Pusan port is about to be dumped as  inedible. In this connection, the U.S. side protested the  abrupt alteration of regulations.    The United States has been exporting the heat-treated  sausage  to the ROK with a 90-day distribution period in refrigeration,  but the ROK Government claims that the heat-treated sausage  should not be allowed to be distributed in refrigeration after  30 days.    The ROK side made an issue of the U.S. delay in its annual  investigation of ROK-made television cathode-ray tubes, thereby  delaying the opportunity for the revocation of the antidumping  charges. Hence, the ROK side demanded an early annual  investigation.</p>

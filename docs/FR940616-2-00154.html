			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, communities are invited to submit strategic plans that comprehensively address how the community would link economic development with education and training as well as how community development, public safety, human services, and environmental initiatives will together support sustainable communities. Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will be designated by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) based on the quality of their strategic plans. Designated areas will receive Federal grant funds and substantial tax benefits and will have access to other Federal programs. (For additional information on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, contact HUD at 1&hyph;800&hyph;998&hyph;9999.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Education is supporting the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative in a variety of ways. It is encouraging Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities to use funds they already receive from Department of Education programs (including Chapter 1 of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, the Adult Education Act, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act) to support the comprehensive vision of their strategic plans. In addition, the Department of Education intends to give preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in a number of discretionary grant programs that are well suited for inclusion in a comprehensive approach to economic and community development. In addition to the National Workplace Literacy Program described in this notice in which the Department intends to give an absolute preference, the Department intends to give competitive preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in the Urban Community Service program, the Rehabilitation Act Projects with Industry program, Rehabilitation Act Special Demonstration Projects program, the Parent Training program and Early Childhood Education program under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, and a variety of discretionary programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Notices concerning those programs will be published at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background on National Workplace Literacy Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The National Workplace Literacy Program is ideally suited to play a key role in the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program because it links economic development and education and training efforts. The program, which makes discretionary grants of up to three years in length, supports demonstration projects that teach literacy skills needed in the workplace through exemplary education partnerships. The partnerships are established between a business, industry, or labor organization or a private industry council and an educational organization to support work-related basic skills training. The National Workplace Literacy Program funds may be used, among other things, to update or upgrade the skills of workers in line with changes in production processes or technology. For example, basic skill levels that formerly were adequate for assembly line production are inadequate for employees faced with sophisticated quality control systems, flexible production, team-based work, and participatory management practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Workplace Literacy projects can improve the human resources of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, increase the productivity of businesses located in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, and help attract new businesses to these needy areas. Further, an amendment to the program, contained in the National Literacy Act of 1991, establishes a statutory priority for serving small businesses. This is the type of business most likely to be found in the zones. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the National Workplace Literacy Program is an important vehicle for achieving the National Education Goal that by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The program helps further this goal by improving approaches and methods used in meeting the literacy needs of adults in the workplace, including those with limited English proficiency. The National Workplace Literacy Program will also benefit by establishing an absolute priority related to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. Communities receiving these designations will already have demonstrated a capacity for the type of cooperative planning that is critical to a successful workplace literacy partnership. Projects funded under the priority will provide models for partnerships in other distressed areas and show how the National Workplace Literacy Program furthers the National Education Goal that every adult American will be literate and able to compete in the global economy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice of proposed priority does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that are otherwise eligible for funding under the National Workplace Literacy Program and that meet the following priority. The Secretary may implement this priority for fiscal year 1995 and for any later fiscal year: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects that provide workplace literacy services only for (a) persons who reside in and work in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities; (b) persons who work in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities although they do not reside there; or (c) persons who reside in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities and who may work outside the Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. If necessary to the proper functioning of a project serving a substantial number of persons in category (c), services may also be provided to a small number of their coworkers who neither work nor reside in an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

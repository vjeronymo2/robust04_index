			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Mandela warns of threat to S African constitution talks THE COMBINATION of political violence and Pretoria's efforts to retain a white veto was 'serious enough to destabilise' South Africa's constitutional negotiations, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, warned yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mandela repeated his intention to create a government of national unity should the ANC win a general election. He reassured white civil servants and invited foreign businessmen to prepare to invest once an interim government was in place. But while he said he was not seeking a confrontation at the second round of constitutional talks that begin on Friday, Mr Mandela made clear his concern at the wide gap between the ANC and the government. 'It takes more than one person to make a crisis,' he said, responding to reports of deadlock over efforts to pave the way for an interim government, the main objective of the forthcoming talks at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). 'We have no intention of staging any showdowns. We are going there with a spirit of reconciliation, wanting that something should come out of the meeting.' The government had moved its position on some key issues, Mr Mandela noted. 'They were against the idea of an interim government, and a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution - now they've accepted it.' But he went on to accuse Mr de Klerk of 'clinging to the levers of power'. The ANC envisaged a bill of rights, a national assembly elected on the basis of proportional representation under a multi-party constitution that required a two-thirds majority for any fundamental change. 'We are very concerned that the first government should be seen to represent everybody, and should inspire confidence among all groups in the country,' Mr Mandela said. 'But what we are not prepared to do is to give a minority of less than 15 per cent of the population the right to veto decisions of the majority . . . that is what Mr de Klerk wants, and that we cannot accept.' Political violence was an attempt 'to destabilise the ANC', he said. 'It seems clear to us that the idea is to prevent (the election of) a democratic government dominated by the ANC.' Mr Mandela said of the Codesa talks that 'problems have arisen, some serious enough to destabilise the discussions'. 'For one reason or other, government was not acting' to curb the violence that has left 13,000 dead in the past four years. Government insistence on a white veto and the continuing political killings were 'two issues that threaten the whole negotiating process', he said. 'But we are determined that the process should proceed, and that is why we have demanded immediate installation of an interim government' which would become responsible for security. Asked about plans to reform the white-dominated civil service, Mr Mandela said: 'We do not intend to throw people on to the streets. We do need to democratise the civil service, but it will be done in a humane manner.'</p>

Under the pact, both sides will cooperate on environmental  protection technology to produce high value-added products.    Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien, who signed the pact  with Voluno Ecology Systems Chairman S. Costa in Taipei, said  the deal is the 12th of its kind since the MOEA embarked on the  mission to form strategic alliances with foreign enterprises.    The Voluno group is a world-renowned multinational  enterprise  which has been an environmental technology leader for more than  60 years. The Danish firm has built 170 incinerators in 18  countries, including the United States, Japan, and Germany.    Yang said at the signing ceremony that Voluno will set up  Asia- Pacific business and manufacturing centers in Taiwan and  establish long-term cooperative ties with local companies and  investment consortia.    He also stressed that through the alliance, Taiwan will be  able to upgrade its industrial design and production ability as  well as boost research and development.    Yang said Voluno's willingness to enter into the venture  reflects its confidence in Taiwan's potential to become a  Asia-Pacific business hub.    The Voluno pact brought the number of foreign enterprises  which have signed strategic alliances with Taiwan to twelve.  Strategic alliances have been signed with AT&amp;T, GE, General  Motors, Motorola, HMM [expansion unknown], Westinghouse, and  Carpenter Technology Corp. of the United States, Holland's  Philips, ABB [expansion unknown] of Sweden, CSR [expansion  unknown] of Australia, and Cida-Geigy Ltd. of Switzerland.</p>

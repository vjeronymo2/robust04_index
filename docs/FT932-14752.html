			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks revive Heavily sold pharmaceuticals stocks recovered some of their losses helped by a hefty piece of chart analysis from Smith New Court. Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome were firm as the house, which has all three as both short- and long-term buy recommendations, argued that the three companies were 'well positioned to deliver above average growth'. Glaxo held out against research that claimed combinations of anti-nausea medicines might be more effective than sole use of Glaxo's Zofran. And, after the market closed, it was announced that Glaxo and SmithKline had settled a long running patent dispute. Glaxo closed 7 up at 562p while SmithKline added 4 1/2 at 413p. Wellcome lifted 10 to 729p.</p>

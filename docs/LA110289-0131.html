			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY SAYS SHOOTING OF CATS FOR RESEARCH WON'T BE HALTED  </P> <P> A controversial military research project that involves shooting hundreds of  cats in the head will continue at least until the findings of a government  investigation are released, the Army announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> The statement of support for the project was issued as an animal protection  group asked for a moratorium on the research project at Louisiana State  University until a report on the Government Accounting Office's investigation  is released.  </P> <P> The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine charged also that Rep. Bob  Livingston (R-La.) was unnecessarily withholding the preliminary GAO findings  on the $2.1-million project, in which cats are shot to learn more about head  trauma to combat soldiers.  </P> <P> "The Army continues to support the project at this time," Army spokesman Maj.  Joe Padilla said, adding that "the findings of the GAO will be addressed by the  Medical Research Command when the report is finalized and presented."  </P></p>

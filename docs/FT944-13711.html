			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU farm ministers agree to cut cereals set-aside European agriculture ministers last night agreed to reduce the amount of land that arable farmers are obliged to take out of production from 15 per cent to 12 per cent. The move to cut set-aside, the single most unpopular aspect of the 1992 common agricultural policy reforms, is expected to please French and British cereal farmers who have been vociferous in demanding a reduction. French farmers demonstrated as ministers began their meeting on Monday, urging a cut of at least 5 per cent. The National Farmers' Union in England and Wales had warned that EU cereal producers could have difficulty maintaining their markets if set-aside remained at 15 per cent. Mr William Waldegrave, UK agriculture minister, said Britain had accepted the Luxembourg council decision on the basis that it would be neutral for the CAP budget. The European Commission earlier this month proposed a reduction of 2 percentage points following a fall in cereal stocks from 33m tonnes to 14m tonnes in the past year and two lower harvests in the wake of the MacSharry reforms. The 3-point reduction will apply for next year only, and the level of set-aside will revert to 15 per cent the following year unless member states decide a further change. EU cereals output is expected to drop significantly this year to around 162m tonnes, compared with harvests of about 185m tonnes before the reforms were implemented. The reforms were aimed at curbing overproduction through cuts in support prices of 30 per cent over three years, and through set-aside. This was designed to go up or down depending on whether output targets were being reached. Mr Rene Steichen, farm commissioner, said strong world market prices, plus the CAP reforms, had left EU cereal prices higher than desired. He forecast a net increase in grain output of 3.5m tonnes after yesterday's decision. Commission officials said the decision could be implemented only after the European Parliament gave its opinion.</p>

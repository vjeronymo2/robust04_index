			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political editor Chip Tsao and Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] Lu Ping, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, yesterday flew in the face of public opinion by  formally refusing to meet the Governor, Chris Patten, during his  visit to the territory, which starts on Sunday. Lu's snub was  delivered on the day that an opinion poll showed an overwhelming  majority of the Hong Kong public want him to put aside his  differences with Patten.    According to the poll, prepared by the public opinion survey  centre of the Oriental Press Group, for Eastern Express and  Oriental Daily News, 71 percent of those questioned think Lu  should meet the Governor and 65 percent support Patten's written  invitation to Lu to meet him. Another 74 percent said Lu should  then invite the governor to visit Beijing to talk about Hong  Kong issues.    This will be Lu's first visit to Hong Kong since Patten took  office in 1992. They have only met once, shortly after the  Governor had published his reform plans that angered China.    Patten said yesterday that he was disappointed by Lu's  decision. "Today, director Lu Ping has written to say that his  schedule is so busy in Hong Kong that he won't, on this  occasion, be able to visit and to have a discussion though I  think he suggested that there may be opportunities in the future  which, indeed, I very much hope is the case," he said. "I am  prepared to cross any street, open any door, shake any hand,  talk to anyone if it is in the interest of Hong Kong. I think  that is what people in Hong Kong would expect. I think people in  Hong Kong want us to talk together."    The Governor said that in his letter inviting Lu to a  meeting, he suggested two topics for discussion. "The first is  the whole question of property prices because I want to put him  in the picture about how we saw the situation and what we  thought was the right way forward in tackling it," he said.  "The second issue which I said I would like to talk to him  about was the transition of the civil service which is another  issue which is important for us both."    The Governor's views are reflected in the poll, which shows  more than half the people--53 percent--think the two should  discuss political issues. Another 40 percent believe Hong Kong  people's livelihood should be on the agenda. However, 46  percent believe it would be unlikely that Hong Kong-Chinese  relations could be improved even if there was such a meeting,  while 38 percent were optimistic that a meeting between the  governor and Lu would result in an improvement of relations.    The poll was conducted on Tuesday and yesterday,  interviewing  a representative cross-section of 260 people.    According to the 1991 Memorandum of Understanding signed by  the British and Chinese foreign ministers, there should be  regular meetings between the Governor and Lu to discuss Hong  Kong affairs. The Governor said that if Lu's schedule was too  busy to meet him, it must be too busy to meet any senior civil  servants as well.    Mike Hanson, the senior government spokesman, said yesterday  the poll was "revealing." "It shows that the people of Hong  Kong want Lu Ping to meet the governor to discuss important  issues that people are worried about. If such a meeting does  not happen, it is for the Chinese to explain why," he said.    Li Weiting, an assistant to the director of the local New  China News Agency (Xinhua), said since Hong Kong was a part of  Chinese territory, the British administration here was nothing  more than a "caretaker" and Xinhua was Hong Kong's "real  master," it was natural that Lu would not meet the governor.    The United Democrats are writing a letter to Lu to request a  meeting with him while he is in Hong Kong, to address their  concerns, such as the case of Xi Yang, the Ming Pao reporter  sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.    A pro-China legislator, Tam Yiu-chung, of the Democratic  Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), also said Lu  should meet the Governor although the atmosphere was "not quite  right" for such a meeting. "It will do Lu no good if he refuses  to meet Patten. But it shows that China is still cross about  Patten and Britain. We hope in future there will be such a  chance," said Tam.    Hong Kong journalists also plan to lobby Lu to free Xi and  petition him to relax the reporting restrictions in China.    Lu arrives in Hong Kong on Sunday from Guangzhou and will  stay for about eight days. He will meet the Preliminary Working  Committee members, Hong Kong affairs advisers, and delegates to  the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, all appointed by China.</p>

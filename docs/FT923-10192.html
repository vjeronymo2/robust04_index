			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Businesses report scarcity of skills NEW skills shortages are emerging that will constrain the UK when it emerges from recession, according to a survey of large companies. The survey, by Gallup on behalf of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and management consultancy firm, indicates that the recession has removed some of the UK's traditional skills shortages. But many of the 100 companies polled say they are experiencing difficulties in specific skills areas where shortages are now almost as severe as before the recession. Shortages persist in information technology, languages and managerial, professional and supervisory skills, they say. Shortages of linguistic skills have worsened during the recession. The report says: 'These are precisely the areas where the same companies see the greatest demands emerging between now and the year 2000.' Companies, according to the survey, fail to equip individuals with requisite skills. Only 50 per cent of companies have, for example, specified the areas of competence they require of managers. Coopers &amp; Lybrand say appraisal systems in many companies do not lead to skills development and are in danger of becoming mere annual rituals. 'That is in spite of the increasing recognition of the growing demands on managers,' says the report. Few companies are equipping older people with the skills needed. 'This could put the UK's economic survival in jeopardy,' says Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'The number of under-35s in the UK workforce is falling, so companies need to retain older members of staff and make sure that they have the right skills.' The survey found that government measures, such as Opportunity 2000 and the Management Charter Initiative (MCI), had made little impact on companies' training plans. Miss Sheila Drew Smith, a Coopers &amp; Lybrand partner, said this may be because the companies in the survey had already developed their own strategies in these areas.

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK WINS DESPITE ESTANCIA RALLY  </P> <P> After a disappointing 58-55 Sea View League loss to Saddleback High School  Wednesday night, members of Estancia's basketball team will no doubt be faced  with the torturous what ifs?  </P> <P> A select few:  </P> <P> -What if Estancia had come out in the first quarter as it did in the third and  fourth, with non-stop intensity?  </P> <P> -What if Estancia played its game -- shooting from 3-point range -- instead of  trying to drive around and through the tall Saddleback defenders?  </P> <P> -And what if Estancia had shot better than 17% from the field in the first  half?  </P> <P> As it was, Estancia, which trailed, 29-17, at the half, staged a thrilling  rally in the second half. After outscoring Saddleback, the county's top-ranked  team, 14-7, in the third quarter, the Eagles closed the gap to 37-35 with just  less than 6 minutes remaining in the game.  </P> <P> From that point on, it was a furious finish with Estancia finding its groove  and Saddleback fighting to hang on.  </P> <P> Malru Dottin, who finished with a game-high 26 points, proved the savior for  Saddleback (15-1 overall and 1-0 in Sea View play). Dottin scored 11 of  Saddleback's 22 fourth-quarter points, several of which came on follow shots  and offensive rebounds.  </P> <P> Saddleback extended its lead to 49-41 with 3:45 remaining, but Estancia, keyed  by Andy Scholes' follow shot, came back to within 2 (55-53) with 27 seconds  left.  </P> <P> Tony Agnew made both ends of a 1-and-1 situation to seal the victory.  </P> <P> "Nobody said it was going to be easy," Pat Quinn, Saddleback coach, said. "We  fought and did what we had to do to win, and that's all I can ask of them.  </P> <P> "We were our own enemy, though. We made 21 turnovers, half of which were  unforced. We have to get back down to business."  </P> <P> Neither team was very effective at the start. Estancia missed its first 12  shots before Augustin Heredia made a layup and drew a foul for a three-point  play with just 43 seconds remaining in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Those were Estancia's only points of that period though, as Saddleback led,  7-3, after the first quarter.  </P> <P> Were the Eagles -- who shot 69% in the second half -- a little tight in the  early going against the county's No. 1-ranked team?  </P> <P> "Oh yeah," Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien said. "We were. We had a nice comeback,  we could have a nice pat on the back for that, but for a team that relies on  shooting . . . "  </P> <P> Estancia was especially ineffective from 3-point territory. The Eagles, who  went into the game shooting 53% from beyond the 3-point line, did not make a  3-pointer.  </P> <P> Heredia led Estancia (13-2, 0-1) with 22 points and Mike Curtis added 15.  </P> <P> Tony Agnew, who was not expected to play because of an ankle sprain suffered in  the Orange Holiday tournament, helped Saddleback with 13 points.  </P> <P> In other Sea View League action:  </P> <P> Corona del Mar 46, University 31 -- Corona del Mar (11-4, 1-0) ran off the  first 9 points and was never behind.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings hit 3 3-pointers in the first quarter, 2 by Matt Cwiertnia and 1  from Warren Johnson. University fell to 0-1 and 5-10.  </P> <P> Tustin 70, Newport Harbor 61 -- Jason Moore scored 18 points to lead Tustin  (11-5, 1-0) at Newport Harbor. Cheavly Ly scored 14 points and David Beilstein  13 for the Tillers. Scott Gray scored 16 points for Newport Harbor (11-5, 0-1).  </P></p>

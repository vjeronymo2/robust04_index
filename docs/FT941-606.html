			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Toyama Chemical warns on profits after price cuts Toyama Chemical, a medium-sized Japanese pharmaceuticals group, has issued a profit warning after the ministry of health and welfare imposed a 12 per cent price cut on its medicines. The announcement underlines the crisis gripping the Japanese pharmaceuticals industry. The company reduced its pre-tax profits forecast for the financial year ending this month to Y2.8bn (Dollars 26m) from Y3.6bn and said it would make only Y2.2bn next financial year. A poor performance by its new medicines and a deterioration in antibiotic sales were to blame for the undershoot this year, according to the company. It said the profits fall next year would be because of the ministry's price cuts and the absence of any new products. The company generates 70 per cent its turnover from antibiotics, a class of drugs which were particularly badly affected by the price cuts announced earlier this month. The fall in profits next year would be in spite of a cost-cutting plan which includes reducing the 2,200 workforce by 300, said Toyama. In April last year Toyama announced it would merge with Mitsui Pharmaceutical, another Japanese drugs group. However, the deal fell through after a Toyama subsidiary, Yuho Kasei, was declared bankrupt.</p>

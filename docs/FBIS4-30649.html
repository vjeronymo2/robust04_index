			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Surabaya, Friday -- The Indonesian Navy will soon  procure at least six to nine CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft  after its acquisition of 39 former East German warships.    The aircraft will replace several aging Australian-made N-22  Nomad maritime patrol aircraft, which are currently being used  in maritime patrols along Indonesia's 6,000km coastline.    Speaking after taking a ceremonial salute from a  guard-of-honor mounted by the members of the Eastern Regional  Air Maritime Fleet unit at Ujung wharf in Surabaya on 17 June,  Tanto Kuswanto, chief of staff of the Indonesian Navy said: "We  hope to get the approval to procure the new aircraft."    He said the CN-235 aircraft has similar capabilities to the  N-22 Nomad and can fly at low altitudes and at a lower speed.  Besides being appropriate for maritime patrol purposes, the  aircraft can also perform extra functions as desired by the  navy's air maritime patrol unit, such as conducting  antisubmarine operations, tactical surveillance, the  transportation of task forces and the provision of swift  logistics support.    He confirmed that the Eastern Regional Air Maritime Fleet  unit, which is a long arm of the navy's Joint Weapons System  (SSAT), has yet to be fully operational, particularly in  detection operations.[passage omitted]</p>

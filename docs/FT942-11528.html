			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / EU judgment deals blow to hopes over women's pensions Women in Britain hoping European Union law would help them secure a full pension at 60 suffered a setback yesterday. The advocate-general of the European Court of Justice said EU law did not prevent an employer raising a woman's pension age to 65, the same as a man. The court usually confirms the advocate-general's opinions. The case being considered by the court involves 78 women who work for Avdel Systems, a Bedford company. They had planned to retire at 60 on full pension but were told by their employer in July 1991 that unless they continued to work until they were 65 their total pension entitlement would be cut by 20 per cent. 'We are obviously disappointed for the women,' Ms Kamlesh Bahl, chairwoman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, said. 'They have lost substantial pension rights as a result of the change and feel it is wrong that in the name of equality those rights have been taken away.' Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at Sedgwick Nobles Lowndes, employee benefits consultants, said: 'The opinion goes further than general practice in this country, as few employers are equalising pension ages for service up to May 1990. 'But it is unlikely employers will take full advantage of it. Not only will it complicate the administration of their pension schemes, but the changes it will bring would be harsh on their female employees.' The European Court's Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange ruling in 1990 found that pensions were part of pay, so men and women had to be treated equally. Occupational pension schemes had to remove sex discrimination from their rules - including the different ages at which pensions begin. Yesterday's opinion, if confirmed, would mean employers could set the retirement age and would not, under European law, have to preserve any previous advantage held by women. They would still have to ensure, however, full equality of pension entitlement for service after May 17 1990, the date of the Barber ruling. Under a European court ruling last October employers are not obliged to pay equal pensions to men and women for service before May 1990.</p>

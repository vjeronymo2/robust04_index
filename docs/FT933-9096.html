			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Cambodians turn back returning Vietnamese: Khmer Rouge threatens to step up attacks THOUSANDS of ethnic Vietnamese fishermen and their families who fled Cambodia after a wave of killings by Khmer Rouge guerrillas are being prevented from returning to the country by the new interim Cambodian government in Phnom Penh. The government says it cannot protect them from the threat of violence, but United Nations officials working in Phnom Penh believe that is largely an attempt to excuse their hostility towards the ethnic Vietnamese. Most of the people who are now trying to re-enter Cambodia fled the country with what they could cram into their boats after more than 100 ethnic Vietnamese people were killed in April in a series of Khmer Rouge attacks on their floating villages. At a meeting on Tuesday, the head of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), Mr Yasushi Akashi, pressed the two interim prime ministers to allow the people back into Cambodia. However, Untac officials say they do not believe his appeal will produce any immediate change in the government's attitude. Untac officials say the ethnic Vietnamese must be given the freedom to choose where they want to live. The people at the border were mostly born in Cambodia and have lived most of their lives in the country. There is still a serious threat to ethnic Vietnamese people who return to Cambodia. On Tuesday night, six were killed in an attack on their house in the central province of Kompong Chnang. Local officials say there is evidence that these killings were the work of Khmer Rouge guerrillas. In recent weeks Khmer Rouge radio has been broadcasting increasingly bloodthirsty calls to Cambodians to rise up and kill ethnic Vietnamese people if they come back to Cambodia. A broadcast on Khmer Rouge radio last week warned that Cambodians were 'sharpening their knives' in preparation for what it called 'a new Vietnamese invasion'. The Khmer Rouge reign of terror in Cambodia was overthrown when Vietnamese troops invaded the country in December 1978. Untac officials at the border say the people there are well aware of the danger they face if they return to their homes in central Cambodia. They still want to go back, though, because they have run out of food and money and they have no means of earning a living away from the great central lake, the Tonle Sap, where they live and fish. Most of them have fled twice from Cambodia: the first time when the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975 and the second in April this year, when Khmer Rouge guerrillas made a concerted attempt to force them out and the United Nations was unable to protect them unless they chose to leave.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / BA defends Dan-Air rescue SIR Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, replied yesterday to airlines that criticised British Airways' agreement to rescue Dan-Air, the severely troubled British carrier. He said Dan-Air would have folded completely by the end of last week had British Airways not stepped in. Every other rescue plan for the airline had been exhausted and there were no other interested buyers or investors. The rescue has been bitterly attacked as anti-competitive by rivals such as Virgin Atlantic and British Midland. Virgin Atlantic, owned by Mr Richard Branson, abandoned its own attempt to take over Dan-Air 10 days before British Airways finalised its deal. Sir Colin said: 'It is interesting to note that the level of complaint against our move appears to be in direct proportion to the amount of disinterest shown in saving Dan-Air routes, aircraft and people by those who attack us.' Sir Colin, speaking at the international forum of the Scottish Council Development and Industry at Gleneagles, Tayside, also attacked American, Delta and United Airlines of the US for 'conspiring against' British Airways' proposed acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in USAir, the fourth-largest US carrier. Britain wants the US authorities to accept BA's investment in USAir as part of a scheme under which capacity and pricing constraints on transatlantic services between Britain and the US would be sharply relaxed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gyori Szabo from Hungarian Socialist Party </F> headquarters]    [Excerpts] We are in the middle of an international news  conference held by the deputy chairmen of the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP]. [passage omitted]    Gyorgy Janosi has said that the possibility exists for the  MSZP to be the leading force in a would-be coalition government.  Several journalists asked about the coalition issue and Gyorgy  Janosi is replying just now. He says that they are thinking in  terms of the broadest possible coalition. [passage omitted]  Imre Szekeres, the other deputy chairman of the MSZP, said that  the Hungarian people's participation in the election means that  they want to make this democracy, in which we live, work.</p>

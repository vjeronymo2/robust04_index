			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Travel: Relais group grows DID YOU know there were newly-elected Relais &amp; Chateaux establishments in Argentina, Fiji and Uruguay? Neither did I, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. But then R&amp;C, which brings together as fine a collection of hotels and restaurants as you will find, is cautiously extending its reach into all sorts of nooks and corners. The 1992 edition of R&amp;C's guide offers 387 hotels and restaurants in 40 countries: 148 in France, including eight new members, and 239 outside France (23 new). However, as the organisation makes clear: 'Maintaining and developing the quality of the R&amp;C network is one of our main concerns. This is the reason why 19 establishments (six in France and 13 outside) will be leaving Relais &amp; Chateaux in 1992.' The R&amp;C flag-waver in Argentina is La Cascada Hotel in San Carlos de Bariloche; in Uruguay: La Bourgogne, a restaurant in Punta del Este; and in Fiji: the Vatulele Island Resort. Britain has 20 Relais members, of which three are Relais gourmand (restaurant only). Between them, these 20 have 17 Michelin stars, 414 bedrooms and suites, and a gross turnover of Pounds 30m-plus. The two new members are the Summer Lodge Country House Hotel at Evershot, west Dorset - the only UK country house hotel joining R&amp;C this year - and Albert Roux's Fortyseven Park Street (posh apartments) and Le Gavroche (three Michelin stars) in London's Mayfair. I have not been there, but Summer Lodge, in Thomas Hardy country, sounds useful. It quotes various special deals. For example, two-day weekend breaks from now until April 16, and from October 1-December 22, cost Pounds 165-Pounds 205 per person, including afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast. Three-day weekday breaks cost Pounds 225-Pounds 300 per person in these periods. The equivalent single rates: Pounds 195 and Pounds 275. (Tel: 0935-83424, fax: 0935-83005). Full details of R&amp;C establishments can be had from its info office at 24-25 New Bond St, London W1Y 9HD, tel: 071-491-2516, fax: 071-584-0439.

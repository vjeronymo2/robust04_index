			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's </F> adviser, by Amnon Levi -- live]    [Text] [Levi] Good evening to you Dr. al-Tibi, 'Arafat's  adviser. A commission of inquiry headed by the Supreme Court's  president and with the participation of an Arab judge -- do you  still think this is a meaningless decision, as 'Arafat termed it?    [Al-Tibi] The decision to set up a state commission of  inquiry is an internal Israeli Government's decision for the  investigation of the incidents. Incidentally, the letter of  appointment refers to checking the facts and circumstances, but  somehow it was forgotten to authorize the commission to  investigate the responsible elements: Was it Barukh Goldstein  only or was it a whole movement, or a settlement, or the  commander of the Central Command or his superiors?    [Levi] It is clearly to be expected though that a commission  chaired by the Supreme Court president will not restrict itself  and will act as it finds appropriate. Let me ask you: We have  just heard a very firm speech by the prime minister in the  Knesset. In fact, I cannot recall a more resolute speech by him  against a sector of the Jewish population. A commission of  inquiry on the highest possible level was established. What  else do you demand?    [Al-Tibi] I cannot recall such a horrendous massacre which  was committed by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officer who is a  Qiryat Arba' settler. In the past, on 16 October 1993, the  Palestinians -- the Supreme Muslim Council in fact -- in a  letter to the prime minister and defense minister, warned that  this person, Barukh [here al-Tibi shows a copy of the letter  which clearly contained the name Barukh] engaged in provocations  against Palestinians inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. A  reminder to this letter was also sent, but there was no  response. Talk is not of Barukh Goldstein only....    [Levi, interrupting] I assume that this very interesting  letter which you mention will reach the inquiry commission when  its starts its work. I assume you will pass it on. Still,  despite the terrible dimensions of the massacre, let us talk of  the peace process which is more important than the massacre.  What conditions, if at all, will bring you back to the  negotiations?    [Al-Tibi] Prior to the cabinet meeting yesterday, the PLO  had relayed to the Israeli Government six points which it thinks  the government should have adopted in view of this new era.  After all, the massacre has changed circumstances and  conditions. It was proven that Qiryat Arba' and settlement in  the heart of the Palestinian population are time bombs which  should be handled, since this is not the first massacre either.  Qiryat Arba' is responsible for another massacre, in the  Islamic college, and for daily provocation, by the same people,  not necessarily only Kakh members. The Palestinians do not  protest only against Kakh -- is Rabbi Levinger a Kakh member?  One of the Bet El rabbis, for instance, said that their  beautiful wives light candles while the men set locals alight,  and this was not forgotten. Therefore, it is necessary to  handle the principle of settlers and settlements in the heart of  Palestinian population. The Israeli Government completely  failed to do that.    [Levi] You are familiar with details of the negotiations  than me, and you know that your demands, such as the removal of  Jewish settlements from Gaza and disarming settlers, are not  realistic. The impression is that you are taking political  advantage of these murders. Furthermore, when Israelis were  murdered recently -- since the peace process began, in fact -- a  demand was repeatedly heard in Israel to discontinue the  process. Prime Minister Rabin rose and stated each time, shortly  after each murder: We will not stop the process because it  would be a victory for the murderers. It seems that in your  action today you are awarding the murderer.    [Al-Tibi] The murder of the pregnant woman last week, for  example, was a base and despicable murder which disgusted me  personally. Still, reference here is not to an ordinary murder.  It was a horrendous, unprecedented massacre. New circumstances  were created by this massacre. The Palestinian residents in the  territories are defenseless and should be protected. The IDF  failed in its task. Due to this and other facts....[pauses] The  agreement of principles stipulates the need for an international  presence [last two words in English] -- this is the reason and  the basis for the demand for international protection, on top of  the IDF's failure. I heard ministers in the Israeli Government  who demanded during the cabinet meeting that Jewish  neighborhoods be removed from the heart of Hebron, and this is  one of the necessary actions.    [Later in the broadcast, Levi cites a reaction by security  elements to the letter presented by Dr. al-Tibi during his  interview, saying "this letter does not at all concern Dr.  Barukh Goldstein, but Barukh Marzel, one of the Kakh leaders."]</p>

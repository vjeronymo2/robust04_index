			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Jefferson Smurfit chief's share disposal MR MICHAEL Smurfit, the chairman and chief executive of Jefferson Smurfit Group, announced yesterday that he had disposed of 7.3m shares in the group, 5.6m of which had been acquired through the conversion last June of IPounds 9.8m of convertible unsecured loan notes. Mr Smurfit said that he and his family continue to hold some 24m shares that he is still the largest individual shareholder. Proceeds from the sale of the shares will be used to repay borrowings made to purchase the convertible loan stock in March 1989. Early this week, after discussions with its bankers, the company's US arm confirmed that a generous incentive package to a number of top executives, including Mr Michael Smurfit, had been drastically scaled down.</p>

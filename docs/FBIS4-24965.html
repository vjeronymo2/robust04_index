			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251) and </F> XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier of the  State Council Zou Jiahua affirmed the achievements of the  general inspection of commodity prices at an earlier time at the  national conference on general inspection of commodity prices  which ended today. He put forward a clear demand on continuing  to do a good job in the general inspection of commodity prices.    Zou Jiahua pointed out: Through concerted efforts by various  departments, the general inspection of commodity prices in the  earlier period was carried out in a smooth manner. A number of  cases concerning commodity prices which violated the related law  were investigated and due punishment was meted out, and some  erroneous practices of wanton raising of commodity prices and  wanton collection of fees were rectified. Those efforts have  made producers and operators strengthen their internal  management concerning prices and improved the order of commodity  prices and the market. They have played an active role in  ensuring market stability, reducing prices of commodities, and  easing the people's minds, and have also created a favorable  economic and social environment for the smooth implementation of  various major reform measures.    Zou Jiahua said: Despite the fact that recently the trend of  inflation has been alleviated, the tasks of controlling  inflation, stabilizing the market, and reducing commodity prices  are still crucial links in correctly handling relations between  reform, development, and stability. To continue doing a good  job in the general inspection of commodity prices, we must  further unify our thinking and understanding and enhance our  consciousness of doing a good job in the general inspection.  The most important thing is that we must correctly understand  and handle relations in the following three aspects:    1. We should correctly understand and handle relations  between the deepening of price reform and the strengthening of  control over commodity prices. To establish a socialist market  economy, we must carry out reform of the price system. To put  it briefly, we should change the mechanism in the formation of  prices and establish a mechanism of deciding prices primarily  through market regulation, we should straighten up the price  system and establish a system of comparable prices which can  reasonably allocate resources, and we should reform the  traditional price management system and establish a price  adjustment system controlled indirectly by the government. To  realize those goals in reforming the price system, we must  adhere to the policy of integrating "adjustment, relaxation, and  control" of prices. We should have control over the adjustment  and relaxing of prices to ensure that there will not be a  disorderly situation while having flexibility in the price  system. Even when the task of reform of the price system is  completed, the state must still have control over the prices of  certain commodities and services with a monopolized or welfare  nature. We must not let the prices of those commodities and  services go astray.    2. We should correctly understand and handle the relations  between supervision and inspection of commodity prices and the  reform and administration of prices. When the prices of most  commodities are decontrolled, the task of price reform is still  not completed. We must continue to change the price mechanism  and raise the prices of basic products [ji chu chan pin 1015  4342 3934 0756] and facilities in a planned and systematic  manner, and further straighten up the price system. Meanwhile,  we should establish and perfect a new price adjustment and  control system and management methods to suit the new situation  of decontrol of prices. This is an urgent task in price reform  today. At present, the problems of manufacturing and selling  fake and shoddy commodities to earn big profits, wantonly  raising prices, and monopolizing the market are still quite  conspicuous. Those problems have aggravated inflation. We must,  through the general inspection of commodity prices, guide the  behavior of setting prices. Reaping staggering profits and  cheating are not in accord with the requirement of the law of a  market economy and must not be allowed. We must take a  clear-cut stand to oppose and stop such behavior in setting  prices.    3. We should correctly understand and handle relations  between the adjustment in the management of the price system and  economic growth. The purpose of conducting general inspection  of commodity prices and implementing the adjustment and  regulation of commodity prices is to improve the order of  commodity prices in the market, control the excessive rise of  commodity prices, and promote economic development in a fast and  sound manner. This is favorable to the overall economic  situation and economic development in various locales. All  locales and departments must subordinate their interests to the  interests of the whole, unify their thinking, and take  coordinated actions.    Zou Jiahua emphatically pointed out: In conducting the  general inspection of commodity prices, we must have a clear  goal and pay attention to key problems. The principal leading  comrades of governments at various levels must personally pay  attention to the work, and leading cadres in charge of the work  must be responsible for the work, make proper arrangements for  the general inspection of commodity prices, create favorable  conditions for the execution of duties by price inspection  personnel, and help inspectors solve difficulties and problems  in their work. Various departments under the State Council  should seriously implement the guidelines of the "State Council  Circular on Carrying Out the General Inspection of Commodity  Prices Throughout the Country," adopt concrete measures to  coordinate with commodity price departments, give full play to  the advantage of joint efforts of all departments, and ensure  the smooth implementation of the general inspection of commodity  prices.    In conclusion, Zou Jiahua asked various locales to attach  great importance to the passing of related laws on price and  manage the price system in accordance with the law as quickly as  possible. In particular, it is necessary to step up efforts to  draft a "law on commodity prices," enacting laws and regulations  on opposing fraud, opposing staggering profits and monopolized  operation, and formulating rules for supervising and inspecting  commodity prices. We should gradually standardize and  institutionalize the management, supervision, and inspection of  prices. Price inspection personnel must exercise laws in a  strict manner, be honest, have self-discipline, actively explore  news ways and methods in inspecting commodity prices according  to the law of the market economy, and make still greater  contributions to stabilizing the overall situation, deepening  reform, and promoting development.    To further promote the deep-going development of the general  inspection of commodity prices, the State Council's working  group on the general inspection of commodity prices will go to  various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in  mid-June to supervise and guide the work and implement various  arrangements made by the current conference.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gosta Karlsson: "Environmental Goals Cannot Be </F> Met"]    [Text] The attempts to reduce the overfertilization of the  North Sea by 50 percent by the year 1995 will not be successful.  None of the eight North Sea nations will be able to cut its  nitrogen emissions in half, as was agreed on six years ago. The  threat to the ecosystem of the sea will thus remain.    The environment and agriculture ministers of the countries  know this as they meet in Copenhagen on 7-8 December in order to  discuss the protection of the North Sea. And in their hands they  will get a fresh report in which researchers warn against the  damaging effects on the marine environment if the countries'  governments do not in earnest begin to deal with the nitrogen  and phosphorus emissions.    The rivers that flow into the North Sea are loaded with  nitrogen compounds. According to the most recent calculations,  about 1 million tons of nitrogen are added to the sea that way  each year. Its origin is primarily commercial fertilizer in  agriculture and wastewater; 75 percent of the "river nitrogen"  comes from the Rhine and the Elbe.    Furthermore, each year the North Sea receives about 600,000  tons of nitrogen in the form of fallout from the atmosphere.  Automobile traffic and industrial processes are the biggest  sources here.  <H5>  Overfertilizing </H5>   In the central North Sea airborne transportation of nitrogen  plays a greater role than river transportation, and the fallout  of ammonia and nitric oxides in this sea has turned out to be  greater than previously calculated.    The addition of phosphates from the Rhine and Elbe is said  to  have decreased somewhat in recent years, but, at least as  regards the Elbe, researchers are uncertain whether this is the  result of lower pollution or because the flow of water during  the sampling period was lower than usual.    Thus, the overfertilization of the North Sea continues,  despite the fact that at the Second North Sea Conference in  London in 1987 the environment ministers of the affected  countries agreed that nitrogen emissions must be reduced by 50  percent--from the 1985 level--by the year 1995. None of the  countries will be able to meet that commitment.    The effects of the massive nitrogen flow is, among others,  that the balance between a variety of plant plankton (algae) is  disturbed. Certain species spread at the expense of others and  also increase their production of toxic substances when the  supply of nitrogen becomes too high. An example of this  phenomenon is the catastrophic accumulation of toxic algae in  Skagerrak and Kattegat in 1968.    At the Third North Sea Conference, in The Hague in 1990,  heavy metals and organic environmental poisons such as dioxins  and PCB's [polychlorinated biphenyl] were the principal theme.  The ministers decided that the emissions of about 40 indicated  substances were to be halved, here as well from the 1985 level,  by 1995. The substances are given in a "blacklist." Four of the  substances, cadmium, mercury, lead, and dioxins, are to be  reduced by 70 percent over the same period because of their  toxicity in the environment, according to the decision in The  Hague.  <H5>  Uncertain </H5>   Just what will happen to that goal is uncertain, judging by  the levels of substances found in the bottom sediments and  organisms of the North Sea. The researchers are saying, somewhat  vaguely, that the "emissions have decreased, rather than  increased." But even if the emissions have declined, it has  still not had any impact on the North Sea. There, the levels of  heavy metals and chloro-organic pollution are unchanged or even  higher, in certain areas.    Footnote: The data on emissions are taken from the  1987 "Quality Status of the North Sea," the most recent public  report on the environmental condition of the North Sea. The data  were submitted by the respective nations to an international  research group, which has been given the task of following the  development in the North Sea.</p>

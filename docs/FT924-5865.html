			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hungary plans further public share offering HUNGARY is to launch another large public share offering as part of the government's attempt to revive the fledgling Budapest stock exchange and raise local interest in privatisation. Danubius Hotel and Spa, a state-owned hotel chain, will offer Ft2bn (Dollars 24.3m) of shares to domestic shareholders on December 1 . This follows the announcement last Friday of the plan to sell up to Ft1.36bn of capital in Pick Szeged, the salami producer. The Danubius issue, lead-managed by the Hungarian subsidiary of Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank, represents 25 per cent of the company's capital. Each share, worth Ft1,000, offers a price-earning ratio of 12.6 based on forecast 1992 results. The government hopes both offerings will boost the Budapest stock exchange, where only three of the 21 shares traded attract regular investor interest. Unprecedented inducements will be offered to small investors to participate in the latest offerings. Only 10 per cent of the price will be required as down payment, with a further 40 per cent due after six months and the remainder financed through cheap credit. Investors will also be entitled to one bonus share for every two held for a year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The first meeting of  the Asia-Pacific Port State Control Committee (PSCC) was opened  here today.    Participating in the meeting are representatives from the 16  Asia-Pacific port countries and regions who signed the  Asia-Pacific Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control  (AP-MOU), as well as representatives from six international  agencies and maritime authorities, who have been invited as  observers of the meeting.    The AP-MOU, signed in December 1993 in Tokyo, is a regional  agreement for cooperation among Asia-Pacific coastal countries  and regions to ensure maritime safety and prevent ocean  pollution caused by ships. It's the third regional cooperative  mou on port control in the world, following the paris and latin  American mous in this field.    So far 16 countries and regions have signed the AP-MOU,  namely, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, Republic of  Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,  Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Solomon Islands, Thailand and  Vanuatu.    Authorities of these signatory nations will use the AP-MOU  to  survey and inspect foreign-flagged ships which anchor in their  ports, in accordance with related international maritime safety  and pollution-prevention conventions. This aims to control and  gradually eliminate low-standard ships from merchandise  transport so as to ensure maritime safety and oceanic  environmental protection.    Sources from the Chinese Ministry of Communications, which  is  in charge of the country's maritime affairs, said that as early  as 1987 the bureau of harbor superintendency of China began to  carry out demonstrations on port control affairs, and to date  the work has been extended to 12 ports.</p>

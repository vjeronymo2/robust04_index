			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Kozoriz from the Chernobyl Atomic Electric </F> Power Plant-Slavutych-Kiev: "The Exoneration of the Atom. Yet  Another Attempt"]    [Text] If you remember correctly, the first attempt was  made by the Supreme Council, which, contrary to logic and common  sense, called off its own moratorium on the construction of  atomic units and canceled its own decree on closing down the  Chernobyl Atomic Plant.    The Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES], named after  V.I. Lenin, lives and... I nearly said... "prospers." The  situation is, of course, far from prosperity, as it also is from  closing down. I became convinced of that last Friday [27 May],  during the visit to the Chernobyl AES by Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk. I have no doubt presidents do not frequently  visit such facilities, and when they do, it is not for mere  trifles.    What led Leonid Makarovych to the Chernobyl Plant? In order  to rule out various interpretations of the trip's objective, the  radio and television efficiently informed the public and  conveyed the president's ideas on the prospects of atomic power  engineering in Ukraine and did so, so to speak, close to the  text. In turn, the public response came quickly. The next day,  I overheard the following conversation on crowded Kiev bus  number 16:    "Did you hear what Kravchuk said? No one intends to close  down Chernobyl. On the contrary, new units will be  commissioned."    "Maybe they will even start the fourth unit?"    "Who knows? He says that Ukraine will plunge into an energy  crisis without Chernobyl."    "An energy crisis is better than yet another Chernobyl. I  wish we could survive that one."    Indeed, at the meeting with representatives of labor  collectives and trade union leaders of the Chernobyl AES, the  Ukrainian president stated that it is still early for us to  dismiss the Chernobyl AES and generally too early to write off  atomic power engineering. That is why the concept of the  Program for the Development of Atomic Power Engineering in  Ukraine had already been elaborated. One can expect that the  program also takes into account the Chernobyl AES. At any rate,  Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] repeated several times that no one  was going to close it down. It is another matter that the world  community wants this very much, but if it really wants this very  much, it must loosen its purse strings and pay... $14 billion.    Despite such a statement, the Ukrainian president gave more  arguments in favor of continuing the operation of the Chernobyl  AES. However, I personally did not find them convincing. Take,  for example, the following argument: The whole Europe abounds  in atomic plants. Or: In terms of some safety parameters, the  Chernobyl AES is in a much better shape than other similar  plants, and so on. Who knows better than Ukraine how safe the  Chernobyl AES is. However, it appears that the president  himself was not quite sure of the validity of his words -- in  particular, those that concerned safety, but he was compelled to  defend the position of the so-called atomic lobby. The atomic  lobby knows what it is defending.    It must be said that, as soon as the correspondents' pickup  crossed the border of the exclusion zone, representatives of  that lobby immediately got down to work. The correspondents  were actively persuaded that it is damaging to close down the  Chernobyl AES and that it is safe. One would think we were not  going to the atomic plant known to the world by the catastrophe  but to a Black Sea resort place. Just eight years have passed  since the accident! Eight! Have we forgotten everything?    At the plant, the correspondents were in for a small  surprise. The program for the president's stay at the Chernobyl  AES has envisaged a visit to the premises of the Central Control  Board. They say it is located right above the reactor. A  historic moment was planned there -- the president poses before  photographers over the reactor, something that might symbolize  its perfect safety. While the entire team of correspondents  climbed to point 35 and prepared the equipment for the  sensational shot, it turned out that certain changes had been  made in the program. In short, the president did not rise to  point 35, and so the historical and sensational shot was not  made. Instead, my colleagues took as many photographs as they  wanted in Slavutych, where Leonid Makarovych went to personally  meet with residents of the town of power engineers. There,  Leonid Makarovych repeated what he said in Chernobyl and added  that the residents of Slavutych should not worry about their  future, meaning that they will not remain without work. I do not  know whether the Slavutych residents are pleased with such  prospects, but I am convinced that the majority of the Ukrainian  population will not be enthusiastic about it.    The exoneration of atomic power engineering is a thankless  and dangerous deed, all the more so since the people still  experience the bitter aftertaste. It is really necessary to  hurry up?</p>

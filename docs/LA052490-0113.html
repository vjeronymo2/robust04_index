			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ROMANIA PARTY'S MONOPOLY ON POWER MAY IRRITATE EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL WOUNDS;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIZATION: THE NATIONAL SALVATION FRONT'S COMMANDING POSITION FEEDS FEARS  OF A REBIRTH OF COMMUNISM.  </P> <P> The National Salvation Front's control of the presidency and both houses of  Parliament gives the party spawned by last December's revolution a virtual  monopoly on power that may irritate Romania's emotional and social wounds.  </P> <P> The front's commanding position after an election marred by domination, deceit  and excess feeds the fear of those who see the loosely organized political  force as a haven for ex-Communists seeking to re-impose one-party rule.  </P> <P> Romanians had 88 parties to choose from when they cast their ballots Sunday,  yet all but the front polled far less than 10%.  </P> <P> Newly elected President Ion Iliescu, at a press conference with foreign  journalists, gave little indication that the victorious front is in the mood  for modesty and conciliation.  </P> <P> "It's very sad when someone doesn't know how to lose," Iliescu responded when  asked about widespread allegations that the front stacked the election deck in  its own favor. "The opposition doesn't want to accept the result only because  it is not in its favor."  </P> <P> With no effective opposition to give voice to their concerns, Romanians who are  worried that too much of the old regime has sur vived the bloody revolution  that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu may again resort to violence  to express their dissent.  </P> <P> However, the front has cast its resounding victory as an indication of popular  desire for order and tranquillity after 50 years of tyranny and a campaign that  served more to instigate than to inform.  </P> <P> Iliescu's opponents tried to delay the election, a strategy that backfired in a  nation weary of provisional government and the political uncertainties delaying  foreign investment and economic recovery.  </P> <P> The 60-year-old Iliescu, who served as interim head of state after the  revolution, said he is open to negotiation with defeated rivals who would like  to play a role in a coalition government. But he berated his presidential  challengers, the Liberals' Radu Campeanu and millionaire emigre Ion Ratiu of  the National Peasants Party, for running campaigns based on "attacks and  instigation to violence."  </P> <P> Silviu Brucan, a Communist diplomat-turned-dissident under Ceausescu and now  the ideological conscience of the front, said he is "very seriously concerned  about the magnitude of the electoral victory of the front." In a two-hour  interview, he expressed grave worry about the front's tendency to be more  enchanted by its preordained landslide than sobered by the threat it poses for  Romania's fragile political health.  </P> <P> Quoting Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Brucan said he fears the front risks  succumbing to "dizziness after success." It would be better served to develop  internal factions within the party and to encourage outside pressure groups as  checks on its authority, he said.  </P> <P> "I think my friend Iliescu should now avoid being surrounded by yes-men and  sycophants who are trying to force their way to the center of power," he  warned.  </P> <P> Iliescu and the front are burdened with having to build a government that will  carry out policies it has not yet clearly defined. Because the front initially  said it would not seek elected offices, its members decided during a national  gathering in January against setting up a formal party structure and forging an  ideological identity.  </P> <P> But the front proved relatively effective in restoring the machinery of  government after the revolution, procuring food for the shops and electricity  to run factories and heat homes, which bodes well for its ability to overcome  the lack of political organization.  </P> <P> The Parliament is required by the constitution to convene within 20 days of the  election, at which time Iliescu will name a prime minister and Cabinet. Iliescu  said at the press conference that interim Prime Minister Petre Roman, a  charismatic 40-year-old technocrat, will be his choice for this post.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the front must mend fences with the opposition parties it so  roundly defeated, which foreign observers and domestic rivals contend was the  result of front control of the mass media and state resources during the first  multi-party campaign in half a century.  </P> <P> The Peasants Party has categorically rejected any role in a coalition, but  front officials such as Brucan have said the leadership would gain from Liberal  membership in the Cabinet, possibly a ministerial seat for Campeanu. The front  has also indicated interest in working with representatives of the Hungarian  minority of 2 million, with environmentalists and with independent groups that  would strengthen the front's links with professionals and specialists who will  be the essential players in reshaping Romania's economy.  </P> <P> The front's attitude toward dissent will likely be the first test of its  commitment to democratic ideals. Iliescu was asked Wednesday whether he stands  by a promise made last week that he would not use violence against the student  demonstrators who have occupied University Square since April 22.  </P> <P> He said no force will be used against the demonstrators, then added, "I hope."  </P> <P> A further check on the front's dominance of Romanian politics could come from  abroad if Western governments attempt to tie financial aid for recovery to  progress in developing pluralism.  </P> <P> The new government wants joint-venture investments and most-favored-nation  trade status from Washington, as well as stronger trade ties with other  nations.  </P></p>

Dr. Anafu told Channel Africa that the soldiers had  agreed in principle to leave their positions and return to their  barracks at Makoanyane and (Ha Rakamose) just outside the  capital.    Mr. Gaylard said discussions with the two fighting Army  factions were continuing, with both sides having expressed  loyalty to the Lesotho Government. Lesotho Foreign Affairs  Minister Molapo Qhobela told Channel Africa that his government  wanted the Commonwealth to take as much time as necessary to  talk to the soldiers and resolve the conflict.</p>

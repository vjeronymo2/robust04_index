			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ORTEGA IN N.Y. ON BIOGRAPHY DEAL  </P> <P> A spokesman for Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader voted out as president of  Nicaragua, says some 16 U.S. publishers are interested in Ortega's biography.  </P> <P> Ortega is in New York discussing the matter.  </P> <P> "It will be personal, not polemical," Paul S. Reichler, a longtime adviser to  the Sandinistas, told The New York Times, "although it will of course talk  about the triumph of the Sandinista revolution, its confrontations with the  United States and the recent elections." Reichler said the plan is for Ortega  to have a manuscript ready by September, 1991, for publication in 1992.  </P></p>

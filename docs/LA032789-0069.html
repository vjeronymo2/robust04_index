			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON YOUR OWN: IS HONESTY ALWAYS THE BEST POLICY?  </P> <P> Is being honest in romantic relationships always the best policy? That's the  question raised by a Cincinnati reader, Joan Farrell. In a column about  "commitmentphobia," I wrote that it is a well-kept male secret that a man often  tells a woman he is afraid of commitment when the truth is that he would prefer  not to be committed, or at least not to her. I said, "It feels easier and  kinder to say that he is afraid than to say he would rather not be committed or  that he does not care enough about her."  </P> <P> Farrell writes that a man doing this "ill serves the woman. I am amazed that  you seem to approve of this behavior. I find it dishonest and also a guilt  mitigator for the man. However, there need be no guilt if one chooses to end a  relationship with anyone. An honest but tactful approach is the best."  </P> <P> In general, I agree. But there are times when honesty and tact do not go  together very well. Let me ask you, Ms. Farrell, would you tell a very nice man  that you wouldn't go out with him because you found him ugly and unappealing?  Or would you tell a caring and decent man that you were ending it because he  was a dud as a lover?  </P> <P> However, there are times when honesty can serve a person well. If someone says,  "You are so desperate and needy that it scares me off," or "You are so  self-centered and ungiving that I feel unseen by you," the other person could  gain important insight. I often suggest that people say simply, "I'm sorry but  I don't feel what I need to feel in order to continue this relationship," but  they have to be prepared to be asked repeatedly, "Why not?"  </P> <P> Responding to a letter I printed from a man whose girlfriend resented the time  he spent with his best friend, a 29-year-old Michigan man wrote: "His letter  struck a chord with me. A similar situation ended the relationship between my  ex-girlfriend and myself. She said that I was 'too close' to a friend and saw  him 'too often.' I asked if she thought something sexual was going on and she  wouldn't answer. Like the man who wrote to you, I reduced how often I saw my  friend. Then one night when I was supposed to see her, he called and said his  father had been in an accident. He asked if I could come to the hospital, and I  said, 'Of course.' When I called my girlfriend, she became furious. That was  the last straw for me. . . . Maybe that incident makes her sound self-centered  and immature, but she wasn't that way about anything else."  </P> <P> Interesting. Since I've now received two letters on this problem, I wonder how  widespread it is. I'd like to hear from other men who have found that the women  in their lives resented their male friendships, and from women who found that  the men in their lives resented their friendships with other women.  </P> <P> I recently responded to a 68-year-old woman who was unhappy that her children  were not presenting her with grandchildren despite her attempts to pressure  them into it. I wrote that having children to please one's parents was not a  good idea.  </P> <P> Two Upstate New York women responded with suggestions. Patricia Kaufman wrote:  "You missed a wonderful opportunity to suggest that she work as a volunteer  with the Adoptive Grandparents Program." And Elaine Schreiber wrote: "Many  grandparents and grandchildren live miles apart. This woman could adopt a  grandchild in her own special way and create the loving bond that I also hope  to have with grandchildren. It would benefit the woman and enrich a child's  life as well."  </P></p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions cool on Scargill threat to Labour MR ARTHUR SCARGILL, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, was isolated by trade unionists yesterday after threatening that Labour's attempts to reform its links with the union movement could lead to the setting up of a new political party. Speaking at his union's annual conference in Scarborough, Mr Scargill said that if the Labour leader persisted with attempts to diminish the role and influence of trade unions in the party there was 'a real risk that trade unions - or some of them - may decide it is time to conceive a new party which will give the same unequivocal commitment in parliament to our class that the Tory Party gives to its own.' Trade unions, he said, should be seeking to strengthen, not weaken the influence and effectiveness of trade unions inside the Labour party. Other trade unions - even those opposed to the reforms proposed by Mr John Smith, Labour leader - quickly distanced themselves from Mr Scargill's remarks. His proposals were not taken seriously either by the Labour leadership, with one official dismissing him as 'an isolated individual.' The schism has historical parallels - the Miners Federation eschewed links with the Labour Representation Committee, the precursor to the Labour party, for almost a decade after its formation in 1900. The miners' union then sponsored its own MPs. But yesterday other trade unions reiterated their commitment to the existing Labour party. A spokesman for the GMB union, whose leader Mr John Edmunds has been critical of Mr Smith's leadership, said Mr Scargill's remarks were 'unhelpful' and divisive. Nupe, the public service union, said it was happy that its views were voiced through Labour's ruling National Executive Committee. 'I think that we would probably want to distance ourselves from it (Mr Scargill's speech) at the moment,' said a spokesman. A spokesman for RMT, the transport union, said there would have to be 'massive changes' for it to abandon the existing Labour party. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, told the union's annual conference yesterday that he supported Labour's existing shadow cabinet, 'warts and all'. The Trades Union Congress said yesterday it was opposed to any takeover of privatised pits by Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate. The TUC also said it would be mounting a campaign of 'political and social pressure' to draw attention to action in the US by the United Mine Workers of America and Canada. UMWA is striking in the US against the Hanson subsidiary, Peabody, over job security.</p>

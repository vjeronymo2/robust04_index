			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Roxspur in black with Pounds 0.12m Roxspur yesterday reported its first full-year profit since it was floated as Levercrest in June 1990, helped by improved manufacturing efficiency and a contribution from Brearley Group, acquired in March. On increased sales of Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 4.18m) a pre-tax profit of Pounds 120,000 was achieved, compared with a Pounds 125,000 deficit previously. Roxspur said that its strong second half bias had continued. Levercrest, which manufactures and installs playground equipment, increased manufacturing efficiency and made a substantial contribution to operating profits of Pounds 189,000 (Pounds 29,000 losses). The operating line was struck after absorbing Pounds 175,000 of abortive acquisition costs. In the 10 weeks since its acquisition, Brearley added Pounds 4,000 to overall pre-tax profits on sales of Pounds 703,000. The group makes electronic and electro-mechanical products. Group earnings per share were 0.4p, compared with losses of 0.9p.</p>

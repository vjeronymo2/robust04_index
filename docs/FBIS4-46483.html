Sukhanov and Reserve Captain </F> 2nd Rank V. Smirnov: "Foreign Navies' Surface Combatants'  Torpedo Defense Systems and Equipment"]    [Text] The development of torpedo defense systems and  equipment for surface combatants and auxiliary ships continues  to remain one of the most dynamic directions of R&amp;D [research  and development] and the primary orientation of purchases in the  navies of foreign countries. This is explained by the fact that  the command authorities of their navies view modern and future  heavy torpedo submarines, especially "Soviet, that are following  in the wake of the 65 class", as a serious threat to surface  combatants and ships at sea. It is thought that they can be  utilized in joint strikes with antiship missiles at distances  that are beyond the maximum assured detection ranges of  submarines that employ these torpedoes. At the same time, we  note that a ship, due to its specific design features, is most  vulnerable to underwater explosions, especially of torpedo  warheads and, in the event of damage by torpedoes, has less  chance for survival than when damaged by a missile. Therefore,  according to foreign experts, along with other defense measures,  we must equip the primary classes of surface combatants with a  single multi-echelon torpedo defense system similar to the PVO  [air defense] system, which must not only detect attacking  torpedoes, suppress and deceive their guidance systems in a  reliable and timely manner, but also destroy these torpedoes.    It is being asserted that there are no such torpedo defense  systems on foreign surface combatants at the present time and  defense from torpedoes is being carried out utilizing only towed  and fired sonar countermeasures systems. And that is already  inadequate to effectively combat modern and, all the more so,  future torpedoes. Abroad, these circumstances have provided a  priority for a number of efforts on the development of  comprehensive torpedo defense systems, including, besides sonar  countermeasures systems, attacking torpedo destruction systems  which, in turn, have received the greatest development in the  navies of the United States, Great Britain, and France.    At the present time, various types of nationally-produced  towed torpedo decoys form the foundation of these countries'  torpedo defense systems. In the process, sonar countermeasures  systems are being combined into the comprehensive SSAWS  "acoustic combat" systems (SSAWS -- Surface Ship Acoustic  Warfare System) on U.S. Navy surface combatants and ships. The  Nixie type towed portion of the decoys, thanks to its small  size, as a rule is located in an below decks space along the  right side. Two towed bodies are deployed at the same time --  each through its own port hole and with its own winch. On  British ships, towed bodies of decoys that have adequately large  dimensions (see the table), along with winches, are located in  the stern on the upper deck. Other countries, for example  Germany and Japan, utilize various modifications of American  Nixie type decoys. However, I must note the development of  national sonar countermeasures equipment on behalf of surface  combatant torpedo defense systems in the Israeli Navy where  today the ATC-1 small electronic-acoustic torpedo decoy has been  developed at the level of modern Western standards.    At the beginning of the 1980's, work was begun, practically  simultaneously, in the United States, Great Britain and France,  on the modernization of existing and the development of  fundamentally new surface combatant and ship torpedo defense  systems based upon the SSTD (United States), Talisman (Great  Britain), and Spartacus (France) programs. In the process, the  American SSTD (SSTD -- Surface Ship Torpedo Defense) Program  consists of three independent stages.    The 1st and 2nd stages form a purely American national  program that is being carried out under the management of the  U.S. Navy's Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). During the course of  accomplishing the program, in the first stage, work was  completed to improve existing torpedo defense systems and, in  the 2nd stage, new generation torpedo defense systems were  developed utilizing modern technical solutions.    In contrast to the 1st and 2nd stages, during the course of  which systems which protect surface combatants and ships from  modern torpedoes were developed within the framework of existing  torpedo defense systems, during the course of the 3rd stage,  they propose developing a fundamentally new multi-echelon system  for their defense from future torpedoes with various types of  guidance systems and target attack methods. While considering  the system's high complexity and cost of R&amp;D on the  development  of this torpedo defense system, in 1998 the U.S. and British  governments decided to combine the scientific-technical and  financial efforts of the two countries for the successful  completion of work by the end of the 1990's.    An improved variant of the AN/SLQ-25 -- the AN/SLQ-25A decoy  was developed during the 1st stage of this program. According to  American experts, this is essentially a new development that  significantly exceeds its predecessor in specifications and  capabilities. Series production of the AN/SLQ-25A decoys had  already begun in 1988 and deliveries of it to the navy were  planned from April 1991. The overall need for them until the  year 2000 was assessed at 240 systems (at a rate of manufacture  of two systems per month).    In accordance with the 2nd stage of the SSTD Program, the  following surface combatant torpedo defense subsystems have been  developed or are at the concluding stage of full-scale  development: an anti-torpedo; the AN/SLR-24 torpedo passive  detection and classification system; the AN/SLQ-36 towed  combined countermeasures system and improved fired sonar  countermeasures systems to suppress EX-10 torpedo guidance  systems and also a countermeasures control system (CDC).    The anti-torpedo was developed based on the Mk 46 small  antisubmarine torpedo. A total of approximately 70 practical  launches of the anti-torpedo have been conducted during  full-scale tests against a 65 cm torpedo simulator. Based upon  tests results, they planned to reequip 172 Mk 46 torpedoes into  anti-torpedoes in the 1993 fiscal year. Later, they propose to  reequip more improved torpedoes -- the Mk 50 Barracuda --  because, according to American experts, anti-torpedoes must  become the primary torpedo defense systems of aircraft carriers  in the near future.    An experimental model of the AN/SLR-24 passive torpedo  detection subsystem has already been tested on the aircraft  carrier John F. Kennedy and demonstrated its capability to  successfully recognize the noises of a simulator of an attacking  antiship torpedo in the background of the aircraft carrier's own  noise. In 1992, they anticipated the delivery to the navy of two  experimental models of this subsystem. As for the AN/SLQ-36  towed countermeasures system, its development was completed in  1988.    It is anticipated that a new torpedo defense system, which  consists of the AN/SLR-24 subsystem, an anti-torpedo, and a CDC  type control system will enter the inventory of American  aircraft carriers already in 1996-1997.    Therefore, the participation of two international  consortiums  headed by the firms Westinghouse and General Electric (United  States) was planned at this stage of work. They propose  concentrating primary efforts on the development of highly  effective robotic torpedo defense systems employing artificial  intelligence technology, including short-range self-defense  torpedo destruction systems. The scientific-technical  achievements obtained during the course of work of the 2nd stage  of the SSTD Program and the SDI Program are being utilized for  their development. In the process, expanded research is being  conducted with the involvement of the experimental facilities of  the U.S. Navy and universities.    They are examining the following systems as torpedo  destruction systems: promising specialized small anti-torpedoes;  anti-torpedo networks with warhead-destroyers that have been  installed in the path of the attacking torpedo and various types  of depth charges.    Analysis of information materials indicates that significant  successes have been achieved in the United States in the  development of specialized anti-torpedoes and also  anti-torpedoes based on small 324 cm antisubmarine torpedoes.  For example, the completion of work in 1991 on the development  of a 203-mm anti-torpedo for submarines and the 2nd stage of the  development of a fundamentally new navigation system for future  anti-torpedoes that have a speed of approximately 40 knots and  the capability to complete turns with an angular velocity of  approximately 50 per second have been reported.    Full-scale testing at Los Alamos Laboratory (New Mexico,  United States) has confirmed the technical capability to  dispense a 5 X 5 meter anti-torpedo network from a 324-mm  platform and a 10 X 10 meter network from a 533-mm platform.  Deployment of the network in the path of the torpedo is carried  out using four hydro-rocket projectiles which explode when the  torpedo ends up in the network.    At the beginning of the 1990's, the United States developed  an anti-torpedo depth charge with a diameter of the bottom  portion of 373-mm and a weight of approximately 360 kg, that is  capable of carrying out ricochetless entry into the water at  acute angles at speeds of up to 610 meters per second at  permissible G-loads.    During the course of work on the 3rd stage of the SSTD  Program, significant attention is being devoted to the  development of a reliable torpedo detection system that provides  the time required to implement torpedo defense system measures.  American experts think that the problem of detection of  torpedoes requires the development of a special torpedo circuit  in a centralized underwater situation information processing  system. In the process, primary emphasis is being made on the  development of hull-mounted and towed concentrated acoustic  systems, and of acoustic systems with a GPBA [flexible towed  extended sonar antenna] -- torpedo detection circuits and the  appropriate processing, analysis and information depiction  software. It is thought that, when torpedoes are detected, their  classification, determination of coordinates, and parameters of  their movement must be conducted, and also detection of the main  threat for surface combatants with the goal of subsequent  automatic selection of the most effective technique to combat  them.    A memorandum between the United States and Great Britain  defines the following time periods during the 3rd phase of work:    1991 -- Selection of the variants of future torpedo defense  systems for further work, a preliminary assessment of the cost  of the torpedo defense system elements and systems on the whole  and conclusion of contracts for R&amp;D;    1992-1993 -- Conceptual design and selection of one basic  variant of the system for each class of ships of the U.S. and  British navies and determination of developing firms on a  competitive basis;    1994 -- (second half) -- Initiation of full-scale  development  of the future torpedo defense system; and,    1998-1999 -- Entry of series-produced models into the  inventory.    The U.S. Navy Naval Systems Command has announced that the  list of all ships on which the future torpedo defense system  will be installed will depend on its effectiveness, operational  requirements and production capacity. According to expert  assessments, the U.S. Navy's need for new torpedo defense  systems totals more than 400 sets and the British Navy's need --  is approximately 80 sets. Furthermore, it was noted that the  involvement of the French Navy in the work is possible during  the 3rd stage of the SSTD Program and that its needs are  assessed as more than 100 sets of the new torpedo defense system.    Great Britain's Talisman Program is similar to the American  SSTD Program and contains three subprograms (stages in the U.S.  program): modernization of existing torpedo defense systems;  development of new generation torpedo defense systems for  surface combatants that are in the inventory and that are under  construction; and, development of new promising torpedo defense  systems within the framework of the 3rd stage of work on the  SSTD Program.    The SEA SIREN Towed Torpedo Decoy, which is considered to be  a next generation system, was developed based on the latest  microprocessor technology during the course of modifying torpedo  defense systems at the end of the 1980's in Great Britain. Like  its predecessors -- the British 182M and GI 738 [sic] decoys, it  is designed to deflect torpedoes with active, passive and  combined acoustic guidance systems away from surface combatants.    The British are applying significant efforts toward the  development of fired drifting sonar countermeasures devices. So,  here they developed the ATAAC 76- and 100-mm projectiles (ATAAC  -- Anti-Torpedo Air-launched Acoustic Countermeasure) for  suppression of torpedoes' acoustic guidance systems at the end  of the 1980's. A rocket-propelled projectile with a noise  jamming generator has been integrated with the launchers of  surface combatants of the U.S. and British navies that are  designed to dispense jamming and decoys. The appropriate  functioning program can be entered into the projectile prior to  launch based upon the data received from the acoustic systems.  After entering the water, the projectile creates powerful noise  jamming in the water in a wide band of torpedo acoustic  frequencies.    An experimental model of the Spartacus surface combatant  torpedo defense system was developed in France at the end of the  1980's. They proposed initiating its series production in the  middle of 1992. This system consists of: a passive torpedo  detection system and issuance of a "torpedo alert" signal; a  countermeasures process control system and rocket-propelled  projectiles with warheads in the shape of various types of sonar  countermeasures instruments.    The torpedo detection system in its complete configuration  consists of the Albatros sonar system with a flexible towed  extended sonar antenna and U/RDT-1A (SPDT-1A) torpedo detection  noise direction-finding equipment that operates from a DUBA-25  type hull-mounted acoustic system antenna.    The joint operation of these two systems provides continuous  360 surveillance of the situation in the passive mode, in  the process, French experts note that the torpedo detection  range can reach 10 or more kilometers with a torpedo DF accuracy  of more than 10 under favorable acoustic conditions.    The U/RDT-1A acoustic system depicts noise spectral analysis  data in time sequence on a color panoramic display and the noise  frequency spectrum on a monochrome panoramic display.    The countermeasures processor control system is a data  processing device of the nearby underwater situation, tactical  situation depiction, data processing on the accomplishment of  torpedo defense missions and control of the torpedo defense  process. The following is carried out using a data processing  unit: underwater situation information analysis on behalf of  torpedo defense; target classification; calculation of the  relative coordinates and the elements of movement of attacking  torpedoes and target ranking based upon the degree of threat  they pose to the surface combatant.    In the Spartacus system, a triangulation method jointly with  carrying out coordinated inter-antenna signal processing from  the bow and towed extended U/RDT-1A and Albatros sonar system  antennas, respectively, is utilized to determine target  coordinates and elements of movement. The system provides:  automatic issuance of an alert signal based upon the results of  the assessment of the tactical situation with its subsequent  confirmation by the control panel operator; calculation of the  availability, state, loading and readiness of torpedo defense  systems and launchers to dispense decoys, and processes  recommendations for maneuvering of the surface combatant and  dispensing torpedo defense systems.    The following are depicted on the display: the mutual  location of the attacking torpedoes and the surface combatant,  the safe zone, and recommendations for maneuvering the surface  combatant; state of loading the launchers with torpedo defense  systems and the degree of readiness of the launchers and torpedo  defense systems for employment.    Rocket-propelled projectiles with three types of sonar  countermeasures systems have been developed for the Spartacus  system:    --with a load in the form of a generator of consecutive  explosive signals to suppress the sonar systems of the firing  submarine and the torpedo's remote control channel;    --with a load in the form of water-reacting substance  charges  that create a powerful camouflage gas screen of small hydrogen  bubbles between the attacking torpedo and the surface  combatant-target during the process of the reaction with water;  and,    --with a traditional electronic-acoustic load that ensures  suppression of attacking torpedoes guidance systems using  camouflage or diversion jamming.    A torpedo defense projectile is a 127 X 900-mm cylinder that  weighs up to 50 kg. Maximum firing range is 3,000 meters.    The Spartacus system utilizes 1-2 Dagaie launchers to fire  these projectiles. The onboard system consists of up to 30  rocket-propelled projectiles with different missions. Dagaie  launchers are universal and have up to 10 launch rails that  serve to launch various EW [electronic warfare] munitions,  including sonar countermeasures devices. Sagaie launch canisters  can also be adapted to fire torpedo defense projectiles.    After receiving the command to fire, the selection of  torpedo  defense projectiles is conducted for this situation and their  automatic launch is carried out. During the terminal phase of  the projectile flight trajectory, speed is reduced using a  braking parachute, the projectile enters the water and the  jamming devices begin to operate at the assigned depth. Their  functioning time is 2-3 minutes and the gas curtain operating  time is 8-10 minutes.    The Spartacus system's operating principle is depicted in  Figure 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-32A>      Figure 1. The Operating Principle of the Spartacus Torpedo Defense System. </FIG>    Thanks to modularity of design, the new torpedo defense  system can be combined with a ship's submarine defense system  and can be installed on various ships regardless of the  equipment and acoustic weapons on them.    According to Western experts, the Spartacus system, despite  the absence of torpedo destruction weapons in it, is  sufficiently effective because it is thought that the mission of  reliable detection, classification and localization of attacking  torpedoes has been successfully accomplished during its  development.    Tourville Class destroyers will be the first ships on which  they plan to install this system because these ships are  equipped with SLASM sonar systems that ensure detection of  torpedoes (a low-frequency hull-mounted acoustic system, a  medium-frequency acoustic system, and an acoustic system with  towed flexible long linear sonar antennas).    Beginning in 1995, they propose installing some components  of  the Spartacus system on seven Georges Leygues and Cassard Class  destroyers, and also on other French Navy surface combatants.    While considering the French Navy's extreme interest in  equipping the aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle with effective  torpedo defense systems, the system's developing firms have been  conducting research since October 1990 to improve the Spartacus  system for its subsequent installation on the aircraft carrier.    The foreign press has reported that the Israeli firm Rafael  Armament has completed development of the ATC-1 (ATC --  Anti-Torpedo Countermeasure) towed torpedo defense system during  the second half of the 1980's. The firm notes that this system,  thanks to its compact construction, can be installed both on the  primary classes of surface combatants and also on merchant ships.    A "decoy" weighing approximately 25 kg, 120 cm long and 30  cm  in diameter emits strong sound signals that create a false phase  front, forcing the torpedo to move in the direction of the  noise, completing in the process a series of consecutive attacks  of the emitters until the total expenditure of its power source.    They also note that, thanks to its small dimensions, the  ATC-1 does not impede the maneuvering of the ship-platform in  course and speed and its installation does not require a great  deal of area or space on the upper deck or in below decks spaces.    Since 1987, the ATC-1 torpedo defense system has been in  series production by Rafael Armament in Haifa. It is important  to note that the "decoy" was designed and tested in accordance  with the MIL-E-16400 All-European Standard in the sphere of  military electronics.    It is being reported that Sa'ar-5 class escort ships, which  are being built for the Israeli Navy in the United States, are  being equipped with ATC-1 decoys. The lead ship of this series  was transferred to the Israeli Navy in 1993.

But as  before, the West considers the conclusion of SEKAY NO KANSEN  Commentator Oh Rekhey [transliterated] to be timely... "Aren't  the colossal expenditures on the construction of surface  combatants senseless from the point of view of self-defense if  we can sink these ships without hindrance..." That is why  foreign navies are paying such serious attention to torpedo  defense as a very important element of the self-defense of  surface combatants and ships.    Today, it seems very important to painstakingly study  leading  foreign experience in the area of their effective defense from  torpedoes when a new native concept of design and construction  of surface combatants and ships is being developed.

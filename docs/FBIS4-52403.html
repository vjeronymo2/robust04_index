			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- China has advised North  Korea not to change the fuel rods at its Yongbyon reactor  without International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supervision, a  well-informed source here said Tuesday.    The Seoul government had asked Beijing to use its influence  in the matter, the source said, but North Korea's response was  not known.    Chinese Ambassador to Seoul Zhang Tingyan notified South  Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong that Beijing has  asked Pyongyang not to replace the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt  reactor in Yongbyon without IAEA supervision, the source said.    North Korea has defied IAEA demands to be present during the  refueling and to take samples of the spent rods, which could  help the agency trace Pyongyang's nuclear activities since 1987  when the reactor is believed to have started operating.    The agency has threatened to report North Korea to the UN  Security Council unless these demands are met.    Pyongyang offered May 6 to let the IAEA be present when the  fuel rods are changed but would not allow the collection of any  samples that might reveal past operations.    Vice Foreign Minister Hong asked the Chinese ambassador to  use his influence with North Korea about a week ago, the source  said.</p>

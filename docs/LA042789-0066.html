			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Sale of U.S. Shoe Collapses: U.S. Shoe Corp. said a $422.5-million deal to sell  its footwear division to an investment group headed by Merrill Lynch Capital  Partners Inc. has fallen through. The company said Merrill Lynch advised it  that certain conditions of the agreement have not been met and that it did not  intend to buy the unit on originally specified terms. It did not elaborate. The  company, a footwear, clothing and eye-care company whose brand-name shoes  include Calvin Klein and Capezio, agreed in February to the buyout, which  included the sale of its name and headquarters as part of a restructuring  designed to head off a possible hostile takeover bid.  </P></p>

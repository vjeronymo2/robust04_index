			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Federico Geremicca report: "No Fascist Ministers: Crisis </F> Between Scalfaro and European Parliament"]    [Text] Rome -- The motion was a very brief one, a mere five  typewritten lines, and was approved by a single vote. Then,  eight minutes later, came the terse reply from the president's  office -- a few very sharp words conveyed in a note from the  press office. And so, around 2130 hours [1930 GMT], the very  day when Berlusconi's approach to the government experienced a  dangerous step into the unknown, saw the explosion of a dispute  that had remained concealed for some weeks -- that of the  European Community with respect to the Italian Government that  is about to be formed. The controversy stems from two anxieties  -- concerning the presence of neofascist ministers in  Berlusconi's cabinet and the possibility that the new government  majority will adopt substantially anti-Community stances in  foreign policy.  <H5>  Socialists' Motion </H5>   These are the facts, as they happened, in rapid succession.  In Strasbourg, the seat of the European Parliament [EP], a  session was devoted to the European Council meeting scheduled  for 24-25 June in Corfu. The Socialist group -- after a series  of meetings that morning among representatives of the various  countries' socialist parties -- put the following motion to the  vote: "The European Parliament demands that the members of the  European Union make it known very clearly to the president of  the Italian Republic that his government must be loyal to the  fundamental principles that presided over the foundation of the  Community, after the horrors of fascism and Nazism."    In the afternoon vote, the motion received 189 for and 188  against. The AGI press agency did not report the news until  2129 [1929 GMT], however, but a mere eight minutes later the  president's office issued its reply (so the reply must have been  ready for some time).    The four lines expressed resentment and disdain: "Italy's  loyalty to the values and principles that lie at the root of the  European constitution is a clear and undisputed fact that  requires no reminders or teachers."    This was already a sufficiently sharp response, but the  chief  of state's aides went further, verbally: "Such a motion should  not even have been put to the vote," they explained. "It is an  unacceptable interference in another country's internal affairs.  And its tone is also unacceptable -- with regard to the  president of the Italian Republic, of course, but also with  regard to the member countries of the Community, to which the  Parliament has never been seen to address such verbs as `to  demand....'"    But in fact there was something else that has never been  seen  before last night, and that is such a sharp and direct dispute  between the European Parliament -- Europe, let us say -- and the  chief of state of a member country of the Community....    But so it was.... And it had been planned for a couple of  weeks, basically proving the fact that the return of neofascist  ministers to the government has perhaps prompted more fear  abroad than it has between Palermo and Milan.    In an evening that suddenly grew very heated, Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro was not the only one drafting replies. Carlo  Scognamiglio, the new speaker of the Senate and a Berlusconi  supporter, also issued a protest. He wrote to Egon Klepsch,  president of the European Parliament. And he did not pull his  punches: "While respecting the prerogatives of the European  Parliament, I believe that the prerogatives of national  parliaments deserve equal respect.... I express my opposition  to a position that seems to reflect an intention to ignore the  expression of the Italian people's will and the exercise of  national sovereignty.... The Italian people and their  democratically elected legislative assemblies are, and will  remain, the only judges of matters concerning national  sovereignty."  <H5>  Berlusconi: No Comment </H5>   What about Berlusconi? What did the prime minister-designate  have to say about the "war" declared on him by the European  Parliament? "No comment. I want to read the text of the motion  first," he whispered as he entered the umpteenth (and  inconclusive) majority meeting. And of course, he knew nothing  about the other "reprisals" planned by the European Socialist  group: They will vote against any decisions by the Council of  Ministers to which the "neofascists" may contribute and will  expel "any member of the group that supported Forza Italia in  the general election or that supports Berlusconi's or his  allies' lists in the coming European elections...." This is  all-out war....</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (2): Record entries for software competition - Business Software Challenge '90s 'Business Software Challenge 90s' - has attracted a record number of entries. Prizes to the value of Pounds 20,000, plus a range of hardware and software, are to be offered to the winners who will be announced in the next issue of the FT's Software At Work, in November.

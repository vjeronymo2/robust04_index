			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe Won't Go Away"] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Secretary's speech last night to the  Belgian Institute of International Affairs was billed in advance  as a hard-hitting demand for curbs on the growing powers of the  European Community. That, however, was for domestic  consumption. The audience must have been struck by the mildness  of both Mr Hurd's tone and his proposals. With the European  elections rapidly approaching, nobody should be surprised by  this apparent contradiction. The Conservatives remain as deeply  divided over Europe as they were last summer at the height of  the Maastricht debate. For reasons largely unconnected with  Europe, the party faces heavy losses in the European polls. Mr  Hurd is clearly seeking to ensure that the Tory campaign between  now and June is not also the occasion for renewed public feuding  within his own ranks.    Considering the gulf between the federalist Tory MEPs  [members of European Parliament] and the Euro-sceptics, he faces  a difficult task. The recent row over the avowedly federalist  manifesto of the European People's Party, with which the British  Conservative MEPs are allied, shows how easily the European  issue could once more blow up in the Prime Minister's face. The  Conservative leadership hopes to defuse it before June by  sticking to the lowest common denominator on all things  European, and by attacking Labour as often as possible.    This may get the Tories through the summer in one piece, but  as a long-term strategy it is inadequate. The questions and  problems of Europe will not go away. Ministers like to boast  that the rest of the Community is coming round to the British  way of thinking, but the evidence for this is thin. The  Government has already been obliged to seek succour from the  European Court to frustrate the Commission's attempt to impose a  48-hour working week, despite our Maastricht opt-out from the  Social Chapter. The 1996 conference that will review the  Maastricht treaty is only two years away. The rest of the  Community will probably use this to demand that we revive the  Exchange Rate Mechanism, pledge ourselves to an eventual common  currency, and allow more powers to be transferred to the  European Parliament.    Before long, therefore, the Conservatives will once again  have to consider these unwelcome issues. There is no doubt that  the party in general is overwhelmingly Euro-sceptic, indeed if  anything, this mood has hardened since the Maastricht debate  last year. By fudging now, ministers may put off the day when  they have to think seriously about Europe again, but they will  not be able to avoid it indefinitely.</p>

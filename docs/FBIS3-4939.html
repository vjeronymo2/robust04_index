			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 1 (YONHAP) -- A senior U.S. State  Department official has publicly expressed his desire to see  South Korea repeal its controversial National Security Law.  Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of State for East  Asian and Pacific Affairs, made the remark at a seminar on  U.S.-South Korean relations in the Pacific era, sponsored by  American University on Feb. 25. In a keynote speech, Hubbard  praised South Korea for making "heartwarming success in  establishing democracy and marked improvement on the human  rights front."    "Despite (these) successes -- or perhaps because of them --  the United States still wishes the Republic of Korea would  repeal the National Security Law," Hubbard said. Hubbard  acknowledged that friction exists between the United States and  South Korea stemming from extensive interaction between nations.  But such friction really results from the "problems of  success," he said. In any event, it was the first time that any  senior U.S. Government official has publicly expressed a desire  to see South Korea's National Security Law repealed.    The remark is attracting even more interest since it was  made  by the American representative to a recent series of  Washington-Pyongyang working-level contacts held in New York to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Contacted for  clarification on Tuesday, a State Department official confirmed  that Hubbard's remark reflects "the official position of the  U.S. Government." The official also confirmed that the U.S.  Government has been urging the Seoul government to undertake  "additional measures" to solidify "democratization" in South  Korea. The official, however, took pains to stress that  Hubbard's comment has nothing to do with the ongoing discussions  between the United States and North Korea on the nuclear and  other issues.    Officials at the South Korean Embassy in Washington admitted  that the U.S. Government has urged Seoul to improve human  rights. But they were at a loss to explain why Hubbard made  such remarks when the North Korean nuclear issue has entered a  critical stage.    Many South Korean leaders including President Kim Yong-sam  believe it is premature to repeal the National Security Law,  which was enacted to deter espionage and other hostile  activities by communists in North Korea aimed at overthrowing  the Seoul government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Syrian Vice President Zuhayr Mashariqah by </F> AL-MUSAWWAR correspondent Sana' al-Sa'id in Syria; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Sa'id] The American campaign against Syria,  which resulted recently in putting Syria on the list of states  that have failed to assist in the fight against drugs, is very  odd. Many believe that it is unfair. How do you view that  campaign?    [Mashariqah] Some elements of the campaign the U.S.  Administration launched against Syria were undoubtedly unfair.  It sought to inflict harm on Syria and its policy through  accusing it of failure to fight drugs. It also aimed to destroy  Syrian-American relations and put pressure on Syria to dissuade  it from taking the stance it is assuming on the peace process  and its fixed principles. That campaign sought also to belittle  the outcome of the Geneva summit meeting between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton and inhibit the impetus it gave to the peace  process.    The manifest fact is that Syria is making efforts in  cooperation with the Lebanese authorities to fight poppy and  other drug farming, particularly in the Lebanese area of  al-Biqa'. Syria has issued many laws to fight drugs, including  the infliction of the severest punishments on whoever farms,  manufactures, or smuggles narcotics. Syria's drug-fighting  efforts seemed very satisfying to the United Nations, as  represented in the regional committee on fighting drugs, which  selected Damascus as a venue for its 30th session. The  committee's representative saw that Syria's drug-fighting  efforts are worthy of praise.    The goal of this campaign is to put pressure on Syria and  force it to relinquish its solid stance and just issues, which  were recognized by international legitimacy, that seek to  establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. But  Syria's stance and its just claims cannot be the subject of  oneupmanship.    [Al-Sa'id] Can this campaign be viewed as a sign of pressure  on Syria, particularly since it was launched just before  Christopher's tour of the region?    [Mashariqah] Putting Syria's name on the list of states that  fail to fight drugs is merely extortion to drive it to accept  Israeli conditions in the peace process. Syria always  reiterates that it rejects extortion and will not tolerate  oneupmanship when it comes to its basic issues. There is no way  that Syria will relinquish its rights; it is determined to hold  on to basic principles concerning Arab rights and claims.  Pressure will only enhance Syria's insistence on these rights  and on defending them. All methods and pressure will not  succeed to force it off its course or make it back down on its  approach to defend Arab rights and issues. [passage omitted]</p>

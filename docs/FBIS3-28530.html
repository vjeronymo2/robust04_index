Speaking at the function, Mr Nguyen  Ngoc Tran, chairman of the Central Board for Overseas Vietnamese  said that about 180,000 Vietnamese overseas had returned to the  homeland for Tet and for investment opportunities in 1993,  compared to little more than 100,000 for the Tet of last year.    He said that their activities to contribute to national  renovation have become more and more practical and fruitful. By  the end of 1993, overseas Vietnamese had 30 projects licensed by  the Vietnamese Government capitalized at tens of millions of US  dollars. They mostly deal with electronics, chemicals, tourism,  services, agriculture, forestry, fishery and soft drinks.    They also have contributed to the transfer of modern  technology to the country in several fields. Many consultative  ideas from overseas Vietnamese have been considered valuable by  government offices in the fields of education and training,  science and technology, finance, banking tourism and  administration.    After Tet, a number of overseas Vietnamese experts will  return to the homeland to attend a conference on Vietnam's  university education renovation with their colleagues here.    According to Mr Tran, more than 2 million Vietnamese have  settled in 70 countries. There are about 1 million in the  United States, 200,000 in France, 150,000 in Canada, 130,000 in  Australia and 85,000 in Germany. Around 400,000 of them have got  university or post graduate degrees and some are holding key  positions in many branches of sciences, technology and  management.    Overseas Vietnamese remittance to their families constitutes  an important source of foreign exchange.    Total import-export turnover of companies owned by overseas  Vietnamese is estimated at around USD 4-6 million a year.    In order to broaden the overseas Vietnamaese participation  in  economic and technical development programmes in the country,  the government is preparing to establish an overseas Vietnamese  bank, a centre of training and technology transfer staffed by  overseas Vietnamese and also so form of non-governmental  consultancy mechanism of overseas Vietnamese.</p>

As Caracol reported, Friday afternoon Fidel Castro told  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin that after having  reviewed the list of participants to the Fourth Meeting of  Solidarity, watching videos of the meeting, and looking at  pictures that were taken of the event, the Cuban Government is  able to guarantee -- his word of honor at stake -- that Ivan  Marquez, Alfonso Cano, or Sincelejo Bishop Nel Beltran were not  at that meeting, much less a guerrilla summit. Fidel Castro also  denied that his government has given the Colombian Guerrilla  Coordinating Board an office so it can carry out subversive  operations in Colombia.    Caracol can also confirm that reliable sources have reported  that the alleged evidence and proof of subversive leaders  participating in the alleged Havana summit given to the  Colombian Government by the Prosecutor General's Office were  based solely on statements by a nun, who had gone to the  Prosecutor General's Office and offered her testimony. In her  statement, she says she believes she saw Nel Beltran at that  conference, that he was a person that looked very much like a  person she had met in our country.    This is too flimsy, too weak a testimony and will probably  be  considered meaningless in the next few hours once it is  established that the nun's testimony saying she saw Nel Beltran  and the guerrilla leaders in Havana is the only testimony of  that kind.    The embarrassing situation caused by EL TIEMPO will be  resolved this week and relations will not be broken. The Gaviria  administration will find President Fidel Castro's explanation  satisfactory, and that will be the end of it.</p>

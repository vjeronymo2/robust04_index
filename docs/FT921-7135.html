			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (5): Trade fairs wooed  -The West Midlands THE NATIONAL Exhibition Centre, the largest purpose-built facility in the UK for trade fairs and exhibitions, has started work on a programme of expansion. The International Convention Centre, with its symphony hall, is building up a momentum of activity after its opening last year. The National Indoor Arena, also opened last year, is finding its role in the marketplace of sporting and mass musical events. These three venues with complementary facilities are the focus of Birmingham's bid to establish itself as an international centre of business tourism and, in the process, to achieve a better balance in the regional economy of the West Midlands. Traditionally, the centre of the British engineering industry, the West Midlands has been vulnerable to the sometimes violent swings of the national economy. The development of a services sector is seen as the way to reduce that vulnerability. Although run as a private sector company at one remove from the local authority, the NEC, the ICC and the NIA are the children of the public sector and the ultimate owner of the NEC and the ICC is Birmingham City Council. Indeed, the council guarantees the loan stock issue which is financing the expansion of the NEC. Last November the NEC signed a Pounds 44m design-and-build contract with Laing Midlands for the construction of four exhibition halls as part of a Pounds 100m investment programme. The effect will be to add 30,000 square metres of display space by mid-1993 and bring the NEC's total capacity to 155,000 sq metres. The expansion will consolidate the NEC's position as the UK market leader for trade fairs and exhibitions and will keep it in the top 10 of European venues. The extra halls will provide the scope to attract some of the bigger trade fairs which hitherto have perambulated around the larger European centres. The first exhibition to use the new halls will be the International Printing Equipment Exhibition. The NEC has consistently made profits since the early 1980s. Its record year was 1989-90 when, after meeting all its financial charges, it contributed Pounds 6.65m to the general fund of Birmingham City Council. That figure nearly halved in 1990-91 when repayments of principal debt fell due. In the current year, latest figures submitted to the council show, the net surplus should be slightly higher than 1990-91 at Pounds 3.99m. Despite the recession, income has held up over the last two years at between Pounds 53m and Pounds 54.34m. But the level of bookings taken for 1992-3 suggests income of Pounds 68.7m and a net surplus of Pounds 12.23m. As, for management purposes, the NEC, ICC and NIA are run by one company, the NEC profits help to offset the planned losses at the ICC and the NIA. Convention centres traditionally have tended not to run at a profit. Rather, they act as a focus to bring spending visitors to a city and hence stimulate the local demand for services. The ICC, apart from the symphony hall, has 11 conference halls capable of seating audiences ranging from 120 to 3,000. A very big conference would be able to use the nearby NIA for plenary sessions and split up into smaller working groups at the ICC. The NIA is conceived primarily as a sports arena able to take around 10,000 spectators. The ICC and the NIA have not been in operation long enough for there to have been any marked effect on the local economy. Efforts are being made to market the facilities both in continental Europe and in the US, but, for these to succeed, it seems likely that there will have to be an expansion of the direct air links between Birmingham and other European centres and the start of transatlantic flights. The ideal for the Birmingham authorities is to have a trade exhibition taking place at the NEC, to the south of the city, with a linked conference taking place at the ICC in the city centre. This has been achieved, for example, with last November's Building Employers' Confederation Conference and the Interbuild 91 exhibition. Although, in its first six months, the ICC attracted 174 conferences, which drew in 60,000 delegates, it is still finding its place in a highly competitive market: so competitive, in fact, that subventions are provided to the organisers of the largest events. Domestically, the ICC would like to bring in events like the party political and CBI annual conferences. Recently, however, the Conservative Party decided not to confirm its booking for the 1993 conference. The ICC and the symphony hall will cost Birmingham City Council Pounds 24.57m in the current financial year and the estimated cost for 1992-93 is Pounds 27.92m. Annual operating costs are over Pounds 9m and there is a financial charge of nearly Pounds 11m, rising, in 1992-93, to Pounds 13.05m. It also has to pay charges to the council of nearly Pounds 6m a year. But the ICC's income this year will be less than Pounds 2m.</p>

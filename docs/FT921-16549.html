			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Dividend doubts Whatever the explanation, the historically minded investor might well conclude that just because bonds may be more attractive relative to equities than they were, that need not mean that they are attractive enough to buy. But perhaps equities are not particularly attractive either. The other central issue troubling the investment community at present is the outlook for dividends. By the end of the 1980s, it was clear that the proportion of UK output accounted for by corporate profits had for some years been unsustainably high. Over the past year, the question has been whether the proportion of profits paid out to shareholders has not been unsustainably high as well. It is sometimes argued that this problem is overstated, since a high proportion of the UK market is accounted for by large, non-cyclical stocks such as the privatised utilities and the pharmaceutical companies. But when boards come to set their dividends, context is all. Many of the utilities are under severe political pressure to exercise dividend restraint. The pharmaceutical companies are seeing their nominal growth rates fall steeply with inflation and through worldwide pressure on drug pricing. Neither group is likely to cut the dividends. But if cuts become fashionable elsewhere, they have plenty of incentive to be stingy.</p>

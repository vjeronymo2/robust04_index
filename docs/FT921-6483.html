			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Fear of action by Labour prompted scrapping of coal terminal FEARS that a Labour government would ban or limit coal imports to protect British Coal prompted PowerGen, the electricity generator, to seek the delay in developing Britain's biggest coal terminal which led to the unexpected cancellation of the project. The terminal, at Immingham on the Humber, would have been capable of handling 12m tonnes of foreign coal a year, threatening the jobs of miners in the Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire coalfields. Associated British Ports (ABP), which was leading the project, said it had cancelled the scheme because PowerGen had already delayed for too long. The other partner in the project was the generator National Power. PowerGen said the project's collapse opened the way for British Coal to compete with imports and offer the electricity industry cheap coal. 'In their own hands lies the future of British pits and miners' jobs,' said Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen's chief executive. He said he was surprised by ABP's 'precipitous' decision, but believed PowerGen had made the right choice in holding back until after the election. 'We took a totally commercial view. If we couldn't put coal through the terminal, we would have been wasting shareholders' money.' Labour could restrict coal imports, under the EC's coal and steel treaty which overrides other EC legislation. Mr Wallis played down the importance of the Immingham project, which he said was far less attractive to the two generators than other projects at Bristol, Liverpool, Hull and on Teesside. 'We are in a very strong position,' he said. 'We only want to burn 19m tonnes of imports, and we can already import half of that with existing projects.' PowerGen was unlikely to commit itself to another coal terminal project before the election, he said, but he insisted that it would not pay the existing premium of Pounds 20 per tonne for UK coal. If British Coal prices did not fall, it would seek alternative supplies. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said the cancellation of Immingham was encouraging for the corporation. But the UK's rush to invest in gas-fired power stations was a much more serious threat to the company than coal imports.</p>

That is the recurring theme of the reports from  Bosnia-Herzegovina carried by the majority of the media.    Clearly NATO was secretly hoping for decisive intervention  by  Russia, knowing that it would be practically impossible to end  the crisis situation around Sarajevo and the whole Balkan  conflict without its more active participation. However,  projects in diplomats' heads are one thing, real specific moves  for which statesmen have to assume responsibility toward their  own people and history are quite another.    NATO placed not just itself but the whole world in an  extreme  situation. Europe could have been faced with an unpredictable  escalation of the Bosnian war. NATO could only be saved from  itself by Russia, and Russia made that tough decision. By  persuading the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms or place them  under UN control Moscow simultaneously contrasted its own  reputation as a great world power to NATO's. A reconnaissance  group from the staff of the Russian Blue Beret battalion  stationed in Serbian Krajina plus a group from the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry headed by Colonel General Yevgeniy  Podkolzin, commander of the airborne assault troops, were  dispatched to the area of anticipated bombing. Their aim was to  guarantee the Serbian side's fulfillment of its commitments to  withdraw arms and to study all questions of a political and  organizational nature connected with the Russian contingent's  deployment, including its possible reinforcement. It should be  specially stressed that this decision does to a certain extent  run counter to Moscow's earlier ban on Russian assault troops'  carrying out the order of the UN Forces Command in former  Yugoslavia redeploying part of the force to Sarajevo. That ban  was more than justified. Moscow could not let its soldiers pay  with their lives for a NATO bombing decision which it had  nothing to do with. Here the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry made efforts to prevent NATO air strikes against  targets belonging to any side, including the Bosnian Muslims,  both through diplomatic channels and via its own line of  communications.    In a personal telephone conversation with U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry -- there had been three conversations in  all as of Monday -- Army General Pavel Grachev, the Russian  president's authorized representative, drew his American  counterpart's attention to the fact that the Bosnian Serbs were  systematically withdrawing their heavy artillery weapons 20-30  km from Sarajevo or placing them under UN control. The  withdrawal was being carried out in unfavorable weather  conditions -- abundant snow and drifts on the roads -- which  made it considerably more difficult for the Russian contingent  to move forward and take up position. Not all the provisions of  the ultimatum will perhaps have been met on schedule, but the  Serbian side's firm intention to carry it out in full renders  strikes redundant. Moreover, the Americans' attention was drawn  to the fact that Russian soldiers in a number of spots find  themselves on routes along which it was intended to carry out  missile and bomb strikes. The U.S. defense secretary was  informed of the Russian leadership's view, namely that the  Bosnian Serbs' positive decision to withdraw their forces not  only removed the question of using aircraft against the sides in  conflict but also created real prerequistes for a political  settlement of the conflict. In the Russian side's opinion, the  positive procress now under way needs joint support.    As we were informed at the Russian Defense Ministry  Information Administration, another telephone conversation will  take place between Pavel Grachev and William Perry Monday  evening, during which measures to relieve the tension  surrounding the Bosnian capital will continue to be examined.  Statements made by certain hotheads in NATO suggesting that it  was premature to abandon air strikes and calls from them to  "hold negotiations while simultaneously carrying out strikes"  causes Russia special alarm.    Telephone contacts have also been maintained at the highest  level. On Sunday, on the initiative of Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, a telephone conversation took place between him and  President Bill Clinton. As a result of that conversation a  final accord was reached on averting bombing in the light of the  efforts made by Russian diplomats and military men. The U.S.  President spoke highly of Boris Yeltsin's political initiative,  which had made it possible to reduce the acuteness of the crisis  substantially. It was confirmed during their conversation that  all decisions arising from the development of the situation  around Sarajevo will be made with UN mediation, as called for by  the Russian side.

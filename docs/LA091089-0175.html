			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to New  York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, asking him to explain the recent  confiscation of negative banners at Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> Norman Siegel, the ACLU's executive director, said that several  anti-Steinbrenner banners -- including ones repeating the newly popular chant  of "George Must Go" -- were recently confiscated by plain-clothes security men.  </P> <P> "What we have here is a selective confiscation of banners," Siegel said. "And  that concerns and disturbs us greatly. It's the kind of policy that should not  be tolerated. It's entirely inappropriate behavior in a city-owned facility,  and it represents an affront to the freedom of expression."  </P></p>

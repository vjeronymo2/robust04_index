This new regulation is being promulgated pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments, suggestions, information, or advice relative to these proposed regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be submitted on or before May 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments (six copies) should be sent to Brad Botwin, Director, Strategic Analysis Division, Office of Industrial Resource Administration, Attention: Offset Regulation Comments, room 3878, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Karen Swasey, Offsets Program Manager, Strategic Analysis Division, Office of Industrial Resource Administration, room 3878, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230.

The Act now requires that U.S. firms entering into contracts for the sale of weapons systems or defense-related items to foreign countries or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnish information regarding such sales to the Secretary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commerce (the Secretary). The Act also now requires the Secretary to establish regulations to collect this information and to protect it from public disclosure unless public disclosure is specifically authorized by the firm furnishing the information. The Act further requires the Secretary to serve as the President's executive agent in preparing an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report will include an aggregated summary of information provided to the Secretary by U.S. industry pursuant to the regulation proposed here. It will address the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. This proposed rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 5 to 60 hours per response, with an average of 10 hours, including time for reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Brad Botwin, Director, Strategic Analysis Division, Office of Industrial Resource Administration, Attention: Offset Regulation Comments, room 3878, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated that the rule will primarily affect large defense contractors that engage in offset agreements with foreign governments. Moreover, the rule is not expected to pose a burden because firms engaging in offset transactions already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must prepare periodic accounts of progress toward fulfillment of offset obligations for the foreign entity that is party to the offset agreement. The information to be collected pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations is less than that required by these foreign parties. With regard to new offset agreements entered into, the information requested is readily available and will take a minimum amount of time to assemble by the parties involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation is specifically exempt pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. (50 U.S.C. app. 2159). Further, no other law requires a notice of proposed rulemaking to be issued for this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because of the importance of the issues raised by this regulation, this rule is being issued in proposed form. Pursuant to the Act, comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. (50 U.S.C. app. 2159(b)(1)). Accordingly, the Department encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of their views.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

"A balanced and quiet approach, devoid of excessive  political  emotions" is necessary in the case, spokesman of the Foreign  Ministry Grigoriy Karasin told TASS on Wednesday.    He added that the Foreign Ministry learned about the arrest  from official information from the United States.    "It is quite natural that we have questions about the merits  of the information. Many things are to be clarified. This is a  job for corresponding special services of Russia and the United  States", Karasin said.    He added that "as far as we know, cooperation (between the  services) is being developed in such spheres as anti-terrorist  and anti-drug fight and these contacts should be used".    Ames and his wife were arrested on Monday during a joint  operation of the CIA and the FBI.</p>

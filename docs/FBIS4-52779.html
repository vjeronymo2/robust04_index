			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>   [Text] Talks with another rightist group, the Kawal ng  Sambayanang Pilipino [Soldiers of the Filipino People] (KSP),  are progressing smoothly in contrast to the talks with the  Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist Revolutionary  Alliance] (RAM).    Professor Alfredo Tadiar, government panel chairman, also  said government and the military soldiers known to be loyal to  former President Marcos have signed three drafts over the  weekend.    Meanwhile, all his panel and the RAM have done is exchange  position papers, he added.    According to a source close to the government panel, the  KSP's advantage lies in its small membership. "Being a smaller  group, it is easier for them to come into position and express  what they want during discussions," he said.    The KSP, led by Brig. Gen.Jose Maria Zumel, signed with Mr.  Tadiar's panel drafts on reform in administration of justice,  reform in the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine  National Police (PNP) and government reforms.    Mr. Tadiar said that unlike with the RAM, his panel only has  a few issues to settle with the KSP. Although there are  similarities in their talking points, many issues have been set  aside by the group in order to give way to more substantial  issues, he said.    Meanwhile, government is not making much progress with RAM  panel led by Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina.    A government negotiator who requested anonymity said all  efforts have to be exerted in order to leach RAM's working  committee members.    He also admitted that aside from exchanging position papers,  nothing else has been achieved with the military reform group.    At present, a meeting is being scheduled to discuss  electoral  reforms proposed by the RAM. The government panel already has a  response to the group's proposals, he said, but could not  arrange for a meeting. He also said the RAM has yet to submit  their formal objection to the government's attrition policy.    On a less brighter note, talks between government and the  National Democratic Front (NDF) are in peril after the  Philippine National Police refused to release captured communist  Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon and four others even as charges  filed against them have been dismissed.    In a faxed statement, Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chairperson  for international affairs and representative to the talks,  threatened to back out of talks if government "will not respect  the rights of communist Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon."    "The NDF will officially disengage from talks with the  Philippine Government and cut off communications with government  panel headed by Mr. Howard Dee, should the rights of Tiamzon and  her companions not be respected by the Ramos regime," Mr.  Jalandoni said.    Ms. Tiamzon, third in the Communist Party of the Philippines  (CPP) hierarchy, was arrested by police authorities last week  with three other ranking communist leaders and one active member.    The PNP Intelligence Command said Ms. Tiamzon has a standing  warrant of arrest for two counts of kidnapping with serious  illegal detention.    The group was also charged with illegal possession of  ammunition and violation of election gun ban which were  dismissed by a Bulacan prosecutor.    The NDF demanded the communist leaders be released  immediately in order that the moribund process be saved.    According to Chief Superintendent Jewel Canson, the arrest  of  Ms. Tiamzon and company should hasten the resumption of the  stalled talks with the Left.    Government panel chairman Howard Dee also said that with the  arrest, government and the NDF have all the reasons to sit at  the negotiating table.    But Mr. Jalandoni said the arrest will not in anyway enhance  the chances for peace. He also called for the immediate release  of Ms. Tiamzon and objected to government's plans of filing  additional charges against her based on offenses allegedly  committed during the past.</p>

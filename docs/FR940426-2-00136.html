			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that FTA's proposed acceptance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional barriers to private sector involvement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with Executive Order 12893 (January 26, 1994),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provides that ``agencies should work with State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enities to minimize legal and regulatory barriers to private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sector participation in the provision of infrastructure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities and services.'' This commenter maintains that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recision would undermine this policy. The Executive Order makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it clear, however, that encouragement of private sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, like the other principles of sound infrastructure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management, is to be implemented through efficient State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local programs. Accordingly, the Executive Order directs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies work with State and local entities to minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such institutional barriers, not to mandate that local officials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overlook them. Indeed, by stating that institutional barriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be minimized rather than ignored, the Executive Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that such barriers exist and must be taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account by local officials in determining the feasibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private sector involvement. FTA finds, therefore, that recision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its current guidance concerning institutional barriers to privatization is fully consistent with Executive Order 12893.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA finds that no data demonstrate that the current policy has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in increased private sector involvement and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current policy has curbed the ability of local communities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine which transit options best meet the needs of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community. FTA believes that this recision of the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy will restore to local transit officials the flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they need to determine to what extent privatization is feasible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the imposition of a Federal mandate that has often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disrupted the grantmaking process and jeopardized the balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between Federal and State/local requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Appeal Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The circulars provide that both recipients and MPOs should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop a process for the resolution of disputes with private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators. Private operators may appeal to FTA if they fail to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolve their disputes at the local level. Pursuant to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision, FTA has rendered administrative decisions following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an investigation of disputes. In certain of these decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the current policy, FTA has indicated that it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withhold Federal funds from grant recipients that failed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform to an FTA determination. In the Notice, FTA stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since it will be conducting regular reviews of grantees'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the planning requirements, a formal appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process leading to FTA does not appear necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters for the private sector supported a continued role by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA in the private sector complaint process. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that by proposing to do away with the appeal process, FTA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is showing that it will not enforce the statutory requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the FT Act. Another noted that of the 12 private enterprise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints brought to FTA since the current private sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy was adopted, eight were dismissed outright because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grantee had committed no procedural error, two resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remands to the grantee, and in all but one other case, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grantee's decision was upheld. This, argues the commenter, ``is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a record of heavy-handed federal interference in local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmaking.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA agrees that the appeal process has not played a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> role in furthering the private enterprise provisions of the FT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. The figures cited by this commenter reveal that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process has in fact resulted in lengthy and cumbersome delays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FTA has taken up to two years to decide certain matters) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has had little impact on the local decisionmaking process or on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level of private sector involvement. A review of FTA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records indicates that in the one case in which a grantee was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited for a violation of the private enterprise provisions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordered to reopen a certain route to private sector bids, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private operator submitted a bid to provide service on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> route.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA therefore concludes that the appeal process has been a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fruitless exercise. Periodic FTA reviews should ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grantees are in compliance with the planning requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local participation without needless Federal intrusion and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional paperwork and administrative burdens on both grantees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and FTA. FTA will therefore eliminate the appeal to FTA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, FTA notes that the agency may investigate and take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action in the case of any failure by a grantee or MPO to follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal requirements. Since private enterprise participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the planning process is mandated by ISTEA and the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metropolitan and statewide planning regulations (49 CFR part 613  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 23 CFR part 450), FTA will monitor and investigate any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparent failures by grantees and MPOs to follow the procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set out in their own local planning process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

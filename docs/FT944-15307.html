			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Management: Reaping the benefits - John Willman starts a series on public services with a success story at Camden benefits office The customer comes first' is a philosophy that most service organisations aspire to. But making it a reality in public services is a task that has de-feated many managers, particularly in inner cities where the welfare state picks up some of society's most intractable problems. Yet Camden, the north London borough with an indifferent reputation for its services and more than its fair share of social deprivation, boasts the best-run local authority benefits office in the country. The Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, last year cited the council's benefits office as a model of good practice in a study which found that only a third of councils administered benefits well. This week it received a further accolade in the form of a chartermark, one of the government's awards for good public service. Camden includes some of the most prosperous north London districts, including Hampstead and Bloomsbury. But much of the rest of the borough is run-down, inner-city estates, with almost half of all households relying on benefits to pay their rent or council tax. Last year, the office dealt with more than 56,000 claims and paid out almost Pounds 120m in benefits. 'If Camden with all its inner-city problems can deliver good quality standards, one must ask why other councils can't,' says the Audit Commission's Doug Edmonds. Much of the credit for the borough's outstanding performance goes to Bridget Cumiskey, Camden's chief benefits officer. A former bank cashier, she confesses to a 'passion for service'. 'People coming in here already have problems,' says Cumiskey. 'They are unemployed, they're pensioners dependent on benefits, they are families living on low pay. It's not our job to make those problems worse. We can be the difference between misery and helping people to feel good about themselves and beginning to solve their problems.' Camden's mission statement is to pay the correct amount of benefit, on time, and with courtesy and respect. They are principles the office organises to achieve. Applicants are seen within 15 minutes of arriving. They are interviewed in privacy and escorted back to the exit - normally within 30 minutes of arrival. Most benefit payments are processed in 14 days, with the remaining 5 per cent completed in a further five days. Success in meeting these targets means Camden has no need for the large waiting rooms that are typical of many inner-city benefits offices. Nor does it need security glass to protect its staff. The reception rarely has more than a dozen people waiting, and all interviews are conducted face to face around a table. 'If you treat people with respect and in a pleasant manner, there is no need to put up barriers,' says Cumiskey. 'If you keep customers waiting for two or three hours, it's not surprising that they get angry. 'I just won't tolerate backlogs. My job descriptions are flexible, and I can transfer staff very quickly between teams to deal with problems. Sometimes we'll use Saturday working to clear backlogs, but we also try to avoid burning staff out through institutionalised overtime.' All this has been achieved for costs lower than those at similar councils offering a far worse service. 'We save money by getting things right first time,' says Cumiskey. 'If you have delays and backlogs of work, people get desperate and telephone, write letters or come in. Staff dealing with such inquiries are not doing the job of paying the benefits.' Camden also takes care to make sure that money isn't paid out to people who shouldn't get it. The borough is ranked third in the country on fraud detection, saving more than Pounds 2m last year. Until recently, there was little incentive for councils to tackle fraud  - most of the cost of housing benefit is paid for by the government. But Cumiskey successfully helped lobby the Treasury to let local authorities keep a share of savings from fraud detection. Camden's share last year was some Pounds 260,000. There is no profound secret behind Camden's success, according to one observer. Cumiskey sets the staff clear targets and makes sure they are met. Rather than administering benefit in the traditional local authority way, she manages the office, he says. Some of that can be put down to training. During her 27 years with Camden, Cumiskey has been on several management courses. But she is clearly a born manager, who instinctively knows how to get the best out of people. Her own explanation is rather more modest. She reckons that much of what she does reflects what she saw during the 1970s as chairman of the local branch of Nalgo, the local government union: 'I dealt with managers throughout the council, and learnt very quickly how not to manage. It gave me the confidence that I knew as much as they did about management.'</p>

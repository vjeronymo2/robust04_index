			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU and Greek officials to meet over cotton frauds European Commission officials are to meet representatives of the Greek agriculture ministry next week in an effort to resolve a long-running dispute over allegations of fraud in the Greek cotton industry. The Commission is trying to persuade Greece to repay up to Ecu120m (Pounds 94m) in respect of cash handed out under the common agriculture policy to cotton farmers for crops that Brussels believes may have never existed. An official from the Greek cotton board, the semi-independent organisation that oversees payments to farmers, has commented: 'Greece accepts that fraud occurred and will pay a fine but not as much as the Commission has asked. There'll be a bargaining process.' At next week's talks in Athens, the Commission officials will discuss with the agriculture ministry the question of fines for 21 owners of cotton gins (processing plants) who are accused of colluding with growers to inflate the figures for cotton processed in 1991-92. As part of efforts by Brussels to crack down on fraud in the European Union's agriculture budget, an auditing team from the Commission is to visit gins and cotton growing areas in Greece every three months to check on cotton board procedures. It has been alleged that Greek cotton farmers inflated their production figures by up to 10 per cent in 1991-92, gaining up to Ecu50m in subsidies to which they were not entitled. The discussion over how much cash Greece should repay is linked to Commission efforts to settle disputes over the EU budget for 1991. Agricultural spending, which accounts for roughly half annual EU spending of about Ecu70bn, encompasses easily the biggest area of reported EU frauds. Commission officials believe that Greece was lax in enforcing controls over cotton payments early in the 1990s but that since then the position has improved. In particular, the Greek government introduced extra checks on purchases of processed cotton last month, when harvesting of this year's cotton crop started. As a result of favourable weather in September and October, this year's cotton harvest is forecast to reach a record 1.2m tonnes, up from just under 1m tonnes last year. The Commission has started checks on possible misuse of EU subsidies related to payments for taking beef into storage in 1992. In that year, the Commission handed out Ecu2.3bn to farmers who could not sell the meat conventionally on account of a general surplus and health scares over bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or 'mad cow disease'. Commission officials believe that up to Ecu100m of this cash may have been handed out wrongly, either because of lax checking procedures or fraud. They are planning to open discussions with member governments on this issue in the next few months. The inquiries will focus on Ireland, which received Ecu575m in beef payments in 1992. Other countries whose farmers received large sums when beef was taken off the market in that year were France, which received Ecu550m; Germany (Ecu480m); Britain (Ecu245m); and Italy (Ecu230m). In recent years, the EU's beef mountain, which reached 395,000 tonnes, worth Ecu1bn, in September 1992, has come down virtually to nothing as market conditions have stabilised.</p>

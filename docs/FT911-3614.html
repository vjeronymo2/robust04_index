Turnover fell to Pounds 12.06m (Pounds 13.12m) and the operating profit was only Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 302,000). The situation was exacerbated by higher interest charges of Pounds 481,000 (Pounds 278,000), but offset to some extent by a reduction in exceptional charges to Pounds 208,000 (Pounds 307,000). Losses per share were 3.51p (1.2p). There is no dividend (interim 1p).</p>

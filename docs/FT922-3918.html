			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: WPP faces shareholder revolt over refinancing THERE WERE signs yesterday that WPP, the marketing services group, faces an uphill struggle to persuade holders of convertible preference shares to accept the refinancing proposal announced on May 13. County NatWest, which is acting for UK institutions holding some of the 213m convertible shares, claimed that more than 38 per cent of convertible holders opposed one of the proposal's key elements, concerning the compulsory conversion to ordinary shares. County Natwest said that other institutions were also likely to oppose the scheme. Under the proposal, convertible holders would be required to convert to ordinary shares at a ratio of 0.588 - about four times the existing terms. However, in recent months securities dealers have increased trading in the convertible shares, giving the market prices of the two shares an average conversion ratio of 0.46. County NatWest said yesterday that some institutional shareholders are seeking a conversion rate closer to 1:1. WPP said its proposed conversion rate was not negotiable. The group has other options if the proposal is rejected, including the formation of a new company, which would be listed in order to raise the Pounds 150m equity. WPP is seeking an equity-debt exchange with its banks, under which the banks would subscribe to a Pounds 150m rights issue in exchange for some 25 per cent of the group's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) debt. The proposal is being considered by WPP's syndicate of 28 banks. WPP confirmed yesterday that the Bank of New York and ASLK, the Belgian bank, are seeking to sell WPP debt, at a discount, to secondary traders. BNY hopes that WPP will approve re-assigning its debt, of some Dollars 85m, to Goldman Sachs and others. However, this could jeopardise the proposal's acceptance with the rest of the syndicate. Yesterday, National Westminster, which owns County NatWest, stated to the Stock Exchange that at close of trading on June 2, it held, via County NatWest, more than 17m WPP convertible shares, giving it 6.3 per cent of voting rights. The statement came after WPP had instituted a search of its share register.</p>

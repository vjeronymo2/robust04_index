			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother Dr. Sayf Sa'il Khalid, member of the  Political Bureau and secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] Central Committee, met yesterday with representatives of  newspapers and news agencies both Arab and international who are  in Aden to cover the events and destructive war waged by the  Sanaa regime against our people in the Democratic Republic of  Yemen. During the meeting Dr. Sayf Sa'il briefed the press and  news agency correspondents on the latest developments in the  military and political situation in the Yemeni arena.    During his briefing, he said that the social and political  forces, which were organizing and pushing the war were  fossilized fundamentalists, besides some shaykh-based and  backward tribalist forces and some totalitarian bureaucratic  civilian and military leaders in the Sanaa regime. He said that  the basic objectives of these forces was not the defense of  unity but the imposition of a backward, fundamentalist,  military, totalitarian and dictatorial regime in Yemen which  would strike down everything relating to modernism, democracy,  and civilization, thus taking Yemen many steps backward. He  said that the victims of this war were the Yemeni people who had  no control over their affairs regardless of their groups or  whether they were elderly people, heroes, men or women. The war  had consumed thousands of people, destroyed the economic and  military foundations of Yemen, and destabilized the moral and  cultural ideals of the Yemeni people [passage omitted] In his  reply to a question connected with the position of the  Governorate of Aden, Dr. Sayf Sa'il said that Aden would be a  hard nut to crack and we would not allow it to fall, whatever  the price. He pointed out that great victories had been achieved  in the governorates of Shabwah, al-Dali, and Radfan and yet one  should not talk about victories in this war because the Yemeni  people were its fuel.    With regard to the position relating to the UN Security  Council decision and the mission of Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy  of the UN secretary general, Dr. Sayf Sa'il said: We welcomed  the Security Council resolution when it was issued and announced  our commitment to it. However, the other side is the one that  violates this resolution. It verbalizes its commitment to it  but on the ground it practices the opposite under the illusion  of achieving victories and imposing a fait accompli. This is  false and deceptive for those laboring under it.    In conclusion, he referred to the importance of the role of  Lakhdar Brahimi and said: We are awaiting his arrival in Aden  because the urgent task is to stop the war and later settle the  dispute through dialogue.</p>

While China's understanding  of North Korea and its aid to the latter are indispensable for  North Korea that is now beset with the nuclear issue and food  shortages, China's maintenance of its influence on North Korea  is an important card for China to play in diplomatic  negotiations with Western nations, especially the United States.  China-North Korea relations, that were once chilled by the  establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South  Korea, are now moving toward improvement because of the  coincidence of their interests and their policies on the  "nuclear" issue and the complex international situation.    At one time, North Korea went so far as to criticize China  as  a revisionist and betrayer, but their relations appear to have  normalized completely. As South Korean Ambassador to China  Whang Pyung-tae explicitly stated in Seoul on 2 February,  China-North Korea relations have improved substantially.    A visit by Whang Chang-yop, secretary of the Workers' Party  of Korea (chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Foreign  Affairs Committee) to China from mid-January to late January  illustrated their improved relations. Mr. Whang was the  highest-ranking North Korean official to visit China since  August 1993, when China and South Korea established diplomatic  relations. According to an informed source, Mr. Whang visited  China in response to President Kim Il-song's intention to  rebuild friendly relations with China.    At a meeting with Mr. Whang and his entourage, General  Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed the "friendship forged with  blood." This expression is a barometer to gauge the  friendliness of relations between the two countries and the  expression has not been used since China and South Korea  established diplomatic relations.    There are two reasons North Korea has decided to improve  relations with China. First, China has persistently opposed any  pressure or sanctions on North Korea. North Korea has no reason  to see the Chinese attitude as negative.    Second, North Korea, which has been beset with economic  stagnation and sluggish growth in food production, is in a  situation where it is badly in need of China's aid. South  Korean Ambassador Whang made it clear that "China is not asking  North Korea to pay its imports from China in foreign currency as  it has done in the past" out of consideration to North Korea.    According to the same source, North Korea is expected to  strongly ask China for food aid and it is highly possible that  President Kim Il-song and his son Secretary Kim Chong-il will  visit China this year.    As for the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear  development, China believes that North Korea has no capability  to develop nuclear weapons even if it intends to do so. China  also considers the issue a very important agenda item in  dialogue with Japan, the United States, and South Korea. It is  unclear how much influence China holds over North Korea, but it  is true that China is giving a great deal of consideration to  North Korea in an attempt to secure its influence over North  Korea. As an example, General Secretary Jiang Zemin has  decided to defer his planned visit to South Korea despite South  Korea's strong wish for his early visit.</p>

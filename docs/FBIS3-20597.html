			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ai Min (5337 3046): "State-Owned Coal Mines </F> Distressed By Artificially Lowered Prices; Government Adjustment  and Control Brings Hope of Alleviating Problem"]    [Text] Early in the morning of 14 January, I received a  letter from Guo Zhimin [6753 3112 3045] of the Urumqi Bureau of  Mining Affairs, No. 1 Coal Mining Area, Jiangou Coal Mine. In  this letter, he related the living difficulties of coal miners.  I reproduce some passages below:    "In this era of opening and reform, the domestic economy is  increasing rapidly. Through 31 December (1993), our mine has had  1,373 continuous days of safe production, our No. 1 Coal Mining  Area has had as much as 7,019 continuous days of safe  production, and in addition, we have accomplished the entire  year's assigned output 20 days ahead of schedule."    "However, in our coal mine it is hard to even pay wages, let  alone give out bonuses. In 1993, there was no one in the entire  mine who received full wages. The mine leaders decided to pay 90  percent (of their wages) to the first line workers who work  underground, 80 percent to the second line workers, while they  themselves received only 35 percent. In the mine's electronic  section, supply section, and labor service company, not only  were just 80 percent of the wages given out, they also only gave  100 people the wages of 90 people, leaving them to work out the  shortages. How are they supposed to cope with this?"    "The problem is coal's lack of value. It now costs more than  71 yuan to produce one ton of coal, while it can only be sold at  a fixed price of 67 yuan, so that producing one ton of coal  causes the mine to suffer a loss of over 4 yuan. The more coal  we produce, the greater the loss. We have heard that the prices  of steel, wood, and cement--essential goods for mining  coal--will rise in 1994, and that tax revenue will rise from  (1993's) 2.17 yuan per ton to 13.6 yuan per ton. So the cost of  producing each ton of coal will be up to 100 yuan. At that time,  we fear that we coal miners will not have enough to eat."    "Everyone knows that a coal miner's work is very hard. While  making more contributions to society, we hope that our lives  will improve year by year along with the whole nation."    That same afternoon, I took the letter to the Urumqi Bureau  of Mining Affairs, located in the city's suburbs. The leaders of  the Bureau were not there, but the person in charge of the  Planning Department was, and after reading the letter, said  frankly that, "This matter of inability to pay wages is not just  confined to the Jiangou coal mine. To some degree it exists in  every one of the Bureau's coal mines. The major cause is the  lower coal price for the State-owned coal mines. In 1993, the  average coal price for the whole bureau was only 68 yuan, while  the prices for the "three types of materials" needed for coal  mining have been going up, the cost of maintaining and replacing  coal mining facilities has risen, the level of charges by  relevant industries and departments for producing and selling  things linked to mining are also rising. These increases have  pushed the per ton cost of to more than 90 yuan. When there is a  major increase in the cost of production, while the price of  coal is fixed and cannot be raised, it is inevitable that  enterprises will suffer losses."    "It is not just our bureau: the entire coal enterprise  industry is suffering losses. In the past, there was a State  subsidy given to our State-owned key coal mines, more than 10  yuan for every ton of coal produced. With the key State-owned  coal mines from throughout Xinjiang having an output of over 4.4  million tons of coal, the amount of the subsidy got up to more  than 60 million yuan. Since 1993, the State has gradually  relaxed the price of coal and reduced the subsidy, to push  State-owned key coal mines to the market. Although these are  good measures, much depends on how they are implemented. Look,  the subsidy to our Bureau was cut by more than half, but the  price of coal hasn't be relaxed completely. In addition, default  payments are hard to get, many mine directors are very worried  at payday, and even the cleverest housewife can't cook a meal  without rice--one can't make bricks without straw." At the  Bureau's Publicity Section, I saw the "Information Extracts  Report" edited by the Bureau and issued on 7 January. The report  listed the Bureau's debit account: there was a debit of 9.32  million yuan for safe production facilities and equipment, a  debit of 19.41 million yuan for developing production, a debit  of 16.37 million yuan for construction projects, and a debit of  23.56 millon yuan for staff and workers' welfare. The  construction company attached to the Bureau was listed as in  "extreme difficulties", with 80 percent of its workers paid only  75 yuan for living expenses in 1993.    On the afternoon of the 15th, I called at the office Li  Yifan  [2621 0111 0416], Vice General Manager of the Xinjiang Coal  Shipping and Marketing Company, seeking his opinions concerning  relaxing the price of coal. He said that it is imperative to  relax the coal price in Xinjiang's State-owned key mines; this  would be an important step towards putting enterprises onto the  track of the market economy and to compete on an equal footing  with local and privately owned coal mines. The mining affairs  bureaus in Ningxia, Shanxi, Henan, and Xinjiang Hami have raised  their coal prices from 20 to 30 yuan, but nothing has been done  in the Urumqi Bureau of Mining Affairs.    "The Autonomous Region's government leaders care about  reform  in coal enterprises and the lives of coal miners." Vice General  Manager Li told me that after repeated estimates, Vice Chairmen  Wang Lequan [3769 2867 3123] and Wang Yousan [3769 2589 0005]  have approved a 30 yuan per ton rise in the price of coal, which  has brought it up to 98 yuan per ton since 1 January 1994. This  will undoubtedly be good news for the Bureau's 12,000 coal  miners."    Will the rise in coal prices affect the lives of the  Xinjiang  Autonomous Region's masses? Vice general Li's answer is, "The  whole of Xinjiang produces over 22 million tons of coal every  year. About one-tenth of this, about 2 million tons, is from the  Urumqi Bureau. It won't have too much affect on the lives of the  masses."</p>

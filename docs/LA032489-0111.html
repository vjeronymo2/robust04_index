			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP OF BLACK WORKERS AT GM BALKS AT SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> A group representing several hundred salaried black employees at General Motors  Corp. said Thursday that it will file a petition opposing a proposed $3-million  settlement of an affirmative action lawsuit.  </P> <P> The group, Concerned Black Salaried Employees, feels the terms of the  settlement are "vague and evasive" and do not address their concerns, the  group's spokesman, Napoleon Quick, said.  </P> <P> The proposed settlement of a class-action suit was reached Jan 13. It covers  10,000 current and former GM employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana between  1982 and 1986.  </P> <P> A company spokeswoman said the auto maker continues to believe that the  settlement "provides the opportunity to redress some perceived inequities and  at the same time strengthens GM's existing systems to ensure all receive  equitable treatment."  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Patricia Molloy added that GM believes that the settlement is a  "win-win situation."  </P> <P> Quick said the employee group plans to meet Monday and will present federal  Judge John Feikens with petitions and a pleading asking for a redrafting of the  settlement.  </P> <P> Feikens has yet to set a hearing in the case.  </P> <P> Quick, who is on leave from his personnel job at GM's Saginaw Steering plant in  Detroit, said the group has 48 specific objections to the settlement, involving  areas such as promotions, pay raises and benefits as well as performance  appraisals.  </P> <P> The spokesman said some group members are fearful that GM may retaliate against  workers who do not go along with the settlement.  </P> <P> "To be honest with you, people are telling me to watch out," Quick said. "We're  not doing this because we're mad. We're in a predicament we are trying to get  resolved."  </P></p>

Quoting a senior U.S. Administration official, the newspaper  said Jiang gave the word during his summit meeting with Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Also during the meeting, Jiang stressed that China does not  recognize any nuclear development on the Korean peninsula.    The Chinese president said that China would do what could be  a plus to the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issues but  never do what could be a minus to it.    As a concrete measure, Jiang promised not to increase the  present level of the shipment of Chinese petroleum, foods and  other trade items to North Korea, the paper said.    The American official reportedly added that Jiang also made  it clear that China will convey to North Korea its position that  Beijing cannot recognize military stockpiling of the foods China  supplied to North Korea.    Another U.S. official said it had been confirmed that North  Korea recently offered to China to buy with cash several million  dollars worth of diesel oil for use as tank fuel, but China  rejected it.    U.S. Administration officials said that they had received  the impression that China would not obstruct it if there arises  a situation in which the United States and other countries would  have to take a sanction against North Korea in connection with  the nuclear question.</p>

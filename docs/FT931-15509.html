			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Watchdog's assessment of coal costs attacked MR NEIL CLARKE, chairman of British Coal, yesterday took public issue with Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, accusing him of misleading the public over the cost of generating electricity from coal. In an unusual step Mr Clarke publicised a letter he sent to Prof Littlechild highlighting what he described as 'serious shortcomings' in a report on electricity prices last month. By using 'a very selective and dubious example' Prof Littlechild had created the mistaken impression that coal was an expensive way of generating electricity. In his report Prof Littlechild examined electricity pricing to determine whether the regional electricity companies were purchasing power economically. He concluded that they were, but in the process indicated that coal-based electricity contracts were the most expensive, followed by nuclear power and gas. Although Prof Littlechild's report was only a prelude to a full study to be published at the end of this month it caused a furore because it coincided with the coal review being conducted by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. In his letter yesterday Mr Clarke said that Prof Littlechild failed to compare like with like and used 'arbitrary' assumptions about the role of various fuels in meeting electricity demand. He also complained that Prof Littlechild stressed the positive features of gas without examining those of coal, and that he portrayed coal as permanently high-cost in spite of steady improvements in British Coal's productivity. Mr Clarke said examination of Prof Littlechild's findings showed that coal was competitive with other fuel sources, including coal imports, and offered advantages. He stressed doubts expressed by Prof Littlechild about whether electricity generators were passing the full benefits of lower coal prices to their customers. Mr Clarke said the press seized on a key sentence in the press release on the report which said coal contracts were the most expensive. 'I fear that the misconception about the fundamental economics of generation from coal and gas, created by misreporting of your study, has served to confuse rather than inform those making vital decisions in the coal review (who will not in general read the detailed document).' A spokesman for Prof Littlechild said officials would discuss the points raised in the letter with British Coal and they would be taken into account in the final report. British Coal's operations should be licensed to the private sector rather than be privatised, according to Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director. He said yesterday mines would be publicly owned 'but the private sector would be able to show whether it could do better'. Work started yesterday on 23 workshops and offices, costing Pounds 850,000 and funded by British Coal, at Seaham Grange industrial estate in the East Durham coalfield. The area is to lose its last two pits under the latest closure plans.</p>

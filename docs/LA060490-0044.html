			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANNIVERSARY OF TIAN AN MEN MARKED;  </P> <P> PROTEST: POLICE ESTIMATE THAT 100,000 MARCHED IN HONG KONG TO DEMONSTRATE  AGAINST BEIJING MASSACRE.  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong and other cities outside China rallied  Sunday in remembrance of those killed when Beijing's troops crushed the  pro-democracy movement a year ago.  </P> <P> "We Won't Forget June 4" and "We Are Not Scared," read banners carried by  marchers in Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.  </P> <P> Police estimated 100,000 people joined in the march, but organizers put the  figure at more than 200,000. It was the biggest rally in the British colony  since nearly 1 million people demonstrated last summer in support of China's  pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> "Only democracy can save China, and we won't back down despite pressure from  Beijing," said Szeto Wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the  Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, which staged the protest.  </P> <P> Rallies also were staged in cities across the United States and the world.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Chinese expatriates and other supporters of the pro-democracy  movement scheduled a protest outside the Chinese Consulate. Another rally at  the same site was set for today.  </P> <P> A New York City rally drew about 1,500 people.  </P> <P> In Taiwan, organizers set up an altar for victims who died when Chinese troops  moved against demonstrators in Beijing and other cities last June 3-4, killing  hundreds, perhaps thousands.  </P> <P> "The June 4 massacre was a historical wound, which we hope can be healed with  support from people in Taiwan and the mainland," said Wu Sheng-nung, chief  organizer of the demonstration in Taipei, which drew about 400 Taiwanese.  </P> <P> Demonstrators in Tokyo gathered in a park with wreaths and banners in Chinese  and Japanese saying, "Long Live Freedom and Democracy in Tian An Men Square"  and "The June 4 Massacre Is the World's Shame." About 200 Chinese, many of them  students, joined in the Tokyo demonstration.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gabriel Lewis Galindo, designated foreign minister  by president-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, has said that  Panama will study with "receptiveness" a formal U.S. proposal in  terms of maintaining certain military installations on the  Isthmus.    Lewis Galindo's declarations were made after his meeting  with  Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee. During his first visit to Washington since  he was designated, Lewis Galindo spoke extensively with several  Democrat and Republican congressmen.    Recent publications indicate official planners are  considering the possibility of maintaining U.S. air and  communications installations in Panama. When questioned on this  issue, however, the foreign minister highlighted that the  current priority is to assure the transfer of the Canal to  Panamanian control without setbacks and with the greatest  efficiency possible.    Meanwhile, at the meeting held with James Fall III, U.S.  Treasury deputy assistant secretary (Developing Nations), Lewis  Galindo assured Fall that U.S. dollars "will continue to be the  main currency used in Panama."    Today, Monday, the designated foreign minister will meet at  the White House with Anthony Lake, assistant to the President  for National Security Affairs, and tomorrow he will meet with  Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Tomorrow Galindo also  will meet with Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American  Development Bank.</p>

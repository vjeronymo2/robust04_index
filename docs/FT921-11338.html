			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The shrinking Pounds 10 note The days of the all-female Pounds 10 note are numbered. On April 29 Florence Nightingale will abandon the Queen and Brittania to make way for Charles Dickens. The Bank of England said the Victorian novelist would appear on the back of the redesigned note - smaller than the new pounds 20 note but slightly bigger than the pounds 5. There are only two conditions for gracing the back of a Bank of England bank note - to have made a significant but uncontroversial contribution to society, and to be dead. The new pounds 10 will be the third in a string of note redesigns known as series E. A smaller pounds 5 note was issued in June 1990 with George Stephenson, the railways pioneer, ousting the Duke of Wellington from the back. A year later it was the pounds 20 note, with William Shakespeare giving way to Michael Faraday, the inventor. A redesigned pounds 50 will be issued at the end of 1993, with Sir Christopher Wren being replaced by the little-known Sir John Houblon, the first governor of the Bank of England. His significant contribution might not be as obvious as the Lady with the Lamp's but, as the Bank said yesterday: 'At least he's dead.' Illustrated in descending order are notes in circulation from 1795 to 1945; 1964 to 1979 and 1975 to date. The new note will measure 7.5 cms by 14.2 cms, roughly the space taken by this story.</p>

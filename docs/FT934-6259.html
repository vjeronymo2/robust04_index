			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (9): Thrifty from the cradle up - The wooing of the small investor Belgium has the highest savings rate among European Union members. Small investors are important people on the country's investment landscape. But it is too early to see whether sweeping changes to taxation on investment revenues, agreed by the government as part of a national plan to increase growth and jobs and balance the Treasury books, will influence small investors' choices. In order to retain the support of its socialist coalition partners, the government balanced social security spending cuts by raising taxes on unearned income. Whether or not their damp, dreary climate is the reason, the average Belgian sets aside 25 per cent of his or her disposable income for a rainy day (according to the Ministry of Finance). A recent survey by the International Savings Bank Institute found Belgian thriftiness surpassed only by Japan, Switzerland and Singapore. Each Belgian citizen, the institute found, has an average of Pounds 11,222 stashed away in a bank account. The large amount of cash sloshing around in Belgium partly results from Belgian tax laws. Belgium still has one of the highest income tax levels in the EU. According to economists, Belgians like to keep their money handy, in case a larger than expected tax bill drops through the letter box. More cynically, high taxes means that tax evasion is a national sport - the guilty need to invest away from the sight of the tax inspector. A Belgian's wealth is staggering. Economists at Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, found that the average Belgian household has BFr7m (Pounds 130,OOO) invested in property and financial products - increasingly, since the early 1980s, in the latter. According to the 1991 Generale de Banque survey, 33.9 per cent of Belgian wealth was invested in property, 66 per cent in savings accounts, government bonds, life insurance and shares. The high savings rate in Belgium is one of the main reasons why, until recently, the government did not feel compelled to deal with its debt problem. In fact about 80 per cent of government's huge borrowings in Belgian francs is owned either directly via the purchase of government bonds, or indirectly through banks investing in government bonds. Belgians have been purchasing government bonds since the second world war, but before 1990 government bonds were not the obvious choice for the small investor. The products were complicated; it was difficult for individuals to understand what they were buying. So the government launched a new two-tier debt instrument system, with linear bonds for larger and institutional investors and bonds sold over the counter directly to retail clients - known as Philippe bonds after Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister, who dreamed them up. Priced at about Pounds 2,000, and announced on the radio, Philippe bonds have been very successful. Even during the Belgian franc's recent roller coaster ride on the foreign exchange markets, small investors remained loyal and held on to their bonds. 'Generally, the small investor doesn't plan to trade his or her bonds, but hangs on to them until maturity. They are not nominative, so even if an owner dies they can be passed on to children,' says Mr Jean-Daul Hologne, an economist with Banque Bruxelles Lambert. National investors are also less concerned about the effects oPounds currency fluctuations. The government's decision to increase taxes on the interest earned on bonds and fixed-term interest accounts to 13.4 per cent from 10.3 per cent, part of a package of reforms, is unlikely to dampen the Philippe bond's popularity. The amount by which to raise the tax was carefully negotiated between the banks and the government so as not to spark a capital flight to neighbouring Luxembourg, where there is no withholding tax, but at the same time to increase government revenue. The economic reforms will also have an inflation-reducing effect, by adjusting the basis on which the consumer price index is calculated, pulling out tobacco, alcohol and diesel oil from the list, adding to the bond's popularity. Another important Belgian financial instrument for the retail investor is the Sicav Capitalisation investment funds, said to total around BFr600bn. Most of the funds invest in short-term Belgian franc treasury certificates and are exempt from withholding taxes. In order to prevent a capital flow from government bonds to Sicavs, at the same time as it raised its withholding tax rates, the Belgian government also raised Sicav entrance taxes. Furthermore, it raised taxes on switching operations within the fund to 1 per cent 0.35 per cent - and the duty charged when an investor takes money out of the fund, from0.5 per cent to 0.35 per cent. 'We have a very distorted flow of funds. People pay a lot of money to the government but they are also paid a lot back in interest. The flow of funds between households and the government is too large compared to the amount of money invested in business,' explains Mr Verfaille./ Check. Who he? 'Belgians still trust the state to repay and they get a good yield from bonds. Investors, on the other hand, don't trust the Belgian stock market because of its illiquidity.' The government would like to inject more dynamism into the Belgian stock market. Despite a number of well publicised court cases involving minority shareholders in Belgium - including the legal victory of minority institutional shareholders in Wagon-Lit, the Belgian travel firm, forcing Accor, the French hotel chain, to increase its offer when it bought the company out two years ago - small investors shy from the stock market. In fact the first moves against Accor were made by a British shareholder; the Belgians followed afterwards. 'Even larger institutional investors often lack the independence to act  - as was the case with Wagons-Lit for a long time, even though the injustice was so obvious,' says Mr Pierre Nothomb, of Deminor. His consulting firm specialises in helping minority shareholders, and launched the Wagon-Lit minority shareholders' offensive. The interdependence of large investors in Belgium makes it very difficult for the small outsider. So far, no shareholders have ever taken investment funds to court in Belgium for failing to act in their interests. The proposed privatisation of Belgacom, the state-owned telephone company, next year, could give the Belgian stock market a much-needed boost, especially if it is carried out by a public share issue (as with British Telecom.) Meanwhile, in a bid to encourage investment in enterprises and help Belgian firms stay out of debt, taxes on earnings from shares were cut to the same level as taxes on interest earnings from bonds - 13.4 per cent, from 25 per cent, as part of the government's economic reforms. The move has received a mixed reaction from the experts. Belgium already has two classes of shares, one with tax privileges worth about BFr30bn, targeted at domestic shareholders - who are, say critics, are an important cause of illiquidity in the market. 'They've scored an own goal on that one,' says Mr Philip Richards, who analyses Belgian stocks for Smith New Court in London. Although the new tax rates on new issues may initially appear attractive to small investors (overseas institutional investors will not benefit from the tax reduction, because they already pay a lower amount), they will be 'inherently illiquid, and in the long run their value would be pushed down,' says Mr Richards.</p>

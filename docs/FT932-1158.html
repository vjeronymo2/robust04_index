			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Confusion reigns over unified EC trade policy: The single market NEARLY half a year into the new European single market, there is still confusion about the EC's failure to forge a unified trade policy. Take Chinese fluffy toys, for example. The European Commission wants to impose a unified quota on Chinese toys - ranging from stuffed animals to pop-guns - which would cut imports by 74 per cent. But EC toymakers are wondering why. 'We as an industry don't require protection and our question is if we don't want protection, who on earth does?' asks Mr Peter Waterman, a vice-president of Hasbro Europe, probably best-known for producing the Sindy doll. An EC-wide toy quota is part of the Commission's proposal to abolish, or harmonise, some 6,500 national restrictions on imports, many of which have existed since the Second World War. In the process, the Commission is treading on the toes of some EC industries, like the toymakers, which depend partly on imports and want a completely free market, and others, such as EC textile manufacturers, which see cheap imports as a threat and demand greater protection. Southern EC members, led by France, have further complicated the issue by linking the liberalisation of quotas to a streamlining of the use of Community trade weapons. If national protection is no longer available, they argue, then the EC must speed up the procedure for acting against unfair trade from beyond Community borders. So-called 'liberal' northern countries argue in their turn that such changes would give too much power to the Commission. With both sides dug firmly into the ideological trenches, Commission officials say the chances of making progress on the package are 'pretty low'. Surprisingly, the worst fears of Brussels officials have not been realised. At the beginning of the year, many predicted chaos at external borders, with national customs officials unsure whether to demand import licences or not, and confrontation at internal frontiers, as member states maintained controls on goods to prevent parallel imports undermining national industries. Imports from state trading countries - China, North Vietnam and North Korea  -would be hardest hit, pessimists warned. Large importers, notably Reebok and Nike, which manufacture training shoes in China, began to make contingency plans to ship their products through EC countries with no national restrictions. In practice the lifting of border controls and the weakness of the European economy seem to have come to the temporary rescue of the importers. Since January 1, member states which want to extend national quotas have sought and usually won Brussels' permission to do so, using a special procedure. Those that have not asked - Britain and the Netherlands, which extended quotas unilaterally, and Germany, which dropped them - now face court action brought by the Commission in an attempt to preserve the principle of unified EC trade policy. National restrictions were already leaky, even before the single market was officially inaugurated. The formal lifting of border controls has made national quotas even more difficult to enforce. The existence of a single market also seems to have deterred governments from seeking emergency protection against parallel imports from other EC countries. Lack of demand means non-EC exporters are working within national quotas where they exist, so EC countries have not been provoked into taking tougher action to protect markets. In the textiles sector, for example, countries exporting to the EC have promised not to disrupt 'traditional' trade patterns even when EC-wide quotas are agreed. Some exporters say that commitment, will hinder the natural evolution of the single market in textiles. But for the time being, as Mr Erik Diekmann, a vice-president of Mondial International, the buying services arm of C&amp;A, the retail chain, points out 'there has not been any great difficulty in importing (textiles), because of the depressed market'. The real problem is that the future of a unified EC trade policy is still shrouded in uncertainty. Neither the importers, nor their EC-based competitors can plan ahead with any confidence. Mr Patrick Brooks, a consultant advising Reebok, says: 'Ultimately, they can get stuff in. What they can't do is budget for a really steady import situation.' Some exporters even go so far as to blame a significant slackening in exports to the EC - in the textile sector, for example - on fear about how new single market regimes will be applied, rather than on recession. While the problem of national quotas remains unresolved, importers are aware that individual member states could start acting unilaterally to restrict imports, and disrupt the internal market. European toymakers believe they have scotched recent French attempts to hinder imports. They say the French were insisting on extensive technical documentation before allowing Chinese toys onto their market. The demand was withdrawn only after the Commission intervened. Italy wrote to the Commission in March asking for wider-ranging emergency measures to limit imports of Chinese shoes, ceramics and silks from other EC member states. The Commission's reaction was a stark warning to Italy to stick to EC rules on lifting or extending quotas. But nervous Commission officials admit that every day the rules remain unclear, the possibility of one country taking the law into its own hands grows stronger.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Westcoast Energy in CDollars 600m takeover WESTCOAST Energy of Vancouver is set to become Canada's biggest natural gas utility with its proposed CDollars 600m (USDollars 487.8m) acquisition of Ontario-based Union Energy. Westcoast yesterday unveiled an offer of CDollars 16 cash or one Westcoast share for each Union share. Union's present controlling shareholder, Union Holdings, has already agreed to tender its 60 per cent stake in the utility. The addition of Union will give Westcoast over a million customers, putting it ahead of Consumers Gas, the Toronto-based utility controlled by British Gas. Westcoast said its offer was conditional on at least two-thirds of Union's shares being tendered. It plans to acquire all remaining Union shares 'as soon as possible' after expiry of the offer. Regulatory discussions are expected to be completed within a week. The planned acquisition marks a major expansion by Westcoast into the central Canadian market. Its business is presently centred on the west coast, mainly in the form of a pipeline network which carries gas to British Columbia and several US states. Union's customers are centred in south-western Ontario close to the US border. Mr Michael Phelps, Westcoast chief executive, said yesterday that one of Union's attractions was its location at the inter-connection of several Canadian and US gas pipelines. Westcoast, which is a widely-held company, said that it had arranged a two-year bridging loan with two Canadian banks. More permanent financing for the Union acquisition is expected to come from CDollars 200m in asset sales, mainly by disposing of part of its stake in wholly-owned oil and gas producer Westcoast Petroleum. Westcoast said it also planned to issue equity 'as market conditions permit'.</p>

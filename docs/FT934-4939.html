			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead close for PNG gold project The Papua New Guinea government will issue a mining lease for the USDollars 609m Lihir Island project, where the biggest gold mine outside South Africa is to be developed, at its next cabinet meeting, probably in January, said Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG's minister of mines and petroleum, yesterday. He also held out hopes that mining could begin again at one of the world's major copper mines, on Bougainville Island, PNG, where the operator, CRA of Australia, had to withdraw in 1989 because of secessionist rebel activity. Mr Iangalio, speaking at a presentation in London by Niugini Mining, which owns 20 per cent of Lihir, said that talks this week with RTZ Corporation of the UK, which owns the other 80 per cent, had removed the last obstacles to the lease being granted. Mr Gavin Thomas, Niugini's exploration director, said site clearing and construction work would begin immediately the licence was granted. The mine, which is expected to produce 620,000 troy ounces of gold annually for the first 12 years, should pour its first precious metal in the third quarter of 1996. The PNG government is to spend Dollars 41m to take a 30 per cent stake in the project and Niugini will build its interest to 30 per cent for Dollars 48m. The three partners intend to put their interests into a new company, Lihir Gold, which will be floated on the Australian stock exchange in the third quarter of next year. Mr Geoff Loudon, Niugini's chairman, said the company had about Dollars 24m in cash and would raise the rest via a placing of 5.7m shares as soon as the mining licence was issued. This would take the stake in Niugini held by Battle Mountain Gold of the US down from 54 to just over 50 per cent. Also Niugini is selling non-core assets and this week collected more than ADollars 4m for its 12 per cent shareholding in Equatorial Mining, a small Australian company. He suggested that, after Lihir Gold was floated, RTZ would own between 24 and 30 per cent, Niugini and the PNG government between 18 and 23 per cent each, and Malaysian Mining Corporation up to 20 per cent while PNG investors, who would be given preferential treatment, would have 7 to 12 per cent. Questioned about Bougainville, Mr Iangalio said that PNG government troops now controlled 90 per cent of the island, including the copper mine site. So far the site had not been carefully inspected but it seemed that the conveyor system was still intact. He hoped the troops would soon have total control of the island and claimed that the PNG government now had the support of the local community so it would not be necessary to keep a large force there - at present 2,000 troops are on the island. Analysts suggested it would take many months to evaluate the copper mine, which is 53.6 per cent owned by CRA and was producing about 175,000 tonnes of copper a year. The mine had only about ten years of reserves left and it might not be worthwhile re-starting output, one said.</p>

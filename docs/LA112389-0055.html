			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TOPANGA CANYON ROAD PROJECT EXPECTED TO TAKE 11  MONTHS  </P> <P> Motorists can expect lengthy delays for the next 11 months on Topanga Canyon  Road between Pacific Coast Highway and Topanga as workers resurface 4.8 miles  of the highway, California Department of Transportation officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The two-lane state highway will be topped with a new asphalt and concrete  surface from the Pacific Coast Highway to half a mile north of Old Topanga  Canyon Road, which is about five miles south of the Ventura Freeway, Caltrans  spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said. About 18,000 motorists use the road each  day, most of them traveling between the San Fernando Valley and Pacific Coast  Highway, she said.  </P> <P> The project is expected to cost $1.8 million and should be completed by late  October, 1990, officials said.  </P> <P> Construction crews will reinforce the road's metal beam guardrails and  reconstruct shoulder areas and slopes next to the highway, Tiritilli said. A  highway bridge over Topanga Canyon Creek will be widened to 40 feet, she said.  </P> <P> The resurfacing will begin Dec. 6 and the bridge widening is scheduled to start  in April, she said. Construction will take place between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.  weekdays, she said.  </P> <P> During the resurfacing of short stretches of the road, one lane will remain  open and motorists will be flagged through in alternating directions, she said.  </P></p>

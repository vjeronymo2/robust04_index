			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> GAVIN FRIDAY: FATAL PASSION  </P> <P> The Virgin Prunes, Ireland's notorious gender-bending art-shock band, dissolved  just before their scheduled L.A. debut in 1986. But the group -- which has  reportedly resumed playing -- still has an estimable reputation among local  gloom-rock fans, many of whom packed Club Lingerie on Tuesday to see former  Prunes singer Gavin Friday. Instead of an electric Prune, they got a different  kind of (Oscar) Wilde thing as Friday and his collaborator, a keyboardist  called the Man Seezer, led a five-piece ensemble through the importance of  being an earnest cabaret act.  </P> <P> A chubby-faced iconoclast with pit demon eyes, Friday alternated between a  croaking whisper and a flamingo-like wail, effectively framing dramatic songs  of fatal passion and questioned faith.  </P> <P> Edith Piaf, German Expressionism, Marianne Faithfull and Jacques Brel were all  processed in the process, and a version of Brel's "Next" proved an effectively  hellish marriage of anarchic behavior and controlled art song.  </P> <P> For second-year art students, the whole George Grosz-like ambiance might seem  innovative, but this is not Paris in the '20s nor Berlin in the '30s, and the  demonstrative artifice of Friday's prophetic decadence often overshadowed any  genuine emotional impact.

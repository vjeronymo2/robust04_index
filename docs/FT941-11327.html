			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Colgate advances 11% to Dollars 122m in fourth term Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 122.1m in the fourth quarter, helped by its largest unit volume growth of the year. Earnings per share rose by 18 per cent to 78 cents with fewer shares in issue. Mr Reuben Mark, chairman and chief executive, said every operating division at home and overseas had turned in its best volume performance of the year. Worldwide unit volume rose by 7 per cent and turn-over by 4 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn. The strongest growth came from Colgate's newer markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Australia produced combined volume growth of 17 per cent and Latin America produced volume growth of 11 per cent. Hill's Pet Nutrition increased volume by 9 per cent. Colgate's mature markets did less well. In North America, volumes declined by 1 per cent from a strong performance in the comparable quarter, and in Europe volumes were only 1 per cent ahead - although this was the first quarter in 1993 to show an increase. For the full year, unit volume grew by 5 per cent and sales by 2 per cent to Dollars 7.1bn. Excluding a charge of Dollars 358.2m for accounting changes, net income advanced by 15 per cent to Dollars 548.1m and earnings per share by 16 per cent to Dollars 3.38.</p>

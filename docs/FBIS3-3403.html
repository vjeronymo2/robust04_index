			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chi Maohua (3069 5399 5363)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Shanxi is rich, as it  supplies four fifths of the coal under unified state  distribution in China.    Shanxi is also poor, as its Luliangshan region is one of  China's 18 major poor regions. Among the province's 118  counties, cities, and districts, 14 are national-class and 36  are provincial-class poor counties. This is a harsh reality  that Shanxi must face during the course of development.    Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee  and NPC deputy, discussed the topic and talked a great deal  about new options for future development.    Hu Fuguo said: We have made proper readjustments of the  province's development strategy. It can be summed up into eight  words, "coal excavation, electricity generation, road  construction, water diversion."    Hu Fuguo said: Shanxi is a major energy source province.  Our strategy for developing the energy industry is to enter the  market, reduce bottleneck restrictions, engage in a fairly  large-scale operation, make rational exploitation, do intensive  processing, and advance toward the world market. In accordance  with this strategy, Shanxi basically accelerated its  construction of energy and chemical industry bases last year.    On the strategy of emphasizing both coal and electric power,  Hu Fuguo said: Shanxi will take advantage of its coal to  develop the electric power industry. With the State Planning  Commission's approval, we recently started the construction of  Yangchuan No. 2 Power Plant and the Liulin Power Plant, bringing  the total capacity of power generating projects under  construction in Shanxi up to 3.6 million kw. At the same time,  the Yangcheng Power Plant will be built with imported technology  and equipment and with funds from outside the province. During  the first stage of its construction, generators with a total of  2.1 million kw capacity will be installed. The preparatory work  for its construction is being stepped up. After completion, it  will supply electric power exclusively to Jiangsu Province.  Feasibility reports on building power plants in Hequ, Wangqu,  and Hejin have been prepared. Shanxi's thermoelectric power  generating capacity will double by the end of the century.    Hu Fuguo said: The construction of roads and water diversion  projects is in full swing in the province. The Taiyuan-Yulin  first- class highway has been completed and is open to traffic.  The construction of two express highways and three second-class  highways has started in an all-around way. By 1997, Shanxi's  highways will be able to transport annually more than 100  million tonnes of goods out of the province. The construction  of the Wanjiazhai project for drawing water from the Huanghe has  started. After completion, the project will solve Shanxi's  water shortage problem once for all. The Taiyuan airport and  railroad are under renovation.    On the province's abundant coal resources, Hu Fuguo said: It  will not do without excavating coal, but coal excavation alone  cannot solve all our problems. The establishment of a socialist  market economic structure has created a development opportunity  for an energy-rich province like Shanxi. Complete decontrol of  coal prices will help rationalize Shanxi's coal management  system and create new opportunities for Shanxi's enterprises to  accumulate capital funds and develop themselves. The  establishment and development of the production-factor market  will make it possible to market electricity as a commodity and  will enable us to realize the strategy of emphasizing both coal  and electric power industries. Shanxi's electric power  development will enter a golden age. So long as we seize the  development opportunity, new progress will be made in Shanxi's  economic construction.</p>

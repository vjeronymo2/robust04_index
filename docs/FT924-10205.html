			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / The irresistible logic of change The US seems to face a fateful choice. At 68, President George Bush looks too old to lead the nation in a radically new direction. His campaign pledges often sound like feeble echoes from the 1980s. Governor Bill Clinton, nearly a quarter of a century his junior, vibrates at a different frequency. As a baby-boomer, he speaks without embarrassment about Aids and homosexuality. He understands the changed social and economic role of women and minorities. He knows that the US economy must adapt if it is to prosper in a more competitive world. Like John F Kennedy in 1960, he seems to stand for the future rather than the past. The contrast between the two men is stark, but it can also be overstated. A victorious Mr Clinton will face the same budgetary pressures as Mr Bush; he will have no magic wand with which to wave away social and economic problems. It will not be a sudden transition from darkness to light, night to day, as some Democrats fondly imagine. The president is commander in chief, but his ability to fight poverty, crime and other social evils is strictly limited, as Lyndon Johnson discovered in the 1960s. If Mr Bush defies the pollsters, his second term need not be a disappointing rerun of his first. Circumstances have changed; the economy has been stagnant for three years; the cold war is over: attention will thus shift to domestic challenges whoever occupies the Oval Office. Contrary to expectations even 18 months ago, issues such as healthcare and education have counted in this campaign. And the Republicans, belatedly, have begun to assemble an agenda for domestic reform. After a narrow victory, even Mr Bush would surely realise a return to business as usual was not possible. He has seen the voters' anger. Adversarial politics tend to exaggerate party divisions. But there are many similarities in the two candidates' plans because both are drawing on a body of progressive policy research, dating from the late 1980s, that bridges traditional liberal/conservative divisions. Mr Clinton is a past chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a body that has held a joint conference with the Heritage Foundation, a supposed bastion of conservatism. As governor of Arkansas Mr Clinton has helped formulate domestic policies subsequently endorsed by Republican administrations. 'Dear Bill . . . well done, oh so well done. You were a joy to work with on the summit and all our folks felt that way.' This was Mr Bush, writing to Mr Clinton in 1989 to thank him for his help in developing the National Education Goals that subsequently formed the foundation of Mr Bush's America 2000 education initiative. Like the president, Mr Clinton favours moves towards a national curriculum and national testing, supports experimental schools and advocates greater choice and competition within the public sector. Privately Mr Clinton has even shown interest in conservative plans to extend choice to the private sector by allowing parents to use public funds to pay part of the costs of private education. There are differences on healthcare. Mr Bush wants to expand access by offering poor families tax credits to help pay for insurance premiums, while Mr Clinton favours rules requiring employers to offer insurance or contribute to the cost of expanded public sector schemes. But both men urge reforms of the private health insurance industry and both advocate 'managed competition' as a means of controlling costs and improving efficiency. In practice both will work to adapt the present system. On welfare, Mr Clinton has spent nearly a decade experimenting with forms of 'workfare' that make handouts conditional on claimants' willingness to accept jobs or training. He helped write the Family Support Act which enshrines similar principles and which President Reagan signed into law in 1988. There are strong similarities even on economic policy. Neither candidate favours tough action on the deficit. Contrary to his rhetoric Mr Bush increased spending a lot and taxes a little - exactly the policy mix expected of Mr Clinton. Mr Bush is spending more on infrastructure and recently climbed on the training bandwagon, promising a Dollars 10bn programme to hone workers' skills if re-elected. Republicans have even begun to edge towards an industrial policy, recognising the role government can play in promoting 'critical technologies'. Contrary to appearances, the issue in this election is less the direction of change, than the speed of change and the skill with which it is managed. In these respects, Mr Clinton carries greater conviction. The Democrat is both more able and more familiar with the issues. He believes passionately in government and is likely to assemble an administration of greater talent than any since the Kennedy era - many of America's brightest academics, for instance, are queueing up for jobs. As a long-serving governor, he understands state government from the inside, and it is the states that in practice will be responsible for many of the domestic reforms. Finally, he is more likely than Mr Bush to develop a constructive relationship with a Democratic Congress - making effective government more likely. If, as expected, Mr Clinton wins, it will be because he is perceived as the better manager of change.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / German competitiveness surviving a bruising THE COMPETITIVENESS of Germany's exporters, as well as the stability of its government, has been dented by the rise in wage inflation following German unification. But German will need a few more years of high pay settlements before the relative gains in competitiveness of the last few years are whittled away. German unit labour costs are now rising faster than those of its main European competitors, as the right-hand charts shows. With exchange rates now fixed in the European exchange rate mechanism, higher growth of unit labour costs - the wage cost per unit of output produced - feeds directly to lost export competitiveness. But this rise in German pay inflation represents only a small erosion of the relative competitiveness gains made by German industry over the past five years. The rise in German unit labour costs since 1987 is still lower than that of France, Italy and the UK. German wage earnings have grown faster than those in France since 1987, the date of the last important realignments within the ERM. But German's superior productity growth record has meant that its unit labour costs, have lagged behind those paid by French industry. Both the UK and Italy have had faster earnings and unit labour cost inflation since 1987. But German unit labour costs have been catching up rapidly since German monetary unification in July 1990. In part, the rise in German wage inflation results from the economic consequences of German unification. The rise in consumer spending by east Germans following the fall of the Berlin wall - and funded largely by hand-outs from the western government - sparked a consumer boom. But this rise in west German wage inflation was, and remains, unsustainable. The Bundesbank has responded to rising inflationary pressures by pushing up interest rates across Europe; and the government, faced with a ballooning fiscal deficit, has pushing up income taxes. The recent crop of wage demands, and ensuing strikes, is the direct manifestation of the refusal of west German workers to accept a fall in their after-tax incomes. But the wage acceleration also results from pre-unification tensions. The latter half of the 1980s was a period of unusual wage restraint in west Germany. In return for a drop in working hours, the unions agreed to moderate their wage demands. With hindsight, the unions underestimated the cost of the fall in working hours. As a result the share of national income distributed to labour, as opposed to capital, fell to levels not seen since the early 1970s. The strikes partly result from their attempts to claw back their share. But if recent pay trends are worrying for German exporters, they are disastrous for those in the UK and Italy. Despite Germany's boom, and slow or zero growth elsewhere in Europe, UK and Italian wage inflation remains higher than in Germany. Unless wage inflation in these countries falls soon, their competitiveness will quickly start to deteriorate again once productivity growth returns to trend.</p>

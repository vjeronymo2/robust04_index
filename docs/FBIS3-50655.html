			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Profiles of 1995"] </F>   [Text] The race for the presidency of the Republic has  begun, although it appears to be a timid start, if we look to  the public statements of the possible candidates. But if we had  access to the intimate thoughts of each of the possible  presidential candidates, it is certain that we would find a  rather mature decision.    What stage has the battle for the 1995 presidency reached?  The first certainty is that there are only 16 months left before  the election date. The second fact, and this is perhaps the  decisive one, is that the results of the referendum have not  only altered the political map, but also seem to have mobilized  the presidential ambitions of various individuals.    The scenario has certainly become more complicated, because  the opposition to the government has become bolder. But it is  also a fact that in Fujimori's party sector, more than one  hopeful has emerged. Up until the date of the referendum, it was  possible to foresee the launching of a single candidate by the  entire opposition as the only proper card to play to defeat the  current chief of state. Today the opposition appears to believe  it is even strong enough to be spared the need to agree on a  single alternative. But not only that. Now the possibility of a  Fujimori party without Fujimori is developing more broadly than  could have been imagined just a few short weeks ago.    Given this context, it is of interest to attempt to profile  the first individuals to enter the field--Ricardo Belmont (RBC),  Daniel Estrada, and Hernando de Soto.    Ricardo Belmont has already had a skirmish with Government  Palace. It occurred last August, and the truth is, according to  the surveys taken then and despite the limited attendance at the  meeting convoked in Manco Capac Square in connection with what  had happened, he did not do badly in his clash with the  executive branch.    The IMASEN undertook a survey during those weeks that it we  would do well to recall. To begin with, a very high 70 percent  of the population of Lima admitted having "knowledge of the  conflict between Ricardo Belmont and the president of the  Republic." A substantial 53 percent believed that the government  was failing to provide Belmont with the resources needed for the  administration of his department. And further still, about 27  percent were convinced that the government was not giving the  mayor the needed resources "because Belmont might be successful  as a candidate for the presidency." Not even water could be  clearer. And it should be no surprise that "Hermanon" has very  carefully evaluated the positive results of these encounters  with Engineer Fujimori (AFF).    However, in that same month, the IMASEN compared AFF and RBC  as presidential candidates. The former won out, with 58.7  percent as compared to the 20.8 percent for the mayor of Lima.  Now "El Colorao" may be thinking that the referendum has  broadened his space and that the months still remaining before  the electoral date may favor him even further. This man always  "thinks positive."    But in the most recent issue of IMASEN CONFIDENCIAL  (November  1993), the administration of the mayor of Lima received good  marks--an approval rating of 61.4 percent as compared to a  rejection rating of 31 percent. (This survey was taken  exclusively in Lima.)    The conclusion reached by this same survey organization is  that Belmont is maintaining his position, and that his approval  rate is improving in the lowest stratum and declining in the  middle-upper strata. This means, of course, that he would be a  candidate who would for the most part eat into a portion of the  same social strata as the current incumbent in Government Palace.    However, Belmont's possible candidacy raises several  questions. Thus far it has been a phenomenon limited to Lima  (although it is true that he enjoys broad acceptance in the  poorer sectors). He has not, therefore, had an opportunity to  assess how well he would be accepted in the country's provinces,  which are today so sensitive to the centralism in Lima.    Another matter of concern regarding Belmont is his habit of  improvising. A few days ago, he made the statement during a  political program that a political platform for governing should  be drafted by technicians, who could readily be hired on  contract. This statement, of course, reminds us of one made by  Luis Bedoya Reyes some decades ago now.    All of this seems to the mayor of Lima to be a matter of  image and "projects." As for the rest, as he says, it would be  up to the technicians hired. All of which is, naturally, highly  debatable, when it comes to managing a city like Lima, and to an  even greater extent, when one is trying to administer a country.    This characteristic, which has heretofore been a part of  RBC's charismatic "spontaneity," might be a highly vulnerable  point when he is compared with other candidates who appear more  solid and combine proposals with image. He has, moreover,  revealed this more dangerous side when, for example, candidates  lacking any prior knowledge about or evaluation for their  positions have been chosen. There have been such flagrant  instances as those involving Jorge Vasquez, in Villa El  Salvador; and Jose Rubio, in San Martin de Porres.    A few months ago, Belmont said that he would not run as a  candidate for the presidency. And that he was not very  comfortable in a tie, or in a suit, either, while men like  Carlos Bolona could indeed wear them much more naturally. The  allusion could not be clearer. If the candidate was the issue,  he already had his own. The former minister of economy favored  him, and very nearly put his name forward. What has changed  between that time and the present? Perhaps it is that Fujimori  no longer seems to Belmont as monolithic as before, and that his  second municipal experience has convinced him that he is now  ready to play in the first division.    One could also surmise that Belmont's affinity for Bolona  has  not dwindled, that he is teamed with "Car'e bebe," and that they  might well join together on a single "super-Lima" platform.    But what does Belmont offer that differentiates him from  Fujimori? RBC maintained a notable level of agreement with  Government Palace until he ran for office a second time at the  beginning of this year. It will readily be remembered that when  Pablo Gutierrez, the candidate of the government party for the  position of mayor of Lima, was headed downhill, AFF could find  no better alternative than to throw his support to RBC. It is  also a fact that in this instance, Belmont was very cautious,  and made it clear that no one owed anybody anything, and that he  had won thanks to his own efforts. But the internal coup of 5  April and many of Fujimori's measures had already won the  support of the municipality.    Belmont then is the man who might say he offers as an  alternative a Fujimori movement without Fujimori, probably in an  attempt to show that the difference he would make has to do with  respect for the autonomy of the institutions. The difference  would be, then, more one of style and communication methods than  one of political proposals.    Would the business community in Lima support a candidacy  like  that of Belmont? This remains to be seen. It will depend on how  much strength he gains in the coming months, and what he can  offer the businessmen. The mayor's ambitious program for  rebuilding historic Lima will not, of course, be enough.    Another candidate who has practically joined the race is  Daniel Estrada. The mayor of Cusco is up to a point the  anti-image of Belmont. Perhaps it is not, therefore, without  reason that his anticentralist ideas are identified, under some  circumstances, with an anti-Lima attitude.    As is obvious, Estrada wants to garner the provincial votes,  and he recently spoke of the need to achieve a major pact  involving various regional sectors in order to defeat the  central power. The results of the recent elections give him a  basis for this venture, particularly since that, precisely, is  Fujimori's weak point.    Estrada's credentials are based on his successful municipal  administration record in the city of Cusco, and he intends to  increase his appeal with his anticentralist proposals, now  combined with a plan, debatable in the eyes of many, for a  federal Peruvian state. However, his current strength may also  prove to be a hindrance to his broader national acceptance.    Estrada is not like any other anticentralist leader, since  he  insists on emphasizing the heritage and representation of the  ancestral Cusco. The question arises as to how he would  integrate this particular characteristic with a national debate  and plan that would not only include the other regions, which  are so dissimilar and so "regionalistic," but also Lima itself,  with its highly diverse population.    On the other hand, could the interregional pact he so much  desires be achieved? The first obstacle is the difficulty of  obtaining the support of the other regional leaders who have  party affiliations, like Jose Murgia, of Trujillo, or whose  representation is clearly local, with roots more in the coastal  population than the Incas, such as Tito Chocano, the mayor of  Tacna.    It must also be remembered that Estrada makes no secret of a  style that is sometimes authoritarian. During a recent  television appearance, he justified the events of 5 April and  criticized the old parliament harshly. His only criticism of  Fujimori's authoritarianism was that it was too cold and  "robot-like."    It is difficult to imagine what the mayor of Cusco would do  if he were installed in Government Palace. There can be no doubt  that an anticentralist policy would be promoted at full speed,  but what is unknown is what his institutional administration  would be like, and what his relations would be, with the  parliament, with the political parties, and with the Armed  Forces, for example. The same can be said about his economic  policy. The unknown factors predominate, but there are still  several months remaining in which they could be clarified.    Carlos Bolona (CBB) is another individual who is making  incursions in the party sector. It is said that there is one  group of businessmen who have confidence in him, and that these  individuals are prepared to play him as their card in the hope  of replacing Fujimori.    Bolona has established his institute, and he issues rather  regular opinions on current political subjects. The profile of  his possible candidacy is for the time being less clearly drawn  that of the others. But his interest in the presidency has been  more or less obvious for some time now.    The leading credential CBB has to offer is his  administration  as head of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This action,  which won applause in one sector, provoked criticism in another.  As a result, it is quite probable that if Bolona should in the  end be persuaded to launch his candidacy, he would have to  broaden his base of support. He would need a good running  mate--perhaps one of provincial origin, and a "marketing  campaign" to modify his very capital-oriented image and his  apparent extreme closeness with wealthy business sectors.    The support of General Jaime Salinas Sedo's precandidacy by  Javier Valle Riestra and Gustavo Mohme represents the initial  effort to clarify the image of the most obvious opposition  candidate today. Salinas Sedo could be the "more combative"  candidate Fernando Belaunde is demanding to oppose Fujimori.    Without a doubt, his candidacy represents the polarization  of  the government and the current high military commanders. There  are basically two obstacles for Salinas Sedo at the present. One  is winning over the more centrist sectors that are less radical  in their opposition to the government, and the other is  overcoming the problems of a legal nature that could be put  forward formally to block his candidacy.  <H5>  "Get Ready, Get Set" </H5>   Hernando de Soto also seems to be adjusting his stance at  the  starting line. Last week, he made public his proposed  constitutional reform by popular initiative. This week he  announced that next Tuesday, the Freedom and Democracy Institute  (ILD) and the popular institutions supporting his proposal will  launch a campaign to obtain the 35,000 signatures the new  constitution requires in order for the Congress to consider the  possibility of amendment.    Last week he also paid a visit to the premises of the CUAVES  [Urban Self-Management Community of Villa El Salvador], and the  National Agrarian Confederation published a statement praising  the ILD initiative. On the day of the press conference at which  the reform proposal was announced, the presence of some  well-known peasant leaders who were active for years in the  leftist sector, such as Marcial Quintana and Jorge Arevalo from  Piura, was notable.    The organization of a meeting of 400 delegates representing  the social organizations throughout the country scheduled to be  held on 18 and 19 December to rally support for the reform  proposal set forth seems to be the last step in this first stage  of preparations for the probable candidacy of De Soto.    And so his electoral strategy would begin with advocacy of a  great concerted union among the representatives of all the  sectors of society. As an alternative to a concertation based  principally on interparty agreement, the president of the ILD  proposes a union supported by the base-level movements.    A careful consideration of their proposals reveals that  neither Belmont, nor Estrada, nor De Soto is urging an agreement  achieved mainly by the parties, although De Soto may perhaps be  the individual most desirous of clarifying his disagreement with  the so-called "partidocracy."    De Soto's proposal combines economic liberalism and  democratization of the state. In a way, it is another version of  a Fujimori platform without Fujimori. The president of the ILD  not only collaborated with the present chief of state during a  certain period, but has also given explicit support to the  government's economic policy. In this realm, De Soto has let  slip some criticisms of government improvisation. He has, for  example, expressed his annoyance at the lack of serious effort  to promote projects such as substitution for the coca leaf as a  crop. However, he has endorsed the central aspects of the  program.    The basic disagreement with the current regime he is  attempting to demonstrate has to do with the democratization of  the state. In this connection, his proposal for constitutional  reform calls for the establishment of closer links between  society and the political regime.    The challenges facing his possible candidacy begin with the  need to ensure that his image "catches on" with the national  electorate. Unlike Belmont and Estrada, De Soto has not run for  political office previously. He does not, therefore, have a  reference point on the basis of which he can project his image  as a government leader.    One unknown factor is how his liberal economic proposal will  sit with the middle and small businessmen's portion of the  national business sector, so as to avoid its ending up as a  simple neomercantilists' adjunct--a dilemma the Fujimori  government is definitely faced with at present, whatever one's  view of it may be.  <H5>  A Hibernating Candidate </H5>   Perez de Cuellar (JPC) is in a state of hibernation, but he  has not by any means vanished as a possible candidate. According  to the most recent surveys on the subject, JPC is the individual  who appears to be in the best position to challenge AFF for the  presidency in 1995.    In addition to that, the opposition parties in the CCD have  given him their support, and he may very well be endorsed by the  sectors that voted "yes" in the recent referendum but have lost  confidence in Fujimori. JPC's great difficulty is that he has  made a great consensus a prerequisite, and it appears that  achieving this will be very difficult.    Perez de Cuellar has confirmed that he will visit Peru in  the  middle of December. He will be here for some weeks, and will  utilize the opportunity to test the air.    During his earlier visit, he met with leading personalities  who wanted him to run for the presidency. This meeting took  place at the home of the painter Fernando de Szyszlo. It is not  known if he will attend similar meetings this time.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (13): Real and symbolic concessions - Islam 'RIGHT - We're Moslems' declare the stickers on car rear windows in Jakarta, in a sort of Islamic counterpoint to the 'Honk for Jesus' message seen on the highways of America. Two statements are commonly made about Islam in south-east Asia. The first is that Indonesia has the largest Moslem population in the world, with 90 per cent of its 183m people professing the Islamic faith; the second is that the Islam practised in Indonesia and Malaysia is much milder than the Middle Eastern brand. Both statements are broadly true, but they gloss over the great diversity of Indonesian and Malaysian Islam, a diversity which encompasses radical as well as moderate and mystical tendencies. Only this month Mr Abdul Fatah Wiranagapati, a 69-year-old Moslem fundamentalist linked to a separatist movement in the northern Indonesian province of Aceh, was sentenced to eight years in jail for attempting to set up an independent Islamic state. Aceh's mosques overflow with worshippers each Friday, the Moslem holy day, and resentment of the central government in Jakarta has helped to fuel Islamic fundamentalism. In the nearby Malaysian state of Kelantan, the Parti Islam is attempting to introduce Islamic criminal law in defiance of the central government's view that such a move is unacceptable in a multiracial and multi-religious society. On the main Indonesian island of Java, Moslems opposed to gambling recently protested against the introduction of a lottery. Last month saw the opening of the country's first Islamic bank, Bank Muamalat Indonesia. The rise of Islamic consciousness over the past decade - more and more women wear Islamic scarves, for example - has prompted President Suharto and his supporters to emphasise the country's Moslem identity and to make several real and symbolic concessions to Moslem groups. President Suharto encouraged the formation two years ago of the All-Indonesia Association of Moslem Intellectuals (ICMI) to bring together loyalist Moslems under the leadership of Mr B J Habibie, the minister responsible for research and technology. Last year, Mr Suharto and his wife undertook their first pilgrimage to Mecca, earning him the title 'Haji' (one who has been on the Haj) and the honorary first name 'Mohammed'. He was also a supporter of the new Islamic bank. The complex forces of Islam are evidently regarded as a useful counterweight to the military establishment and the extent to which the authorities are guilty of political opportunism has now become a matter of public debate. A mass prayer in April for President Suharto's re-election became so controversial after the event - particularly when a number of Islamic groups said to have given their support to the prayer denied involvement - that the president was forced to distance himself from the organisers of the rally. 'The president relies more and more on the Islamic movement,' says Mr Abdurrahman Wahid, moderate leader of the country's largest Moslem organisation, the Nahdhatul Ulama (NU). 'But the problem now is that when a rift takes place between the president and the armed forces then those people who would like to formalise Islam in state life try to manipulate the gap to make the president dependent on them. This is the sorry state we are now in. . . I'm concerned that this kind of manipulation will encourage the fundamentalists to come up.' Mr Suharto is well aware of the dangers of the somewhat unpredictable Islamic card that he has played in the recent election campaign. He deliberately emasculated political Islam after the overthrow of President Sukarno in 1965, forcing all the Moslem parties into the new United Development Party (PPP) and framing the non-confessional official political philosophy of 'Pancasila'. More recently, Mr Suharto's 'New Order' government has discouraged Indonesians from studying in countries such as Saudi Arabia where they might absorb extremist Islamic ideas. Students say they have been told that there are good Islamic studies courses in the US and Canada as well as in the Middle East. 'The New Order de-politicises Islam and de-Islamises politics,' says Mr Wahid, whose NU organisation is thought to have some 35m supporters. 'But at the same time the government needs legitimacy from Islamic groups for its programmes - like family planning for example.' The moderate, mystical strain in Indonesian Islam remains strong. Islam was brought to Indonesia by traders from Arabia and Persia from around the 14th century, and orthodox Moslems, known as 'santri', are numerous on the coasts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and Kalimantan. In Java, however, many of the poor are classed as 'abangan', Moslems whose beliefs are mingled with pre-Islamic Javanese mysticism as well as Hinduism and Buddhism. Leaders of the Islamic Association of University Students (HMI) - which took over the gloomy Jakarta offices of the banned communist party - reject the violent style of Iranian or Afghan Islam and say they do not even mind about the lottery. 'We want to become Moslems of intellect and professionalism,' says Ms Lena Mariana Mukti. 'We are very tolerant. Our relations are very close with other religious groups. For example after the Dili incident (when Indonesian troops shot dead at least 50 pro-independence demonstrators at a funeral in predominantly Christian East Timor) we went to demonstrate in the street.' Mr Wahid reckons there is a core of only about 5,000 active Islamic fundamentalists in the country, but he is under pressure from radicals within his own organisation to take a stronger stand for Islam, and profoundly concerned about Saudi-funded efforts to confront the supposed 'Christianisation' of society, an issue he regards as dangerously divisive. 'I was surprised one day when my eight-year-old daughter said she was on the same bench as a Christian girl at school,' he said. 'Eight years old and already talking about things in religious terms] It's not healthy for Indonesia. . . Ten years ago there was no word of 'Christianisation' in the mosques; now there's plenty.' Mr Wahid distinguished himself as a Moslem by defending Mr Salman Rushdie's right to free speech after Ayatollah Khomeini had condemned the British writer to death for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses. He believes that Islam should be a democratising rather than an anti-democratic force and, in the face of harassment from the authorities, he chairs the Forum for Democracy group. 'I saw the hanging of Jews in Baghdad in 1969 - 14 of them,' he says. 'That's when I decided to go for democracy. . . We don't want to divide people into Moslems and second-class citizens. What happens in Iran now, or Saudi Arabia? Non-Moslems have no rights at all. 'As long as we're given the right to explain the human side of Islam, then I'm convinced that Indonesians will always be moderate Moslems,' he says.</p>

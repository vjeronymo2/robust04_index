			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDIANA GIRL LOSES HAND IN BOMB BLAST  </P> <P> Surgeons failed in their attempt today to reattach the left hand of a  5-year-old girl maimed by a pipe bomb at a K mart department store, while  investigators sought a group of young men for questioning in the blast.  </P> <P> Erin Bower, who suffered eye damage and lost four fingers and part of her palm  when she touched the pressure-sensitive bomb about 7:50 p.m. Monday, was in  serious but stable condition at Methodist Hospital today after surgery.  </P> <P> The hand was recovered by paramedics at the store about an hour after the  blast, packed in ice and rushed to the hospital. However, doctors said the limb  had been separated too long for a successful attempt at reattachment,  </P> <P> The explosion occurred as Erin was walking through the store with her parents  and 1-year-old sister.  </P> <P> The bomb, which needed only a slight touch to be set off, was hidden in a box  of trash bags and placed on a shelf in the hardware and housewares section of  the store. Sheriff's detective Sgt. Mike Kouns said four or five young men were  being sought for questioning. Witnesses said the men left the store right after  the explosion and appeared unconcerned about the incident.  </P></p>

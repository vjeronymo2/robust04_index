			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Hanson silent over bid battle for RHM LORD HANSON is expected to indicate early this week if he plans to trump the Tomkins conglomerate's Pounds 935m recommended offer for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK milling, baking and grocery products group, which topped his hostile bid by Pounds 145m. The head of the Anglo-US conglomerate maintained silence at the weekend amid rumours that Barclays de Zoete Wedd had problems with underwriting the Tomkins offer. Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, said last week underwriting of the Pounds 653m one-for-two rights issue, with which Tomkins is partially funding the bid, had gone well. However, Gartmore, with 4.4 per cent of Tomkins' shares, declined to participate in the underwriting. This sparked suggestions Tomkins had been forced to pull out all the stops to find backing for the bid at the current price. Mr Hutchings has put his former boss in a tight spot. Lord Hanson has to weigh up the cost of being seen to be paying too much, if he increases his bid from 220p a share, against a potential loss of reputation if he lets his protege win. In financial terms, a takeover of RHM would enhance earnings considerably more for Tomkins than for the much larger Hanson group. Also, the rights issue is structured to allow Mr Hutchings to increase the Tomkins offer, if necessary, without asking the underwriters. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter dated April 12, 1994, Dr. Jack Roth of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, submitted the human gene transfer protocol entitled: Clinical Protocol for Modification of Tumor Suppressor Gene Expression and Induction of Apoptosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an Adenovirus Vector Expressing Wildtype p53 and Cisplatin to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal review and approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> X.

Addition to Appendix D of the NIH Guidelines Regarding a Human Gene Transfer Protocol/Drs. Liu and Young <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter dated October 7, 1993, Drs. Johnson M. Liu and Neal S. Young of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, submitted the human gene transfer protocol entitled: Retroviral Mediated Gene Transfer of the Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Gene to Hematopoietic Progenitors of Group C Patients to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal review and approval. At the December 2&hyph;3, 1993, meeting, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee deferred the protocol until the investigators return to the full Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee with the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Murine data demonstrating  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  expression of the FACC gene and safety data accumulated over a period of " 4 months demonstrating that the FACC-transduced cells do not produce any untoward effects, i.e., malignant transformation: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Data (cited in Dr. Cynthia Dunbar's December 1993 data management report, Protocol  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9206&hyph;025) regarding the possibility that ``stem cell factor could favor the growth of leukemic versus normal progenitors during  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  culture periods;'' and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Revised eligibility criteria sections for both the protocol and Informed Consent document that describe the necessity for bone marrow examination following each infusion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consensus of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee was that the investigators were not required to submit this additional data until 4 weeks prior to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting at which the information is reviewed. Submission of previously reviewed information is not required. The motion to defer the protocol pending full Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee review of additional information passed by a vote of 14 in favor, 0 opposed, and 3 abstentions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 2, 1994, Drs. Liu and Young submitted additional materials relating to the human gene transfer protocol to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal review and approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> XII. Amendment to Part I&hyph;D of the Points to Consider in the Design and Submission of Protocols for the Transfer of Recombinant DNA Into the Genome of Human Subjects, NIH Guidelines, Regarding Informed Consent/Dr. Zallen <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the December 2&hyph;3, 1993, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Gary Ellis, Director of the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, responded to the written comments submitted by Dr. Zallen, Chair of the Working Group on Informed Consent Issues. Dr. Ellis noted the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee's concern regarding specific issues that should be addressed in human gene transfer protocol Informed Consent documents, i.e., request for autopsy, recommendations for male/female contraception, separate Informed Consent documents when gene therapy is separate from a clinical protocol, commitment to long-term patient follow-up, and financial responsibility of the institution for all research-related costs. During his presentation, Dr. Ellis provided the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee with background information regarding the roles of both OPRR and local Institutional Review Boards (IRB) in the review of research proposals involving human subjects. Dr. Ellis recommended that the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee draft a letter outlining its specific recommendations to OPRR for distribution and consideration by the local IRBs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a memorandum dated December 23, 1993, Dr. Ellis further clarified the avenues that should be pursued by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee with regard to the ``quality and content of informed consent documents into constructive changes in the informed consent process,'' specifically in relation to human gene transfer. Dr. Ellis recommended that the Points to Consider should be amended to introduce consistency in the Informed Consent document language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the March 3&hyph;4, 1994, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Doris Zallen, Chair of the Working Group on Informed Consent, provided a summary of the proposed amendments to Part I&hyph;D, Informed Consent of the Points to Consider. Two versions of revised Part I&hyph;D were presented: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The version drafted by the working group, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A modified version incorporating the modifications suggested by Mr. Alex Capron. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee recommended that the working group should develop a consolidated version of part I&hyph;D which includes language from both proposed documents. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee suggested that questions should be prefaced with an explanation as to the necessity for the requested information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 27, 1994, Dr. Zallen submitted revised amendments to part I&hyph;D, Informed Consent, of the Points to Consider in response to the specific comments posed by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee at its March 3&hyph;4, 1994, meeting. The proposed amendments read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Part I&hyph;D Informed Consent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``In accordance with the requirements of DHHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR part 46), investigators shall indicate how subjects will be informed about the proposed study, the manner in which their consent will be solicited, and that the informed consent form makes clear the special requirements of gene transfer research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Part 1&hyph;D&hyph;1.

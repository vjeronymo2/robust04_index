			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CREWS PRACTICE ROUTINES FOR BRUSH FIRE SEASON  </P> <P> A fire races up a canyon on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, gobbling up bone-dry  brush on its way to a row of expensive houses perched on higher ground.  </P> <P> But a helicopter appears, dropping off a work crew to clear a fire line ahead  of the flames, then flies off to fill its tanks with water to use to help knock  down the blaze.  </P> <P> That, on paper at least, is the way helicopter firefighting works. To help  ensure that does occur when fires strike, firefighters and a helicopter crew  from the Los Angeles County Fire Department converged on Rancho Palos Verdes  late last week for practice.  </P> <P> "The helicopter is probably the most effective tool for keeping brush-fires  from getting out of control," Battalion Chief Gordon Pearson said during the  exercise, held on a coastal bluff near Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall. "They can  make a 300-gallon water drop while we're still pulling hoses to the fire. That  can make the difference between saving houses and not saving them."  </P> <P> The drill was part of a routine program aimed at training the county's local  fire units to cooperate with the department's helicopter crews. But fire  officials say they have placed more emphasis on the program in recent years as  drought conditions in the area have worsened.  </P> <P> The peninsula's tinder-dry canyons are now brush-fires waiting to happen, the  officials say. With the fire season under way as of May 15, they are urging  peninsula residents to take precautions.  </P> <P> Among them: clear away brush and dry grasses within 100 to 200 feet of homes,  prune dead branches from trees and shrubs, and clean debris from roofs.  </P> <P> "We haven't had a fire here in many years, and with all this growth, deadwood  and drought, the fire potential is just tremendous," said Tim O'Neill, a county  fire captain at last Thursday's drill.  </P> <P> The last big brush-fire to hit the Palos Verdes Peninsula occurred in 1973,  when a blaze fanned by sea breezes charred 900 acres and destroyed 11 houses,  causing an estimated $2 million in property damage.  </P> <P> Though no blaze of that dimension has occurred since, there have been scares.  The most recent came on April 29, when a brush-fire started in a canyon between  two fairways in the Palos Verdes Golf Course in Palos Verdes Estates.  </P> <P> Firefighters soon doused the blaze, but not before it had deposited burning  embers on the roof of a house on Paseo del Campo, about 600 feet away.  Authorities say they do not know what caused the blaze.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief Rene Rigaud said the fire was particularly worrisome in light  of a recent forestry report predicting that brush and deadwood on the peninsula  could fuel flames capable of breaching a 79-foot gap.  </P> <P> Said Rigaud grimly of the April 29 blaze: "It was a harbinger of what's to  come."  </P> <P> It is to prevent such predictions from coming true that the Fire Department is  staging exercises like the one held last week. Before the program concludes  this Thursday, personnel at seven of the county's South Bay fire stations will  receive the training.  </P> <P> Last week's session was the first in this year's program on the peninsula and  included instruction on points ranging from ground-to-air communications to the  preparation of safe helicopter landing sites.  </P></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Butler Cox recommends Pounds 14m bid from US group BUTLER COX, the London-based management consulting company specialising in information technology, is to be sold to Computer Sciences Corporation of the US in a cash deal worth Pounds 14.3m. CSC, a large computer systems integration company with an international reputation for large industrial and government projects, said yesterday that it had agreed to pay 245p per share for the entire share capital of Butler Cox. Following the statement shares in Butler Cox virtually doubled from 131p to 230p. The company was floated on the London stock market in May 1989 at 175p. Butler Cox directors, who between them hold 36.7 per cent of the capital, are unanimously recommending acceptance of the offer. Mr George Cox, managing director, said yesterday that 'the price reflects the potential of the business.' He said the downturn in the UK economy had hit both the level of profitability and the share price which had made it impossible for Butler Cox to make acquisitions using its own paper. However, he pointed out that the company remained profitable, had grown in cash and had avoided compulsory redundancies. In its last financial Butler Cox experienced a 42 per cent fall in taxable profits to Pounds 760,425 (Pounds 1.32m) on turnover up nearly 15 per cent to Pounds 10.73m. CSC, with headquarters in Los Angeles, had net income last year of Dollars 65m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Dollars 1.7bn. The two companies said that Butler Cox's presence in Europe would complement CSC's strength in North America. Butler Cox is unique in its sector in that its conventional consultancy activities are underpinned by a syndicated research foundation. Members of the Butler Cox Foundation include many of the most prestigious companies in the UK and mainland Europe, brought together by a common concern to make the best use of information technology. Last year Butler Cox added an education arm through the purchase of Cranfield Information Technology Institute. CSC announced two years ago that it intended to grow the commercial side of its business through acquisition and had set aside a war chest of Dollars 500m for purchases world-wide. It already owns Index, a consultancy with offices in Boston, Los Angeles, New York and London with strong links to Harvard and to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The US company said its intention was to bring together Butler Cox and Index to form a global consulting group. The two companies have a total of some 800 companies worldwide subscribing to their research programmes.</p>

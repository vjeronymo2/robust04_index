			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Hekmatyar halts assault on Kabul RADICAL Mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar halted his assault on Kabul yesterday so that peace talks could be held with his rivals in the new Mujahideen government. Mr Hekmatyar's five-man delegation demanded, among other things, that President Sigbutulla Mojaddedi's powers to select cabinet ministers be eliminated. He also wants an 8,000-man Uzbek militia backing his chief rival, defence minister Ahmad Shah Massoud, to leave the capital region. Mr Massoud's chief deputy, Mr Abdur Rahaman, said in an interview that the ruling 51-member council would negotiate with Mr Hekmatyar, 'but one-way demands are not reasonable. He should accept the decisions of the council.' Mr Masoud's political leader, Mr Berhanuddin Rabbanni, who will assume the nation's presidency in six weeks, is expected to meet Mr Hekmatyar on the outskirts of Kabul today. The peace talks are expected to lead to Mr Hekmatyar's admission to the interim government in some form. Although Mr Hekmatyar had appeared to isolate himself from nearly all major Mujahideen leaders by continuing to fight despite Kabul's fall two weeks ago, it has become clear that his rivals are not ready to sever ties with him. This means that a member of Mr Hekmatyar's organisation, Hezb-i-Islami, will probably assume the post of prime minister. Mr Hekmatyar has nominated one of his northern commanders, Ustad Fareed, to take the position, and he seems to have been accepted by most of the rebel factions participating in the government. Analysts believe Mr Massoud is reconciled to his bitter enemy joining the government, but that he would like to delay the move as long as possible. 'Masoud doesn't want to annihilate Hekmatyar. Basically his strategy is to weaken him sufficiently, then let him join the government,' said an Asian diplomat. Mr Hekmatyar, 39, is believed to have huge stockpiles of weapons from his 14 years as the chief recipient of Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5bn) in US aid to the Mujahideen. A gifted organiser and orator with fierce determination, Mr Hekmatyar has been able to stall and bully his way into powerful positions throughout the war. Meanwhile, Mr Abdul Wakil, the deposed regime's foreign minister, was said to have fled to Tashkent. Mr Wakil became the face of the government after ex-president Najibullah went into hiding.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (D) The State must be assured that the POU and POE devices are properly installed, maintained and monitored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Period of delivery.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PWS shall provide Alternative Water for the following time periods:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Alternative Water shall be provided to each infant for the period requested, which may not exceed twenty weeks from the date of initial delivery. Alternative Water delivery shall be provided for the full twenty weeks if requested, even if the infant becomes one year of age during the delivery period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Alternative Water shall be provided to each traveler and new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident for the period requested, not to exceed six weeks from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date of initial delivery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Notification/Education Program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements of this section apply only in States which have authorized the Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method of Compliance. The requirements apply only to those PWSs in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States which have chosen to comply with the sulfate MCL through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Method of Compliance rather than by achieving the MCL in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples taken at each entry point to the distribution system. The PWS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall implement the public notification/education program described in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsection in lieu of &sect;141.32, and shall provide the State with copies of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all public notification and education materials at the same time. There  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are four components to the program: Notices in bills, pamphlets, signs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and notices to the media. Transient systems (e.g., campgrounds and gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations) and non-transient, non-community systems (e.g. schools,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factories) shall be required to post signs in accordance with paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (r)(3)(v) of this section, but shall not be required to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for notices in bills, notices to the media, or pamphlets in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (r)(3) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (vi) of this section. Community water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems which are non-transient systems shall comply with all four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components set forth in paragraphs (r)(3) (i)&hyph;(vi) of this section, i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notices in bills, pamphlets, signs, and notices to the media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Newspaper, mail, hand delivery, of notices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PWSs shall give notice by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area served  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the system as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate in excess of the MCL has been detected in the water. The notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be repeated at intervals of 6 months while the sulfate concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the water in the distribution system continues to exceed the MCL. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area served by a public water system is not served by a daily newspaper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of general circulation, notice shall instead be given by publication in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weekly newspaper of general circulation. The notice shall define and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describe the geographic location served by the system. In communities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where a significant portion of the population speaks a language other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> English, the text shall be published in the appropriate language(s), in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to English. A telephone number(s) and an office location for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting Alternative Water delivery shall be provided. The notice shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be provided at least once every six months by mail delivery (by direct mail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or with the water bill), or by hand delivery, not later than 45 days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sulfate MCL has been exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Text of the Notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PWS shall, within 60 days of confirmed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection of sulfate in the distribution system, insert notices in each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customer's water utility bill containing the following mandatory paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the water bill itself in large bold print. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Warning: The water being supplied to you has high levels of sulfate which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can cause diarrhea in people who are not used to it.

In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communities where a significant portion of the population speaks a language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than English, the text shall be published in the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language(s), in addition to English. The text shall be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Introduction. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the [insert name of State primacy agency], and [insert name of water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplier] are concerned about sulfate in your drinking water. Sulfate salts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are found naturally in soil and rock in certain areas of the country,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including ours. With the exception of infants, residents of the area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be accustomed to the sulfate in our drinking water, and should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience ill effects. However, people who are not accustomed to high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of sulfate in their drinking water may experience diarrhea. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal law, we are required to provide sensitive populations with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative water until their bodies adapt to the sulfate concentrations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our water. This brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sensitive populations: infants, visitors from outside the area, and new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Health Effects of Sulfate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ingestion of sulfate in high concentrations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to cause diarrhea. The greatest risk is to infants, for whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prolonged diarrhea can be dangerous. New residents and travelers may also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience diarrhea when they first drink water with high levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate. After approximately two weeks, adult's bodies become accustomed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the sulfate, and the diarrhea stops. Available studies have not shown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any long-term or chronic adverse effects from consuming sulfate in drinking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water. Boiling the water will not reduce the sulfate content, and in fact,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will concentrate it through evaporation of the water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Alternative Water Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If you are expecting a baby, if you are a new resident, or expecting visitors from outside the area, please call [insert phone number of water system] to request delivery of alternative water to your home. We will provide you with sufficient water for the cooking and drinking needs for each sensitive person. We will provide you with two liters per day of bottled water for your infant for up to 20 weeks, during which time you should gradually add tap water to the bottled water. In this way, your baby will become gradually accustomed to the sulfate in the water. We will provide your out-of-town guests with two liters of bottled water per day for the period needed, up to a maximum of six weeks. We will provide new residents with two liters per person per day for up to six weeks. During that time, tap water should be gradually mixed with the bottled water. Restaurants and other establishments who are likely to serve at least some members of the target population on a continual basis may be provided individual treatment devices, depending on our evaluation of the size of the target population and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New customers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PWS shall provide notice of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following to new customers or billing units prior to or on the date service begins: Sulfate MCL exceedence in the water entering the distribution system, the health effect of sulfate for target populations, and the need to mix bottled water and tap water for gradual acclimation to sulfate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Metallbank breaks German mould - David Waller on a Frankfurt-based investment banking boutique IN GERMANY, a country where hopping from one profession to another is frowned upon, a bank run by a former journalist still counts as highly unusual. But Mr Michael Gotthelf's background as financial editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is not the only unusual aspect of the Metallbank, where Gotthelf is joint managing director. The Frankfurt-based Metallbank, with 180 staff and a DM1.1bn (Dollars 688m) balance sheet, has become something of a mould-breaker in the German financial markets. It organised the first German issue of so-called 'stripped' bonds, for the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau in May of last year, whereby the interest payments on the DM300m issue were packaged into a separate issue. The separate tradeability of the coupon was new for Germany and Metallbank acted as lead manager and sole placing agent. More recently, in January this year, the bank co-ordinated another first for Germany, acting as main placing agent for a warrant issue on 30-year French government bonds, working in conjunction with Caisse des Depots. It worked with Citibank's Spanish operations to develop a similar warrants issue on peseta bonds. Both issues were strong performers amid the currency market turbulence of the past year. It is also working with the Deutsche Bank to set up a service to allow German companies to take out hedge and swap agreements on oil and fuel prices. As Mr Gotthelf admits, these products are commonplace in the US market - but they are new for Germany. The bank was founded in 1906 and developed into a savings and loans institution for the staff of Metallgesellschaft, the large metals, mining and industrial group based in the heart of Frankfurt. The bank changed its complexion with the arrival of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch at the helm of the parent company in the late eighties. Mr Schimmelbusch helped turn the bank into what in the Anglo-American world would be described as an investment banking boutique. Metallbank is still owned by Metallgesellschaft - and it still provides savings bank services for the parent company's employees - but two-thirds of the bank's profits now come from its investment banking activities, an area which employs just a third of the its staff. Business activities include trading, fund management and mergers and acquisitions advice - often to the parent company, which has until recently been one of Germany's most vigorous buyers and sellers of businesses. 'We are backed by the capital of our mother company,' says Gotthelf, 'which gives us a power in terms of trading muscle and information flow which no other bank of this size can match. This has allowed us to duplicate US inventions for the German market sometimes years before the big German banks catch on.' However, the association with the mother company is not uniformly positive. Metallgesellschaft's profits have tumbled over the past two years amid deep recession in the metals and engineering industries. In June this year, the company reported half-year profits down 39 per cent to DM98.3m. Its deal-making ambitions have been put into reverse: Schimmelbusch is busily trying to raise DM1bn from corporate disposals. Mr Gotthelf will not comment on this but the difficulties of the parent seem to be one factor behind an (undisclosed) drop in the bank's profits last year. Moreover, the bank seems unlikely to escape the staff cuts planned for the Metallgesellschaft group as a whole: the group's staff is to be lopped by 10 per cent over the next two years and the bank's headcount is set to drop by the same proportion. But, said Mr Lothar Mark, joint managing director, there will be no redundancies - retirees in the non-investment banking part of the business will simply not be replaced. He added that profits are likely to rise by 30 per cent in the year to the end of September, reflecting the bank's new issue business and vigorous trading activity. 'We will be able to pay a handsome dividend to the mother company,' he boasted. Few of the chiefs of Metallgesellschaft's other subsidiaries are able to say the same.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: THE HERO BIZ  </P> <P> Heroes from the comics have been filling theaters lately, but three Marvel  comics super-guys are languishing very unheroically without production or  distribution dates.  </P> <P> * Already used in a TV movie, "Spider-Man" was announced for feature filming  two years ago but is still in development at 21st Century Film Corp. Neil  Ruttenberg is writing a script.  </P> <P> Columbia Pictures Entertainment -- which has a distribution agreement with 21st  Century -- says there's "quite a bit of enthusiasm" at the studio about the  project.  </P> <P> * The already-filmed "Captain America" -- also from 21st Century, for release  through Columbia -- sits on the shelf, possibly to be released in late summer  or early fall. But a Columbia source was less optimistic, calling the picture  amateurish and "unreleasable."  </P> <P> * "The Punisher," based on the Marvel comic about a one-man anti-criminal death  squad, was originally due in the spring of 1989. Starring Dolph Lundgren as the  leather-clad title character, the picture got entangled in the sale of New  World Pictures, which produced.  </P> <P> Since sold to I.V.E., which plans an upcoming video release, the film will have  its "U.S. premiere" July 8 during the L.A. Comic Book and Science Fiction  Convention at the Shrine Auditorium. Convention organizer Bruce Schwartz says  this will be the film's only 35-millimeter screening before its journey to  video shelves. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

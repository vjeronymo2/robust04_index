			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound suffers in busy trading THE D-MARK was the main beneficiary of sterling and dollar weakness yesterday, ending sharply higher as the pound fell on Maastricht nervousness, and worse than expected new homes data pushed the US currency lower. The pound tumbled following weekend reports that Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, would resign if Tory backbenchers voted against the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union. Although Downing Street dismissed the story yesterday morning, the damage had been done and the UK currency ended the day 2 pfennigs down from Friday's close at its lowest level since just after the general election on April 9. An analyst commented: 'After Denmark's rejection of the treaty, people are taking these rumours more seriously than they would otherwise have done.' Foreign investors in particular were worried by the reports and rushed to safety in the D-Mark. Sterling's weakness was exacerbated by a number of gloomy economic surveys released over the weekend and by heavy dollar and yen selling for D-Marks. The pound closed at DM2.8925, compared with DM2.9125 previously. However, it held up against the dollar - which had an even rougher day - finishing at Dollars 1.9070, after Friday's close of Dollars 1.8920. Sterling eased back in New York to end at Dollars 1.9033. The dollar continued its sharp descent, losing 2 1/4 pfennigs in a busy session. Traders reported heavy selling from a wide range of corporate and fund investors. Discussions about another possible cut in US interest rates dominated activity on the foreign exchanges. This looked even more likely after May US new home sales were reported to have dropped a sharp 5.6 per cent to 501,000, compared with economists' forecasts of a rise to 550,000. A US bank trader said: 'The dollar had been on a nice corrective rally this afternoon, but the figures put paid to that.' The Federal Open Markets Committee meets today and tomorrow to discuss rate policy. Many expect it to sanction a further easing. The US currency closed at DM1.5165, down from Friday's finish of DM1.5390. It fared slightly better against the yen, thanks mainly to heavy yen selling for D-Marks. The dollar ended steadier in New York at DM1.5213 last night. All this left the D-Mark sharply higher. 'Everybody loves the D-Mark,' said one trader. 'If Maastricht breaks down, that is where everyone will go. If there is any economy with growth potential, it is Germany's' The Portuguese escudo, still the top currency in the European Monetary System grid, pushed through its maximum limit against the pound during the day, but traders said the Bank of Portugal intervened to sell escudos for D-Marks.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  </P> <P> * For late-summer show of color -- plant petunias, marigolds, zinnias and  lobelia.  </P> <P> * Check the lawn and garden for pest and diseases. Apply the proper controls  immediately.  </P> <P> * It's a good idea to take down your hanging baskets every now and then and  give them a thorough soaking by either dunking them in a bucket or by running  the water from a hose very slowly over a period of time.  </P> <P> * Faded annuals can be quickly replaced with fresh new plants from your  nursery.  </P></p>

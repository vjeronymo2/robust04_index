			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: 'Otello' revived - Opera Elijah Moshinsky's production of Verdi's opera, re-staged now by Richard Gregson, has established itself as a durable treasure of the Royal Opera repertoire. It looks imposing, though it has no tricks that grow stale (the opening tempest still dazzles with Robert Bryan's lighting); it sets a credible time and place compactly and thriftily; it wastes no time - one modest interval between the middle acts, the merest pauses elsewhere. On Monday its fourth revival, with all the principals drawn from previous casts, gave resounding satisfaction. 'Resounding' in particular because the Otello was again the Russian tenor Vladimir Atlantov, whose forte is fortissimo: for the July 18 concert-performance by the lake at Kenwood, he will need no microphones. Not long ago I heard him in the role in Vienna, where he sang wildly, if sometimes thrillingly, and barely interacted with his Desdemona and Iago. At Covent Garden, with sharply purposeful conducting by Edward Downes, he was better tuned and rather less self-absorbed. It remains a broad, extrovert performance - far removed from Domingo's anguished subtleties with Carlos Kleiber in the pit (worlds away, in the 'Dio] mi potevi scagliar' soliloquy), but honestly stirring in its own terms. His Desdemona was the lovely Katia Ricciarelli, still a radiant, unsurpassable icon of innocent goodness. The vocal problems of recent years have melted away; the 'beat' in the voice is safely under control, and warmly affecting. Her soprano glows with a new maturity, if not the reckless generosity of her early career. On the modern stage sheer goodness is not a plausible commodity, but Ricciarelli's natural grace, spontaneity and dignity carry it off and seize one's heart. Like this heroine, Justino Diaz's Iago was captured by Zeffirelli for his film of the opera - and was, I suspect, enhanced by the experience. It is not a flamboyant study in villainy, nor does it brandish the dark-grained weight of the Diaz baritone. (In the roaring duet with Otello, indeed, he sang his first verse more or less to his knees, an odd thing to do.) But plain, subtle details accumulate and soon a formidably troubled character comes into focus, without melodramatic signalling of the kind few Iagos can resist. Sterling work from the lesser principals, among whom I will mention invidiously Robin Leggate's ever-upstanding Cassio, Anne Mason's alert Emilia and the precocious Ambassador of Peter Rose, who lends to his all-but-faceless role the solid bottom that it needs for the drama. For the chorus Otello sets strenuous tests, all of which the Royal Opera forces passed with flying colours. I still think that the choir of 'Cypriot' boys (this time from Chorley Wood) is excessively tow-headed, but it is not a point to fret over. Sponsored (1987) by Morgan Grenfell Group plc</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Mideast peace session given go-ahead ISRAEL and its Arab neighbours have agreed to hold a fifth round of peace talks in Washington on April 27. It appears they may then hold future talks closer to the Middle East, as demanded by Israel. The US State Department confirmed plans for the fifth stage in the peace process last night after representatives of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation had given the go-ahead at a meeting in Beirut. The State Department said all parties had responded to a US request to present a list of potential sites for a sixth round outside Washington. There was 'some commonality' in the lists, it said, and as a result, the sixth round 'will be held in a venue closer to the region.' This appeared to be a breakthrough after months of squabbling about the best site to continue talks. Israel wants them in the Middle East to gain greater Arab recognition, but the Arabs have wanted to stay in Washington to maximise USinvolvement. In the end, they are likely to settle on a European city. The Arab representatives meeting in Beirut agreed to attend the fifth round of talks despite Syrian and Lebanese reservations about continuing negotiations before Israeli elections on June 23. Officials said delegates wanted 'to prove to the international community that obstacles are being raised by Israel, not the Arabs'. Representatives of Portugal, Britain and the Netherlands - the 'troika' of the immediate past, present and future presidents of the European Community  -met the Arab delegates in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Syria and Lebanon to join multilateral Arab-Israeli talks on economic development, refugees, water resources and the environment in May. Syria and Lebanon had boycotted the first round of the multilateral talks held in Moscow.</p>

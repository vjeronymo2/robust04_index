			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Does cable TV need a Cowboy Television Network? Country music star Willie  Nelson apparently thinks so, and has paid $1 million-plus to Norman Lear's Act  III Entertainment to corral more than 4,000 vintage country music television  shows featuring the likes of Porter Wagoner, Dolly Parton, Flatt and Scruggs  and Marty Robbins. Nelson hopes to start the channel next year, broadcasting  the historic shows along with music videos, movies and specials. The operation  would be based near his Austin, Tex., home.

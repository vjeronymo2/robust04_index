			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 9--India is appointing a senior  diplomat, Mr Madhav Mangalmurti, presently ambassador to  Switzerland, as the first ambassador to South Africa.    The Indian diplomatic mission in South Africa is being set  up  well ahead of the first free elections in the country slated for  April.    The pace of mutual co-operation between the two countries  has  been quickened since the signing of the historic protocol for  diplomatic ties during the recent visit of the South African  foreign minister, Mr R.F. Botha, to New Delhi.    In the last few months, India has not only established a  direct air link with South Africa but has also set up a cultural  centre in Johannesburg. Last month, the minister of state for  external affairs, Mr Salman Khursheed, paid an official visit to  South Africa and met leaders of all the major political parties  there.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme Rink achieves 35% growth PRE-TAX profits of Wolsten-holme Rink, the Lancashire-based metal powders maker and supplier of products for the printing industry, showed a 35 per cent improvement, from Pounds 1.24m to Pounds 1.68m, in the six months to end-June. Mr Tony Rink, joint chairman, said the advance had been achieved despite a fall in turnover to Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 27.5m) and was mainly the result of a recovery in the part of the business which supplies international printing ink manufacturers. Profits had also been helped by the acquisition last year of PCO, which had performed well, he added. However, no improvement had been seen in trading conditions in the UK. Sales in the printing supplies business had fallen and bad debts were still a significant problem. An improved interim dividend of 6.5p (6.3p) is declared, payable from earnings of 14.4p (11.8p) per share.</p>

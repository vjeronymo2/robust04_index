			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (2): High flyers come down to earth  -Aerospace and defence / David White traces the alarming loss of jobs the old A1 - used to be the pride of Hatfield. They now have a sheepish look, eclipsed by the stark modernity of the Galleria shopping complex across the road. Recession caught up with both last year. The Galleria went into receivership a year after opening, and British Aerospace announced it would stop making aircraft there after almost 60 years, with the loss of 2,000 jobs. Manufacturing will cease at BAe's Hatfield site by the end of this year. At the Rolls-Royce engine plant at Leavesden, near Watford, it is due to end in June. The two plants were among Hertfordshire's biggest employers, figureheads of an aerospace and defence sector that has been at the core of industrial development in the county since before the second world war. The decline can be traced back to the mid-1980s. A report two years ago by Mr David Kraithman, now principal economics lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire, cited figures showing aerospace industry employment of just under 15,000 in the county. That figure was already down by a quarter from a peak of over 20,000 in 1985-86. Job cuts announced by large companies since then amount to a further cut of about a third. A broader estimate from Hertfordshire County Council put the number of jobs in defence and aerospace five years ago at 30,000 or more. Cutbacks at groups such as BAe, GEC and Rolls-Royce have wiped out almost half that number of posts in the intervening period. Hertfordshire still has a broad range of defence-related industries, including less well-known but successful companies such as Irvin Great Britain, a parachute maker belonging to the Hunting Group at Letchworth. This concentration is something of a historical accident. Hertfordshire has less to do with the military than most other counties. It has no major defence installations other than US communications relay stations at Bovingdon and Barkway, near Royston. An airfield at Nuthampstead, in the north-east of the county, was used by American Flying Fortresses in the war, but there are no bases today. The industry grew around de Havilland, which moved its aircraft and propeller manufacturing from Edgware to Hatfield in 1934. An engine factory, set up on the far side of the airfield, developed into a guided weapons centre in the 1950s. In 1959 the de Havilland name disappeared when it was bought up by Hawker Siddeley, and in 1978 was nationalised as part of BAe. The plant was the original manufacturing site for the BAe 146 regional jet, but its involvement was reduced well before the closure decision. With the setting-up of Avro International, a joint regional jet venture between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, Hatfield's remaining production work is being transferred to Woodford in Cheshire. No more than 200-300 jobs are expected to remain, in design of corporate jets and in London Business Aviation, which operates the airfield. The guided weapons side, BAe Dynamics, which employed 2,200 at Hatfield, closed down in 1989. That site, now in the hands of BAe's property subsidiary Arlington Securities, is being developed as a business park. Its activities - weapons - were moved to Stevenage, but jobs there have also been sharply cut back. The guided weapons factory at Stevenage, originally an English Electric plant set up in 1955, employed about 6,000 after the closure of Hatfield. But with the loss of assembly and manufacturing activities the number has since shrunk to 3,100. Across the road from it, BAe's space facility - another legacy from de Havilland and the UK's only builder of commercial satellites - last year axed just over half its workforce of 1,200. Rolls-Royce's helicopter engine factory at Leavesden is due to shut down completely in June. Also going back to de Havilland days, it has been on the closure list since 1991, when it still employed 1,750 people. Its work, which has suffered a sharp fall in recent years, is being transferred to Bristol. GEC-Marconi announced two years ago it was closing its research and development facility for underwater systems at Croxley Green, affecting 300 jobs. But other branches of GEC-Marconi employ about 900 at Borehamwood in a variety of activities, mostly in defence. Marconi Instruments, a separate subsidiary of the GEC group involved in electronic test and measurement equipment, has its headquarters at St Albans and a site at Stevenage, together employing about 800. Mr Peter Smith, managing director, says a move away from manufacturing over the past four years, with the loss of about 30 per cent of the workforce, has led to increased emphasis on its Stevenage R&amp;D operations. Activity is mostly geared to civilian markets, although the company's products also have military applications. Lucas Aerospace's power systems division at Hemel Hempstead has also cut back over the past couple of years to its present workforce of 690. The factory, which moved from Willesden in the later 1960s, makes electrical generating systems and small gas turbines for aircraft such as the Tornado and Harrier. A survivor from successive takeovers and reorganisations is Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering, based at Welwyn Garden City. Making control systems for gas turbine engines and gyroscopes and other systems for ships, it escaped the nationalisation of Hawker Siddeley's aircraft and missile businesses. Last December, a year after the takeover of Hawker Siddeley by BTR, it declared its independence through a management buy-out. It is now looking to non-military outlets to increase its Pounds 20m annual turnover. The company is halving its total workforce of 520. But Mr Ian Johnston, managing director, says its Hertfordshire operations will suffer the least from these cuts, with about 150 jobs likely be kept at Welwyn and 60 at Watford. 'We have retrenched into Hertfordshire to a large extent,' he says. The company's plans confirm a trend away from manufacturing and towards research, development and software. This is clearly the case at BAe's remaining activities and at GEC. One result of this change is that fewer employees in aerospace and defence-related industries live near the plants. Stevenage-based BAe Dynamics says its catchment area is now spread throughout Hertfordshire and further afield. The sector was always closely identified with the development of Hertfordshire's new towns after the war - Stevenage, Hemel Hempstead, Hatfield and Welwyn. But this relationship is now being doubly diluted: there are far fewer employed in the sector, and a smaller proportion have their homes in the new towns.</p>

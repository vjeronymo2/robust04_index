			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Insults fly as Adams and Mates clash in TV debate It was riveting political theatre. But at the end of last night's unprecedented public confrontation between a Sinn Fein leader and a government emissary there appeared to have been no progress along the road to a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. The 15-minute televised debate between Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, sent to the US to counter the Sinn Fein president's two-week propaganda offensive, quickly degenerated into point-scoring and insults. For anyone viewing the encounter as a dry run for the talks that could take place between the government and the IRA's political wing as soon as December, the portents were not encouraging. When it was all over, the clearest impression was that Mr Adams, whose voice was until recently prevented from being heard on the British media by the government's broadcasting ban, still had much to learn in terms of communicating his message effectively on television. To that extent, last night's event was a success for the more restrained Mr Mates and went some way to vindicating the government's decision to dispatch him to the US. In the course of the bad-tempered exchanges, broadcast on BBC's Newsnight, Mr Adams again refused to be drawn on whether the IRA's four-week-old ceasefire was permanent, saying only that as far as he was concerned 'we are in the final phase of this struggle'. He tried to put pressure on the government to lift its exclusion order preventing him from visiting the British mainland, saying it was 'silly and bizarre' that the debate had to take place in New York. 'Why can't I come to London to discuss this?' he asked. 'The banning order should be stopped immediately.' Mr Mates suggested that the ban could in time be lifted. On the question of consent to an eventual settlement, there was no hint of a narrowing of the gap between the two sides. Mr Mates said Northern Ireland's future had to be settled with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. Mr Adams retorted that Britain should leave it to parties in Ireland and Northern Ireland to decide how their right to self-determination was exercised.</p>

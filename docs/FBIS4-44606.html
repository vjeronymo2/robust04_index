The  lasing wavelength is 860 nm at room temperature and a peak power  of more than 20 mW has been achieved in single-mode pulse  operation. The device operates in single longitudinal mode (SLM)  between 0C and 80C. As a preliminary result, the  threshold current for a 5-6-m-wide oxide device is  approximately 700 mA.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   The DFB semiconductor laser is one of the critical devices  used in large-scale, long-range fiber optic communications. As  electro-optic devices are being developed, the DFB laser also  plays an important role in optical information processing and  optical measurement. There are two DFB laser feedback  mechanisms, i.e., index-of-refraction-coupled and  gain-coupled.[.sup]1[/] The use of a structure to separately  block carriers and optical waveguide makes the index-coupled DFB  laser a practical device; it becomes the mainstream of DFB  semiconductor lasers. Nevertheless, there is a stop band in an  index-coupled DFB device and there are two lowest modes of the  same gain threshold on either side of the stop  band.[.sup]1[/] Therefore, an index-coupled DFB device, in  principle, does not operate in a single mode. This issue becomes  more critical in dynamic operating conditions. Using a _l_/4  phase shifter,[.sup]2[/] a strip width  modulator,[.sup]3[/] or a high-reflection/no-reflection  coating[.sup]4[/] can overcome mode degeneracy and improve  single-mode yield. However, single-mode stability can easily be  affected by spatial hole burning[.sup]5[/] and end  reflection.[.sup]6[/]    Contrary to the problem we discussed above, the lowest gain  threshold mode of a gain-coupled DFB laser is at the Bragg  wavelength. Hence, it is truly operating in a single mode. Even  a compound DFB laser that is both index-coupled and gain-coupled  can also totally eliminate mode degeneracy and operate in a  single mode.[.sup]7[/]    On the basis of understanding of its superiority, research  on  gain-coupled DFB laser devices is very active worldwide. To  date, there are two ways to incorporate the gain-coupling  mechanism into a DFB laser. One is to fabricate a gain grating.  For instance, a grating can be grown on an active layer using an  OMVPE [organo-metallic vapor-phase epitaxy] technique on a  non-planar surface.[.sup]8,9[/] The other way is to  incorporate a loss grating near the active layer to periodically  modulate the net gain of the laser.[.sup]10[/]    Compared to index-coupled DFB lasers, gain-coupled DFB  lasers  of both types have a number of advantages, including higher  single-mode yield,[.sup]11,12[/] extremely low chirping at  high dynamic modulation,[.sup]13,14[/] capability to generate  single-mode ultra-short pulses[.sup]13[/] and low noise  induced by external reflection.[.sup]15[/] The gain-coupled  DFB laser has proven its role in optical communications.    A gain-coupled DFB laser with an absorptive loss grating is  attracting more attention because there are no special  requirements in its fabrication. Devices have been fabricated  worldwide using techniques such as OMVPE, LPE [liquid-phase  epitaxy] and CBE [chemical beam epitaxy] with materials such as  GaAlAs, InGaAlAs and InGaAsP.[.sup]10,14,16,17,18[/] In this  work, for the first time a GaAlAs/GaAs gain-coupled MQW DFB  laser with an absorptive grating has been successfully prepared  using MBE. In addition, for the first time in China, a  gain-coupled DFB laser has successfully lased at room  temperature.  <H5>  2. Device Structure and Fabrication Technique </H5>   Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of the laser. The  active layer employs an MQW structure to further optimize the  performance of the device. An absorptive loss grating is  incorporated on top of the active layer to periodically modulate  the longitudinal optical field of the laser. This is equivalent  to a periodic modulation of the net gain of the optical field  mode along the longitudinal axis in order to incorporate the  gain-coupling mechanism into the laser. In the structure shown,  the change of conduction mode of the absorptive loss grating to  n type as compared to its surrounding p type can further lower  the threshold and improve the nonlinearity effect caused by  absorption saturation.[.sup]18[/] The gain-coupling  coefficient, a parameter that reflects the strength of optical  feedback as a result of periodically changing gain, is a direct  function of factors such as the absorption coefficient of the  grating material and grating thickness. To this end, we  calculated the relation between the absorptive layer thickness  and gain-coupling coefficient.[.sup]19[/] After taking actual  fabrication into consideration, we only calculated a three-stage  grating and the result is shown in Figure 2. When the absorptive  layer is more than 50 nm thick, the normalized gain-coupling  coefficient is greater than 0.8, which is sufficiently large to  improve device performance. On the other hand, increasing the  absorptive layer thickness will also raise the dc component of  the periodic loss, i.e., the average mode loss, which causes an  increase in the threshold current of the device. Therefore, the  thickness of the grating has been fixed at 50-80 nm. A carrier  blocking layer is introduced between upper guiding and  absorptive grating to effectively confine injected carriers in  the active layer. A high-refractance epitaxial layer, i.e., a  low-Al-composition layer, is added underneath the absorptive  grating layer. On one hand, it acts as a waveguide to enhance  the effect of the grating to raise the coupling coefficient. On  the other hand, it can avoid possible oxidation and  contamination of the high-Al-composition grating due to exposure  to air during fabrication.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-06A>      Figure 1. Cross-Sectional View of the Device </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-06B>      Figure 2. Gain-Coupling Coefficient vs. Absorptive Layer </FIG>  Thickness When Bulk Absorption Coefficient Is 5,000  cm[.sup]-1[/]&lt;/graphic&gt;     In the first MBE process the following layers are grown on  top of a Si-doped (1-2 x 10[.sup]18[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) GaAs  substrate: n-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As lower  cladding layer (1.5 m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/]  cm[.sup]-3[/]), Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As lower  guiding layer (0.25 m, undoped),  Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As/GaAs triple-quantum-well  active layer (well width 10 nm, barrier width 12 nm, undoped),  Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As upper guiding layer (0.25  m, undoped), p-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As carrier  blocking layer (0.15 m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/]  cm[.sup]-3[/]), p-Ga[.sub]0.76[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As  guiding layer (0.05 m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/]  cm[.sup]-3[/]), and n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs absorptive layer  (0.05 m, 1 x 10[.sup]18[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]).    Because it is impossible to fabricate primary GaAlAs/GaAs  gratings using conventional techniques and the process to make  secondary gratings is hard to control, we chose to fabricate a  tertiary grating that is capable of having a sufficiently high  coupling coefficient under a given set of  conditions.[.sup]18[/] A holographic exposure system based on  a 325-nm ultraviolet laser was employed to make a tertiary  grating with a periodicity of 378 nm. Afterward, it was  chemically etched in  H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]2[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O  = 9:1:1 at 5C for 4 seconds to obtain a triangular  absorptive loss grating.    In the second MBE process, a  p-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As upper cladding layer (1  m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) and a  p[.sup]+[/]-GaAs ohmic contact (0.5 m, 1 x  10[.sup]19[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) were grown on top of the  grating. Making a DFB laser using an MBE technique has not been  reported in China and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world.  The difficulty involved is the secondary epitaxy process on the  grating due to the fact that crystal quality and surface  morphology of the boundary are adversely affected by oxidation  and contamination. We also encountered a great deal of  difficulty in this work. A unique secondary epitaxy  technique[.sup]20[/] based on the characteristics of MBE was  developed to overcome this problem.    To simplify the technique, the device has a basic oxide film  strip structure. A 200-nm-thick SiO[.sub]2[/] film was  deposited by RF sputtering. A 5-6-m-wide strip was obtained  by etching in a buffered HF solution. A p-type Au-Cr contact and  an n-type Au-Ge-Ni contact were made by evaporation.  <H5>  3. Device Performance </H5>   Lasing was successfully achieved at room temperature. Figure  3 shows the output light intensity as a function of injected  current for a 300-m cavity device operating with 500 ns and  1  kHz pulses. The threshold of the device is 700 mA at 20C.  The primary reason for this high threshold current is that the  device does not have any lateral blocking. In addition, the  quality of the primary epitaxy process needs to be improved.  Figure 4 shows the lasing spectra of the same device at  different injection currents. When the injection current is  approximately 0.9 times the threshold (see Figure 4(a)), besides  the Fabry-Perot mode at the gain peak, the DFB mode 7 nm away is  significantly enhanced. This is a piece of evidence that this  mode has a larger threshold gain difference compared to other  surrounding modes. When the injection current approaches the  threshold, the DFB mode begins to lase (see Figure 4(b)) at  approximately 860 nm. As the current is further increased (see  Figure 4(c)), it operates completely in a single mode. It is  worthwhile to point out that it is difficult to see a stop band  in a gain-coupled DFB laser. Our device is no exception.    <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-07A>      Figure 3. Peak Output Power vs. Injected Current </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-07B>      Figure 4. Lasing Spectra at Different Injection Currents </FIG>     In addition, the peak single-mode optical output is over 20  mW. Higher power spectra were not measured because of the danger  that the photomultiplier tube might be damaged. However, from  Figure 3, the peak pulse output should be no less than 50 mW.  Besides the large optical cavity effect due to the relatively  thick guiding layer in the device, it also illustrates the  advantage that a gain-coupled DFB laser is not affected by space  burning at high power levels.    Figure 5 shows the lasing wavelength as a function of  temperature. Due to equipment limitation, it was only measured  between 0C and 80C. No mode hopping took place within  this temperature range. The temperature coefficient of the  wavelength is approximately 0.07 nm/C. This is another  piece of evidence that our device is operating in the DFB mode.  Figure 6 shows the lasing spectra at different temperatures. It  is obvious that it continues to operate in a complete single  mode up to 80C.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-08A>      Figure 5.

Conclusions </H5>   A GaAlAs/GaAs MQW gain-coupled DFB laser with an absorptive  grating has been successfully fabricated using an MBE technique  for the first time. At room temperature, the device lases at 860  nm. At 20C, the current threshold is 700 mA. The device  remains lasing in SLM within a range of 0C to 80C. The  peak power in single-mode single-ended output at room  temperature could exceed 20 mW.  <H5>  Acknowledgment </H5>   The authors wish to express their gratitude to Professor  Zhou  Bingkun [0719 3521 3824] for his concern and assistance in  pushing this study forward, to Li Li [2621 4539] of the National  Center for Optoelectronics Fabrication for his assistance in the  fabrication of gratings, to Professor Li Deji [2621 1795 2638]  for his support and assistance in device fabrication, to  Professors Peng Jihu [1756 0679 5706], Zhang Keqian [1728 0344  3383] and Jiang Jianping [3068 0494 1627] for their  encouragement and support, and to Professor Kunio Tada and  Associate Professor Yoshiteru Nakano of the Department of  Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University, for their guidance.

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH LOSES PLEA FOR NEW TRIAL BASED ON JUROR'S CONDUCT  </P> <P> A federal district judge refused Friday to grant a new trial to former White  House aide Oliver L. North, saying North had offered no proof that his  conviction last May was biased by a juror's alleged misconduct.  </P> <P> As a result, North's sentencing is expected to proceed on Wednesday as  scheduled. North, convicted on three of 12 felony counts for his role in the  Iran-Contra affair, could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined as  much as $750,000.  </P> <P> North was found guilty on May 4 of altering and destroying top-secret  documents, helping to mislead Congress and illegally accepting a $13,800 home  security system as a gift.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Withheld Information  </P> <P> The juror, Tara Leigh King, had failed to disclose that members of her family  had been charged with crimes and that she had been questioned by a grand jury  in connection with the investigation of a brother who was convicted of armed  robbery.  </P> <P> In a questionnaire, the 34-year-old copy machine operator had answered "no"  when asked whether she or any member of her immediate family had been involved  in any court proceeding or investigation. At a hearing Wednesday, King said she  had forgotten the incidents.  </P> <P> North's sentencing initially had been scheduled for June 23, but U.S. District  Judge Gerhard A. Gesell postponed it to allow the hearing into questions that  North's attorneys raised regarding King's fitness as a juror.  </P> <P> Gesell noted Friday that King had voted to acquit North of many of the felony  counts against him.  </P> <P> "King was not biased for or against either side," Gesell wrote in his nine-page  order. "No proof was presented indicating that King was unfair or that she  failed in any way to serve conscientiously."  </P> <P> Gesell wrote that King had been "distressed over (her brother's) conviction and  the family was embarrassed. She may well have felt it would prevent her being  considered for jury service. Her omission was knowing, but she had no desire to  help or to hurt North or the prosecution."  </P> <P> King admitted also that she had used drugs on occasion but insisted that she  quit using them several months before the trial and never was under their  influence during the proceedings.  </P> <P> In a related development, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) announced  Friday that he and 58 other House members plan to ask President Bush to pardon  North. They plan to make their appeal at a news conference after North's  sentencing.  </P></p>

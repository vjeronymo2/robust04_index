			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Opposing influences move Frankfurt bourse THERE was a sense of hiatus among senior bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff, with Paris, Madrid and Brussels closed for the Assumption Day holiday. FRANKFURT fell back from early morning highs, the DAX index closing 5.61 higher at 1,912.19, after an early intraday peak of 1,931.38 and a gain of 2 per cent last week. Brokers said that there were some large buy orders in the pre-bourse, but no positive follow-through thereafter. Turnover fell from DM9.4bn to DM7.8bn. In the post-bourse, the Ibis-indicated DAX fell to 1,903.51. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, at James Capel in Frankfurt, said that investors were torn between thoughts of consolidation - the DAX having risen by 300 points in less than three months - and the temptation to begin speculation on a further reduction in interest rates when the Bundesbank meets on Thursday week. Meanwhile, blue chips saw Siemens rise DM8.60 to DM684.60, having lagged behind the market recently. In chemicals, Hoechst put on DM2.80m to DM279.80 for similar reasons; among carmakers, a DM7.30 drop in Volkswagen to DM392.30, weighed down by industrial spying allegations, was offset by a DM13 rise to DM716.50 at Daimler. Initial interest in the department store retailer, Karstadt, took it up to DM623 at midday before it closed a modest DM3.20 higher at DM608.00 following confirmation of discussions on warehousing and distribution logistics with its competitor, Hertie. In contrast, Germany's second largest department store chain, Kaufhof, fell DM16 to DM549 on switch considerations. Meanwhile, Lufthansa continued its climb, rising DM3.20 to DM151.50 after its management board chairman, Mr Jurgen Weber, said that the airline would resume paying a dividend by 1995 at the latest. ZURICH went higher following bearish James Capel notes on both fundamental and technical grounds, the SMI index rising 17.9 to 2,478.9. Dealers said that profit-taking was always likely and that international investors could shift funds into more promising markets like Germany. However, the market was drawn higher by Nestle, up SFr19 at SFr1,099, and Roche, with the certificates SFr90 higher at SFr5,120. AMSTERDAM closed unchanged in spite of some convincing gains by leading multinational groups such as Unilever, up Fl 2.90 at Fl 193.40, and Royal Dutch, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 187.40. The CBS Tendency index finished at 127.9. Among second liners, Frans Maas, the road transport group, shed Fl 7.30 to Fl 49.00 on news over the weekend that it is now forecasting lower than expected results this year. KLM, which has a stake in the group, came off 50 cents to Fl 36.70. Among other stocks in the transport sector, Nedlloyd lost 80 cents to Fl 47.30 ahead of results due later this month. MILAN saw a heavy reverse in Ferruzzi ordinary shares after Friday's 20 per cent gain, closing down L86.20 at L242.00. Analysts remarked that dealing in the stock was now driven by the speculative activity of small investors and, as such, liable to sudden swings. On the last day of the account, the Comit index rose 4.07 to 593.04. Montedison rose again on last week's results, by L34 to L772.50. Yesterday a court said that it had postponed until the end of the month a decision on whether to allow a request by the company for the seizure of L500bn of assets from ex-managers. In Scandinavia, STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index eased on profit-taking, down 8.3 at 1,285.0 with Ericsson B shares losing SKr6 to SKr372 ahead of Thursday's half year results. OSLO, in similar vein, saw the all-share index off 4.14 at 586.94 in turnover of NKr606m. HELSINKI closed lower also on the profit-taking theme, the HEX index down 13.4 to 1,427.9, with the banking sector off some 5 per cent. VIENNA traders said that the expiry of August derivatives added uncertainty to a market in correction as the ATX index eased 11.01 to 989.63. The August ATX future eased 15 to 986. ISTANBUL gained 4.7 per cent and broke above 10,000 for first time since August 3. The composite index put on 458.51 to 10,199.7, following a rise of 2 per cent on Friday. Some market observers said that the recently positive tone might be due to the expectation of fresh liquidity following the maturity of Treasury bills early next month. WARSAW saw as 12 shares hit record highs, the bourse posting its second highest ever turnover of 619.5bn zloty (Dollars 34m) as the WIG index gained 240.8, or 4.6 per cent to 5,492.4.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 16 (Partial)                                  THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1278.67    1278.14    1276.81    1275.98 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1359.33    1359.91    1358.42    1357.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1276.14    1277.04    1275.70    1276.32 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1361.15    1359.02    1358.62    1359.35  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 13    Aug 12    Aug 11    Aug 10     Aug 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1276.24   1280.84   1274.70   1261.80   1269.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1354.67   1359.88   1354.98   1348.51   1352.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1278.89; 200 - 1361.30 Low/day: 100 - 1274.81 200 - 1356.78  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

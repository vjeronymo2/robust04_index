			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATORS FORM LIFE CHAIN  </P> <P> The Times' coverage of the Oct. 7 Life Chain held in Torrance again included  the typical negatively biased terms "foes," "anti-abortion" and "protest"  ("Foes Form 'Life Chain' Along Streets," Metro, Oct. 8).  </P> <P> Many individuals involved in a variety of pro-life activities came together to  form the Southern California Life Chain organization.  </P> <P> We were also blessed with the endorsements of numerous church leaders and  pro-life organizations.  </P> <P> As an original member of the general Life Chain Committee, I know that an  invitation to participate in the life chain was extended to all churches in the  Los Angeles-Orange County areas and that the 30,000-plus participants were  Christians of all denominations, not just Catholics. The focus of the committee  was always on the prayerful and peaceful education of the general public that  "abortion kills children."  </P> <P> It was my humble privilege to, first, work with so many dedicated pro-lifers in  organizing the life chain, and, second, to stand with my fellow church members  to present our message on behalf of the defenseless unborn children.  </P> <P> LOUISE MEEHAN  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Link to influential Senator ROBERT MAXWELL used former Senator John Tower, the influential Republican, to seek US government assistance in 1988 for an aborted attempt to acquire 15 insolvent Texas savings-and-loans institutions, according to a former US bank regulatory official. Tower, who died in an air crash last year, was a paid consultant to Maxwell and served on the board of Macmillan, the publisher owned by Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC). In August 1988 Senator Tower went to see Mr Danny Wall, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the now-defunct agency that previously regulated the US savings-and-loan industry. The former Texan Senator met Mr Wall to argue on behalf of a bid by Maxwell for a group of 15 failing savings-and-loan institutions that were later declared inolvent, sold as a single package and renamed the Bluebonnet Savings Bank. According to documents obtained by the Financial Times, the Maxwell proposal asked the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to grant Maxwell 50 per cent of an estimated Dollars 86.3m of expected tax benefits. A Congressional investigator claimed at the weekend that 'Maxwell hired Tower to try and grease the savings-and-loan deal' because of his political influence. Mr Wall, who resigned in March 1990, said he saw 'nothing nefarious' in Tower's approach. After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower had a series of business ties to Maxwell, for whom he acted as a paid consultant. In April 1989 Tower was named by Maxwell to the board of directors of Macmillan. Maxwell also paid the former senator to serve as chairman of two Macmillan subsidiaries - Pergamon Brassey International Defence Publications, a publisher, and the Armed Forces Journal, a monthly magazine. Mr David Shaffer, the Macmillan chairman who was asked by a New York bankruptcy court to manage MCC's US assets after MCC filed last December for protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law, said Tower reported to him 'and was a very important conduit to the defence industry who brought in a lot of advertising'. Mr Shaffer, who declined to say how much Tower was paid by Macmillan, noted that Tower 'never attended any Macmillan board meetings while he was on the board'.</p>

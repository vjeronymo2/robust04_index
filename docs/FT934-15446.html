			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Start-ups highest since 1990 - In a Nutshell Nearly 107,000 new businesses started up in the second quarter of 1993, the largest number since the final three months of 1990 and 23 per cent more than in the same period of 1992, according to the latest edition of Barclays Bank's Small Business Bulletin. New starts were still outnumbered by closures, though at 130,000 these were 14 per cent lower than in the second quarter of 1992. In the first six months of the year, new starts rose 14 per cent to nearly 237,000. This increase reflected improving business optimism encouraged by low interest rates, falling inflation and the competitiveness of sterling's exchange rate. Barclays said it did not expect this rate of improvement to be maintained throughout 1993. It estimates that new starts this year will reach about 400,000, nearly 10 per cent more than in 1992. The most buoyant regions in the first half were East Anglia and the north-west of England. Contact Paragon Communications. Tel: 071 734 6030.</p>

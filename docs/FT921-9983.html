			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: Be a card . . . and make someone your Valentine - Some ways of bringing an extra touch of romance to that very special person in your life THERE are those for whom the very notion of sending even a card, let alone a present, for St Valentine's Day is quitec incomprehensible. Surely, they mutter, nobody could be quite so daft. Then there are others - and all the evidence seems to suggest there are plenty of them - for whom the day never passes without some wonderfully daffy notion winging its way across town, country or ocean. Hardened cynics, or those who feel they have said it all, done it all or just cannot be bothered, need not read on. Those who feel that perhaps a present or a charming gesture might bring a little fun or a little pleasure into somebody's life can choose between something as conventional as flowers, chocolates or champagne - or as off-beat as a flight in an ancient Tiger Moth. Here are just some of the options on offer. Poverty is no excuse - sweet, old-fashioned postcards can be found in antique shops such as Alfies Antique Market (13-25 Church Street, London NW8 8DT, tel. 071-723-6066) for as little as Pounds 3, while for Pounds 10 you could buy a blue, heart-shaped ashtray. If you are disorganised and busy (and who isn't?), just ring Paradigm Management (081-785-9822) with your Visa or Access number and they can send a full (Pounds 30) or half (Pounds 21.50) bottle of Laurent Perrier champagne, plus a large heart-shaped helium-filled balloon, to any part of greater London. The Museum Store (37 The Market, The Piazza, Covent Garden, London WC2E 8RF) has lots of charming, inexpensive ideas: a mini-volume of Love Quotes (Pounds 3.25) from the New York Public Library ('I like not only to be loved, but to be told I am loved.' - George Eliot); reproduction earrings (one black, one white faux pearl, Pounds 19.99) from the Goddess of Love in Rubens's 17th-century painting Venus before the Mirror; or the matrimony jug (Pounds 16.95) from the Longue Vue Collection, New Orleans. The South Bank Centre Craft Shop and Gallery at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1, is the place for crafts and one-off pieces. There, four post-graduate designers from the Royal College of Art have the sort of avant-garde pieces that catch the eye of people like Prince, Jazzie B, Paula Abdul and Enya, not to mention up-to-the-minute media folk. This is where you go to show you really are in touch with what's happening NOW. Everything from waistcoats to spectacles, from ear-rings to bodies and ties can be found at prices ranging from Pounds 20-250. Baskets of miniature roses, hyacinths, primulas or narcissus will be sent on The Day for Pounds 7.50 by The Flowersmith, 34 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London WC2 (tel. 071-240-6688). Or a posy of fresh roses, lilies, anemones, tulips and dill with silver/green foliage from Pounds 15. The ultimate present for the rugger fan: Pounds 2,000 buys a 10-year debenture for the new stand at Twickenham. Write to the Rugby Football Union, Twickenham, London TW1 1DZ (tel. 081-892-8161). Finally, if you are one of the not-so-little band without a nearest and dearest - do not despair. Buy yourself a present (it's a leap year, remember) and invest in membership of Drawing Down The Moon, the yuppie introduction agency. Membership sounds expensive (Pounds 646.25, although you get a 10 per cent discount if you join on your first visit), but for that you get a personal, in-depth interview (so, of course, have all the people to whom you are about to be introduced), and a year's active membership (which means plenty of introductions). Drawing Down The Moon will NOT take on people for whom it feels it will be unable to find suitable partners (for women, I am afraid, that means you should be under 43, and under 55 for men) and it takes on only what it describes as graduates, professional and business people or people in the creative world. (7-11 Kensington High Street, London, tel. 071-937-8880). Better, perhaps, than any consumer durable is a day to remember. A 90-year-old friend of ours, for instance, had the birthday of a lifetime when his son booked him a trip in a hot-air balloon. Red Letter will organise a range of special experiences - from a day's rally driving at Silverstone (Pounds 199) or a weekend learning to hang-glide (Pounds 95) to a flight in a Tiger Moth (Pounds 125, pictured here) or a pistol-shooting session (Pounds 39). For those whose tastes run to more passive treats, it would fix-up a day at a health spa (from Pounds 45) or a trip on the Orient Express (from Pounds 129); the list is endless. If you are interested, write to Red Letter Days, Freepost, London N3 1BR (or, to order in time for Valentine's Day, ring 081-343-0822). Red Letter sends a charming letter explaining the gift and giving all the options on day, time and location. The lucky recipient has about four months to decide and can also change it for any of the other 150 ideas (with a price adjustment if necessary, of course). For real sentimentality, the Victorians leave the rest of us standing. When it comes to a good old treacly wallow, Forget-Me-Nots, A Victorian Book of Love by Cynthia Hart, John Grossman and Tracy Gill (Pounds 6.99) is hard to beat although it carries the slight risk that it might put the loved-one off the whole thing for life. Forget-Me-Nots (in the immortal words of the frontispiece) 'celebrates these sweet sentiments and evokes them anew for dear friends, lovers and beloveds.' There are lots of authentically soppy Victorian drawings, cards and photographs to match the words. As somebody once said, memorably: 'Once you spend more than Pounds 8 on a watch, you are moving out of the realm of the strictly functional and into the realm of fantasy.' If fantasy, then you might as well do it properly. Chaumet's Anneau watch has a classically-plain and charming white face and solid gold frame and comes with a choice of bracelets made from semi-precious stones. The one photographed here is made from turquoise beads but you can choose between amethyst, haematite, lapis lazuli and pearls as well. Pounds 1,900 in semi-precious stones, Pounds 3,600 with pearl or gold beads. Chaumet is at 178 New Bond Street, London W1Y 9PD (tel. 071-493-5403). For HIM - some cuff-links, perhaps? But not just any old cuff-links: a little quelque chose from a jeweller as grand as Boucheron ought to go down a treat and could solve your present problems for years to come. First you give him the gold base (Pounds 425) and then (one by one) you give him the stones to put in them - leopardwood, tiger's eye, onyx and rock crystal are all Pounds 150 while coral is Pounds 350 and lapis lazuli Pounds 525. Also available by mail order. Yves St-Laurent's costume jewellery has gone a bundle on hearts this year. Whether it be necklaces, brooches, chains or earrings, hearts are everywhere. These earrings are gold-plated on pewter, with ruby-coloured and fuchsia stones, and come with a two-year guarantee (something that few costume jewellers offer). Pounds 80 from most good department stores including Harvey Nichols, Harrods, House of Fraser and Larizzi at Boston Spa. An 18-carat, gold-plated, heart-shaped brooch with blue stone, by Cabouchon, Pounds 19.99. Order by telephone: 081-877-3050. Lots more inexpensive chunky costume jewellery is available by mail order. Ask for the catalogue if you are interested.</p>

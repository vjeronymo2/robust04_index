			<p>BFN     [Text] The Barbados Labor Party [BLP] has refuted charges  that it is not ready for general elections. BLP public  relations person Tony Alton was responding to remarks by the  leader of the National Democratic Party, Dr. Richie Haynes, that  the BLP is not in a position to contest an upcoming election.  Mr. Alton said the leadership issue in the party has already  been settled, with Owen Arthur at the head. He also disclosed  that the BLP has candidates for all the constituencies and some,  he says, have already been elected.    [Begin Alton recording] Currently lifetime members [words  indistinct], each of them has indicated that they will, if  selected, run on behalf of the BLP again. There are several of  us that have been nominated and endorsed by the national council  to represent the party at the next election. These would be  (Liam Artley), Duncan Carter, Blaine Clark, (Romel Marshall),  and myself. There are another six nominations that are on  schedule for the end, rather, by the end of July. [end recording]    Meanwhile BLP MP Delisle Bradshaw is still not sure when he  is returning home. Bradshaw missed last week's historic  no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford as  he had to obtain medical treatment in Antigua. Speaking with  (Novodin Busta) from Antigua, Bradshaw indicated that he was  still in a lot of pain and was awaiting word from his physician  on when he could return to Barbados.    [Begin Bradshaw recording] I am still seeing my doctor. I am  hoping to be back, [pauses] will be returning to see my doctor  again on Friday. I hope that I will be fit to travel to return  home. [end recording]    Mr. Bradshaw also reiterated that he had intended to be in  Barbados for last week's vote. He said he left the 14th  Caribbean General Insurance Conference overseas ahead of its  conclusions when he heard that the debate on the motion was  pending. The MP noted that he is ready to defend his name and  respond to the rumors about why he missed the no-confidence  motion upon his return to Barbados. He noted that he would be  speaking to his party leader, constituents, and the Barbadian  public on this very contentious issue.    [Begin Bradshaw recording] I was in Belize some time last  week. Then last week, week before when I was called and told to  return home for the no-confidence motion, and I will return to  Barbados. [sentence as heard] [end recording]</p>

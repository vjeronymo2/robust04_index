			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> PARTY-CONTROL LAW TENTATIVELY OKD  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance that will  require those who throw loud and raucous parties to reimburse the city for the  cost of dispatching police responding to neighborhood complaints.  </P> <P> Police officials said that during the past year officers answered 845 calls  about party disturbances throughout the city, compared to 799 the previous  year.  </P> <P> "It's beginning to be outrageous," Councilman Glen McAdoo said of the number of  disturbance calls generated each year. "The neighborhoods are not designed to  have nightclubs in the middle of them, and that's exactly what's happened."  </P> <P> Sgt. Bob Gardner, who helped write the ordinance, said police will first issue  a written warning to those responsible for a disturbance complaint. Gardner  said those individuals will then be billed for any additional calls the police  have to make.  </P> <P> Although the cost of police responses will vary, Gardner said, the least that  loud revelers can expect to pay is $250.  </P> <P> Gardner said he has talked to officials of several cities in Los Angeles and  Orange counties that have enacted similar laws, and they said the laws were  successful in reducing party disturbances.  </P> <P> The council is expected to give final approval to the party ordinance at its  meeting next Monday. The ordinance will take effect 30 days later. CARLOS V.  LOZANO  </P></p>

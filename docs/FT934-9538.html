			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Plans for new Lloyd's trust scrapped on fears of lack of capital PLANS TO launch a Lloyd's investment trust were scrapped yesterday, indicating that the appetite of institutional investors for new Lloyd's corporate capital schemes may be reaching its limit. Lazard Brothers, Cazenove and Octavian Group, one of the largest Lloyd's agencies, issued a pathfinder prospectus to raise capital for the Nelson Lloyd's Trust last Thursday. But yesterday Nelson announced that 'in current market conditions there could not be sufficient assurance that the company would be able to raise the initial target capital of Pounds 60m on which its investment and underwriting strategies were based'. Mr Nigel Rogers of Octavian said 'institutions have set aside a certain amount of money but there is not a bottomless pit'. Nelson had 'come a little bit late in the day. Today was the day we set for responses. Some were good but it was clear we were not going to meet the target figure.' The withdrawal follows other setbacks for backers of Lloyd's funds. HCG Lloyd's Investment Trust and CLM Insurance Fund scaled down the amount of capital raised, because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient 'good quality' capacity on Lloyd's syndicates. Last week Johnson Fry, the financial services group, abandoned plans to launch a 'fund of funds' to attract retail investors after raising only Pounds 8m of its Pounds 15m target. Even so, over the past two weeks 10 funds have raised more than Pounds 500m from institutional and retail investors. The biggest trust, the London Insurance Market Investment Trust (LIMIT) sponsored by James Capel and Samuel Montagu, successfully placed an issue for Pounds 280m with institutions last Wednesday. At least five other investment companies and trusts plan to raise up to Pounds 650m in launches over the next few days. One Lloyd's agency, the Hiscox Group, which has already launched one investment trust, is so confident about prospects that yesterday it unveiled plans to raise a further Pounds 25m for a second trust. The new trust, Hiscox Dedicated, will provide capacity only to the four syndicates managed by Hiscox Syndicates, the group's managing agency. Charterhouse Tilney will support the new fund.</p>

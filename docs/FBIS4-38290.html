			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: In the wake of the aggressive Israeli  attacks in the Lebanese skies and on the Lebanese territories  and the occupied Palestinian lands, Yitzhaq Rabin has made  threatening statements to undermine Syria's firm quest for a  just and comprehensive peace. As a matter of fact, this Israeli  pressure is nothing new. These statements are as old as the  peace process launched by the Madrid conference. For, similar  statements have continued to be made since the start of the  Washington bilateral talks up to date. Their pressure has taken  the form of evasion and maneuvering. However, they have now  begun to take the form of threatening aggression since the  conclusion of distorted and flawed agreements, such as the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The entire world community has seen Israel attempting to  kill  the peace process, and to preoccupy it with formalities and  procedural matters in a bid to circumvent any discussion of  substantive issues. This has been meant to evade the  requirements of peace; namely, complete Israeli withdrawal from  the occupied Arab territories in compliance with the well-known  UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425.    In the wake of this evasion and these maneuvers, Israel  posed  insincere questions about the kind of peace Syria is offering.  It is to be recalled that the peace Syria is offering is  crystal clear. It has to be just and comprehensive. This was  well put by His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad when he said  that Syria is offering full peace in return for complete  withdrawal. Since then, we have heard statements by Yitzhaq  Rabin about withdrawal on the Golan, rather than from the Golan.  Then, we heard provocative Israeli statements regarding an  Israeli referendum on the future of the occupied Golan, as if  the UN Security Council did not pass a resolution providing for  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in 1967; namely, Resolution  242, which was later augmented by Resolution 338. Israel has  behaved as if withdrawal from the Arab territories is an issue  that must remain hostage to Israeli whims. As a matter of fact,  this withdrawal is required in compliance with the  aforementioned UN resolution to vindicate right and achieve  peace in the interest of the region and the world at large.    It is necessary to note here that the international  community's position, which has not thus far been firm enough,  has encouraged Israel to hold the peace process in disregard.  As for the Israeli evasion, it has produced flawed and partial  solutions, which run counter to the just and comprehensive peace  that is required. By contrast, the international community has  seen Arab Syria augmenting its desire for just peace with a  clear and strong position grounded in adherence to Arab rights,  which are at the heart of just peace, taking care to safeguard  the peace process. This has frustrated Israel's goal of  thwarting the peace process.    The world community has praised this Syrian position, as  demonstrated at the Geneva summit between His Excellency  President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. For  the U.S. President declared that peace must be comprehensive,  noting that Syria holds the key to peace, and that there can be  no peace without Syria.    Throughout the peace talks, the world community has seen a  Syrian Arab eagerness to safeguard the peace process. Likewise,  it has also seen a firm Syrian Arab position, as manifested in  the working paper Syria submitted to the Israeli negotiators at  one of the rounds of Washington bilateral talks.    There is no denying that there are many things Israel can  do.  Nonetheless, there are two things Israel can do nothing about.  First, Israel cannot undermine Syria's firm and noble quest for  just and comprehensive peace, which must be grounded in complete  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the  occupied Arab territories, for this quest is attested to by the  world public. Second, Israel cannot weaken the firm Syrian Arab  position, which is, indeed, the position of all Arabs. This is  a fact that is widely known to all those engaged in peace  efforts, headed by the cosponsors of the peace process.</p>

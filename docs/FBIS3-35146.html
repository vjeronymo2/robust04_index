			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Transitional National Assembly has condemned the  report on Sudan presented by the rapporteur of the UN Human  Rights (?Committee), Gaspar Biro, which described Islamic law  and punishment as contradictory to UN charters and incompatible  with human rights. The assembly asked the UN secretary general  to (?withdraw) the report immediately because it brought into  disrepute the faith of the Islamic nation. It was a flagrant  challenge to all divine religions and human values and  destructive to human rights and international charters.    In a report on this matter, the Assembly called on all  parliaments in Arab and Islamic states and others which respect  human rights and values to decisively reject this defamation.    Meanwhile, Mr. 'Abd-al-Aziz Shiddu, justice minister and  attorney general, stressed that Gaspar Biro's report is clearly  a conspiracy against [words indistinct] the West's design to  destroy Islam and all other divine religions. He said the  report had a secular base which called for the separation of  religion and the state and used the United Nations as a tool to  achieve this.</p>

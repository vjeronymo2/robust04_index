			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FISCHER TIES RECORD, BUT MARINA WINS  </P> <P> Debbie Fischer tied the state record for most three-point baskets in a season,  hitting three Saturday night to raise her total to 66, but her Edison team lost  to Marina, 55-45, in a Sunset League girls' basketball game at Edison.  </P> <P> Melisa Sortino had 28 points to lead Marina, which improved to 14-4 overall and  3-0 in league play.  </P> <P> Fischer finished with just 11 points, due at least in part to Yorke's  man-to-man defense against her. Yorke had six steals to go with to her 12  points.  </P> <P> Edison is 9-5 and 1-2.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "R.C.": "European Elections: Delors' Anger"] </F>   [Text] Jacques Delors intended to be discreet. He said he  wanted to observe a reserved attitude as president of the  European Commission during the French European election  campaign. During the presentation of Europe Day at the Odeon  yesterday, organized by the European Movement, the outgoing  Commission president nonetheless seized the opportunity to  express his "anger" and "disappointment" at the "timidity" of  the pro-Europeans who do not dare "admit" that "the European  idea transcends political divisions." On the other hand, the  anti-Europeans are much more aggressive, producing numerous  "glaring inaccuracies" and spouting "nonsense" about Brussels.  This lack of combativeness in France among those who claim to  believe in Europe is, in his opinion, unique in Europe: "There  is not a single country in the rest of the European Union in  which things are going as they are in France."    What about the European crisis? At most, it is "a crisis of  growth" but not a "regression." He also warned those who,  "forgetting the past," run the risk of new "wars of religion."  And yet, the example of Bosnia proves, he thinks, that Europe  is less protected than ever from a tragic "confusion between  ethnic group and nation." As for the Maastricht Treaty, it did  not take account of the reservations expressed by the  Commission. A treaty which he nonetheless defended in  retrospect because "Europe's progress was at stake."</p>

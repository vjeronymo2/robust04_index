			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong session for ICI ICI was at the front of the market yesterday with an advance of 45 to 719p, fuelled by bullish speculation on the prospects for the company's petrochemicals business on the part of SG Warburg analyst Mr Michael Stone. He told Warburg's sales force at the morning meeting that Europe's ethylene producers were likely to succeed in their attempt to control supply and that ICI could benefit to the tune of an extra Pounds 100m on its trading profits as early as 1995. His briefing followed a meeting of the Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe (APPE), after which most petrochemicals groups said they were optimistic about getting agreement to cut back production next month. Other brokers, even those who are ICI buyers, were keen to knock down the tale. One said: 'If the rise is in direct response to the APPE, it is grossly overdone. That is, in our view, a total over-reaction to the news.' But UK equity market specialists said that if the plan is agreed by producers, the European Commission still has to grant it approval. Also, overproduction in ethylene is a global problem, with European manufacturers tending to be smaller and less efficient than those in the US and the Far East.</p>

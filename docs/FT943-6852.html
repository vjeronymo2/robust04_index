Directors said current operations were inadequate to enable the company to trade profitably. A recapitalisation and acquisition were required to secure its future. A number of potential acquisitions had been reviewed and an announcement to shareholders was likely in the near future. Sales fell to Pounds 636,000 (Pounds 654,000).

Losses per share widened to 3.6p (2.8p).</p>

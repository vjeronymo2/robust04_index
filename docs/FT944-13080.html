			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / New trademark treaty agreed A new international treaty to simplify protection of trademarks was signed in Geneva yesterday after five years of negotiation involving nearly 100 countries. The Trademark Law Treaty, negotiated under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo), will make it easier for companies to register trademarks, including service marks, in their home countries and internationally. It will come into force three months after a minimum of five countries have formally ratified it. Some 300,000 registered trademarks used internationally are lodged with Wipo, but the total registered worldwide with national trademark authorities is put at 7m. The new treaty lays down common procedures for national trademark registration, cuts down on red tape, harmonises the duration of initial and renewal registration to ten years and gives service marks the same legal status as trademarks. Among 35 states which signed the treaty yesterday were the US, Russia, China, six European Union members including Britain, several east European nations and a number of developing countries.</p>

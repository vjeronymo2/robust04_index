			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Sunday wage proposal defeated An attempt by Labour MPs to introduce a statutory requirement that shop workers should be paid double time for working on Sundays was defeated by a majority of 30 (299-269) in the Commons last night. Before the vote was taken Mr Peter Lloyd, junior home office minister, warned that such a requirement would be likely to undermine the partial liberalisation of Sunday trading hours for shops in England and Wales. While accepting that some large retailers would be able to afford to pay double time for staff employed on Sundays, he said smaller shops unable to do so would eventually be driven out of business. Mr Lloyd said that as a result the number of shops open on Sundays would be cut, thus denying shoppers the freedom of choice that was intended to be the main object of the Sunday trading bill. Ms Joan Ruddock, Labour's shadow home affairs minister, maintained that it was only 'fair and just' that workers deprived of the opportunity of spending Sundays with their families should receive a premium payment. She said the imposition of a statutory requirement on employers to pay double time would also recognise the 'special nature of Sunday'. Ms Ruddock warned that, unless required to pay double time by law, some employers were likely to try to engage new staff on the basis that Sunday was a normal working day. She suggested that unless employers were legally bound to pay double time, the attitude of some MPs who voted for the bill when it was given a second reading by a majority of 75 in December, was likely to change.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> CARTER OCTET AT INSTITUTE  </P> <P> There was a certain appropriateness to the appearance of the John Carter Octet  at the first concert in the Southern California Institute of Architecture's new  music series Saturday night in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Carter and SCI-ARC share vigorously contemporary views of their respective  creative disciplines, and the iconoclastic sounds of the Octet sounded  perfectly at home in the warehouse high-tech environment of the school's main  building.  </P> <P> The program consisted of six extended selections from Carter's "Castles of  Ghana" Suite. While the clarinetist is a firm advocate of unfettered  improvisation, "Castles" was a through-composed piece rich with fascinating  textures and colors. Acerbic dissonances, leaping melodies and brooding bass  ostinatos dominated the work. A series of passionate "free" improvisations --  most notably those by Carter, saxophonist Charles Owens, cornetist Bobby  Bradford and bassist Roberto Miranda -- circled through and around the composed  sections.

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Abnormal items put Aztec Mining in black Aztec Mining Company, which is facing an unwanted bid from Mr Robert de Crespigny's Poseidon Gold, yesterday reported a turnround in profitability last year, with net operating profits of ADollars 12.8m (USDollars 9.2m) for the 12 months, compared with a loss of ADollars 50.8m in 1992 The improvement, however, was due to abnormal items. The previous year included a charge of ADollars 459.8m, while the recent 12 months benefited from a gain of ADollars 9.6m, related to the disposal of an investment in Discovery Petroleum. At the operating level, before tax and abnormals, Aztec made a small loss in 1993 of ADollars 41.8m, compared with an equally modest profit of ADollars 1.2m in 1992. Aztec noted that the state of base metal prices had made life difficult last year, but said that 'continuing improvements' at the Bounty Gold Mine, and 'increasingly stable operating conditions' at the Woodcutters and Scuddles zinc mines had 'significantly reduced the full impact of the adverse economic climate.</p>

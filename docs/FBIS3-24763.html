			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Saturday, the government of the Central African  country of Burundi sacked all members of the Constitutional  Court because they refused to accept the appointment of the new  president, Cyprien Ntaryamira.    The announcement was made in Brussels by the Burundi  Embassy.    Two weeks ago the Burundi parliament chose the Agriculture  Minister, a Hutu, Ntaryamira to succeed President Ndadaye also  from the Hutu people. He was killed in a failed coup d'etat  three months ago.    The constitutional successor was also killed in the coup.  Due to the unsettled state of the country it was impossible to  hold general elections.    After the impasse the two Hutu judges of the Constitutional  Court resigned. The other five, all Tutsis, have now been  dismissed.    The embassy says that Ntaryamira's nomination as president  can now be ratified.</p>

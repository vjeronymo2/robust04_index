			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / US bid values TIP Europe at Pounds 71m: Angus Foster on GE Capital's move into European trailer rental GE CAPITAL, the fast-growing financial services arm of General Electric of the US, yesterday made a recommended cash offer for TIP Europe, the trailer rental company. The 42p a share cash bid values TIP Europe at Pounds 71m, a premium to its recent share price but well below its trading level before a refinancing crisis in 1991. GE Capital is the largest trailer rental company in the US and has been looking to expand in Europe since 1991. Mr David Callear, chief executive, TIP Europe, said the price offered was 'reasonably healthy'. He said UK business was improving, but the outlook on the continent was poor. The offer 'brings an immediate confidence to the business', he said. TIP Europe's shares jumped from 25 1/2 p to 40 1/2 p, their highest level since last year. The shares collapsed from 175p in 1990 when the company was hit by the UK recession. GE Capital's offer price is pitched just above a 1991 five-for-six rights issue at 40p, which followed the refinancing. The company's largest shareholder, the Dutch investment company HAL Investments (UK) which holds 9.9 per cent, has said it will accept the offer unless a higher bid is made. TIP Europe's directors, who hold 0.6 per cent, have accepted the offer and recommended it to shareholders. Mr M van der Vorm, a director in both companies, has expressed no view because of potential conflicts of interest. However, a large proportion of the shares are held by individuals and it is unclear whether they will accept. Tiphook, Europe's largest trailer rental company, holds a 5.4 per cent stake in TIP Europe, which it took in 1991 when it feared GE Capital was about to bid. Mr Robert Montague, chairman, Tiphook, said he was not surprised by the offer. He said a rival bid from Tiphook would raise monopoly questions. TIP Europe yesterday announced a fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.3m in the six months to January 31. UK profits rose, helped by higher rental rates, but continental profits were hit by falling volumes. Mobiel, a modular building supplier, performed poorly. Turnover fell from Pounds 54.9m to Pounds 52.7m while earnings slipped 43 per cent to 1.01p. The interim dividend was cut from 0.64p to 0.4p, which shareholders will still receive under the offer.</p>

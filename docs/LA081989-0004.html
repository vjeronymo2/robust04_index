			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIRCUS ANIMALS' PLIGHT  </P> <P> I recently attended the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and was  appalled by what I saw.  </P> <P> At the beginning of the second act, live bears were made to perform on motor  bikes in apparently uncomfortable positions. Bears were chained on their backs  so they could balance batons that resembled cigarettes. One bear, being led  away, was jerked backward several times and almost knocked off balance.  </P> <P> Watching the bears, seals, elephants, tigers, etc., I could not but feel  remorse for the animals and their plight.  </P> <P> I have always loved the circus, or thought I did. This time, I felt like a  little boy who had been told there is no Santa Claus.  </P> <P> My consciousness has been raised. Never again will I attend a performance where  "wild animals" are used for the entertainment of humans.  </P> <P> MARTIN P. REGAN  </P> <P> Eagle Rock  </P></p>

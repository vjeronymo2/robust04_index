			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The frown on the face of the tiger - Investing in . . . Korea THE ROAR of South Korea, one of the Far East's four tigers, has been subdued. Along with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, South Korea was one of the Far East economic miracles which showed that countries could industrialise on the strength of their exports. An average 13.6 per cent growth in the volume of exports between 1980 and 1988 led to gross national product growth averaging 9.2 per cent during the same period. The Seoul stock market index had an impressive rise, increasing from 127.3 in 1982 to 909.7 in 1989, according to figures from Goldman Sachs. Since then the picture has been different. The market hit its lowest level in almost five years last week with the index down to 559 - a drop of more than 40 per cent in the past three years - in spite of the intervention of a government stock market stabilisation fund. 'Korea has been a very sorry market since April 1989,' said Michael Watt, investment manager of Touche Remnant's Pacific Investment Trust, which has ranked consistently highly in the Far East excluding Japan sector. The Korea weighting in the fund has been halved since 1989 to only 6 per cent today. The main problem has been the erosion of South Korea's international competitiveness in the last five years, caused in part by a jump in wages. Industry prospered on cheap labour but, with the introduction of full democracy in 1987, organised labour grew, leading to strikes and pay rises as workers tried to keep up with higher consumer prices and climbing housing costs. Inflationary pressure was fuelled by an expansion of the money supply. The recession in the US, the main export market for Korean goods, did not help. Nevertheless, the economy is one of the world's fastest expanding, with an expected growth rate of at least 7 per cent this year following a gain of 8.4 per cent in 1991. It still has to bring down inflation - currently about 7 per cent - and to deal with the steep interest rates and a trade deficit of Dollars 8.7bn last year. These obstacles make it difficult for Hugh Young, managing director of Abtrust in Singapore, to be positive about Korea. 'The market has a lot of problems with the level of corporate debt. So far this year we've seen 11 quoted bankruptcies. The level of bankruptcies is well up in the hundreds. This is all due to corporate debt levels - a gearing of five to one is not uncommon,' he said. But many fund managers are optimistic and see potential attractions in Korea for the private investor. Save &amp; Proper has chosen this month to launch a single country Korea onshore unit trust. Qais Zakaria, manager of the fund said: 'We understand the negatives but we are anticipating a pick-up in 1993 based on a recovery in the world market. The Korean market is not attractive now but it is better to launch early in order to pick up stocks cheaply.' Julian Tregoning, director of Save &amp; Prosper, underlined the risks and said the Korea fund would carry a warning that it should only form part of an investment portfolio but, 'taking a 10 year view we believe that the Korean economy will be second only to Japan, with China as the unknown factor.' Foreign interest in Korea was stimulated in January and February by the opening of the market to direct foreign investment. This led to a brief rally. However, Jeremy Hill, chairman of the Schroder Korea Fund, launched last December to take advantage of the new regulations, described the opening of the market as 'very disappointing'. 'By the time the government opened up the market, the economy was in retreat and the stock market had fallen and is still falling,' he said. He too believes the longer term outlook is quite different. 'We're bullish looking to a year or so. Korea is tremendously dynamic and the basic economy is strong. Its problems, such as labour shortages are really those of success. In the short term there is a lack of confidence and an overhang of stock in the market which should get worked through with time.' The government is lifting the 10 per cent limit placed on foreign ownership of shares to 25 per cent, and has allowed foreigners to acquire an 8 per cent holding in either Pohang Iron &amp; Steel or Korea Electric Power Corporation. The two companies account for almost 13 per cent of total market capitalisation. Collective funds, in Korea only or in the Far East as a whole, offer the safest way into the market. Unit trusts had been hampered by regulations until March this year, when the Securities and Investments Board added Korea to its approved securities market for unit trusts, removing the 10 per cent limit on participation in an unapproved market. Peter Irving, fund manager of Schroder's Korea-Europe investment trust, says: 'The arguments in favour of Korea are long term; 1993 and 1994 could be good years if there is a worldwide recovery but 1992 will be unexciting as the stock market digests the implications of a slower economy.' Sectors which are expected to do well are export-oriented, low cost high technology producers, such as Samsung Electronics, which has an international reputation in the semi-conductor business. Watt also singles out service companies such as Korea Mobile Telephone Corporation. The smaller companies sector, which has performed well over the past 18 months, has fallen out of favour with managers. Watt says he will be increasing the exposure of the Pacific Investment Trust to Korea later in the year. 'Company ratings have come down to sensible levels. The stock market is highly geared, so under the right conditions - a rebound in company profits and a good world economy - the market in Korea could double. That is by no means impossible over three years.' These contingencies make it a market reserved for what he describes as the 'highly specialised and affluent investor.'  ------------------------------------------------------ FACTFILE: KOREA  ------------------------------------------------------ Population 1991:                               43.21m Gross Domestic product 1991:          Pounds 159.92bn Market capitalisation:                  Pounds 51.5bn Inflation rate, (April 1992):            7.2 per cent Interest rate (March):                  14.7 per cent Exchange rate:                   Pounds 1 = Won 1,497  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

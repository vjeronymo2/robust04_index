			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / South Korean president seeks to cool row with North South Korea's President Kim Young-sam yesterday called for greater diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis over North Korea's refusal to open its nuclear sites to international inspection. His call came as North Korea said it had been 'driven into a corner' by US and international demands for full nuclear inspections, and reiterated it would withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) if US pressure continued. Speaking after talks with China's Premier Li Peng, Mr Kim appeared to support Beijing's call for patience in dealing with North Korea. 'Through consultation and dialogue I believe we can solve this problem smoothly without any difficulties,' he said. Mr Kim has sent his foreign minister, Mr Han Sung-joo, to the US to press for heightened diplomatic efforts. Mr Han would also visit Russia early next month for consultations on the nuclear issue, he said. China opposes US efforts at the UN to set a deadline for Pyongyang to comply with international demands for access to its nuclear sites for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors. Beijing has indicated it might accept a statement by the Security Council president calling for North Korean co-operation, but only if it was couched in general terms and did not foreshadow economic sanctions. China's foreign ministry said on Monday that dialogue was 'the only effective way' to settle the issue. China is apprehensive of action that might place its unpredictable neighbour in a corner. Mr Kim used his visit to Beijing to urge China to play a more active role in seeking to wean North Korea from its self-imposed isolation. 'We have never wanted the North to be isolated and will spare no effort to help Pyongyang join the international community as a responsible member,' Mr Kim said at Beijing university yesterday. This approach mirrors one advocated by China. Chinese officials have said repeatedly that the west and especially the US should make gestures towards North Korea, such as steps towards diplomatic recognition. Mr Han said in Beijing before leaving for Washington that although China opposed sanctions against Pyongyang, it did not reject Seoul's view that pressure on North Korea could be increased later if required. Mr Han denied there was a wide gap between China's position and that of the US and South Korea. 'There's only a difference in the intensity of preference,' he said. South Korean officials have warned that sanctions against Pyongyang without China's co-operation would be ineffective. China supplies the bulk of North Korea's oil. It also ships foodstuffs. China has criticised US and South Korean plans to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercises suspended last year in an effort to encourage North Korea to be more co-operative. Beijing has also counselled against the deployment of US Patriot missiles in South Korea. These criticisms are regarded by western officials in Beijing as 'pro-forma'. China is thought to want to continue giving the appearance of supporting North Korea on some issues in the hope that ultimately this may bolster its leverage in Pyongyang. Meanwhile in Bangkok, in a rare briefing by a North Korean official, Mr Li Do Sop, Pyongyang's ambassador to Thailand, denied his government wanted to build nuclear weapons, saying it had neither the capacity nor the money to do so. Explaining why North Korea has barred IAEA inspectors from fully examining all its nuclear sites, Mr Li said this was a response to outside pressure. 'They forced us too much, they drove us into a corner so much that we reacted,' he said, calling North Koreans the 'victims' of US hostility. 'The US's pressure-bound machinations will result in driving us completely out of the NPT.' Mr Li avoided the bellicose language of some earlier North Korean statements and described his country's military posture as completely defensive. Asked why his country had developed long-range missiles, he replied: 'We have to increase our defensive capacity to defend our sovereignty and our dignity.' He insisted the nuclear issue should be resolved as part of a package deal agreed by Washington and Pyongyang last month that included an IAEA inspection, a proposal for the exchange of envoys between North and South Korea, and the suspension of the US-South Korean 'Team Spirit' military exercise. Each side now accuses the other of breaking the agreement; the US and South Korea are planning to go ahead with Team Spirit. 'The US does not have real intentions to solve nuclear problems through negotiations or talks,' Mr Li said. 'It is their intention to stifle our republic, destroy our republic.' He ruled out a military first strike by North Korea, but added: 'If they kill one of us, then one of them should also be killed.' On the threat of economic sanctions against North Korea, Mr Li said his country was already under economic pressure from the US and Japan and was accustomed to self-sufficiency. 'The people have no worries about their housing, clothes or their food, or any worries about medical care,' he said. 'At this moment, our people are saying they are happy.'</p>

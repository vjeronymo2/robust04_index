			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by Milan </F> Rusko; place and date not given: "Presenting Slovakia  Correctly"]    [Text] Diplomacy is one of the most important instruments  for shaping opinion about Slovakia throughout the world.  Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan expressed his views on this and  other Slovak foreign policy tasks in an interview for PRAVDA.    [Rusko] Shortly after entering office, you expressed the  view that assisting Slovakia's economy is also a task for our  foreign policy. How can your department fulfill this task?    [Kukan] I am convinced that highlighting the economic  dimension of foreign service work is one of our most pressing  tasks. Our representative offices must become more actively  involved in looking for ways to help the Slovak economy. This  means adopting a pragmatic and new course of action, perhaps  even to the detriment of traditional diplomacy, toward these  issues. Apart from emphasis on the comprehensive functioning of  our diplomatic service, we are also orienting our ambassadors  and other diplomats toward forging intensive contacts with  business circles and the financial sphere in host countries and  toward increasing the information available to potential  partners. Presenting Slovakia and its domestic political  situation correctly and objectively is essential because foreign  investors, in considering activity in our country, want to know  what they are getting themselves into and that they are making a  purposeful investment. Therefore, the country's political  stability is also important.    [Rusko] What do you think of the stage the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) has reached? Has it  not already passed its zenith?    [Kukan] This question, for example, came up in discussion  during my recent visit to Canada. In my opinion, the CSCE is  still an important institution; it has not yet exhausted its  potential. It is necessary to vitalize its activity, especially  in maintaining peace on the continent and in preparing and  dispatching groups of observers or delegations to areas of  conflict. The CSCE can play a positive role there, even given  the existence of other mechanisms. It is necessary to  institutionalize its mechanisms more thoroughly. There was often  a lack of consensus in decisionmaking in the past. Perhaps for  this reason the impression was given that it is declining in  importance. I think it could still do a great deal.    [Rusko] Do you think that, in time, it could also have its  own military-security structures alongside NATO and the Western  European Union?    [Kukan] This is highly unlikely.    [Rusko] Various points of view are also being expressed  about the justification for the Visegrad Four (the Czech  Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia). What is your view?    [Kukan] In our opinion, the Visegrad Four should continue to  function as a free alliance, without establishing institutions.  This alliance could be used for consultations and for  coordinating certain foreign policy steps. Representatives from  the individual member countries have differing views on the  justification for the Visegrad Four, but, as long as the  grouping exists, Slovakia will advocate that it continues to  function.    [Rusko] At the recent meeting involving seven presidents in  Litomysl, it became apparent that there is no unanimous  interpretation of the political term "Central Europe." Lech  Walesa at least twice publicly expressed his opposition to using  this term. Some others admitted that it is, to say the least,  difficult to precisely define this term in view of the  political, but especially economic, differences among the  individual countries in it. What is your interpretation?    [Kukan] The term "Central Europe" has not really been  defined precisely. In the wake of the political changes on the  continent and the eradication of political bipolarity, this term  began to be employed instead of the former ideological term  "East Europe." At first, international organizations began to  speak about "Central and East Europe," and now they only speak  about "Central Europe," but no one can say what belongs there.  It is possible to speak about Central Europe as a free and, in  specific instances of economic, political, and security  contacts, purposefully perceived subregion of the Continent of  Europe in which more intensive relations could be developed. We  are interested in them, and we consider them to be a form of  rapprochement with the whole of Europe. After all, our  relations--for example, with the countries that belong to the  European Union and with the other countries preparing for  entry--have been defined. Similarly, in the security sphere, we  have acknowledged the Partnership for Peace--our presentation  document should be ready in the very near future--as our road  toward NATO. It is unequivocal.    [Rusko] However, because of these very objectives of certain  countries, Russia has recently modified its stance. It has  modified it with regard to the Partnership for Peace and also,  it seems, with regard to NATO. What is the attitude adopted by  our foreign policy toward the topical perceptions of Russian  diplomacy?    [Kukan] We have emphasized many times in our talks with our  partners in Europe and overseas--and we concurred in this--that  our interest lies in ensuring that the situation in Russia is  stable and that the proreform and prodemocratic forces prevail  and govern society. From this point of view, it is essential to  keep on emphasizing that our interest in integration with NATO  and other European structures does not mean we have any hostile  intentions toward Russia. On the contrary, there is room for  cooperation with Russia, especially in the economic sphere.  Naturally, we see a focal point in this, but we also want to  have normal mutual political relations at the level of sovereign  states and corresponding to the appropriate norms of  international law and diplomacy.    [Rusko] We have good relations with all neighboring  states; only in our relations with Hungary are certain elements  of tension palpable. In your opinion, how could we get rid of  this tension?    [Kukan] By means of a calm, matter-of-fact, and continuous  dialogue that would create a favorable atmosphere for gradually  resolving the issues on which we have different views. We want  to emphasize that the Slovak side is ready for such a dialogue.    [Rusko] During your recent visit to the United States, you,  according to the U.S. press, also discussed the sale of products  from the Slovak arms industry. Could you tell our readers about  the outcome of these talks?    [Kukan] In this case, the reports were distorted. Within  the framework of my program, I had lunch in Washington with  eight representatives of the U.S. press, actually from  influential dailies such as THE WASHINGTON POST, THE NEW YORK  TIMES, and so on, and we spoke about all sorts of things. We  also discussed arms sales; they asked me about this, and I  explained to them the kind of problems we have with conversion  and what the more than 90-percent reduction in production  compared with 1989 has meant for Slovakia. And, within the  framework of the general conversation, I told them that the  government is considering a partial renewal of production and  possible arms exports, but we will not export them to high-risk  regions of conflict. I said this to U.S. journalists, but I did  not negotiate with the U.S. side about any arms sales.    [Rusko] A contingent of Pakistani troops is to come to  Slovakia and will undergo training here for service in UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Force] units.    [Kukan] I discussed these issues with UN officials during my  recent visit to the United States. They assessed positively our  willingness to provide this opportunity. They noted it, and  Slovakia has thus scored a few points. I view this as  assistance and cooperation within the framework of the United  Nations.    [Rusko] Since we are talking about the United Nations, has a  decision been made yet on Slovakia's permanent representative,  who will take over from you?    [Kukan] No decision has been made yet. Someone has just been  nominated; therefore, I will not mention any names. However, we  envisage that he would take up his post sometime in July so that  he can become familiar with the working environment and  conditions in the United Nations before the start of the next UN  General Assembly session in September.    [Rusko] Even before you entered office, there was talk about  reducing the number of Slovak representative offices. What are  the prospects?    [Kukan] We would not like to reduce their number. We proceed  from the premise that the number of representative offices--63,  these include embassies, permanent missions, consulates general,  and consulates--is not many. After all, countries comparable  with us perhaps have more representative offices than the Slovak  Republic. We are under a great deal of pressure; it is possible  that we will have to adopt some budget measures, but we want, to  say the least, to maintain this number of representative offices.    [Rusko] Preparing for the conference to be held at the end  of May in Paris on issues concerning stability in Europe is one  of the topical tasks facing our diplomatic service. What would  the Slovak side like to come up with there?    [Kukan] In preparing for this important event, we are  proceeding from the premise that the Pact on Stability should  respect the interests of all of the participants on an equal  basis. There should be neither "victors" nor "vanquished" in it.</p>

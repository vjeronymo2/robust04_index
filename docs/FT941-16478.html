			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: US airlines The US transportation secretary's proposals to allow foreigners to increase their ownership of US airlines from 25 per cent to 49 per cent will raise a small cheer among high-flying European airlines. The move seemingly represents a further step towards liberalisation of the skies. But the US Congress has yet to have its say; it is not yet clear what the US will demand from European governments in return. Moreover, at present, all it would mean for European airlines is that they could buy bigger stakes in loss-making businesses. The US market may have experienced a pick-up in demand as economic recovery has gathered pace. With the exception of USAir, all the major carriers have posted third-quarter profits. But a recent bout of seasonal discounting has again disfigured the market. The growth of airlines such as Southwest Airlines, which offers cheap point-to-point services rather than the traditional hub-and-spoke operations, will also limit the scale of any profits upswing. US carriers are having to respond to such pressures with ever more inventive means of cutting costs. United's plan to sell stock to its unions represents the boldest move. USAir is attempting to cut operating costs by minimising the time its airplanes spend on the ground. Besides, European carriers' ambitions to expand in the US may be limited by worries of their own. Most state-owned European airlines have far more bloated cost structures. There is also a danger that concealed forms of state subsidy in Europe will keep excess capacity in the air, with the same devastating impact on industry profitability as Chapter 11 produced in the US.</p>

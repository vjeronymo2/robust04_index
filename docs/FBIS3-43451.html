			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Political Rights Organization, the PRO, has been  launched. The PRO, which was launched yesterday, will campaign  for amnesty for rightwing political prisoners. In a statement,  PRO Chairman (Avril Budd) said task groups have been formed to  investigate the conviction of rightist political prisoners. The  task groups will also investigate the reasons for the release of  ANC [African National Congress] and PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] prisoners who were arrested for crimes such as the  King William's Town Golf Club attack and the St. James Church  massacre.    The statement says PRO intends to draw public attention to  the plight of hundreds of policemen who were imprisoned and will  also demand their immediate release. (Budd) says PRO wants the  government to either charge or release right-wingers being held  under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. It will also ask  for right-wing prisoners to be removed from the Soweto Prison  where (Budd) claims they are at the mercy of the ANC-alligned  police union, Popcru [Police and Prison's Civil Rights Union].</p>

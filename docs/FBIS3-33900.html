He denied  that Qatar's policy toward Israel is aimed against any of its  neighbors. However, he said that this policy is independent and  that there are "differences between us and the other Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] states in this connection, but they  are not major differences." The Qatari minister confirmed that  he met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last Sunday.  He also confirmed that Qatar is making contacts with Israel  regarding a natural gas deal, but it will not begin  implementation before progress is achieved in the peace process  with Syria and Lebanon. He indicated that Qatar may  independently decide to abolish the second- and third-degree  boycott of Israel if progress occurs in the negotiations.  However, he associated the abolition of the main boycott with a  decision from the Arab League.    In a news conference he held yesterday after his talks with  U.S. officials, especially with Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, Shaykh Hamad said that Qatar has special interests  in developing the peace process and making it a success. He  expressed his hope that progress would be made on the Syrian and  Lebanese tracks in 1994. He said: "We hope that the peace  process will lead to the establishment of a new order and a new  Middle East free from bloodshed...."    He expressed satisfaction with the fact that the  Palestinians  and Israelis have sat together to resolve their differences  directly and with support from the United States and Russia. He  said that at the end of April Qatar will host a round of the  multilateral negotiations and will receive Israeli diplomats  like other diplomats. "And we feel that our people will welcome  that, because the aim is peace and an end to bloodshed."    Asked whether he had managed to conclude a gas deal with the  Israelis in London, he said: "True, a meeting was held in  London, but so far we have not concluded a gas deal...." He  pointed out that the Israelis know well "Qatar's position and  its terms, as we clearly said that we want progress to be made  in the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks..." He  added, "We are thinking about a deal, but nothing has been  achieved."    Asked whether his country "is playing with fire" with its  neighbors in terms of its policy with Israel, the Qatari  minister said that "it is exciting sometimes to play with fire.  But this should be done safely. However, we do not believe  that our relations with Israel are aimed against any of our  neighbors. Qatar has good relations with Iraq and Iran and also  with the other GCC states. Of course we have some problems with  our neighbors, but it does not mean that we are doing things  deliberately...."    Asked whether Qatar consulted or coordinated with its GCC  neighbors over its new policy toward Israel, he said: "It is  our policy and I can only speak about Qatar...." He said that  "we have differences with the GCC states, but they are not major  differences, and as I said, it is our policy."    Shaykh Hamad disclosed that he had discussed with  Christopher  the issue of Qatar's relations with Iran and Iraq and that he  had told the U.S. secretary that "Iran is one of Qatar's  neighbors. We clearly told the secretary of state that we wish  to establish good relations with Iran...so that the opposite  will emerge." [sentence as published] He said that Secretary  Christopher understood the Qatari position because Qatar and  Iran are "close neighbors."</p>

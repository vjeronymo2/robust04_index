			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Government to share coal illness liabilities in sell-off: Bid battle expected in all regions as DTI removes obstacle to privatisation The government is backing down from its insistence that coal pit buyers should shoulder all liabilities for the industrial illness of employees it takes on from British Coal. The shift may remove one of the remaining obstacles to privatising the industry. The retreat came after intense pressure from prospective bidders, who warned that a continuing hard line by ministers would have deterred bidding. The government has now agreed in principle to share some the liabilities, although it is still to work out the exact details. The dispute over industrial illness is the most serious of several involving liabilities. Prospective bidders also want assurances that the government will underwrite environmental liabilities resulting from water leakage and site pollution. Ministers believe an accommodation is achievable. It emerged yesterday that there might be stiff competition for the five regions to be sold this year. NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government on coal privatisation, announced that 33 parties had submitted applications to qualify for bidding. Some of the applications are for the six stand-alone pits also on offer. Nevertheless, a bid battle involving at least three rival companies and consortia is expected in each of the five regions. Mr Keith Palmer, Rothschild managing director, said he was pleased with the range and number of applications, but would not say who had made them and which regions and pits they were for. However, it is understood that overseas companies, including some from Australia, are among the applicants. Interest from North America is believed to be less than had been hoped. The applicants, who paid Pounds 15,000 to 'pre-qualify' for bidding for each region and Pounds 6,000 for each stand-alone pit, have until September to decide whether to bid. They will welcome the decision on illness liabilities, having warned that companies would have been uninsurable without it. According to lawyers acting for Nacods, the pit deputies union, claims from former miners suffering from work-related sicknesses may exceed Pounds 5bn. Previously, the government had suggested that private companies would have to assume responsibility for work-related sickness of employees they take over from British Coal, even if the causes of the illness related to pre-privatisation days. The Department of Trade and Industry would not comment in detail yesterday on industrial illness liabilities, but stressed that all coal workers, past and present, would be fully protected.</p>

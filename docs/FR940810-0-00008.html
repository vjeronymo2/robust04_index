			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also in the following analysis, we have used published price flexibilities to estimate the potential economic effects of allowing apples, grapes, and pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC; flexibilities are used to estimate relationships between changes in supply and subsequent changes in price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Apples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1987, 36,718 farms in the United States, of which 1,186 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. Although it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according to Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards), it is likely that most would. In 1992, domestic farms produced almost 5.78 billion pounds of apples for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $1.13 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the volume of apples imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 7.5 percent of current total imports into the United States, about 0.35 percent of current domestic production and about 0.33 percent of the current total apple supply in the United States (domestic and imports).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assuming that a 0.33 percent increase in the supply of apples would lead to a decrease of about 0.20 percent in the domestic price of apples (using a price flexibility for apples of -0.590, based on all Eastern States' sales of North Carolina apples), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.038 per hundredweight (cwt), or $0.00038 per pound, from an original price of $0.195 per pound. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. apple producers of about $2.20 million, which is roughly 0.20 percent of the original total revenue of $1.13 billion. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing apples to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers or other small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Grapes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1987, 23,236 farms in the United States, of which 286 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. In 1992 domestic farms produced about 1.54 billion pounds of grapes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $327 million. Although it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the volume of grapes to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 2.9 percent of current total imports to the United States, about 1.3 percent of current domestic production and about 0.89 percent of the current total grape supply in the United States (domestic and imports).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assuming that a 0.89 percent increase in the supply of grapes would lead to a decrease of about 0.88 percent in the domestic price of grapes (using a price flexibility for California grapes of -0.981), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $3.73 per ton, or $0.0019 per pound, from an original price of $425.62 per ton. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. grape producers of about $2.9 million, which is roughly 0.88 percent of the original total revenue of $327 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing grapes to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers or other small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pears  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1987, 10,092 farms in the United States, 88 of which were in North Carolina, harvested pears. In 1992, domestic farms produced about 890 million pounds of pears for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $168 million. Although it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the volume of pears to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 15.4 percent of current total imports to the United States, about 2.2 percent of current domestic production and about 2.0 percent of the current total pear supply in the United States (domestic and imports).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assuming that a 2.0 percent increase in the supply of pears would lead to a decrease of about 1.2 percent in the domestic price of pears (using a price flexibility for California pears of -0.609), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $4.51 per ton, or $0.0023 per pound, from an original price of $377.61 per ton. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. pear producers of about $2.0 million, which is roughly 1.19 percent of the original total revenue of $168 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers or other small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in light of the preceding analyses (which estimate greatest possible, and thus highly unlikely, economic effects), as well as our expectation that most imports of fruit to Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment will occur during the off-season for domestic production, we anticipate that this action will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers of apples, grapes, and pears, or other small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, we anticipate that allowing cold treatment at the port of Wilmington, NC, could have beneficial economic effects. Importers who routinely transport fruit to the Southeastern United States could benefit from this action due to lower transportation costs. Freight companies and shipping companies in North Carolina, as well as the local economy, might also benefit. Also, consumers are likely to gain from the increased selection of products and any price decreases, albeit small, that occur with increases in supply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule allows cold treatment of certain fruits to be conducted at the port of Wilmington, NC. State and local laws and regulations regarding the importation of fruits under this rule will be preempted while the fruits are in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Neither this action nor the alternative of maintaining the existing rule would significantly affect the environment. Changes in the timing of the submittal of spent fuel management and funding for prematurely shut down power reactors would not alter the effect on the environment of the licensed activities considered in either the final spent fuel disposition rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (49 FR 34689; August 31, 1984) or the final decommissioning rule (53 FR 24018; June 27, 1988) as analyzed in the Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement on Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities (NUREG&hyph;0586, August 1988). The alternative to this action would not significantly affect the environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that this rule will not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and, therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. No other agencies or persons were contacted for this action, and no other documents related to the environmental impact of this action exist. The foregoing constitutes the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number [3150&hyph;0011].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 31, 1984, the NRC published a final rule, ``Requirements for Licensee Actions Regarding the Disposition of Spent Fuel Upon Expiration of Reactor Operating Licensees.'' (49 FR 34689). As part of this rule, the NRC required power reactor licensees to submit for NRC review and approval, no later than 5 years before expiration of the reactor operating license, their plans for managing spent fuel at their site until title to the spent fuel is transferred to the Department of Energy (DOE). These plans are to include plans for funding of spent fuel management before transfer to DOE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 27, 1988, the Commission promulgated its final decommissioning rule (53 FR 24019). Section 50.82 of this rule provides that licensees of all power reactors that permanently cease operation after July 27, 1988, including those that shut down prematurely, must apply to the NRC to decommission their facilities within 2 years following permanent cessation of operations. Section 50.82(b)(1)(iii) further provides that the proposed decommissioning plan submitted by the licensee should consider such factors as the ``unavailability of waste disposal capacity and other site-specific factors affecting the licensee's capability to carry out decommissioning safely *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Commission requires licensees to submit decommissioning plans in a timely manner after they permanently cease operations at their facilities. The NRC's regulations recognize that a licensee's ability to plan properly and safely for decommissioning depends on a licensee's ability to manage and dispose of its spent fuel. Thus, the timing of requirements for submittal of plans for spent fuel management and storage should be consistent with the timing for submittal of decommissioning plans, including those for power reactors that have been shut down prematurely. Therefore, the NRC is amending 10 CFR 50.54(bb) to require each power reactor licensee to notify the NRC of its program to manage and provide funding for management of the irradiated fuel at its reactor either within 2 years after the licensee permanently ceases operation of its reactor or no later than 5 years before its reactor operating license expires, whichever occurs first. Licensees of nuclear power reactors that have already permanently ceased operations by the effective date of this rule are required to submit such notification within 2 years after the effective date of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the timing of preparation and submittal of plans for management and funding of spent fuel would be formally advanced for licensees that shut down their power reactors prematurely, these licensees typically would have already evaluated spent fuel management and funding issues before submitting decommissioning plans required under 10 CFR 50.82. This rule merely makes 10 CFR 50.54(bb) submittal schedular requirements consistent with 10 CFR 50.82. Thus, there should be no substantive impact on power reactor licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule would not create substantial costs for other licensees. This final rule also will not significantly affect State and local governments and geographical regions, or the environment, or create substantial costs to the NRC or other Federal agencies. The foregoing discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The rule will potentially affect approximately 115 nuclear power reactor operating licenses. Nuclear power plant licensees do not fall within the definition of small businesses as defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, the Small Business Size Standards of the Small Business Administrator (13 CFR part 121), or the Commission's Size Standards (56 FR 56671, November 6, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

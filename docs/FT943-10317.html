			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Caught in the middle of a shake-up - The chemicals group is sticking to core sectors If Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou had his way, he may have preferred not to publish yesterday's mid-year results for Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and drugs group. However, the Rhone-Poulenc chairman does not concede that his group has been blown off course. 'Our operating, industrial results are globally in progression, and this will continue,' he said. But the mid-year statement catches Rhone-Poulenc, privatised last year, awkwardly in the middle of a strategic re-orientation of its chemical division that will only start to bear fruit, and profit, by the end of this year. Rhone-Poulenc wants to sell Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn of assets over the 18 months, mostly in basic commodity chemicals, to reinforce its presence in specialised 'performance' products, requiring a higher rate of market innovation but with a better return. 'By November or December, we should have two or three good sales,' Mr Fourtou said. For the first half of the year, the group is stuck with a perfectly respectable 14.6 per cent rise in pre-tax operating results that could not offset a FFr900m restructuring provision and the impact of some wrong guesses by its treasury department. By incorporating the profitable vaccine-making Merieux Institute fully into the group, by selling off its Roussel-Uclaf stake to Hoechst, and by a slightly lower rate of investment, Rhone-Poulenc has pushed the ratio of its debt to own funds down to 48 per cent and the planned asset sales should push this ratio lower still. Industrially, Mr Fourtou is adamant that his group will stick to its core sectors: Human and animal health. Rhone-Poulenc is 'heavily involved here, and will develop these activities' through the Merieux Institute and through Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Rhone-Poulenc has notified the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it would like some flexibility in its 1990 standstill agreement that limits its stake in Rorer to 68 per cent for seven years, during which period it cannot make any more acquisitions. This caused a flutter on Wall Street in June. But Mr Fourtou says he had no particular scheme in mind, except for a desire to integrate Cooper, a French pharmaceutical business that Rhone-Poulenc recently bought, into Rorer. Nor, he emphasises, can any change be made without the agreement of a majority of Rorer's independent American directors. Agro-chemicals. Sales of these products did drop 25 per cent to 30 per cent in 1992-93, but recovered well particularly in North America and Japan. Synthetic fibres. The group has been reorganising its activities and selling off chunks. But 'we want to say in nylon in Europe and polyester in Brazil', affirms Mr Fourtou. Chemicals. 'The fact that we are planning sales does not mean that we are no longer interested in chemicals. We will stay in intermediate products where we have a dominant position and where we have a downstream use for them. But we are less interested in those intermediate products, unrelated to any downstream activity. These commodity chemicals are very cyclical, require heavy investment to get into important new markets such as Asia, and are best left to companies such as BASF and Dow, or in the case of Asia to indigenous oil companies in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.' Far better, says Mr Fourtou, to get into what he calls special performance products where brainpower is as important as money and where 'innovation and understanding of markets is key'. He cites as example the increasing requirement of cosmetics companies for bio-degradable chemical inputs. In the first half of the year, chemical prices remained below their average at the start of 1993, but rose above their average in the second half of last year. 'The market is turning around and will be better at the end of 1994,' says Mr Fourtou. The Rhone-Poulenc chief concedes there is 'a slight risk' that his planned chemical asset sales will not come through on time, to balance out an estimated FFr1bn in restructuring costs over the course of 1994.</p>

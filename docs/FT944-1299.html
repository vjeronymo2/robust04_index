			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Crackdown on abuse of legal aid: Loopholes for rich targeted The government yesterday announced a crackdown on abuse of the legal aid scheme by wealthy businessmen who receive public funds to fight court actions. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, outlined proposals to close loopholes in the scheme, which will help an estimated 3.5m people in 1994-95 at a cost of Pounds 1.4bn to the taxpayer. The changes follow a public outcry over several high profile and expensive cases, where apparently wealthy businessmen have received millions of pounds of aid. In June Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the Lord Advocate, revealed in the Lords that Dr Jawad Hashim had received Pounds 4.01m in legal aid. Dr Hashim, a former president of the Arab Monetary Fund who is being sued for Pounds 33m he allegedly siphoned off from it to private Swiss bank accounts, owns six luxury homes around the world. Other cases include the Pounds 3.7m aid received by Mr Roger Levitt, the disgraced financial services salesman, to fight fraud charges. Mr Levitt continues to live a luxury lifestyle in north London. Lord Mackay said yesterday: 'Legal aid is not there to be exploited by the wealthy.' Among the proposals under consideration are: Limiting to Pounds 100,000 the amount of equity value in a house that is ignored for legal aid means assessment. Developing the idea of legal aid as a loan. Giving officials power to refuse legal aid if an individual leads an apparently wealthy lifestyle. Confiscating any assets undisclosed by applicants for criminal legal aid. Freezing the assets of applicants for criminal legal aid with legal aid costs being recovered from them if the applicant is subsequently convicted. Including assets under dispute or frozen by the courts in means assessment for civil legal aid. The government is seeking views on its present position that it would be wrong to ban criminal or civil legal aid for non-UK citizens fighting cases in British courts. It is also conducting a fundamental review of spending on legal aid as part of the wider Treasury review of spending by the Lord Chancellor's department. A green paper on cash-limiting legal aid by creating a system of 'fundholders for justice' modelled on the GP fundholder system is expected to published next spring. Lord Woolf, the Law Lord, is also conducting a review of the civil justice system for Lord Mackay, part of the purpose of which is to look at ways of improving access to justice and reducing the cost of going to court.</p>

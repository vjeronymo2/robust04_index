			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. HOSTAGE STEEN BRIEFLY ESCAPED IN 1987, POLHILL REPORTS  </P> <P> American hostage Alann Steen briefly escaped his Lebanese kidnapers in 1987 and  was seriously ill shortly after he was abducted, the Boston Herald reported  today.  </P> <P> Robert Polhill, who was released Sunday by Lebanese Shiite Muslim kidnapers,  confirmed previous reports of Steen's failed escape and illness in a telephone  conversation with Steen's wife, Virginia, in Michigan, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> In Orlando, Fla., Steen's brother, Craig, said he was not surprised that his  brother, a former U.S. Marine, sought to escape after being abducted with two  other men, including Polhill, from Beirut University, where they were faculty  members.  </P> <P> "When you're captured by an enemy, one of your primary jobs is to try to  escape," Craig Steen said. "Evidently he saw an opportunity and went for it."  </P></p>

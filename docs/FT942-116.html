			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Channel tunnel express train service faces further delay The Channel tunnel has been hit by yet another delay with the announcement yesterday that long-distance passenger rail services will not start before September at the earliest. The British, French and Belgian railways said the latest hold-up had been caused by the complexity of the testing and commissioning programme for the Eurostar trains, costing Pounds 24m each, to be used on the service between London, Paris and Brussels. They can run on three different national electrical power systems and four signalling systems. Passenger services had been expected to start next month. Freight shuttle services were launched in May and long-distance container services started this month. Jean-Francois Benard, managing director of SNCF, the French railway, said: 'The three networks concluded that there could be no Eurostar opening during their summer schedules. It won't happen before the last Sunday in September.' Tests have been carried out in the three countries but there has been no intensive testing through the tunnel. 'We need to do a lot of continuous running between the city centres,' European Passenger Services (EPS), the British partner in the three-nation rail consortium, said. 'We have got to get the miles on the trains and ensure they are reliable.' Eurotunnel, which owns and operates the tunnel, said the Folkestone-Calais shuttle would not suffer as long a delay, and the setback to long-distance passenger services would not have a significant impact on revenues. 'The contract between us and the railway companies provides for us to seek penalties and covers at least part of the losses,' it said. However, Eurotunnel will have to further revise the financial projections, most recently updated for its Pounds 858m rights issue earlier this month. The launch of passenger services still depends on Eurotunnel obtaining government approval for the tunnel and its operating systems. It hopes to get it by mid-July. According to French railway officials, the failure to obtain government clearance for passenger services was a factor in the delay.</p>

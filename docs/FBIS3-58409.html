			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister tonight backed away from  unleashing air strikes against Serb positions to relieve the  United Nations humanitarian operation in Bosnia.    He urged caution and was supported by Defence Secretary  Malcolm Rifkind, who warned Britain was "not enthusiastic" about  a policy of extending the threat of air strikes.    Mr. Major's tone in the Commons appeared more cautious than  when NATO leaders agreed to the Anglo-French proposal to  threaten airpower to break the Serbs' refusal to allow a Dutch  force to replace 300 Canadian troops in Srebrenica and reopen  Tuzla airport.    He said local cooperation from the three warring factions  was  vital if the aid operation was to succeed.    This was a primary factor to be taken into account before  deciding if any military action needs to be taken.    "It is very easy to say that it is an easy decision and that  all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or two and all is  well," he said.    "I have to say to those who readily advocate that course  without careful thought that it may well not be a wise policy.  It may be a necessary policy at some stage -- but it is a  policy that should be entered into with very considerable  caution."    Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath issued a firm warning  against air strikes, arguing they could suck Britain into the  civil war and bring retaliation. "My own decision would be not  to bomb," he said.    However, the French were much more bullish, with Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe warning NATO "meant business" when it  pledged to open Tuzla airport and relieve the beleaguered  Canadian peacekeepers in the Srebrenica Muslim enclave.    French Defence Minister Francois Leotard agreed on a plan to  reopen Tuzla with his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjorck as most  of the troops in the city are from Sweden.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali ordered a  preliminary study of NATO's overt threat of air strikes if the  Serbs continue to thwart the UN efforts in Srebrenica and Tuzla.    He asked Yasushi Akashi, his special representative in the  former Yugoslavia, to lead the study and report to a high-level  meeting of UN officials in the Swiss city of Geneva on Monday.    UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] said senior military  officials  including the overall commander, French General Jean Cot, were  analysing NATO's declaration and drawing up proposals to relieve  Srebrenica and Tuzla with the help of air power.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was meeting the new commander  of the 12,000 UN peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    A spokesman at the Foreign Office described Mr. Hurd's  meeting with Lieutenant-General Sir Mike Rose as "introductory."    British defence officials said Britain's aircrews in the  region were ready to go if the call to action comes.    "We have been out there for a long time," said one official.  "We are trained, highly capable and ready to respond to any  decision to go."    A powerful allied force of strike and fighter aircraft has  been gathered at air bases in Italy and on carriers in the  Adriatic.    Britain has six Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard Invincible,  nine  RAF Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del Colle in Italy with three  more available in the UK.</p>

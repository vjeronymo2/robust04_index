			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Franc zone move will hit public investment Sir, Your excellent report on the CFA (Communaute Financiere Africaine) franc devaluation ('IMF persuades French Africa to go for growth', January 13) omitted two important points in the franc zone devaluation debate. First, the fixed exchange rate against the French franc was originally to provide monetary stability and relatively low prices for imported investment goods. In contrast to the rest of Africa, the zone has achieved a record of remarkable monetary stability. It is unfortunate that successive French governments preferred to stock their ex-colonies with arms and kept in power elites which preferred relatively cheap imported luxury goods to industrialisation. Second, with African franc zone countries now committed to orthodox 'adjustment' policies, it is highly unlikely the International Monetary Fund's grip on public finances will allow public investment on a sufficient scale to secure sustained economic growth. The temporary economic accelerations the World Bank and IMF have managed to engineer in Ghana and Nigeria were obtained in part because they were able to export to erstwhile hard currency markets in neighbouring franc zone countries. In addition to the inflationary shock that franc zone countries will experience, their neighbours will suffer from reduced regional export markets. Economic stagnation in west Africa will exacerbate tensions in its embryonic economic union Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States).

With Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks facing rough sailing and debates on  deregulation and income tax reductions in Japan stalled, U.S.  Government officials are increasingly taking the view that  "Japanese bureaucrats are standing in the way of changes for  Japan." U.S. Government officials are taking this view because  Japan's politics are unable to display leadership and Japanese  bureaucrats are increasingly taking an inward-looking attitude,  asserting that "Japan must say what it needs to say and it must  protect what it needs to protect." Under these circumstances,  there is no sign in sight for breaking the stalemate in the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.    The criticism by Japanese bureaucrats is roughly classified  into two categories. First, the Japanese bureaucrats are  standing in the way of rebuilding Japan's economic structure,  which has been sought by the United States. The U.S. side  explained: "We have drawn that conclusion after reviewing the  results of a series of discussions by deliberation and research  councils of the Japanese Government." The Provisional Council  for the Promotion of Administrative Reform has been deluged with  a flurry of deregulation requests from the private sector, but  many of the council members only lamented: "We have been unable  to brush aside the resistance of government ministries and  agencies." Late last year, the United States expected the  Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa Commission) to  make a recommendation that Japan set a target on its own to cut  its current account surplus, but the recommendation has  disappeared.    Every day the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo translates a huge volume  of Japanese newspapers to send to Washington. The embassy has  also used its own channels to gather information about  discussions by the deliberation and research councils from  sources close to the prime minister and other sources.    There is a strong indication that the White House, the State  Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have  lobbied the Hiraiwa Commission to draw conclusions favorable to  the United States. Last December, one American under  secretary-level official after another visited Japan for the  sole purpose of "collecting the information."    The National Economic Council (NEC), the supreme  decisionmaking body for U.S. economic policy, at a recent  working-level meeting, concluded that: "All conclusion drawn by  the deliberation and research councils were far from meeting our  expectations because of resistance from the bureaucracy."  Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to President Clinton said:  "Japanese bureaucrats are giving more priority to the interests  of their respective ministries than to the prime minister's  intentions."    Many U.S. Government officials think that Japanese  bureaucrats are whipping up anti-America sentiment. In  particular, the U.S. side was surprised to find that: "Officials  in charge of past external negotiations in the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the International  Finance Bureau of the Finance Ministry are now in the forefront  of criticism against the United States after abruptly turning  inward.    A U.S. Government official, who does not hide his  irritation,  said: "The Japanese bureaucracy appears to have a "policy  consensus" of never making concessions to the protectionist  Clinton administration."    Several Japanese Government authorities have admitted the  existence of the policy consensus. Last September, Japanese  negotiators decided to uphold the principle of "making no  concessions to any U.S. trade demand which may lead to setting  numerical targets." Recently, Jiro Saito, Finance Ministry  administrative vice minister, and Hideaki Kumano, MITI  administrative vice minister, agreed not to hastily seek a  compromise with the U.S. side to settle bilateral negotiations  on insurance, automobile, and auto parts in February."    "Ending the era when Japan is changed by external pressure"  is a password of the Japanese bureaucrats. At the same time,  however, they cannot ignore the consequences of their password  -- a toughened U.S. attitude toward Japan and a vicious cycle in  the two countries' relations.    There is a large difference between Japanese and U.S.  bureaucrats. In the United States, the President appoints all  senior government officials, known as political appointees, and  they are tasked with policy coordination. Mr. Cutter stated:  "Their work is to carry out the President's intentions." There  is a decisive difference between the United States and Japan in  the personnel affairs management of senior government officials.  In Japan, the prime minister has no personal ties with them,  with some exceptions.    American senior government officials, who share the same  fate  as the President, are now moving toward changes. The Clinton  administration has announced its plan, worked out by those  senior government officials, to cut 100,0000 federal government  employees. The Japanese bureaucracy, which does not change even  when a change in government occurs, is suitable for the  continuity of policies but unsuitable for changes.    There is no denying the Japanese bureaucracy has problems  which draw criticism from the United States. American  bureaucracy is too often pushed around by the President and  Congress and this is a defective aspect of American bureaucracy.  At Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, differences have  existed between departments in charge of the talks and American  officials in charge of the talks on U.S. demands. There have  also been differences between them over U.S. sanctions against  Japan, causing the Japanese side to distrust the U.S. side.    Another cause for stalling bilateral negotiations, that  seemingly contradicts U.S. criticism of the Japanese  bureaucracy, is excessively high expectations by the United  States for a good performance by the Japanese bureaucracy.  American bureaucrats appear to have an "opportunist trend" in  which they first pin high expectations to the performance, and  if their expectations are not met, they then attack the Japanese  bureaucracy.    From the start of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  the United States has pinned high hopes on the "leadership" of  bureaucrats in MITI and the Finance Ministry. The United States  still sticks to its demand for setting numerical targets to open  the Japanese market wider after concluding that it is quick to  use the conventional bureaucrat-led formula to get trade  results. As for stimulus measures, some U.S. Government  officials even said: "It is best to negotiate directly with  Administrative Vice Minister Saito."    This, however, is a miscalculation on the part of the United  States. MITI's influence on businesses has waned compared with  the influence it exercised in the past. What is growing in the  entire bureaucratic world is an introspective mood.    The voice is heard both in Japan and the United States: "No  matter how many times the two countries hold working-level  economic framework talks under this situation, they will only  find it difficult to break the stalemate." While the United  States is waging a campaign aimed at criticizing the Japanese  bureaucracy, American Embassy staffers familiar with Japanese  political circles are frequently contacting aides to Prime  Minister Hosokawa. As a result, the United States appears to be  using a tactic aimed at going over the heads of bureaucrats to  seek political settlement.    This U.S. tactic is aimed at gaining the same agreement as  an  ambiguous agreement reached between former Prime Minister  Miyazawa and President Clinton last July that "set an objective  criteria in both quantitative and qualitative terms," leaving  its definition unclear. If the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks are to produce some agreements before Japan-U.S. summit  talks scheduled for February, the United States may use the same  tactic to seek an "ambiguous political settlement" which, like  the July agreement, will leave something less than desirable.  Behind Japan-U.S. trade friction are differences between the  bureaucrats of Japan and the United States.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU FAILS TO MEET PAYROLL AS IT STRUGGLES TO ARRANGE BAILOUT  </P> <P> Unable to meet its payroll on schedule for the second time this year, United  States International University has asked all of its employees for "patience  and support" while it attempts to complete a $15-million refinancing package.  </P> <P> Employees who expected their checks Monday will be paid "as soon as possible  after April 1," according to a memo to employees.  </P> <P> The financially troubled university expected to receive a $15-million loan Feb.  28, but it was delayed after the university sold its 74% interest in KUSI-TV  (Channel 51), acting university President Kenneth McLennan said.  </P> <P> "The sale of the television station changed the university's financial status,"  McLennan said. "It required the revision of the financial data submitted to  support the granting of the loan."  </P> <P> The potential lenders have also asked the university to submit an environmental  survey of the campus and further information about its accreditation with the  Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges. The accreditation has been in doubt,  partly because of the university's financial problems.  </P> <P> The refinancing deal is being arranged through the Beverly Hills-based DS  Financing Group. DS president Destan Seferaj didn't return phone calls  Thursday.  </P> <P> In January, when the deal to sell its interest in the station to minority owner  Michael McKinnon originally collapsed, the university was forced to ask about  35 salaried employees to delay in picking up their paychecks. A few weeks  later, the university received a $1-million advance from McKinnon for the sale  of the television station, which helped it meet its payroll.  </P> <P> The sale of the television station, which is still pending approval of the  Federal Communications Commission, calls for McKinnon, who was the minority  owner, to pay the university $9 million up front, lend it $7 million and  forgive about $7 million in debt.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, McKinnon gave the university permission to use a  small percentage of its shares in the television station as collateral to  arrange short-term loans while awaiting approval of the sale from the Federal  Communications Commission. But McLennan said the university has been unable use  the shares to arrange a short-term loan.  </P> <P> As of last week, no protests had been filed with the FCC against the sale, and  it could be approved within the next two weeks.  </P> <P> If the university is able to arrange the $15-million package, it will use the  money to restructure about $12 million in secured debt and establish an  endowment, McLennan said. In the past, the university, a nonprofit  organization, has operated without reserves.  </P> <P> Last fall, Bank of America filed notice threatening to foreclose if the  university didn't repay its debt to the bank.  </P> <P> "The university is not a business," McLennan said. "It's largely  tuition-driven, and tuition comes in every three or four months. There's no  steady income, which is one of the reasons we were anxious to sell the station  and negotiate a loan."  </P></p>

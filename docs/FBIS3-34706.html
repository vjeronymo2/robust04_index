			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said that although  terror hurts, we must once and for all solve the conflict. The  weapon of terror is in the hands of those who oppose us. Today,  we are in control of the territories, yet we are unable to foil  terrorism. If our partner realizes that security is important  to us, and if he understands that he will not attain his goals  as long as there is no full security, he will have an interest  in seeing to it that security is realized.    Mr. Rabin further said that he recognizes the existence of a  Palestinian entity, but distinguishes between it and a state.  The Palestinians will have their flag and other symbols, such  as a police force. They are entitled to have symbols, Rabin  told the Labor Party Bureau in Tel Aviv today.</p>

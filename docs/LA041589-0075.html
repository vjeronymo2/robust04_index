			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE MASTERED THE GAME WITHOUT WINNING MASTERS  </P> <P> Commentator Byron Nelson's remarks that a golfer couldn't be judged great  unless he has won a Masters title are rather snobbish and untrue.  </P> <P> I think the British Open, which is not on the same course every year and is  especially tough for Americans, is an even greater test. Lee Trevino won  back-to-back British Opens in 1971 and '72. He also has won two PGA titles and  two U.S. Opens.  </P> <P> Trevino will go down in my book as a great golfer, and one with a great sense  of humor as well.  </P> <P> GEORGE DODELEIN  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

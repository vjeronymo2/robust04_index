			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Describe the methods used to determine the compensation of the entity manager and related persons for services provided to the entity. For example, does the manager have the ability to affect the timing and/or amount of its compensation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To what extent would transactions prohibited as a result of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision be covered by any existing statutory or administrative exemptions? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Describe whether the entity managers are affiliated with general account investors or other fiduciaries of plans that are accountholders of such general account investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. What information does the entity provide to investors? For example, does the entity provide information regarding the internal operation of the entity prior to investment, and periodic disclosures during the period of investment? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. What other standards should be included in a class exemption in addition to an arm's-length requirement? For example, should an exemption condition relief upon some degree of sophistication and financial accountability on the part of the entity manager? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Exemption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption consists of six separate parts. Section I sets forth the basic exemption and enumerates certain conditions applicable to transactions described therein. Sections II and III of the proposal set forth three specific exemptions. Section IV contains the general conditions applicable to transactions described in sections I and II. Section V contains definitions for certain terms used in the proposed exemption. Section VI sets forth the effective date of the exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The general exemption set forth in section I would provide an exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) for: (1) any transaction between a party in interest with respect to a plan and an insurance company general account, in which the plan has an interest as a contractholder; (2) any acquisition or holding by the general account of employer securities or employer real property; and (3) any acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities or qualifying employer real property by a plan (other than through an insurance company general account) if the acquisition or holding contravenes the restrictions of sections 406(A)(1)(E), 406(a)(2) and 407(a) of ERISA solely by reason of being aggregated with employer securities or employer real property held by an insurance company general account. The above exemptions are subject to the requirement that the plan's participation in the general account as measured by the amount of the reserves arising from the contract held by the plan, (determined under section 807(d) of the Code) does not exceed 10% of all liabilities of the general account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ACLI stated that it would be unfair to retroactively impose a percentage limitation in the requested exemption. In this regard, the Applicant represents that the level of insurance company general account investments activities and the breadth of general account holdings are so great that it would effectively preclude any single plan contractholder from exerting any undue influence over the decisions of an insurance company. Nevertheless, the Department has decided to reject the ACLI's recommendation that a percentage limitation not be imposed as a condition to broad exemptive relief. In the past, the Department has conditioned the availability of a number of class exemptions providing similar broad relief on a plan's interest in a collective fund or account not exceeding a specified percentage amount. The Department continues to believe that a plan that provides a significant percentage of an entity's business would, in many cases, be in a position to improperly influence the investment decisions of the entity. In any event, it does not appear that compliance with such a condition would be difficult in light of the apparent size of most general accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section II is divided into two subparts. Section II(a) of the proposed exemption would permit transactions involving persons who are parties in interest to a plan solely by reason of providing services to an insurance company general account in which the plan has an interest as a contractholder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on precedents established in several class and individual exemptions the Department is proposing an exemption, in section II(b), that permits the furnishing of services, facilities and any goods incidental to such services and facilities by a place of public accommodation owned by an insurance company general account to parties in interest if the services, facilities and incidental goods are furnished on a comparable basis to the general public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the regular operations of places of public accommodation, such as hotels and motels, that may be purchased by an insurance company general account, many people, including parties in interest with respect to plans which have participating contracts with the general account, may receive use of such rooms, service, food, etc. Such hotels and motels will typically be managed by hotel management companies who probably would not be aware of the relationship of the hotel and motel guests to the insurance company and the plans who purchased general account contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent to the filing of the ACLI exemption application, the Department has received several suggestions with respect to any exemption that may result from the Department's consideration of the ACLI request. While expressing general endorsement for the exemption requested by the ACLI with respect to the operation of entities that are deemed to hold plan assets under section 2510.3&hyph;101(f) as a result of an insurance company general account investment, one commenter specifically focused on the impact of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision on a number of exemptions previously granted by the Department for the operation of asset pool investment trusts that issue asset-backed, pass-through certificates to plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PTE 83&hyph;1 (48 FR 895, January 7, 1983) provides conditional relief for the operation of certain mortgage pool investment trusts and the acquisition and holding by plans of certain mortgage-backed pass-through certificates evidencing interests therein. The Department also granted a large number of individual exemptions (e.g., PTE 89&hyph;88 [54 FR 42581, October 17, 1989]), each of which provides substantially identical relief for the operation of certain asset pool investment trusts and the acquisition and holding by plans of certain asset-based pass-through certificates representing interests in those trusts (collectively, the Underwriter Exemptions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

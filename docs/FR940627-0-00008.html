This action requires either pressure checks and charging, if necessary, of the low pressure chamber of the nose gear shock absorber, or torque checks of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation is within specified limits; recharging of the shock absorber, if necessary; and installation of a relay in the electrical rack. This amendment is prompted by reports of failure of the nose landing gear (NLG) to extend fully. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent malfunction of the NLG during extension due to recompression of the nose gear shock absorber. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before August 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;82&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Dassault International, Inc., P.O.

The DGAC advises that it has received reports of recompression of the nose landing gear (NLG) shock absorber due to the relative wind upon retraction. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the NLG to extend fully using the normal hydraulic mode, the emergency hydraulic mode, or the emergency mechanical mode.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dassault Aviation issued Service Bulletin F900&hyph;A149 (F900&hyph;A32&hyph;11), dated April 13, 1994, which describes procedures for pressure checks of the low pressure chamber of the nose gear shock absorber or a torque check of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation is within specified limits; and recharging of the shock absorber, if necessary. Dassault Aviation also issued Service Bulletin F900&hyph;150 (F900&hyph;32-12), dated May 9, 1994, which describes procedures to install a relay in the right side of the electrical rack. The purpose of this relay is to interrupt the NLG retraction cycle if the NLG shock absorber is not fully expanded. This will prevent a lock-up of the NLG and a subsequent inability to deploy the NLG when necessary. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;098&hyph;014(B)R1, dated May 11, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the NLG to extend (deploy) using the normal hydraulic mode, the emergency hydraulic mode, or the emergency mechanical mode. This AD requires either repetitive pressure checks and charging, if necessary, of the low pressure chamber of the nose gear shock absorber, or torque checks of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation is within specified limits; and recharging of the shock absorber, if necessary. This AD also requires installation of a relay in the right side of the electrical rack. Installation of the relay terminates the repetitive pressure and torque checks. These actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

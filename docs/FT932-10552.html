			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Denmark remains pro-Maastricht A VOCIFEROUS debate over the legal validity of the Edinburgh agreement between Denmark and the other 11 EC member states has failed to remove the big lead which the pro-Maastricht supporters have built up ahead of the May 18 referendum on the treaty. Two polls published yesterday indicated that the vote will be about 60 to 40 in favour of the treaty, although both polls showed a small increase in the No vote. According to a Gallup survey, 48 per cent are in favour, 33 per cent against and the rest undecided, which breaks down as 59-39 per cent in favour among those who have made up their minds. The No vote, however, is up from 28 per cent two weeks ago. The second poll, published in business newspaper Borsen, showed 53 per cent for, 34 per cent against and the rest undecided, or 61 to 39 per cent in favour after excluding the don't knows. The same poll gave the No supporters 28 per cent in March. The validity of the Edinburgh agreement - which allows Denmark to opt out of the Maastricht treaty's defence co-operation programme, the final phase of monetary union, supra-national legal co-operation and union citizenship - is under attack from British lawyers, who claim that the agreement is not legally binding on the Community.</p>

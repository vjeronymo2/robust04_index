			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Travel: The Silk Road's route to a living laboratory - John Lloyd on the road from Khiva through Samarkandto Tashkent Few tourists presently travel Uzbekistan's part of the Silk Road - through Khiva, Bokhara and Samarkand to Tashkent. Countries ending in 'stan' give off an impression of danger now, enough to deter from the poetry of the names of the road-cities. This is a shame, for the Silk Road is not merely a parade of cultural artefacts of extraordinary beauty and power strung along a former caravan route which the Chinese pioneered to sell their unique commodity before the birth of Christ, but also a living laboratory of the retreat, and survival, of the road's latest civilisation, the Soviet one. Khiva, from where it is best to start, is in the north-west of the long strip of land called Uzbekistan, and is a museum. Its walled core has few inhabitants, but a welter of madrasas (Moslem seminaries), mosques, palaces, harems and dungeons. The Khivan khans were, according to the Soviet-era museum displays, connoisseurs of cruelty: they embedded victims in 'bug pits' of scorpions and ants, impaled them on spikes, executed and strangled them, threw them from the towers of mosques and fed them alive to beasts. On some accounts, they continued to do at least some of this until deep into this century. Gustav Krist's marvellous, John Buchan-esque memoir, Alone Through a Forbidden Land, records executions by throwing from a mosque tower as late as 1920. In that year, the last of the khans left before the Bolsheviks got him and moved to Afghanistan (his son fetched up as a Soviet army general). Most of the line of 47 khans lived inside a fortress - the Kunya Ark - within the walls, where the harem, the mint and a mosque have been restored. Finer is the Tash Khauli, or stone palace, commissioned by the 37th khan, Allakuli, who commanded to be built a palace which still dazzles with its inventiveness and colour. In the main courtyard, the rooms for the legal wives lie along one side, next to the khan's own rooms; opposite, the rooms for the 40 non-lawful wives. Meok Kasmaodov, a local man who did a fair job as a guide, says that 'because they were on the sunny side, they often grew tired and sometimes sick - at which the khan would throw them out'. There is little sign of a religious revival, though madrasas are being brought into new service at a great rate everywhere and Islam is close to a state religion. One of the largest madrasas has been re-cast as a hotel. The manager looks very much like Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi, and tries to charge Dollars 50 for a badly converted cell with a tap and a broken toilet. In the restaurant next door, the tables were taken up with an Algerian-Russian-Uzbek crew leisurely filming what was said to be a promotional film. They stayed up much of the night for a union meeting in the hotel's forecourt, complaining of bad conditions and low pay. A bar in a vault sells western drinks and cigarettes. On the stools, two young Uzbeks sat and swayed delicately to the Russian and Uzbek pop music, eyes shut. The local children were voracious for gum or money, and threw stones at one companion who parted with neither. But a wedding procession in the midday heat was a showcase for a marvellous dance from an elderly man, pirouetting gravely before a young couple who walked slowly down the main street, the bride with grim face, the groom sniggering with his best man. A little bus to get us to Bokhara bounced through the gathering dusk across the southern edge of the Kizyl Kum desert. Bokhara also has an ark (citadel), which juts up out of a leafy square, and inside is a museum of exquisitely made Korans and the apartments and courts of the caliphs whose arrogance caused all supplicants and ambassadors to approach on all fours and walk out backwards. On the wall, a little pie chart shows that 'before the revolution, the richest families in the city controlled 87 per cent of the land; the peasants, 13 per cent'. The Bokhara bug-pit housed two British officers, Lt-Col Charles Stoddart and Capt Arthur Connolly, in the early 1840s. They were executed when the latter refused to convert to Islam. Our guide was a russified Uzbek woman named Zinai Ashurova who, in Bokhara's oven-like temperatures, had the fondest memories of her time in a college in Novokuznetsk, a - to my senses - industrial hell-hole of a town in southern Siberia built round a vast steel plant. 'The people there are so warm, so welcoming,' she said. In the grounds of the Ark, most other sight-seers were girls from outlying villages in loose dresses of brightly-coloured silk, giggly and silly before the western strangers. Ashurova proposed an excursion to a little museum she knew 'where you can try on clothes'. It was, of course, a softening-up course for shopping, but more or less worth it. The museum was in a private house, preserved; Shurova described it as a millionaire's house. In fact, as I was later told, it belonged to the family of Kodja Oghli, or Kojaev, a man of wealthy family who turned communist and who in 1920 assisted the Bolsheviks to expel the emir and the bourgeoisie. Later he became first secretary of Uzbekistan, and was executed in the late 1930s by Stalin. We sat in the house of the class traitor and were served green tea and sweets. After some time, the curator of the museum came in and showed us clothes, inviting us to try them on so that we were dressed as Uzbeks of property. Her husband, a handsome, languid man, assisted (only men can dress men in Moslem custom). The rooms were splendid. In one, a vast old gramophone declared it to have been the chamber where the women of the house danced together of an afternoon. Taken for Jews in the street, we were led to the town's synagogue by its caretaker. It was two medium-sized rooms in a sagging house, with the prayers in large letters on the walls and the raised pulpit in the middle of the room. The tables were covered with tea bowls and little teapots. The caretaker said that 400 Jews only remained from a community of many thousands. Later, in the market, a trader who introduced himself as Jewish, said there were 2,000 Jews, 'but leaving fast' - as from everywhere in the former Soviet Union. In the local art gallery, a young artist named Rachman Avezov sold me an illustration, and himself guided us to the large Kalyan Mosque, and to some of the fine - but deserted - old madrasas. An Uzbek, he studied in Leningrad (as it then was) and married a Russian. His wife found Bokhara provincial and hot, and left him with their son to live in Norilsk in the Arctic circle; he remarried. He fears that a revival of religion will narrow the freedom artists enjoy in a still largely secular if (comparatively) mildly despotic state. 'Art has no boundaries,' he said, showing me a book of avant garde art he had just bought, in which Uzbek and Russian artists were displayed together. ('Mildly despotic' deserves an explanation. The country is run by a president, Islam Karimov, the former Communist Party first secretary, who routinely throws opposition leaders into jail. He recently sent the editor of an opposition newspaper, a man in his late 50s, to hard labour in gold mines for five years. Diplomats in Tashkent credit Karimov with being hard-working and concerned for the future of his country.) Another 300-plus kilometres of bad road, and there is Samarkand, where the mausoleum of Tamberlaine - Gur Emir, the Rulers' Tomb - is being restored by lethargic workers and the guard, for about Dollars 4, took us to the real burial vault of the tyrant under the false one he built to deter disturbers. He told us the well-worn tale of the Russian anthropologist, Mikhail Gerasimov, who - defying the curse laid upon grave-openers - exhumed the body on the night of June 22 1941, to be told within minutes of doing so that Hitler, goaded to fury by the insult to his fellow mass murderer, had invaded the Soviet Union. But the glory of Samarkand and of the road is the Registan: a square formed on three sides by the soaring arches of madrasas, of a form and colouring (mostly restored) which define space in a way not found in Europe. Behind the vast arches of the entrances are the ribbed domes of the mosques splayed out from the central apex like tensed muscles. Inside are some of the loveliest rooms in the world, some restored and well preserved, others neglected. In the yards, lounging young men entice you to their stall by shouting, and play the awful local pop on portable tape machines. One last bone rattle to Tashkent. Uzbekistan's capital was wholly destroyed by a series of earthquakes in 1966 and rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It is green, with more working fountains than others of its kind, but dull, too, with no fine buildings. In the squalid airport, men and women humped huge sacks of fruit and vegetables; merchants with low-price tickets were taking produce on a 3 1/2  hour flight to Moscow. Theft from gardens is now common because of the high prices which the produce commands in the Russian markets. In the main museum we saw a jumble of paintings, many in the Soviet realist style: strapping Uzbek cotton workers and soldiers, patient old men's faces, wooden still lives. The handicrafts, by contrast, are marvellous: embroidered kholats (men's gowns) which took five years of a woman's working life, covered in intricate designs in gold thread. In the Hotel Uzbekistan, we found another wedding. The young women danced gracefully to the raucous din from the loudspeakers; the men pay them, and they give the money to the bride. To our table came a drunken waitress. A few moments before she had rudely refused to sell us tea on the obviously false grounds that there were no teapots. She sat and burst into tears, speaking a very broken German. She claimed she was ethnic German (there are many still in central Asia) and that her brother had gone to Germany while she was stuck here. She remembered her mother, and cried. She tried to insist that we were German, anxious to claim a kinship. But, perhaps suddenly struck that she was a middle-aged waitress, drunk but well short of oblivion, in a shabby hotel bar where the Germans whose understanding she was trying to gain were barely civil and were anyway not German - she rose with a grunt and flopped off back behind her counter.</p>

The  defense ministers signed a joint communique.    Four joint working groups were formed, Kannik said. They  will be dealing with communications, control of airspace and  borders, weapon standardization, and preparations for the joint  peacekeeping battalion. According to Kannik, the key aim in  setting up a working group for weapon standardization is to  discuss matters first with the other two Baltic countries --  should one of the Baltic states want to purchase weapons in the  future -- or decide what kind of ammunition to use. It was  agreed that the working groups must have a first meeting before  15 March and draft their basic positions before 15 May.    At the beginning of (?April), a meeting of Nordic and Baltic  defense ministers will take place in [word indistinct], the  defense minister said. The Baltic defense ministers acknowledge  in their joint communique the need to train and exchange  military attaches between the three countries. Kannik said that  an Estonian proposal for participation in the Partnership For  Peace program is being coordinated by the Foreign Ministry.  During the course of March it should become clear what shape  the proposal will take. According to Kannik, this will depend  on political and financial constraints. He thinks that so far,  the biggest interest in the formation of a Baltic peacekeeping  battalion has been displayed by the Nordic countries and  Britain. They have also offered help.

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Reshuffle at Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez THE senior management of Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, one of France's largest industrial companies, has been reshuffled with the replacement of Mr Jean-Paul Parayre, as deputy chairman and director general, by Mr Jean-Louis Brault, another director of the group. Mr Parayre's departure has been interpreted as a victory for Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, who has been trying to consolidate his hold over the group ever since Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water utility company he headed, merged with Dumez, the construction group led by Mr Parayre, two years ago. Ironically it was Mr Parayre who had originally encouraged Dumez to opt for the merger, against the advice of the family shareholders. Mr Brault, his successor as deputy chairman, currently heads Degremont, a water treatment company belonging to the Lyonnaise side of the group. However Mr Brault, 53, spent part of his career in the construction industry as a senior executive for Bouygues, the French company which is the world's biggest building group. During his time at Dumez Mr Parayre has played a pivotal part in the Channel tunnel project. He will retain his position as chairman of Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of construction contractors working on the tunnel, and will continue to lead their negotiations with the Eurotunnel group. The management reshuffle comes shortly after Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez disclosed a fall in net profits from FFr1.4bn in 1990 to FFr1.17bn (Dollars 234m) in 1991. Mr Monod recently announced a divestment programme which will include selling its 3.9 per cent stake in Havas, the French media group, and the eventual disposal of United Westburne, its Canadian building materials subsidiary.</p>

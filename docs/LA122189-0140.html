			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINNESOTANS GET APOLOGY FROM SEN. DURENBERGER OVER FINANCES  </P> <P> Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) made a public apology Wednesday to the people  of Minnesota, breaking a yearlong silence to say "I have let you down" and  admitting "mistakes and . . . lapses of judgment" in handling his personal  finances over the last several years.  </P> <P> Durenberger's apology, which he made at four news conferences in Minnesota, was  offered in the midst of a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into whether he  evaded limits on honorariums in collecting $100,000 in 1985-86 under an unusual  book contract or broke Senate rules in soliciting trips from special interest  groups to visit Boston on personal business.  </P> <P> The senator admitted no violations of law or Senate rules. But he said: "I  failed to appreciate the appearance of what I was doing. For the disappointment  and embarrassment I've caused my family, supporters and friends -- and all  Minnesotans -- I am deeply sorry."  </P> <P> Durenberger said in a telephone interview that his decision to ignore his  attorneys' advice and answer questions was triggered mainly by a Minneapolis  Star-Tribune report earlier this month that disclosed he has been charging the  Senate rent for staying at his own condominium in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Ruth Stanoch, chairwoman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said  she found the timing of Durenberger's statement curious because he would not  comment on his finances during his reelection campaign last fall.  </P> <P> Durenberger noted that the expense of having residences in Washington and in  Minnesota and raising four college-age sons led him to try "to find a way --  within the rules -- of both increasing my income and reducing my expenses."  </P></p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Phone privatisation proves profitable in Venezuela - Joseph Mann reports on the two-year transformation of a previously under-funded public company NEARLY two years after taking operating control of Venezuela's national telecommunications concern, GTE of the US has provided the Caracas government with an opportunity to ease the state's fiscal deficit. Compania Anonima Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV) has been turned from a money-losing, inefficient concern into a profitable company, although GTE has a long way to go in its transformation. The Venezuelan government, which owns 49 per cent of CANTV following a partial privatisation in 1991, hopes to raise some Dollars 800m from the sale of part of its stake this year. GTE led Venworld Telecom, the international consortium that won 40 per cent of CANTV with a bid of Dollars 1.89bn. Venworld is controlled by GTE, which has 51 per cent, and has four other partners: Telefonica de Espana (16 per cent), La Electricidad de Caracas (Venezuela's largest private utility, holding 16 per cent), CIMA (the investment arm of Venezuela's Banco Mercantil group, with 12 per cent) and AT&amp;T (5 per cent). CANTV employees will eventually own 11 per cent of their company's shares. CANTV was in poor shape when it was privatised. An erratic telephone service was not only a social irritant, but also seriously hindered economic development. Under government ownership CANTV invested little in equipment and had an appalling record in maintenance and service to the public. For example, in 1991 Venezuela had eight telephones per 100 inhabitants, compared with 49 per 100 in more developed countries. Digital lines accounted for only 20 per cent of total lines (62 per cent), 80 per cent of outgoing international calls were not completed (35 per cent), and 57 per cent of public telephones were out of service at any time (5 per cent). Since December 1991, Venworld has made more capital investments than the country's telecommunications industry received over the previous two decades. The 'new CANTV' invested Dollars 500m last year and plans capital outlays of Dollars 650m in 1993 as part of a Dollars 6bn capital investment programme between 1992-2000. Other than using its own cash to invest, the company will receive more than Dollars 300m in loans this year from external sources such as export-import banks in the US, Japan, France, Germany and Sweden, as well as from syndicated bank loans and commercial paper. Investments cover new digital telephone lines, new public telephones, infrastructure and service improvements, installation of fibre-optic systems, expansion of international telecommunications capacity, rural and cellular telephone systems, new services for telephone customers, businesses and other communications clients, plus other areas. CANTV installed 413,000 digital telephone lines in 1992 and is adding 459,000 more this year. It installed or replaced 18,400 public telephones last year, and is aiming for another 17,000 by December. Customers have noticed a big improvement in reliability of services, and repairs are often done within days rather than weeks or months. Financial results during the first year of privatisation were also a big improvement over previous years, when CANTV regularly produced red ink and paid little in taxes to the Venezuelan treasury. Using figures adjusted for inflation, CANTV had operating revenues of Dollars 986m in 1992 (78.5bn bolivars), up from Dollars 637m the previous year. Net income for 1992 was Dollars 169m, compared to a loss of Dollars 72m in 1991. The improvement was due to higher rates for telecommunications services, better collection procedures and expanded services. Aside from normal income taxes, CANTV now also pays the treasury a special tax of 5 per cent of its ordinary annual revenues, plus quarterly royalty fees. The 35-year concession contract grants CANTV the exclusive right to operate all local and long-distance (national and international) telephone services for nine years. Other services, such as cellular phones and data transmission, are open to competition. There is still debate among Venezuelan officials and CANTV executives over when the government should put its remaining shares up for sale. While some in the cash-strapped government want to tap the US stock market as soon as possible to shore up official finances this year, others argue that the uncertainties of a presidential election year and recent political upheavals will have a negative effect on the sales price of shares. Pricing for these new shares is also a problem, since the privatisation is still in its early stages and the company declared no dividends in 1992. CANTV's privatisation, the biggest sale of Venezuelan state assets so far and one of the largest in Latin America, is a big test for the government's privatisation programme - and for CANTV, which must continue to develop services, retrain (or replace) the 20,000 employees it inherited from the days of government ownership, and cope with a militant labour union in Caracas.</p>

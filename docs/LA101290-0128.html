			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODEST PASTOR SEES COSTA MESA FLOCK GROW FROM 25 TO 12,000  </P> <P> In an era of fallen televangelists and mass-marketed religion, Pastor Chuck  Smith's Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa approaches its 25th anniversary unscathed  by scandal and seemingly ever mindful of the pride that could precede a fall.  </P> <P> About 12,000 people attend services at the chapel each Sunday, making it the  third-best-attended Protestant church in the nation, according to a new survey.  Calvary Chapel also claims 386 affiliated churches in the United States,  Canada, Europe and the Far East; religious programs on about 140 radio  stations; missionaries in 15 countries, and a booming book, music and  Bible-on-cassette business.  </P> <P> Yet, unlike its better-known neighbors, Melodyland Christian Center and the  Crystal Cathedral, Calvary Chapel does not advertise its services. It shuns  publicity. And as an article of faith, it never solicits contributions. "If you  ask for money, you'll probably get fired," said Assistant Pastor L. E. Romaine.  </P> <P> Indeed, the church has even replaced the Sunday collection plate with a simple  bag.  </P> <P> "That way people aren't looking to see how much Joe gave this week, and 'Look,  Bill just gave a dollar,' " said Lew Phelps, who manages the chapel's outreach  ministry.  </P> <P> Even Calvary Chapel's origins are low-profile. The fundamentalist church began  amid the bean fields of Santa Ana, but membership had dwindled to 25 when Smith  took over in 1965.  </P> <P> After several moves to other churches and a two-year stint in a tent, the  fellowship moved in 1971 to its present location, a low-slung building at  Sunflower and Fairview avenues. By then, it was attracting crowds of young  people, including many ex-hippies, in what later became known as the Jesus  People Movement of 1969-1974.  </P> <P> "They were accepted just as they were -- long hair, granny dresses, fur-covered  Bibles, whatever," said Romaine.  </P> <P> Many still worship at Calvary Chapel.  </P> <P> Smith began conducting mass baptisms at Pirate's Cove at Corona del Mar, which  continue to draw huge crowds.  </P> <P> A five-day Harvest Crusade at the Pacific Amphitheater in August drew 18,000 to  20,000 people each night, church leaders said. The following week, Smith  baptized 1,000 people.  </P> <P> Smith, once a Foursquare Gospel minister, is a believer in the Pentecostal gift  of "speaking in tongues" and takes a literalist biblical approach, including  assumptions that the world's "last days" are near. But he has roundly  criticized excesses in the Pentecostal movement, such as people collapsing as  if "slain by the Spirit" and flamboyant displays of piety.  </P> <P> Smith said some of his flock practice charismatic devotions such as  faith-healing and speaking in tongues. But the tone of the church's public  sermons is more restrained.  </P> <P> "We don't believe in the actions of the charismatics which are so often  excessive -- for example speaking in tongues in church and making a heavy  emphasis on acts of faith," he said. "We have elders who pray for the sick, but  we don't make a big display of it. It's not a circus-tent environment."  </P> <P> At 63, Smith, who prefers to be called "Pastor Chuck," is unassuming and  easygoing. On Thursday, he showed visitors around the chapel dressed in a  Hawaiian shirt and said he was "totally and completely" surprised to learn that  his flock is the third largest in the nation.  </P> <P> The church's 21-acre campus includes a religious bookstore, the chapel, the  newly expanded Maranatha Christian Academy with 1,500 pupils in kindergarten  through grade 12, a fellowship hall and several overcrowded parking lots.  </P> <P> Smith graduated from LIFE Bible College in Los Angeles and was a pastor in  Foursquare Gospel churches for 17 years before taking over Calvary Chapel.  </P> <P> Calvary Chapel's total budget was $9.5 million last year, all from donations,  Smith said.Two-thirds of the income is spent on missionary work and one-third  is used to operate Calvary Chapel. The church has no debts. Smith said  surpluses are used to subsidize tuition at the Christian schools and to loan  $10 million to affiliated churches to help them expand.  </P> <P> Several years ago, the church donated $453,000 to the Israeli government to  help establish settlements in "upper Galilee," now known as the occupied West  Bank, and built baptismal sites for Christian pilgrims on the River Jordan,  church leaders said.  </P> <P> The chapel was recently rebuffed in efforts to build a 550-acre religious  resort and conference center in a quiet valley on Palomar Mountain. This month,  it announced plans to build the retreat near Lake Arrowhead instead.  </P></p>

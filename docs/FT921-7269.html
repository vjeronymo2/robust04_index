			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Bosnians agree on existing borders to ease tension THE leaders of the three main national groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina at the weekend agreed to recognise the existing borders of the central Yugoslav republic to ease tensions in the run-up to the republic's referendum on independence. The agreement, reached during European Community-brokered talks, represented a concession by the leaders of Bosnia's Serb and Croat communities to Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia. But, at the same time, Mr Izetbegovic said he had compromised and accepted the formation of several national territorial units within Bosnia. Moslems account for 44 per cent of the 4.4m population, followed by Serbs (33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent). Although Slavic, the Moslems see themselves as Bosnian and believe that any division of the republic between Serbia and Croatia would leave them homeless. On his return from the weekend talks in Portugal - which holds the EC presidency - Mr Izetbegovic yesterday said his concession would enable the continuation of talks with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbian Democratic Party, and Mr Mate Boban, who heads the Croatian Democratic Union. Serb and Croat leaders have urged re-organisation of the republic along regional lines to limit central control. A western diplomat said: 'It appears that every Serb and Croat politician in Bosnia has a copy of the Swiss constitution. They want to see if it is possible to transplant Swiss cantons to Bosnia.' Serbia and Croatia have held talks over the division of Bosnia. In an effort to prevent the carve-up of the central republic, leaders of Bosnia's Moslems insist on a 'republic of citizens rather than of national groups'. Mr Jose Cutileiro, a Portuguese diplomat who chaired the talks among Bosnia's leaders told journalists: 'We have achieved some progress so far and I hope that we will continue to make more.' He said that talks on the future constitutional arrangement of Bosnia would be continued on Thursday under the auspices of the EC peace conference on Yugoslavia. The talks could ease tensions among Bosnia's volatile population before the referendum set for February 29 and March 1. But extremists from the Serb and Croat communities, who hope to join their kin in neighbouring republics, still threaten to secede from Bosnia. It is uncertain whether the more moderate national leaders will be able to honour their agreement to respect Bosnia's existing borders. They must bring check hardline nationalists and take control of the political agenda.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Swiss Bank Corp rises 6.6% to SFr805m SWISS Bank Corporation, Switzerland's second-largest bank, has disclosed that parent company net profits in 1992 rose 6.6 per cent to SFr805m, (Dollars 551.3m) enabling it to maintain its dividend. The bank forecast last July that profits would be flat this year because of the unfavourable economic environment and the exceptional costs of absorbing acquisitions. However, it said fourth-quarter trading revenues were exceptionally good and significant extraordinary gains were made from sales of assets. Total assets stood at SFr172bn at the end of last year, up from SFr169bn a year earlier. The bank said it would seek shareholder approval at the annual meeting in April to eliminate its participation certificates, converting them into bearer shares at the rate of one-for-one. It would also seek to split its registered shares two-for-one. 'This will ensure the preponderance of the registered shares in terms of voting, as is required under the Bank Act . . . as proof of Swiss control,' the bank said. The directors will propose that shareholders have the choice of receiving their dividends in the form of shares as well as cash.</p>

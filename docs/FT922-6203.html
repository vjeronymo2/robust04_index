			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Belgrade softens line on Bosnia to avoid sanctions BELGRADE yesterday launched a diplomatic offensive to stave off international sanctions by trying to distance itself from the war being waged by Serbian forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Branko Kostic, the acting president of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav presidency, wrote to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, appealing to all sides to allow the reopening of the airport in Sarajevo and stop the bombardment of the Bosnian capital and Mostar (in southern Bosnia). His move followed similar conciliatory statements overnight from the federal presidency and government. The airport has been under blockade since early April, first by the federal army and now by Serbian irregulars. Western diplomats said the statements represented attempts at improving public relations rather than concrete steps to end the killing and destruction in Bosnia. 'It is hot air,' said one diplomat. 'The presidency could take some real steps. For example, it could order the Serbian army to hand over its weapons.' Mr Kostic dismissed as 'psychological pressure' the possibility of western military intervention. 'I think foreign countries will find it difficult to decide to send soldiers to our country because of the possibility of them coming back in coffins,' he said. As Bosnian radio yesterday reported a lull in fighting around Sarajevo, the Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has capitalised on the international pressure which is mounting on Serbia by calling fresh parliamentary elections. The announcement by Mr Franjo Gregoric, the Croatian prime minister, coincides with a revival in support for the ruling conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), led by Mr Tudjman. The HDZ won the republic's first free elections in April 1990. Although Mr Tudjman has publicly supported the territorial integrity of independent Bosnia, he has consistently backed plans by Bosnia's nationalist Croats, led by Mr Mate Boban, and Bosnia's Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, to divide the republic between Serbia and Croatia. This would leave the Moslems without a homeland. Members of Croatia's opposition parties say international attention on the war in Bosnia, and criticism of Serbia, has also allowed Mr Tudjman to crack down on the media. Mr Vladimir Seks, a parliamentary deputy, who was recently appointed state prosecutor, has pressed charges against prominent members of the opposition and journalists. They include Mr Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, head of the Croatian Peasants Party, Mr Milorad Pupovac, head of the liberal Serbian Democratic Forum, and Ms Jelena Lovric, a journalist at Danas, the Croatian weekly. Under the criminal code, anyone found guilty of disseminating false information, or causing disturbances of the public peace, can be imprisoned for up to five years.</p>

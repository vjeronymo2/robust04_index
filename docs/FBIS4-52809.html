			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation of U.S.-Vietnam war veterans leaves for  Hanoi this weekend on a trip designed to help account for  missing servicemen from both sides of the war. The Americans  will hand over maps, snapshots, identity cards, and other  battlefield souvenirs that they hope will help to trace some of  more than 300,000 Vietnamese who went missing in action.    The items were collected from U.S. veterans and are to be  presented by a 16-member delegation. The Vietnamese veterans of  America believe that if initiative can make a significant  contribution to the 20-year effort, they make accounting for  2,234 American POW-MIA [Prisoners of War-Missing in Action] and  Vietnam's 300,000 missing.</p>

The committee, which was created last December through a  decree, is headed by Federal Administration Secretary Romildo  Canhim and made up of seven society representatives.

The  starting point will be the Budget CPI's [Congressional  Investigative Committee] final report, which actually prompted  the creation of this new committee. The committee will  investigate the involvement of Executive Branch employees in the  budget mafia.    Minister Romildo Canhim said the committee will have to  suggest legislative measures or other government actions to  correct the mechanisms that currently exist within the public  administration and that have been promoting corruption:    [Begin recording, in progress] ...as of today, a real  picture, an X-ray, of the public administration system of  authorizing funds.

The  committee is made up of professor Candido Mendes de Almeida,  lawyer Daniel Quintela Brandao, businessman Emerson Kapaz,  former Justices Evandro Gueiros Leite and Miguel Jeronimo  Ferrante, retired Division General Francisco Batista de Torres  Mello, and Modesto Cavalhosa, president of the Brazilian  Attorneys Association's ethics court.</p>

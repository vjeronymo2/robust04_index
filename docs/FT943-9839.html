			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / People: Strategic move for London Stock Exchange The London Stock Exchange, once the English gentleman's bastion, has appointed an American woman, Fields Wicker-Miurin, 36, to the newly created post of director of strategy and finance. The Exchange is facing increasing competition both at home - from alternative trading systems - and abroad - from other exchanges which are increasingly challenging London's role as the centre of cross-border share-trading. Mike Lawrence, the chief executive, created the position as part of a wide-ranging shake-up at the Exchange and the executive has spent six months seeking a suitable candidate. 'The main challenge is to make sure we can maintain our leading position in European and global securities markets,' Wicker-Miurin says, describing her new job. For Lawrence, described by the City's old guard as 'not one of us', the appointment may be a bit of a gamble, although Wicker-Miurin's credentials are impeccable. A native of North Carolina with an MA in international economics and European studies from Johns Hopkins University, Wicker-Miurin also studied at the Institute d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. She has lived and worked in Europe since February 1987, when she was sent to Luxembourg by Core States Financial, a large regional bank then known as Philadelphia National Bank, to establish a European operation. At that time, like many big US commercial banks, Core States Financial had aspirations to use its banking relationships to build a distribution base for commercial paper and other types of securities. However, Core States, along with many of its competitors, found the strategy wrong and the bank withdrew. But Wicker-Miurin stayed, and signed on as a strategy consultant with Strategic Planning Consultants, now part of Mercer Management Consultants where her clients were leading UK and international investment banks and insurance companies.</p>

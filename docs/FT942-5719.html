			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / North awaits decision on Senate race Some 14,000 registered Republicans from the state of Virginia will decide tomorrow afternoon if Mr Oliver North, of Iran-Contra notoriety, has any kind of political future. The probability, but not certainty, is that the party convention in Richmond will nominate him to contest the seat to be defended by Senator Charles Robb. This assumes the incumbent survives the Democratic primary on June 14  -his two opponents have made much of his confessions of marital infidelity. If Mr North and Mr Robb emerge as the candidates of the two established parties, independent bids are likely to follow and make Virginia the most fascinating, if least edifying, of all the national mid-term elections in November. Mr Doug Wilder, former Democratic governor, is poised to enter as an independent, as, under prodding from Virginia's other senator, the Republican Mr John Warner, may Mr Marshall Coleman. He is the former Republican state attorney general beaten by Mr Robb for the governorship in 1981 and by Mr Wilder in 1989. But all eyes this week are on Richmond and the convention's secret ballot between Mr North and Mr James Miller, former budget director in the Reagan administration. With fundamentalist Christian and right-wing support well organised for Mr North, the staid and conservative Mr Miller, previously little-known in the state, apparently faces an uphill battle. However, national Republican strategists are nervous that the convention, with predictable tub-thumping appeals to very conservative values, will be seen as a state version of the party's convention in Houston in 1992. That occasion did nothing for President George Bush's re-election prospects. But, as one local political analyst put it: 'Oliver North is a bomb thrower and the fundamentalists want a bomb thrower.' Mr Miller is not without support from some famous conservative names, including Mr Ronald Reagan, who has condemned Mr North for lying about what the then-president knew during Iran-Contra. This was a scheme in the mid-1980s to sell arms to Iran aimed at securing the release of US hostages in Lebanon. Simultaneously funds were diverted to Contra rebels in Nicaragua in defiance of Congress. But nothing compares with the fury exhibited by Mr Warner at the prospect of being joined in Washington by a man he considers unfit to hold public office and to represent the Republican party. Mr Warner is not only threatening to bolt from the party and campaign as an independent when he runs for re-election in 1996, but is also urging Mr Coleman to get into the senate race, if Mr North is the nominee. Paradoxically, an evenly divided four-way contest might increase, rather than diminish, Mr North's chances if he is on the November ballot. His hardcore support seems very loyal, which is more than can be said for any of the other prospects.</p>

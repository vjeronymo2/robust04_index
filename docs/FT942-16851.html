			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Mexican says he acted alone in assassination The confessed assassin of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's governing party, has claimed he acted alone and not as part of a conspiracy. Mr Mario Aburto denied the special prosecutor's account that he conspired with six other men to assassinate Mr Colosio at a Tijuana campaign rally last month. He said he did not know the other men charged with the murder, according to testimony released by lawyers. Mr Aburto's statement adds to pressure on the special prosecutor to release more evidence implicating the other six suspects, and to find the people who hired them. So far the authorities have largely based their suspicions on a video and photographs that appear to show the suspects helping Mr Aburto gain access to Mr Colosio, witnesses who saw the suspects talking together before the crime, and some inconsistencies in their testimonies. An official familiar with the investigations said Mr Aburto's statements did not surprise the prosecutors, and that under the circumstances it was expected that Mr Aburto would keep silent. The prosecutor's conclusion that Mr Colosio was the victim of an organised plot has led to wild speculation over who may have ordered his killing. Press speculation has centred on members of Mr Colosio's own party, drug traffickers, or unknown subversive political groups. Three of the men charged by the Attorney-General's Office were hired by Mr Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a local official of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, to control crowds at the campaign rally in Tijuana where Mr Colosio was killed. Mr Rivapalacio has been charged with indirect involvement in Mr Colosio's killing. A fifth man has been detained, and authorities are looking for the sixth.</p>

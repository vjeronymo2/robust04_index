The consent decree resolves an action based on violations which occurred at the New Waterbury industrial facility located at 59 Mill Street in Waterbury, Connecticut (``facility''). The facility is approximately 100 buildings on 100 acres in downtown Waterbury, Connecticut and was used for years in the manufacture of brass and copper products. New Waterbury, Ltd., a real estate development limited partnership, acquired the manufacturing facility in 1987 from the former Century Brass Products, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Settling defendants are storing PCB equipment and drums of PCB waste in a building that does not comply with the structural requirements for PCB storage areas established by 40 CFR 761.65(b) (it lacks an adequate roof and walls to prevent contact with rain water, adequate spill containment, and surfaces impervious to PCB penetration). Until the filing of the complaint settling defendants had not been conducting monthly leak inspections as required by 40 CFR 761.65(c)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PCB equipment and waste drums have been stored at the facility since before 1987, in violation of 40 CFR 761.65(a). In addition, settling defendants are operating a commercial PCB storage facility without having applied for and received Region I approval, in violation of 40 CFR 761.65(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to this proposed consent decree, settling defendants will remove and properly dispose of all PCB equipment and PCB waste by August 15, 1995. Settling defendants will also clean up any spills of PCBs derived from the storage of PCB equipment and PCB waste. The cost of PCB removal and disposal under the consent decree is estimated at nearly $500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pending proper disposal, settling defendants will provide and maintain adequate temporary storage measures to prevent and contain PCB leaks and minimize the risks of fire and vandalism, will keep proper records on the stored PCBs, and will report monthly to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed consent decree.

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEATH;  </P> <P> INVENTOR NATHANIEL WYETH DIES  </P> <P> Nathaniel Wyeth, the brother of artist Andrew Wyeth and the inventor of the  plastic soda bottle, died at his home in this coastal community. He was 78.  </P> <P> Wyeth, who lived in the village of Tenants Harbor in Saint George, was  pronounced dead at the Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Glen Cove on Wednesday  night, hospital spokesman Russell Donahue said today.  </P> <P> While other members of the family achieved greater fame with their art work,  Wyeth achieved distinction in science during a 40-year career with the Du Pont  Co.  </P> <P> He was best known for developing the polyethylene terephthalate, or PET,  bottle, which he invented in the early 1970s. The bottle is used for carbonated  beverages, wine, liquor and food because of its light weight and impact  resistance. It was patented in 1973, and more than 6 million of the containers  are produced annually around the world.  </P></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Auditors resign but vigorously defend role ARTHUR ANDERSEN formally resigned as auditors to Spring Ram yesterday following shareholders' concern over the firm's role. Price Waterhouse will take on the audit. In an unusually public statement on a client matter, Andersen vigorously defended its role and stressed that it had served shareholders' best interests. 'We firmly believe that our role over the past few months has been crucial in keeping shareholders informed, albeit of certain unwelcome facts,' it said. The firm said that it had been responsible for forcing Spring Ram to issue a profits warning last year which first alerted the City to potential problems with the accounts. 'The new chairman and finance director have confirmed that their decision to use another firm to review the interim results bears no reflection on their regard for Arthur Andersen or for the role we have played,' it said. It argued that the only changes to pre-tax profits before the year to January 3 1993 related to changes in accounting policies and practices which had been fully disclosed in the accounts. It stressed that it had not been asked to review the interim figures to July 4 last year, which were substantially amended yesterday. Mr Martin Towers, the new finance director, said of the Andersen performance: 'It was not perfect but they were not responsible for the worst things.' The Andersen departure is the second high-profile case in recent months of an auditor resigning from a company after shareholder discontent, while arguing it had done no wrong. Touche Ross tendered its resignation earlier this year as auditor to Trafalgar House following the company's reprimand by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog.</p>

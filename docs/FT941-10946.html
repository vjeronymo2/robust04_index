			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / The Markets: Fed blows off market froth - Global Investor The next few days will be tense as the world waits to see just how serious a sell-off develops in stock and bond markets following Friday's surprise tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve. Despite Friday's 96 point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the bank's  1/4 percentage point increase in the Fed funds rate seems unlikely to kill off the global financial bull - though it will certainly blow away a lot of speculative froth from the beast, and that is no bad thing. The first Fed tightening in five years is a long-term positive for the US economy and its stock and bond markets. With America leading the world out of recession, a turn in the US interest rate cycle was inevitable. Only the timing and degree of tightening were in doubt. By taking Wall Street by surprise, with a rise in rates so small it will not jeopardise growth, the Fed has underlined its inflation fighting credentials  -at a time when it was in danger of losing them - and may prolong the current economic expansion. The recent resignation of two inflation hawks, Mr David Mullins and Mr Wayne Angell, from the Fed board had raised questions about the bank's resolve at a time when speculative funds were starting to flow into traditional inflation hedges, such as commodities. And by taking the unusual step of formally announcing its action - rather than leaving the market guessing - Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, may have ameliorated criticism in Congress over the bank's secrecy. The tightening, at a time when many Wall Street analysts said one was not yet necessary, suggests the Fed expects first quarter GDP growth to come in ahead of the consensus forecast, which stands at about 3 per cent. Mr David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial, who welcomes the Fed move as a 'stitch in time,' thinks GDP may be growing by as much as 4 per cent. So the Fed's pre-emptive action may have prevented a sharp rise in long bond rates some months down the road, accompanied by a severe tightening, which would have had much more serious consequences for market confidence than Friday's move. US Treasuries may have further to fall over the next few weeks, but the tightening means they should not move too far from their current trading range. The Fed, in other words, may have put a floor under the bond market. Bonds could even rally later in the year. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, reckons that a combination of moderate economic growth, low inflation, a falling Federal deficit and sluggish international growth could push long bond yields below 6 per cent again, though that is a minority view. Equities It is hardly surprising that the Fed's move should have knocked some stuffing out of the equity market. After the sharp run up of the past few weeks US stocks are very generously valued by historic standards. And turns in the interest rate cycle have traditionally been accompanied by market corrections. However, this cycle is different in one important respect: the explosive growth of the mutual fund industry. US households have moved a large proportion of their liquid assets from bank deposits and money market funds into mutual funds in a search for higher returns, as US interest rates have fallen in recent years. Over the past year these funds have moved large amounts of money into overseas markets, triggering huge increases in valuations in volatile, illiquid emerging markets. A key question now is the extent to which these investors take fright at falling equity prices and pull funds from the market, thus accentuating its fall; or repatriate funds to the US in the expectation that Friday's sharp rise in the dollar is symptomatic of a long period of appreciation; or move cash back into money funds as interest rates rise. A mere 25 basis points on Fed funds is in itself not going to trigger such action, but many Wall Street analysts think further tightening could push the rate to between 3.5 and 4 per cent by the end of this year. The Fed will need to move gingerly in the months ahead if it is not to spook the equity markets. That said, a slowdown, if not reversal, of the flow of cash into the mutual fund industry is to be welcomed, since it may deflate a worrying speculative bubble. At least, the Fed's action will slow the upward momentum of both US and foreign equity markets, since any increase now will have to be based on higher earnings potential, rather than driven by market liquidity. That bodes fairly well for the US, where corporate profits are rising healthily. Europe may fare less well, and some of the most speculative Third World markets could lose a great deal of fizz. GM and Ford The importance of strong earnings potential should be underlined this week when America's two largest car manufacturers, General Motors and Ford Motor, announce fourth quarter results. Both are expected to produce greatly improved profits, following the example set by cross-town rival Chrysler in January. So is it time for investors to take profits and lighten holdings of US automotive stocks, which have outperformed the market over the past year, with GM and Chrysler up by more than 50 per cent, and Ford up by 38 per cent? Almost certainly not. For the auto companies are in the early stages of a cyclical upswing as cheap loan rates and rising consumer confidence push up US sales of cars and light trucks. The industry expects sales to peak in about 1996-97 at approximately 17m units a year - beating the 16m record set in 1986 - which allows a window of perhaps 18 months for the shares to outperform the market. Sales are expected to rise 7 per cent this year, to about 14.8m vehicles, and the pace could prove even stronger. So far the recovery has lagged previous upturns, and there are an abnormally high number of rust-buckets cruising America's highways which are likely to be replaced. Rising demand means Detroit can reduce the large discounts it has had to offer to shift vehicles from dealers' forecourts, while the rise in the yen (now going into reverse) has helped make Japanese cars more expensive than their US rivals (the price differential averages about Dollars 2,500), which has helped Ford and Chysler win big market share gains. Add to this large gains in Detroit's efficiency (due to the twin challenges of recession and Japan), together with some upturn in the European market in 1995, and you have a recipe for a sharp rise in profits. Ford looks the most attractive of the trio in 1994. Its earnings have not reflected its strong market share gains in recent quarters, but that may be about to change. Market Mania With immaculate timing, The Bank Credit Analyst, the Montreal-based research firm, has just issued a strong warning about the rush into mutual funds and emerging markets, and forecasts that this 'financial mania' will end in a US market correction of between 10 and 15 per cent. It points out that the shift into mutual funds is finite and will stop when bank deposits have been reduced to a core level. Then, which may be soon, the equity market will be particularly vulnerable. However, the Analyst argues that any correction will probably be short-lived. The bull will revive, partly because Europe will follow America's move into mutual funds as interest rates there continue to fall. To support this idea, it points to a close historic correlation between US and UK household holdings of securities. It is an interesting theory, though it perhaps gives too little weight to Europe's traditional lack of enthusiasm for equity investments, which contrasts sharply with American shareholder democracy. The Analyst sees non-US mutual fund investment propping up the bull market for a couple more years, before the mania ends in a 'climactic blow-off.' Of such stuff - and not a   1/4 point on Fed funds - are market nightmares made.  -------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 3/2/94  --------------------------------------------------------------                   ----------- % change over period ------------                     US   Japan  Germany  France   Italy      UK  --------------------------------------------------------------  Cash Week              0.06    0.04     0.12    0.12    0.16    0.10 Month             0.27    0.20     0.51    0.54    0.70    0.46 Year              3.63    3.28     7.19    9.69   11.69    5.63  --------------------------------------------------------------  Bonds 3-5 year Week             -0.39   -0.49    -0.21   -0.09    0.23    0.04 Month             0.76   -1.99    -0.05   -0.15    0.90    0.27 Year              7.36    7.57    16.41   11.47   25.60   10.60  --------------------------------------------------------------  Bonds 7-10 year Week             -0.48   -0.39    -0.39    0.03    0.19   -0.21 Month             1.19   -3.32    -0.18   -0.47    0.91   -0.45 Year             10.95    9.31    21.00   14.50   36.58   17.49  --------------------------------------------------------------  Equities Week              -0.3   -0.9      0.1     1.0      3.8    -0.9 Month              0.7    8.9     -5.3     1.8      2.9     2.2 Year              10.4   23.2     36.6    37.8     39.7    28.4  -------------------------------------------------------------- BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 3/2/94  --------------------------------------------------------------                                        ------- % change -------                             Close      Week     Month      Year  -------------------------------------------------------------- Tasman Properties (NZ)       0.05      66.7      66.7     -54.5 Carena Dev.

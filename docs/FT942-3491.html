			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Strength in cyclicals takes Dow higher Wall Street Most US share prices stalled yesterday, but cyclical issues were strong enough to carry the blue chip index higher, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 9.67 ahead at 3,783.12, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was only 0.43 better at 459.10. A moderate 243.6m shares were traded on the New York SE. A decisive trend also failed to develop in the secondary markets. The American SE composite edged 0.65 lower to 441.19, while the Nasdaq composite shed 2.55 to 731.70. It was yet another session in which many investors preferred to watch and wait for more clues about the economy. May's consumer price data, to be released this morning, were generally viewed as unthreatening, but an unexpected jump in core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy sectors, could trip up the market. With last Friday's producer price data bringing a mild surprise, bond traders were taking no chances on today's report. Treasury prices were moderately down, restraining the mood among equity investors. But economists were attaching more importance to tomorrow's report on industrial production, business inventories and capacity utilisation. The data were expected to show the economy continuing to grow at a stable pace. Such news should have a favourable impact on stocks likely to benefit from healthy growth. Yesterday, cyclicals were showing signs of life for a second straight session after weeks of dormancy. Alcoa advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 75 1/4 , International Paper Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/4 and DuPont Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 3/4 . Offsetting those gains, Exxon dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 59 1/4 after a federal jury ruled that recklessness by the company and the captain of the Exxon Valdez had been responsible for the 1989 Alaskan oil spill. The decision allows plaintiffs to pursue Dollars 15bn in punitive claims. Elsewhere in Oils, Texaco lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 63 5/8 . In the automobile sector, Ford Motor moved ahead Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 59 in brisk activity, after the company unveiled a reorganisation of its financial operations. Chrysler was Dollars 1 1/2 stronger at Dollars 48 3/8 . Cyprus Amax Minerals made a rare appearance on the NYSE's active list. The stock climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 after the group filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf offering of up to Dollars 500m in debt securities and equity.</p>

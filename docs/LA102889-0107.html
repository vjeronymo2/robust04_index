			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRITIUM MISSING BUT THEFT OF GAS IS DOUBTED  </P> <P> The Energy Department said Friday that it has suspended commercial shipments of  tritium, a radioactive gas used primarily in nuclear weapons, because small  quantities are missing. But an official called the action "no big deal" and  suggested that shipments may be resumed next week.  </P> <P> Spokesman Phil Keif said that a review of the matter is "pretty well over" and  that Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is expected to make a decision next week  on whether to resume shipments from Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Oak  Ridge, Tenn.  </P> <P> Most tritium is used in nuclear weapons, although some is used in making  medical diagnoses and in manufacturing luminous lights and dials.  </P> <P> Keif said that some commercial customers had not received all of the gas  supposedly shipped from Oak Ridge. Other quantities have disappeared from test  shipments between lab buildings at the facility, which is operated by Martin  Marietta Corp. under a contract with the government.  </P> <P> He said that there are no suspicions that the unaccounted-for quantities had  been stolen or diverted to nuclear weapons manufacture by another nation or  group.  </P> <P> "It may have been leaks of the gas, or maybe sloppy handling or sloppy  measurements," Keif said.  </P> <P> The department last July announced a halt in tritium shipments from Oak Ridge  after an inconclusive search for about 5 grams of missing tritium. Lab records  showed that the 5 grams had been shipped to commercial customers, but the  customers claimed it never arrived.  </P> <P> In August, the department said that it was resuming most shipments after  finding bits of the missing material and discounting the likelihood of theft.  </P> <P> A confidential internal report disclosed that less than 2 grams of tritium had  disappeared in a subsequent test aimed at trying to determine the cause of the  "losses." The report, obtained by the Associated Press under a Freedom of  Information Act request, said three-quarters of a test sample disappeared  during a round trip of loading and unloading between two labs.  </P> <P> Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who has raised questions about the  disappearances, ridiculed the test results.  </P> <P> "You have to wonder what kind of Keystone Kops operation the Department of  Energy has down at Oak Ridge when they lose more than 22,000 curies of tritium  in a test designed to find out why DOE keeps on losing track of tritium," he  said. A curie is a unit of radioactivity.  </P> <P> "Given the possibility of a diversion for nuclear weapons purposes, it's time  we started getting some answers," he said.  </P></p>

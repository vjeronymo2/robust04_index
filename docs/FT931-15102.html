			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bank agrees to sale of 100m Astra shares BANK Indonesia, the central bank, has approved the sale of 100m shares in Astra International, which dominates the country's motor vehicle sector. The bank's go-ahead is a step forward in resolving the company's two-month ownership crisis. The Soeryadjaya family, Astra's founders, have been selling down their stake following the collapse of their privately-owned Bank Summa with obligations of Rp1,600bn (Dollars 776m). A Bank Indonesia executive, however, cast doubt that the sale of shares would lead to an early return of money for Bank Summa's large-scale depositors. He also said it was 'unlikely' that the consortium negotiating to buy the shares would set up a new bank into which the accounts of the depositors could be transferred. The 100m shares are currently held by a consortium of three banks - Bank Danamon, a publicly-quoted bank, and Bank Exim and Bapindo, both state-owned banks - against loans of Rp500bn on which the Soeryadjayas are in default. Brokers say the two state-owned banks may keep 20m shares, which would raise the Astra stake purchased by state institutions since mid-November to 27 per cent. Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who has led negotiations with the Soeryadjayas for the sale of the shares, is expected to buy about 15m shares, with Mr Liem Sioe Liong, who runs the Salim group, taking about 10m shares, brokers say. Other members of the consortium are reported to include Mr Henry Pribadi, Mr Ibrahim Risyad and Mr Sudwikatmono, all Salim group executives. Indomobil, Astra's main competitor, is a Salim group subsidiary, and brokers warn that the presence of so many Salim group executives in the consortium could undermine Astra's independence.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Observer: Staggering on It's official. New Statesman readers do not have a sense of humour. Several months ago the left-leaning weekly magazine started a competition to find the funniest joke about Tony Blair, Labour's new leader. The winning joke was to have been announced in this week's Labour party conference issue but the magazine has failed to find a funny Tony Blair joke. Or maybe Blair just isn't funny? Anyway, Observer is not prepared to give in so easily and offers a bottle of the finest malt for the best - printable - offering. Answers by mail or fax to 071 873 3926.</p>

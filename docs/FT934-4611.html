			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Europe 'in need of democracy overhaul' Member states of the European Union should set up a two-chamber European parliament to improve democratic control of decision-making, according to an international report published today. This is among a series of recommendations for a fully fledged European constitution, put forward by a group of 13 academics and researchers from seven European countries. The report says the need for a broad public debate on a European constitution has been underlined by difficulties over ratifying the Maastricht treaty. In addition, the prospective enlargement of the Union in coming years requires important changes in EU decision-making. The study group says the legal basis of the EU has become 'incomprehensible' as a result of two important amendments to the original Common Market treaty: the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty.

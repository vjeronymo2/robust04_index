			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town -- Work on a huge reshuffle of the civil  service by strategic management teams is set to begin within  weeks. The mammoth task involves welding departments of  now-defunct tricameral administrations, homelands,  self-governing territories and provincial administrations into  new central and provincial departments.    Each department will be handled by a three-member team,  which  will be empowered to redeploy staff.    One tough challenge will be to rationalise into single  entities those departments where functions were duplicated in  the apartheid era -- and then choose a head.    ANC MP Salie Manie, long involved in think-tanks on  restructuring the civil service, disclosed details of the plan.  The teams will work along guidelines meant to ensure  democratisation and deracialisation of the civil service, while  ending inefficiency and an "autocratic" approach.    Among the reforms proposed by the ANC think-tank is the  introduction of a performance appraisal system "to avoid the  civil service being a retirement village".    A key goal of the plan will be the implementation of an  affirmative action policy.    Implementation of the plan will have to begin in the wake of  tension among civil servants elsewhere in the country,  especially in former homelands. While restructuring will be  far-reaching, a key goal in the process will be to ensure  continuity.    Decisions on redeployment of staff, and even whether early  retirement should be allowed in some cases, would depend on  implications for service delivery and budgetary impact.    Manie said pre-election promises that civil servants would  not lose jobs or be prejudiced by change would be honoured.    There are more than a million public servants.</p>

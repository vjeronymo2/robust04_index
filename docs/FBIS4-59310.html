			<p>BFN     [Text] Medina, May 11, IRNA -- Hajj is the best time to  voice support for the Bosnian Muslims and hatred for the Serbs  atrocities, said head of the Iranian hajj pilgrims Hojjat  ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri here Tuesday. Speaking to  IRNA, Reyshahri said that the hajj season is the best time to  set forth the problems of Muslims and to find solutions for  them. That is why, he added, May 15 was announced the day for  support of Bosnian Muslims.    Reyshahri who is also representative of the leader, said  that  while the arrogant world has practically given the green light  to the racist Serbs to continue their crimes, Muslims are  duty-bound to support the resistance of their Muslim brethren.  He blasted the international organizations especially the  United Nations for their silence and negligence towards Serbs  crimes.    Deploring that the Serbs were massacring more Bosnian women,  children and men every day due to the connivance of the U.N. and  other world bodies, he said the continued arms embargo on Bosnia  has made the Muslims defenceless against the criminal Serbs. He  called for lifting of the arms sanctions imposed on  Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to prevent continuation of the  bloodshed.    Reyshahri said that the U.N. insistence to continue the arms  embargo only indicates the collaboration of the organization and  the big powers dominating it with the Serbs.    Criticising the U.N. opposition with the dispatch of peace  keeping forces from Islamic countries including Iran to Bosnia,  he said that "it has only one meaning and that is the support of  the United Nations, the powers dominating over the international  body and the person of the secretary general for the criminal  Serbs." Stressing that helping the oppressed Bosnians was a  religious task, he called on all Iranian and non-Iranian  pilgrims to assist Muslim Bosnians as much as they could on May  15.    Funds will be set up at the site of Iranian hajj caravans to  collect cash donations of the pilgrims in Mecca and Medina.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Redwood challenges critics of Lloyd's structure MR JOHN REDWOOD, corp-orate affairs minister, yesterday hit out at Labour calls to bring the Lloyd's of London insurance market under an independent regulatory regime. Speaking in response to allegations that Lloyd's syndicates had been favouring working Names within the market by offloading bad risks on to outside Names, Mr Redwoood said that advocates of change would first have to demonstrate there had been 'failings' under the present structure. Names are the individuals whose assets provide Lloyd's capital. Mr Redwood accused Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs spokeswoman, of 'jumping too many hurdles all at the same time' when calling for Lloyd's to be brought within the terms of something similar to the Act which regulates the rest of the City. He suggested that if concerns about the malpractices were serious enough the Names should take them to the Serious Fraud Office. But he added that there was not enough evidence to suggest that a change in the market's regulatory regime was needed. The claims had been made by a group of Names, including Conservative MPs, and prompted calls for an investigation in four parliamentary early day motions by two Labour MPs, Mr Brian Sedgemore and Mr Dennis Skinner. Earlier a delegation of Names, including Mr Paul Marland, Conservative MP for Gloucester West, met Mr Redwood. It included the chairmen of three action groups for syndicates suffering heavy losses as a result of catastrophe claims, as well as Mr Marland, who was a member of syndicates managed by Rose Thomson Young and Gooda Walker until his resignation from Lloyd's early this year. One member said Names on the catastrophe syndicates were facing losses of more than Pounds 500m. The suggestions in the early-day motions that working Names were being given preferential access to some better-performing syndicates were dismissed as an 'unwarranted slur' by Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's. Mr Coleridge said a recent report on Lloyd's by a market task force had shown that in two of the last three underwriting years external members had enjoyed higher re-turns than working members. Insider syndicates - those on which working Names predominate - listed in the the Labour motions were 45 (managed by the Bankside agency), 138 (Bailey), 179 (Anton), 183 (Ashley), 372 (Claremount), 431 (Wren), 960 (Sturge), 990 (Morgan), 994 (Kellett) and 1028 (Wellington). Four of these, (179, 183, 990 and 1028) returned losses in 1988 (the last year for which final figures are available). According to Chatset, the group that provides independent analysis of Lloyd's syndicates, over the most recently available six years only two of the named syndicates (45 and 960) were among the top performers. Mr Anthony Cooper, managing director of Wellington Underwriting, which manages Syndicate 1028, said he was 'mystified and shocked' that one of the his agency's syndicates was included on the list.</p>

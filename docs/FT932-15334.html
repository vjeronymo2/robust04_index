			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Vance-Owen plan must be adjusted to achieve greater equity Sir, For the second time in a year, the US and the European Community are attempting to impose their will on Bosnia's 1.5m Serbs. A year ago, the 'independence' of Bosnia was recognised by the west despite the objections of the Bosnian Serbs. The Serbs, who constitute a third of Bosnia's population and inhabit 60 per cent of its territory, opposed independence prior to an agreement on constitutional principles. Predictably, the Bosnian Serbs took up arms to resist being forcibly incorporated in an inherently hostile state. The consequences of their rebellion have been dreadful. Today, the West is attempting to force the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan. Although the Vance-Owen plan goes a long way toward recognising the rights of all three Bosnian groups, including the Bosnian Serbs, it stops short of an equitable and lasting solution. The Vance-Owen plan divides Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous regions dominated by either Bosnia's Croats, Moslems or Serbs. The Bosnian Croats accept the Vance-Owen plan without reservation because it gives them far more territory than they could have possibly expected. The Bosnian Moslems reluctantly accept the plan because, at present, it represents the best prospect for foreign military intervention. The cost to the Moslems, however, is the abandonment of their goal of a unitary state. The Bosnian Serbs object to the Vance-Owen plan on two points. First, the map leaves large numbers of Serbs in areas dominated by Moslems and Croats; and second, it denies the Serbs a land corridor between the large Serb-inhabited region in north-western Bosnia and Serbia itself. Given the present animosity between the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, an isolated Serb region in Bosnia would become the Nagorno-Karabakh of Europe. It is inconceivable that the Serbs will voluntarily accept this arrangement. Adjustments must be made to the Vance-Owen plan to ensure that it is fair to all three Bosnian groups. Otherwise, the country will be condemned to decades of misery. George Tintor, 52-62 Bishopsgate, London EC2N 4AR</p>

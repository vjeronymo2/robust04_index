			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Clarke puts strict limit on relief of VAT on fuel bills: Compensation 'substantially less' than hoped THE GOVERNMENT appears ready to confront a threatened backbench rebellion over the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel by announcing substantially less compensation than the Pounds 500m demanded by many Tory MPs. In spite of the outcry among the government's supporters over the impact on its traditional voters of the controversial tax, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has decided to limit severely the amount available to sweeten its effect. He has insisted that extra payments to offset the cost of higher heating bills should be limited to those qualifying for income support. That in effect excludes the 'nearly poor' - many of whom are Conservative supporters - with modest incomes and savings who do not qualify for state benefits. In the wake of the government's disastrous defeat in the Christchurch by-election in the summer, several ministers joined backbench critics of the tax in demanding that this group should be compensated. It had been widely assumed at Westminster that Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, had won more from the Treasury to help this vulnerable group. Last night, Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for pensioners, warned of 'serious trouble' on the backbenches if the compensation package was below expectations. One of the arguments that is believed to have convinced the Treasury not to provide more in the present public-spending round revolves around the difficulty of implementing a bigger compensation package. Ministers believe it would be almost impossible to find a simple method of providing compensation for those not on income support. The decision to limit compensation is expected to be approved at tomorrow's session of the cabinet, which will confirm the level of public spending to be announced in Mr Clarke's unified Budget on November 30. The cabinet is also expected to confirm proposals to cut defence spending which, officials say, will not lead to a reduction in operational capability of the armed services or a lowering of manpower levels. In particular, officials suggest that the effect of cuts in the defence budget over the next three years might be offset by sales of land and other military assets that have no direct operational role. On domestic fuel, Mr John Major and Mr Clarke seem determined to stick by the government's original plan to impose 8 per cent VAT next April and to raise that to 17.5 per cent in 1995, but no final decision has been taken. According to MPs close to Mr Lilley, the social security secretary does not see the decision on fuel as a personal defeat. It is understood he always believed it to be perfectly proper that the Treasury, which decided to impose VAT on fuel, would settle the compensation. In the longer term, some minsters do not believe that compensation for the tax on fuel can go on indefinitely, particularly since electricity privatisation has meant lower electricity bills. Mr Lilley has taken an active role in looking at ways to cut his own Pounds 78bn budget, such as slimming the Pounds 5.5bn budget for invalidity benefit. Ministers have now agreed to shave hundreds of millions of pounds off this benefit. On defence cuts, some of the 20 Conservative MPs who have threatened to rebel against the government said they were still unsure whether they would approve the Treasury's proposals. Several of the MPs discussed the government's proposals with Mr Clarke on Monday night. They told him of their concern that the Treasury had been reluctant to allow the MoD to make new orders for Challenger tanks and for the EH101 helicopter.</p>

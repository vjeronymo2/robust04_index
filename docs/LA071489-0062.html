			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD AWARD IS WELL-DESERVED  </P> <P> As a longtime resident of Inglewood, I too am proud of the All-America City  Award, despite its critics (Times, July 7). Yes, it is unfortunate that  apparently this award was mainly given on the crime prevention programs  established by the city. The prevention of crime is foremost on people's minds  everywhere and Inglewood is no exception.  </P> <P> Let me assure you, however, that there are many other worthwhile programs and  activities in this city to qualify us as All-American: Inglewood Women's  Beautification Assn., which, in cooperation with block clubs and individuals,  is planting and maintaining flower beds three times a year all throughout the  city; the annual Community Recognition Dinner; the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  festivities and the Memorial Day service; Fourth of July "Picnic in the Park";  Inglewood Playhouse; Sister City program; the excellent recreation facilities  in all the parks; Inglewood Neighborhood Housing Service, a nonprofit  organization dedicated to improving the housing and living conditions in their  neighborhood, just to name a few. Citizens are participating on many levels and  aspects of city life and determined to make a difference. Last but not least,  as also noted in your paper, the interracial harmony we all enjoy. Inglewood is  truly a dynamic and vibrant place to live. Let no one tell you otherwise!  </P> <P> It is too bad that there are always critics gnawing and biting at the heels of  success. Nevertheless, these folks are also a part of the whole experience that  makes an All-America City.  </P> <P> HERMANN FAE  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

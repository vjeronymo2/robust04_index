			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / The high-wire act continues: Boris Yeltsin will need all the balance and ballast he can muster if Russia is to exploit the first signs of recovery The drums roll, the curtains (no longer made of iron) part and . . . out of Russia comes President Boris Yeltsin, walking on a tightrope. Russia is a great country for high-wire artists, real and metaphorical. Mr Yeltsin, in Britain this weekend and the US next week, is in that tradition. He will feel at home with John Major and Bill Clinton: he is as unpopular as they are, probably more so. Mr Yeltsin leads a sullen country, many of whose people feel abused playthings of corrupt or ineffective politicians, rapacious bureaucrats and criminals. Yet at the same time he presides over signs of revival in parts of the economy: Russia is finally showing that it might realise the promise it has long held out. Mr Yeltsin's unpopularity is, of course, a price any politician in his job would have to pay, though he may have increased it through erratic behaviour and increasing remoteness. And the atmosphere in Russia does seem to have changed in the year since the countdown began to the violent confrontation at Moscow's parliamentary White House. On Tuesday, Mr Yeltsin returned from a five-week holiday at his Black Sea dacha - punctuated only by a trip to Germany to observe the withdrawal of Russian troops - to find an altogether cooler political climate. It is too soon, however, to stop worrying about the course of events in Russia. The hot autumn promised by the opposition may yet arrive. Almost every opinion poll shows a turning away from democrats and growing or sustained approval of nationalist and communist themes, if not parties and individuals. Polling of the electorate in the Moscow suburban constituency of Khimki for a by-election next month shows an electorate whose main complaints are the number of immigrants in their area, the ubiquity of the conspicuously rich and the ineffectiveness of the government. The opposition has promised to bring down the government in parliament - which re-opens next week - and may use the debate on the budget to do so. Leaders of harder-line opposition parties have been in conclave. While they evidently cannot agree a common presidential candidate against Mr Yeltsin, they nevertheless have in former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi a passably charismatic figure round whom they could cluster. Mr Rutskoi and his comrades have little more to offer on the economy than statist controls, a war on crime and credits for all. But their policies do not have to be coherent to prove popular, if they mount a strong campaign. As if recognising this, Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, sounded a caution earlier this week. He said the Pentagon's nuclear posture review had concluded there was a 'small but real danger that reform in Russia might fail and a new government might arise hostile to the United States, still armed with 25,000 nuclear weapons'. Mr Perry seems to mean what he says: the danger is real but it is seen as small - and official Washington will stress to Mr Yeltsin how pleased it is with US-Russian military co-operation, with joint approaches to Bosnia and the Middle East, and with the progress of economic reform and the evident stability in Moscow. Nevertheless, Mr Perry's speech shows how much he thinks there is still to be done - and this will be much of the content of the talks between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Clinton. The US thinks Russia is lagging in reducing its nuclear weaponry, and that it is lax in guarding it. It will propose that Russia stops making plutonium, builds a new storage facility for the fissile material taken from dismantled weapons, and makes a better count of the weapons it has. Mr Clinton will promise to work on Congress to maintain the 'Nunn-Lugar' funds  -around Dollars 200m put up to aid nuclear arms reduction - as long as the Russians show willingness to use them. Russia, however, is resentful of western suspicions. It is also itself suspicious of a Nato, which lacks the constraining presence of the Warsaw Pact at the end of its gun sights, and is giving a broader welcome than Russia would like to its former central European allies. Mr Yeltsin is likely to use his UN General Assembly speech on Monday to call for a reduction in arsenals other than the superpowers' - which means those of the UK and France. He will raise, with both Mr Major and Mr Clinton, the view that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a better vehicle for security than Nato. But Russian suspicions run deep. Mr Yevgeny Primakov, head of the Federal Intelligence Service (the former first directory of the KGB), argues the military, political and economic re-unification of the former Soviet states (except the Baltics) is now inevitable - and is the only way to safeguard the independence and democratic character of their new regimes. If, says Mr Primakov, the west acts as if this is a neo-imperialist thrust, the danger is both sides will retreat into laagers like those of the cold war. This danger is the greater, says the country's top spy, because the west sees it as in its interests to have a weak and divided space where once the Soviet Union existed - not understanding that a new, non-coercive union is the only guarantee of its security. Russian politicians are conscious of their diminished world role and thus are more insistent in demanding that their 'sphere of influence' be respected. They are glad the US is trying to set Haiti to rights because they argue that their own backyard - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Tajikistan - needs the similar robust policing. The trouble for the west lies in learning to distinguish between robust policing and undermining. Ukraine, the other major state of the former Soviet Union, hovers between two possible courses. It could choose a reformist course which would strengthen its real independence. Or it could try to throw itself on the mercy of a Russia which keeps it supplied with cheap energy and provides markets for its low-quality goods. Russian politicians are increasingl their efforts to conclude comprehensive treaties with Ukraine on a range of issues - including the disputed Black Sea Fleet - while the smaller country stalls, knowing it will deal from a weak hand. Similarly, Russia responded to the signing this week of an Dollars 8bn contract between Azerbaijan and a group of major western oil companies by challenging Azerbaijan's right to dispose of the contents of its continental shelf. Its challenge may or may not be pushed to the extent of scuppering the deal. Mr Major will want to raise the issue, since BP is the lead contractor - as will Mr Clinton. Underlying everything, as always, is the economy. Russia's economy looks in better shape than it has since independence. Inflation was down to a monthly rate of 4 per cent in August and the government is holding the budget deficit within the 10 per cent of GDP set by the International Monetary Fund. Better, investment really is coming into Russia - in two forms. First, the sheer rock-bottom prices which Russian assets commanded when they were pulled out of state control are proving increasingly attractive to portfolio investors. Even if many of the shares are worthless, investors have concluded that others, especially in the energy sector, utilities and telecoms, are among the world's best bargains. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister, estimates that at least Dollars 200m a month is now coming in. Second, increasing numbers of large, mainly US companies are setting up production bases, including: Caterpillar, which is undertaking two joint ventures with Russia's biggest engineering companies, Zil and Uralmash; Polaroid, which has seen sales soar as the instant picture craze catches on; and Bayer, which has just started making Aspirin in Moscow. Increasingly, the conventional wisdom is that the reforms are irreversible and that, even if the road is rocky, fortunes can still be made with nerve and patience. For the government the next stage of reforms - if the IMF and the World Bank put up the Dollars 10bn the Russians want - is to balance budget expenditure and move to stabilise the currency early next year. The gleam in its eye is of genuinely low inflation in 1995, with the beginnings of a strong, broadly-based recovery by the end of the year and rapid growth by 1996, when elections are due. By that time privatisation of state assets will be all but complete, and it is not wholly utopian to believe that Russia could end the millennium as one of the world's faster growing economies. The delivery of western support to make this vision reality will form part of Mr Yeltsin's discussions in Washington next week, and will be discussed at the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank. So the conventional wisdom may be right, and becomes more likely to be so with every day that the situation remains stable. But it is not certain. Secretary Perry's 'small but real' risk reflects the increasingly resentful section of the populace which feels left aside. The government has stayed within the limits agreed with the IMF by slashing expenditure on everything, including on commitments like wages. Huge areas of Russian public life - health, social security, law and order, education - are starved of funds, and the bodies responsible for these areas reduced to patching things together, taking bribes or just giving up. Great Soviet institutions have become ruined hulks. Moscow State University's classrooms crumble; many of its curricula are unchanged since Communist times; its teachers are materially poor - but its students, or some of them, desperately strive for an education. The Bolshoi Theatre opened its new season on Thursday night with Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades. The production was antiquated; the costumes less than gorgeous; a huge row raged backstage about money - and the singing was miraculous. Will Russia make it? Probably, in its own rickety, brilliant, arrogant fashion. Mr Yeltsin must seek to explain that way to his bemused friends, and hope they stick with him on the rocky road yet awhile.</p>

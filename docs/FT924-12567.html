			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Arts: Bravura portraiture / Review the 'Swagger' exhibition at the Tate 'The Swagger Portrait' is a phrase that bears any number of interpretations. To Andrew Wilton, Keeper of the British Collection at the Tate and curator of this intriguing exhibition, it may be glossed simply enough by the subtitle he has given it, 'Grand Manner Portraiture in Britain from Van Dyck to Augustus John: 1630-1930'. Swagger, showing-off, self-regard and self-display - such human indulgence is as old as civilisation itself, let alone the practice of the portrait that has marked its record. Here we are offered a bare 300 years' worth, effectively limited within our own national school of painting, but the questions still come begging in. Who is doing the swaggering? It has always been quite as much the artist, up to his bravura tricks, as the mere patron who dresses up and foots the bill. And so, in that case, what, no Holbein, no Titian, no Rubens or Velasquez to get us going, no David, Goya, Ingres or Vigee le Brun to keep us going, nor even Whistler, Munnings, MacEvoy or Nicholson to finish up? Wilton argues his case bravely, and within the particular context points up effectively the constant creative stimulus and exchange that British artists have enjoyed with artists from abroad - from, such as Van Dyck, Batoni, Winterhalter and Sargent in successive centuries. In this respect, with Holbein, the obvious precursor, reasonably excluded, the only serious omission is Whistler: never exactly the swagger painter, perhaps, but with his consummate dandyism and rigorous aesthetic, the perfect, necessary complement and counterpoint, to Sargent above all. The substantial achievement is simply the bringing together of so many marvellous works within a coherent sequence, and yet, mixing the obvious with the unfamiliar, keeping the whole fresh and full of surprises. This, after all, is the familiar story of a field in which the British School stands equal, if not pre-eminent, among international peers. We know it well enough already, but at once, in a first room of some seven first division Van Dycks, we are back on our heels. How hard it is to turn away from Lady Carlisle, Mrs Porter or fair Erminia with her Cupid, but for the treats to come. The direct comparison of Van Dyck with his young English successor at the Cavalier Court, William Dobson, is especially useful, not so much for what it tells of Dobson's antecedents as for his proper distinction. No less refined in feeling and observation than Van Dyck, he is yet more forthright and robust in spirit. His painting of the first Lord Byron clearly foreshadows the quality of 18th century British portraiture, of Reynolds especially whom, had he lived beyond his thirties, he might well have far outstripped. It is good, too, to see Michael Wright, the Scottish painter at the Restoration Court, shown beyond the Scottish context for the cosmopolitan he was, indeed anticipating Ramsay in his travels between Rome and London. But the more notable connection is that demonstrated between Allan Ramsay and his Italian contemporary, Pompeo Batoni, painter extraordinary to the British Milord on the Grand Tour, whom he befriended on his first extended visit to Rome in the late 1730s. Fifty years on, Henry Raeburn's Sir John Sinclair follows Wright and Ramsay in a great sequence Scotch grandees in tartan splendour. More intriguing, however, is the cast the painting makes back, on the one hand, to Dobson, on the other, forward a century to Sargent. It is at such moments that one regrets the conventional chronology of these theme shows. Dobson, Raeburn, Sargent: Van Dyck, Hudson, Gainsborough, Lawrence; Millais, Orpen, John - there is no end to it. There are many particular treats: Hudson's extremely fetching Mary Panton in the blue silks of her 'Van Dyck' dress; Reynolds' windswept Mrs Musters; Gainsborough's dancing Giovanna Bacelli; Beechey's Prinny; Raeburn's harp-playing Lady Northampton; Millais' 'Hearts are Trumps' of the three Armstrong daughters; the Lawrence's willowy Catherine Gray  - wonderful things. The show's final service is the challenge it offers to the received wisdom, that this great tradition in portraiture saw a sad tailing-off this century. The lie is given, in the last brave room, by the several magnificent Sargents above all, but also by Boldini and Lavery; by Orpen's exquisite Lady Rocksavage and his Mrs St George; by Augustus John's extravagant Madame Suggia and by his seated William Nicholson, who should be represented here by more than his likeness. In a happy coincidence, the Allan Ramsay retrospective shown this summer at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery at Edinburgh, where it was reviewed by Patricia Morison, has now come to London. This study confirms Ramsay's recent critical elevation to the front rank of British painters. While the Tate celebrates him in the grand manner, at the National Portrait Gallery follows his later transition into a closer, more delicate and intimate realism. The psychological intensity of his scrutiny is remarkable, his delicacy more French than anything else in British art, his colour of the utmost refinement. As a painter of men, and in his self-portraits, one begins to think of Goya. As a sympathetic painter of women, young and old, he has no rival. The Swagger Portrait: The Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until January 10. Allan Ramsay: The National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place WC2, until January 17: sponsored by Mobil North Sea - a concessionary ticket is available to cover both exhibitions.</p>

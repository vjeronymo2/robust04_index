			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Kostenko under the rubric ``They Have Lived </F> Out Their Days!'' and under the epigraph ``Wake Up! -- Kozma  Prutkov'': ``He Who Sleeps With His Coworkers Will Inevitably  Catch AIDS!''; first paragraph is boldface VECHERNIY KIEV  introduction]    [Text]If you diligently use condoms and do not  indulge in injections by others' syringes, that does not mean  that you will keep your body that has already been weakened by  chemicals, radiation, and the spring weather from the AIDS that  had perfidiously sneaked in from the West. I, for example,  recently got hold of a color booklet published by the Republic  Health Center of the RSFSR Ministry of Health (?) [question mark  as published] ``The AIDS Problem and Your Workplace,'' and I  understood that ignoring haunts of vice will not save us from  this foreign disease: The main danger is waylaying us everyday  at ... work.    The booklet clearly specifies that there are only four ways  of transmitting the AIDS virus. So you only need to limit  yourself in a few ways. In summary, at work you must not do the  following: engage in sexual contacts with an infected person  (and indeed, there are so many healthy people around!); use  needles and syringes together with HIV carriers -- have some  pride and bring personal ones; transfuse infected blood; and  have children if you are already infected with AIDS. Adhere to  the above norms and your safety is guaranteed. AIDS, while close  by, will not sneak into the sterile workplace.    All of this would be funny if it were not so sad. The  valuable scientific material of a doctor of medical sciences has  been clothed in such a strange form that one wants to respond to  the publishers with some large-scale work of the type ``AIDS and  the Absolute Blanks of History,'' ``AIDS and Actions During a  Fire,'' and ``AIDS and the Causes of the Transport Workers  Strike''...    Possibly, only my sense of humor has atrophied, and the  other  50,000 readers (that is the number of copies of the brochure  printed) will obtain something useful for themselves. They will,  for example, find out that fear of the illness passes when  knowledge emerges. I don't know about others, but in my case,  the fear emerged anyway: Somehow it has become frightening to go  to work -- Will I suddenly fail to take some path of infection  into account?    And I was given this ``little booklet'' in the Central  Palace  of Children and Youth. This type of ``literature'' was also  generously dispersed alongside a drugstore. And children hid the  bright little papers in their schoolbags. And then what? School  will be over soon, and I carry it to work. And there AIDS comes  out and rages.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK property Property owners must have hoped that news of the proposed law reform concerning privity of contract in commercial leases was an April Fool's joke. Sadly for them, the government seems deadly serious, although the timing of the legislation is unclear. The government did not go as far as many tenants wanted and refrained from changing leases retrospectively. Nevertheless, the reform will marginally lessen the security of income for property investors. It also represents a further shift in the balance of power from landlord to tenant, although bleating about it savaging property values can safely be dismissed. More worrying for the long term was the environment secretary's announcement that he will review upwards-only rent reviews, confidentiality clauses and procedures for resolving disputes. Any such changes to commercial leases would have far-reaching implications for property owners. The uncertainty may deter those contemplating a return to direct investment. Overseas investors have found the security of UK property leases attractive with German funds buying about Pounds 600m of UK property last year. There are also signs that domestic funds are again looking to buy after budget changes which marginally increased property's relative appeal to gross funds. It would be unsettling if the government prevaricates. But the precedent on privity of contract is not good. The lord chancellor has already taken five years to act on the Law Commission's main recommendations.</p>

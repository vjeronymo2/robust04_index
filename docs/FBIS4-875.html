			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It looks as if the log jam in Liberia's peace  process has been eased. The factions that signed last year's  Cotonou accord have been deadlocked over the appointment of  ministers in the transitional council. Charles Taylor has been  rejecting the selection of four cabinet ministers -- justice,  finance, defense, and foreign -- and has been refusing to seat  to his NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] nominees who  have been appointed. The NPFL has also been refusing to attend  nomination hearings. But now, agreement has been reached over  who should have three of the four ministries and it looks like  quite a breakthrough. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed  this report:    Liberia's five-member transitional council today announced  new heads for the ministries of justice, finance, and defense.  A statement from the office of Council Chairman David Kpomakpor  said a minister of foreign affairs will be named shortly. The  council appointed Laveli Supuwood of the NPFL to head the  Justice Ministry. Sande Ware, of the defunct interim government  of Amos Sawyer, retains the post of defense minister, and Banker  Wilson Tarpeh got the finance portfolio on the ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] ticket.    The statement said the parties to the Cotonou accord made  the  nominations for three of the four disputed portfolios, leaving  the State Council with a free hand to appoint a foreign  minister. It said the new appointees and cabinet nominees of  the National Patriotic Front of Liberia were expected to go to  the confirmation hearings today. NPFL cabinet nominees expected  for today's confirmation hearings include Joe Mulbah of  information, Tom Woewiyu of labor, and Samuel Dhokie, internal  affairs.    A Nigerian diplomat said this is the best piece of news for  ages and an editorial article today in the Monrovia DAILY NEWS  declared: At last a dove of peace is apparently flying over this  troubled nation of ours.    Charles Taylor of the NPFL in Liberia has just called us up  to say that the agreement on the appointment of cabinet  ministers does not have his blessing. He said if Laveli  Supuwood has accepted the appointment as justice minister, he is  a defector from the NPFL.</p>

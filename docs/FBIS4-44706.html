			<p>Tool   <F P=102>   94WS0306C Paris L'USINE NOUVELLE in French 31 Mar 94 p 52 </F> <F P=103> 94WS0306C </F> <F P=104>  Paris L'USINE NOUVELLE </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T.L.: "CNES Manages its Technical Files With an </F> Object-Oriented Database"]    [Text] Developed with an object-oriented DBMS  [database management system], Baghera is a technical information  sharing tool. It facilitates navigation among data and enables  accessing according to specialized viewpoints.    Filing one's data is fine; knowing how to share them is even  better. The CNES [National Center for Space Studies] at  Toulouse, together with Aerospatiale Satellites at Cannes, chose  object-oriented technologies on which to base the creating of  Baghera, their technical-data accessing tool. Baghera was  developed by the Espri-Concept company--which markets the  software--using 02 Technology's object-oriented database  management system. Aerospatiale and CNES have both validated the  product on the basis of a project, and are now planning to  extend its use.    "In the space industry, each project generates masses of  data  that must be accessible by all the participants (design bureau,  project manager, office responsible for manufacturing, etc...),"  says Jean-Luc Le Gal, head of engineering tools integration at  CNES. A satellite program, for example, will produce 15,000  technical documents, 11,000 models of CAD, 200 images and  photos, and even some 100 video sequences describing  components-integration methods.  <H5>  Maximizing Simplification of Information Access </H5>   The role of a tool such as Baghera is consequently that of  facilitating the filing and accessing of these data of very  different natures.    The primary need expressed by the future users of the system  was utter simplicity of access to the information. "After a  comparative test between a relational database and an  object-oriented one, the latter was chosen, because it enables  free-ranging navigation within the data," says Andre Labat, CEO  of Esprit-Concept. In Baghera, the data are structured in the  form of a technical flow chart. The user need only click at the  nodes of the flow chart to obtain, step by step, all the plans,  documents, images, and video sequences desired. By clicking at a  CAD model displayed on the screen (a satellite), the user can  select a component and obtain the manufacturing drawings, video  of its integration, etc. Adding to the database is simplified,  since creating a component in a project means adding an object  into the base.    The other problem that arose in the design of the CNES's  database was the diversity of its potential users. Each user  needs to quickly obtain the information specific to his or her  specialty. Baghera resolves this problem by making it possible  to construct a specific organization of data, around the  reference base, for each specialist. This system of "viewpoints"  enables the design engineer, the project manager, and the  fabrication engineer, for example, to access the data by the  means with which each is familiar. Thus, the designer of a  propulsion system will first display its schemas. But upon  clicking at a piece of equipment, the designer will obtain its  manufacturing drawings, lists of components, a video sequence of  its assembly, etc. The links created among objects correlate the  data modules corresponding to the different viewpoints, and  maintain the coherence of the whole. This capacity for adding to  the modes of access to information is being used to advantage at  CNES and Aerospatiale to gradually bring their different  services around to using the database.  <H5>  A Promising Technological Marriage </H5>   The marriage between object-oriented technologies and DBMS's  goes back beyond just yesterday. The first object-oriented  DBMS's came into being in 1988, and since then this niche has  seen a relatively sizable growth featuring products such as:  ObjectStore by Object Design, the market leader, whose French  subsidiary was created toward the end of last year; Ontologic's  Ontos; Servio's Gemstone; Versant and two French products that  have succeeded in asserting themselves in this emerging market;  ADB's Matisse; and 02 Technology's 02. To the conventional  functions of the relational DBMS, the object-oriented DBMS adds  its ease of adaptation and extension, as well as a respectable  ability to manage complex and multimedia data. Technical-data  processing is well represented in applications such as CAD,  technical databases; network management, geographical data  systems, etc... But the management environment is becoming  increasingly aware of the advantages of object-oriented DBMS's.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Establishment of the Credentials Committee and Committees I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support the establishment of the Credentials Committee and Committees I and II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishment of the Credentials Committee is a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  matter. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Credentials Committee approves the credentials of delegates to the COP, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirming that they are official representatives of their government,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby affording them the right to vote in Committee and Plenary sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States supports the establishment of Committees I and II,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided most participating Parties have been able to send at least two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegates, or that the rules governing debate of the Committees ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most delegations will have an opportunity to debate recommendations before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a final decision is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Report of the Credentials Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support adoption of the report of the Credentials Committee if it does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommend the exclusion of legitimate representatives of countries that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties to CITES. Representatives whose credentials are not in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be afforded observer status as provided for under Article XI. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credentials have been delayed, representatives should be allowed to vote on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a provisional basis. A liberal interpretation of the Rules of Procedure on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credentials should be adhered to in order to permit clearly legitimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives to participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adoption of the report is generally  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusion of Party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives whose credentials are not in order could undermine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential cooperation among Parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Admission of Observers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support admission to the meeting of all technically qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-governmental organizations and oppose unreasonable limitations on their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full participation at COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-governmental organizations representing a broad range of viewpoints and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perspectives play an important role in CITES activities and have much to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer to the debates and negotiations at a COP. Their participation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically provided by Article XI of CITES. The United States supports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the opportunity for all technically qualified observers to fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate at COPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

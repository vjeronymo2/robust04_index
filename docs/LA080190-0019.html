			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULINGS ON OLLIE NORTH CONVICTIONS  </P> <P> Oliver North may well get away with a reversal of convictions based on  technicalities.  </P> <P> The travesty is that North and his supporters will now self-righteously claim  "vindication." This despite the fact that not only have the charges been found  to be accurate, but only immunity kept him from being convicted on many other  possible charges.  </P> <P> He is, therefore, guilty, but free, thus giving "freedom" a fresh meaning.  </P> <P> There is no question that individual rights must be protected, but North's  grinning manipulation of the government and the judicial system is an  embarrassment to American values.  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

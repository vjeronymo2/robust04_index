			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By STAR staff writer Osama al-Sharif ] </F>   [Text] Minister of Finance Mr. Sami Qammuh said that the  prolonging of the UN enforced embargo on al-'Aqabah is a form of  "pressure on Jordan for a political purpose" and that this will  not be accepted by Jordan. He said interception and inspection  of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels has increased over the last few  weeks, and that it is time that this "intervention" in Jordanian  affairs be stopped.    "We never agreed or accepted these practices since the  beginning," he said.    His Majesty King Husayn told ambassadors of the five  permanent members to the Security Council on Monday [28 March]  that Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace process is  conditional to an immediate resolution of the siege enforced on  al-'Aqabah.    In an interview with THE STAR this week, Mr. Qammuh said the  interception and inspection of vessels coming to al-'Aqabah by  U.S.- led ships in the Red Sea "is in contradiction with  international law and with the UN Charter." He added that the  naval act is not supported by any UN resolution and has no legal  warrant.    "We have informed the Security Council Sanctions Committee  (of Jordanian grievances) and the Prime Minister visited New  York and addressed this committee and submitted detailed reports  about the practices and the losses Jordan had been incurring due  to the interception of vessels and the embargo against Iraq and  we are still waiting for a response," Mr. Qammuh said. "No less  than 12 documents have been sent (to the UN), and we received  lots of promises but we have not seen implementation of these  promises."    The minister reiterated Jordanian demands for compensations  to the losses incurred by the Jordanian economy as a direct  result of the embargo. "The losses amount to more than $1.3  billion and with the heavy burden Jordan is shouldering this  additional burden will aggravate an already difficult financial  situation," Mr. Qammuh said.    Since the naval blockade was enforced in 1990, over 1700  commercial vessels were inspected by naval forces positioned at  the Straits of Tiran. "They were inspected, rerouted, but none  was found to be carrying irregular or unacceptable cargo," Mr.  Qammuh said.    He added that Jordan has accepted an interim arrangement of  "an independent, international, nonprofit organization to check  on shore cargo coming to al-'Aqabah because we wanted to  cooperate with the Sanctions Committee." But he pointed that  even such an arrangement does not apply to any of the countries  bordering Iraq.    "We have been acting in good faith and we are committed to  our international responsibilities," the minister said. "We  expect other parties to be equally committed and equally fair in  treating and handling the problems concerning the peace process."</p>

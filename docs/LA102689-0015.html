			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> The Dublin birthplace of Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw has been sold for  $166,000 to a trust that will turn it into a museum. The Dublin-based Shaw  Birthplace Museum Trust will restore the eight-room house near the center of  Dublin to the way it was when Shaw was born there in 1856. Shaw and his family  lived in the house at 33 Synge St. for 10 years. It went up for auction in  Dublin last month but failed to reach its reserve price. "We have been after  the house for some time and look forward to it becoming the basis of an  appropriate permanent commemoration," Trust chairwoman Nora Lever said. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

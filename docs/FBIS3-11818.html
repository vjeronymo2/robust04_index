			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Francisco J. Gurdian M.] </F>   [Text] With great concern we have seen in the agricultural  loan tables published by the BND [National Development Bank]  that the projected disbursements for the 1994-95 season are  insufficient.    I say with great concern, for the amounts listed for each  item really lack any logic and agricultural meaning. Let us take  a closer look at this.    For sesame, for example, the amount to be financed will be  477 cordobas per manzana (according to the table published).  Based on my personal evaluation, the actual production cost will  be no less than 1,200 cordobas per manzana (I am, of course,  speaking merely of operating costs).    This leaves a balance of 723 cordobas per manzana which the  grower will have to make up; I do not know where the grower will  get that money from. The bank, in this case, will only be  providing 39 percent of the costs that will have to be financed.    Then, of course, only 39 percent of the seed's potential is  going to be produced. That is, if all goes well. It is much more  likely that production will be less than that percentage. This  is especially disturbing as those amounts are less than last  year's, despite the 20 percent devaluation and the constant  slippages we are experiencing at the present time.    The same thing is happening with coffee, sorghum, rice,  corn,  etc.    This will inevitably mean that the grower will not be able  to  pay off his debts to the financial system. Naturally the  producer, because of all the above, will not be able to repay  his past unpaid loans that have been restructured or deferred.    And, what amounts to the same thing, the high interest  rates,  the dollarized credits, and the inadequate amount of these  loans, will all combine to generate a major liquidity crisis  that will cause great distress to Nicaragua's heavily indebted  producers.    I have the impression that attempts are being made to  finance  more areas while reducing the total amounts to be financed for  all crops. This is truly cause for much concern.    That is why things are going badly in Nicaragua, very badly.  We have declines in productivity and increases in production  costs, due primarily to insufficient credit.    I will venture to say that the agricultural technology  tables  that the bank uses to calculate its financing are far removed  from reality, and from what is actually needed to produce a good  crop.    And there is something even more serious: the limited funds  they have planned to disburse will be subject to availability.  This means that they will approve loans whose actual  disbursement is not guaranteed. The available bank funds will be  subject to the funds it has recovered, realizing in advance that  those recoveries are going to be low, precisely because past  credit was insufficient to reach points of equilibrium in  production.    In other words, when the producer comes in to apply for a  loan disbursement to meet some urgent and essential need, it is  possible that payment will not be made because at that moment  the bank does not have funds available, thus causing irreparable  damage to the harvest.    Recently in ADAL [Association of Leon Cotton Growers] and  ANPROSOR [National Association of Sorghum Producers] we  conducted agricultural experiments designed, among other things,  to measure the relation between input and productivity. It is  quite interesting that we found that the best harvests, and  consequently, the best earnings, were produced by applying  agricultural technology tables that are different from the ones  used by the bank. In these experiments, the correct amounts were  applied in order to produce good crops.    It was possible to determine that with adequate  fertilization  levels, greater than those estimated, with that alone, sorghum  production could be increased by 20 quintals per manzana.  Obviously, the production cost of each quintal of sorghum then  becomes cheaper. It was proved that the marginal cost of using  more fertilizer was a very worthwhile investment: it gives us  the opportunity to sell at low local prices or to export,  generating sufficient earnings for us to pay off our bank loans  and be left with a profit.    After those experiments, which were repeated many times over  on farms in different areas, using appropriate statistical  analyses and good experimental designs, we were able to conclude  that the best deal the bank can make is to finance production  costs correctly and in sufficient amounts.    And by a better deal for the bank, I mean that its portfolio  of loan payments in arrears, of refinancing, deferred payments,  or loan restructurings will be reduced to tolerable levels, like  those in a country with a normal economy.    It seems reasonable, then, that if we want to create a real  economic renewal and to improve our people's standard of living,  we should use the valid scientific results that are being  generated in Nicaragua in order to adjust the necessary  financing correctly. Let us not deceive ourselves. At the  present time, the agricultural credit system is making mistakes  that bring about unpredictable consequences in political,  social, and economic matters.</p>

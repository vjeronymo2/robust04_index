			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Ford TV service for dealers launched FORD, the leader of the UK new car market, is launching a satellite business television service for its UK dealer network, Kevin Done writes. Regular weekly programmes will be broadcast to the majority of Ford's 400 main and 600 retail dealers. The system is designed to become the main source of business information for Ford dealers in the future. The network should be fully operational by the end of the year. The programmes, which will cover marketing, sales and administrative issues, will be created and supplied by Imagination, a London-based design and communications agency. Ford already operates an internal television news service, Ford Communication Network, to link its plants and offices. The business television system will allow dealer staff to raise questions with Ford management during live broadcasts using a telephone link.</p>

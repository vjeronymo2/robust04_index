			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Four Seasons to raise CDollars 100m with disposals Four Seasons Hotels plans to raise about CDollars 100m (USDollars 75m) by selling half a dozen properties, including the Four Seasons Hotel, formerly Inn on the Park, in London. The Toronto-based company, which claims to be the world's largest operator of luxury hotels, decided to sell the properties to reduce debt and to take advantage of 'what appears to be the beginning of a moderate recovery in the real estate markets'. Besides the London property, the assets for sale include Four Seasons Hotels in San Francisco, Austin (Texas), Santa Barbara (California) and Vancouver, as well as the Inn on the Park in Toronto. Mr Roger Garland, executive vice-president, said that Four Seasons would in some cases be willing to give up its management contract to the buyer. But the group will make it 'an absolute requirement' to maintain management of the London property, despite disappointing occupancy levels. Business has been hit by the weak European economy and by the increasing number of hotel rooms available in London. Four Seasons posted nine-month earnings of CDollars 5.2m, or 19 cents a share, down from CDollars 6.1m, or 26 cents a share last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Karelian Parliament and deputy  to the Federal Assembly, Viktor Stepanov, has told INTERFAX that  on January 9 or 10 he intends to initiate preliminary  discussion, with part of his colleagues in the upper house, of  his proposal not to elect the speaker of the Federation Council.    Stepanov has said he intends to propose at the first session  of the Federation Council January 11 to elect instead an  executive secretary, as well as three co-speakers, each from the  republics, autonomies, territories and regions who would in  turns chair the House sessions. Stepanov has said that such a  structural framework will help to achieve real, not just  declared, equality of all subjects of the Russian Federation.    Stepanov believes there is no such equality so far, because  as distinct from the Russian republics, territories and regions  do not have their own constitutions and their heads are still  appointed by the president.    Stepanov said that as an MP he would like to abolish  Unitarianism in the Russian Federation and provide genuine  federalism, when the component parts in the state have equal  rights as is the case in the United States, Switzerland,  Germany, and some other countries.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTO TICKET PURCHASED IN ONTARIO WORTH $44.4 MILLION  </P> <P> One winning ticket was purchased for the $44.4-million jackpot in Wednesday's  California Lottery Lotto 6/53 game, lottery officials said.  </P> <P> The ticket with all six winning numbers was sold in Ontario, and the holder or  holders can claim the ninth-largest prize in the history of the Lotto game.  </P> <P> But the owner of a liquor store that sold the winning ticket said his  excitement was dampened by a rule imposed only five days ago that keeps him  from enjoying a share of the prize.  </P> <P> The state Lottery Commission changed its policy on Dec. 1 to increase general  sales commissions from a nickel to 6 cents on each ticket while discontinuing  the practice of rewarding sellers of winning tickets with one-half of 1% of the  top prizes.  </P> <P> "Instead of getting $222,000, I got 6 cents for selling the ticket," said Ted  Gable, owner of Corks &amp; Cans Liquor in Ontario. "Talk about mixed  emotions."  </P> <P> The winning numbers were 7, 25, 26, 27, 36 and 39 with the bonus number 4.  </P></p>

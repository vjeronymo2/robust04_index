			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Korea is close to  producing key semiconductor parts completely on its own,  industry sources said Monday.    POSCO-huls, an affiliate of Pohang Iron and Steel Co.,  Lucky-Goldstar Group's Siltron and Poongsan Precision are  gearing up to develop silicone wafers and semiconductor lead  frames in preparation for mass production of 16 Megabyte Dynamic  Random Access (DRAM) memory chips from the second half of the  year.    POSCO-huls is poised to step up production of its eight-inch  wafers to reach annual capacity of 35 million square inches by  year-end and 60 million square inches by next year to meet the  demand for 16 M-DRAM chips.    Predicting the mainstay of semiconductor production will  shift to 16 M-DRAM next year from 4 M-DRAM, the company will  change its wafer production ratio of 4 M-DRAM and 16 M-DRAM to  4:6 from the current 6:4.    Siltron, which concentrates on six-inch wafers making up 4  M-DRAM chips, will make 40 million square inches of eight-inch  wafers by late this year so as to localize 90 percent of the  material, which is currently more than 50-percent dependent on  imports.    Poongsan Precision, which succeeded in developing a  super-thin lead frame enveloping ASIC (Application-Specific  Integrated Circuit), will install stamping facilities to mass  produce lead frames for 16 M-DRAM chips by the end of this year.    Dongbu Steel is reportedly preparing to make polycrystalline  silicone from next year since it is ready to begin manufacturing  its main material, trichloro-silica.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late buying by public funds lifts Nikkei THE NIKKEI average closed marginally higher on late buying by public funds ahead of today's national holiday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 45.23 to end at the day's high of 17,690.67 on late afternoon buying, having fallen to the day's low of 17,563.59 during the first hour of trading on selling by tokkin, or specified money trusts. Volume declined to 220m shares from 246m. Most dealers remained on the sidelines since they end trading for their December accounts on Friday. Overall declines, however, still led advances by 534 to 409, with 196 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.09 to 1,349.86, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.68 to 1,102.55. The Ministry of Finance announced plans for a new capitalisation weighted futures index to end criticism of the negative effects of futures and options trading. The proposed weighted index will take into account the number of shares outstanding and is planned to replace the Nikkei 225 futures index, which is a simple price average of 225 stocks. The announcement prompted little reaction from the futures market, but triggered some buying in stocks which are currently under-represented in the Nikkei 225. Electric power utilities gained ground along with banks and telecoms. Tokyo Electric Power moved ahead Y90 to Y2,680, Mitusbishi Bank Y10 to Y2,430 and NTT Y10,000 to Y572,000. Dainippon Ink and Chemicals put on Y5 at Y411 on reports of planned joint ventures in China. Suzuki Motor, also a China related stock, climbed Y15 to Y846. Trading of Jax, the import car dealer listed on the over-the-counter market, was once again suspended. Volkswagen announced in the morning that it would acquire a 49.9 per cent stake in Jax to boost its Japanese sales network. Medical hygiene-related shares gained on the Finance Ministry's draft budget for fiscal 1993, which earmarked Y134m for prevention measures against a new virus contracted mainly in hospitals. Sanden, a steriliser maker, firmed Y5 to Y593 and Terumo, a leading manufacturer of disposable medical instruments, rose Y10 to Y875. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 35.20 to 19,082.48 in volume of 37m shares. The index retreated for the first time in four trading days ahead of the national holiday. Roundup THE region's markets were mixed yesterday. HONG KONG was lifted by foreign institutional buying and the Hang Seng index finished 55.26 ahead at 5,297.74 in low turnover of HKDollars 1.77bn. Among the actives, HSBC Holdings appreciated 50 cents to HKDollars 53, while Cheung Kong gained 40 cents at HKDollars 17.90 and Jardine Matheson moved forward 50 cents to HKDollars 41.50. Hong Kong Telecom firmed 20 cents to HKDollars 9.45. SINGAPORE retreated on profit-taking in blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index receded 22.33 to 1,489.16 in volume of 68.5m shares, against 112.9m on Monday. SEOUL reversed early losses as investors concentrated on small and medium-sized companies. The composite index was finally 3.55 higher on balance at 657.01 in turnover of some Won460.7bn. TAIWAN regained some of Monday's fall but sentiment remained nervous following the ruling Nationalist party's poor performance in parliamentary elections at the weekend. The weighted index improved 3.88 to 3,579.97 in low turnover of TDollars 8bn. AUSTRALIA lost ground after its strong recent performance, the All Ordinaries index closing 7 down at 1,530.1 in turnover of ADollars 301.7m. BHP relinquished 8 cents to ADollars 13.08.

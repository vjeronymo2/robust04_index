			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: German bank lifts profits 'more than 30%' Commerzbank's total operating profits climbed by 'more than 30 per cent' in the first five months of the year, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chairman, said yesterday. Partial operating profits, which exclude the profits generated from the bank's own-account trading activities, increased by more than 13 per cent, he said. The comments come only weeks after the bank reported an 11 per cent increase in partial operating profits for January to April this year, serving to emphasise the robustness of the bank's earnings in spite of bad market conditions and poor share price performance, in common with other German bank shares. Commerzbank's shares, unchanged yesterday at DM324, have dropped nearly 17 per cent since the beginning of the year whilst German bank shares as a whole are down by more than 20 per cent. Provisions for the year as a whole would be high, Mr Kohlhaussen predicted at a press conference in Luxembourg, but would not necessarily be higher than last year when Commerzbank was the only one of the big German banks to reduce total provisions. The total operating profits are calculated after taking account of provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Mr Kohlhaussen said the result to date included a 'good three-digit' contribution from own-account trading - that is, more than DM100m. Interest income rose by 7.6 per cent in the five months while fee income rose by 5.6 per cent. The preliminary figures did not as yet include any extraordinary profit from from the sale of a stake in the Karstadt retailer or the DBV insurance group, the chairman indicated. For last year as a whole total operating profits rose by nearly a quarter to DM1.33bn (Dollars 810m).</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Recovery 'will fail to solve unemployment' Even a sustained recovery in industrial economies will fail to solve the problem of unemployment, the Bank for International Settlements warns in its annual report, writes Philip Coggan. The BIS takes the free-market line that 'a large proportion of the labour force will remain unemployed unless action is taken to make labour markets more flexible, especially in Europe'. Mr Andrew Crockett, general manager of the BIS, said: 'The purpose of the financial and economic system is to serve social goals: growth and employment foremost among them. 'If the economic and financial system is not succeeding in delivering full employment, we cannot be satisfied. 'The danger is that people will reach for the most obvious solution: to expand aggregate demand.' In the annual report, the BIS argues high unemployment is due to 'structural rigidities that prevent the labour market from functioning efficiently. 'Legal or other arrangements, originally designed to protect workers in employment, have turned against those without jobs.' The bank is not very optimistic that the problem can be easily solved. 'Unfortunately for the prospects of achieving reform, existing arrangements are often backed by a strong social consensus,' the report adds. 'There seems to be little alternative to a patient explanation of economic cause and effect as a means of preparing public attitudes for the changes essential if lasting progress is to be made in tackling the evil of unemployment.' More immediately, the Bank argues that progress could be made by scaling back employers' social security contributions and other non-wage costs which may constitute a disincentive to take on labour. Although the bank feels that the current unemployment rate of 11.5 per cent in European countries is partly cyclical, it warns that 'even on the most favourable estimates, some 7-8 per cent of hard-core or structural unemployment would remain after a cyclical recovery'.</p>

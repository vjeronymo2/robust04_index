			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / German unions hit out at cuts: Waigel's plans to curb public-sector deficit draw fire from both sides TRADE union leaders in Germany warned this weekend of all-out opposition to the cuts in social spending planned by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, as part of his latest drive to curb the public-sector budget deficit. At the same time, leaders of German industry have warned that the package may not be tough enough to control the deficit and therefore to give the German Bundesbank room for further cuts in its leading interest rates. The package, which Mr Waigel hopes to finalise in negotiations with ministerial colleagues, and members of the parliamentary parties in the ruling coalition, by tomorrow night, is supposed to cut public spending by DM30bn (Pounds 12bn) next year, by DM35bn in 1995 and DM40bn in 1996. Key components are a 3 per cent across-the-board cut in unemployment and social assistance benefits, imposition of a 32-month time limit on unemployment pay, a pay freeze in the public sector, and cancellation of 'bad weather pay' for workers in the building industry. Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, chairman of the German trade union federation (DGB), described the package as 'anti-social and therefore unacceptable' to the trade union movement. He warned of opposition from the labour movement 'with all the means at our disposal', clearly implying strike action, although political strikes are illegal. IG Bau building workers' union also threatened strike action if 'bad weather money', compensating construction workers for idle days, is cancelled. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the new national chairman of the opposition Social Democrats, added his voice against cuts in social spending, although he hinted that some compromise might be necessary. Mr Waigel seems to be determined to hold his line for a savings package which is merely intended to keep the federal government's budget deficit to DM70bn in 1994 - the same as the probable outcome in 1993, compared with an original target of DM43bn. He repeated at the weekend that it was wrong for unemployed workers to earn more than those with jobs, and wrong for those on social assistance to get as much as those who have paid their unemployment benefit. His plan would cut a married worker's dole money from 68 to 65 per cent of net income, and that of an unmarried worker from 63 to 60 per cent. Mr Waigel held talks last week with most of his departmental colleagues, including Mr Matthias Wissman, the transport minister (who faces a freeze on all new west German road building), and Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, who is being asked to cut subsidies to the coking coal industry. Today he has an important meeting with Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, before presenting his package to the leaders of the parliamentary parties in the ruling coalition. Although the budget is to be finalised only by July 13, Mr Waigel and Chancellor Helmut Kohl want to have the savings package agreed before the Group of Seven summit on July 7-9. They expect to face renewed pressure there for tougher spending control, in order to give the Bundesbank room for more interest rate cuts.</p>

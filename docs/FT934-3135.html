			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Committee re-elects unionist supporter Mr Andrew Hunter last night held off a challenge from Mr Peter Temple-Morris for the chairmanship of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee in a move that was immediately welcomed by Ulster Unionists. Although detailed results of Conservative backbench elections are not officially released, the Conservative MP for Basingstoke was believed to have polled between twice and three times as many votes as his challenger. As many as 150 Conservative MPs were said to have cast votes, reflecting the high level of interest in the province at Westminster at present. Mr Hunter said afterwards: 'This vote was a clear signal that the Tory back benches are not in the business of buying peace from the IRA. It was a signal, too, that the mood on the back benches is pro-unionist.' Mr Temple-Morris, the more moderate MP for Leominster, said he was 'naturally disappointed' but added that the committee was 'in good hands'. For the Ulster Unionists, Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, said Mr Hunter's election would 'help to settle nerves in Northern Ireland'. Mr Hunter's election was 'a significant reflection of feeling on the Conservative back benches at the present moment, especially as there was a very strong challenge'.</p>

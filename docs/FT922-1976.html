			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Investors in UK and US shy away from deal - Demand falls short by 30m shares leaving financial advisers bitterly disappointed DEMAND for GPA Group's shares fell well short of the goal set by the aircraft lessor's financial advisers, with UK and US institutional investors shying away from the deal. Originally, GPA had hoped to sell 80m shares worldwide, with 30m in the UK and Ireland, 20m in the US, 15m internationally (continental Europe, the Middle East and Asia), and 15m in Japan. Instead, by early yesterday morning, the financial advisers to the issue found that there was only demand for about 50m shares, with nearly half of that - 22.93m - coming from retail investors in Japan. Although some of the other financial advisers remained sceptical about the strength of Japanese demand for the shares, Nomura, the global co-ordinator for the issue, denied its managed investment funds would have been used to mop up the shares. It said that two-thirds of the demand from Japanese retail investors was new money. Demand from international investors, particularly Swiss, German and Middle Eastern institutions, was healthy, amounting to 13.3m shares. However, in the UK and Ireland demand amounted to only 7.5m shares, while in the US there was only a demand for 6.5m shares. In both cases, the institutions were notable by their absence, according to the financial advisers involved in the flotation. One adviser said: 'US institutional demand was disappointingly small - though maybe it would have been better if there had been more time to sell the issue.' With such a low proportion of institutions willing to buy, financial advisers pointed out there was not a substantial enough investor base for the deal to go ahead, and expressed concern that the retail investors could have quickly sold out if the issue had gone ahead. Financial advisers and investors yesterday provided plenty of reasons why GPA had not proved a popular stock. Many pointed to the current difficulties faced by the US airline industry, general market conditions, and the reluctance of the US fund managers to commit themselves to the issue before seeing the response of the UK investors. One of the advisers to the issue complained: 'There wasn't any single issue which arose, but it was partly the fact that the US investors seemed to be looking to the UK for a lead, while the UK investors looked to the US for a lead.' Another of GPA's financial advisers blamed conditions in the US market for IPOs (initial public offerings). 'Several recent (IPO)issues have subsequently traded at below the price offered, which doesn't look good.' GPA's rapid growth and the domineering style of its senior management made some potential investors wary. The head of investments at one of the UK's biggest insurers said: 'People are very nervous about these large entrepreneurial businesses - it hasn't been a good year for them.' In addition, GPA's high level of gearing and the complex financial structure of the group put off the more cautious investors. 'It's the sort of business that's very difficult to understand,' said one. 'It's like a pyramid of cards. If something goes wrong, the whole lot could come down.' The airline industry analyst at one of the largest US mutual funds, which has Dollars 70bn under management, gave several reasons for turning down the GPA offer. 'GPA badly needed access to public equity finance, which is not the best motivation for a global share offering,' he said. 'Investors were unnerved by the air of urgency.' He added an assortment of further reasons for remaining cautious including:- The cyclical peak in leasing margins and residual aircraft values has already been reached against a background of decline in the airline industry as a whole. It was 'common knowledge' as early as last year that Air Canada and Air Lingus wanted to liquidate their holdings in GPA, and the stock was touted around the US. GPA's financial strength was questionable. Total debt rose from Dollars 2.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 4.1bn in 1992. Gearing rose from 240 per cent to 330 per cent. The company is commited to raising Dollars 11.9bn to fund aircraft purchases to the year 2000, with a further Dollars 9.1bn required if it exercises options on aircraft. Lines to meet these funding needs are not in place. Lease financing from Japanese banks, the engine of the business in the 1980s, has dried up. This could lead to an increase in on GPA's cost of funds. GPA's profitability was already in decline. Upward pressure on funding costs will accelerate this. Most of GPA's customers were not among the top league airlines, so its exposure to credit risk is substantial. The failure of the issue has clearly been a bitter disappointment to many of the financial advisers concerned, particularly Nomura given that it was the company's first mandate as global co-ordinator for an equity deal outside Japan.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JORDAN BEATS JEFFERSON, ENDS 14-GAME SLUMP  </P> <P> Damien Jackson's nine-yard touchdown pass to Malcom McCray with 6:19 to play  gave Jordan a 24-18 victory over Jefferson Friday in a City nonconference game  at Jefferson.  </P> <P> Jordan, which had lost 14 consecutive games, scored on all of its second-half  possessions to erase an 18-6 halftime deficit. The Bulldogs' last victory also  came against Jefferson, on Oct. 28, 1988.  </P> <P> "We've been struggling all season, but today we put it together," said Jackson,  who threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score. "I think our  program is on an upswing."  </P> <P> Jordan (1-4) took a 6-0 first-quarter lead on a 67-yard touchdown pass play  from Jackson to McCray. However, Jefferson scored 18 consecutive points behind  tailback Tony Thomas, who finished with 103 yards in the first half, and  fullback Marcus Johnson, who scored two one-yard touchdowns. The Democrats'  third touchdown came on a 24-yard pass from Darrell Cooley to Emilo Ramirez.  </P> <P> Thomas, a junior, entered the game with 735 yards rushing for the season. He  was shut down in the second half as Jordan held him to 20 yards and took  control with its rushing attack.  </P> <P> Behind James Wheeler and Maurice Smith, who combined for 91 yards in 20  carries, the Bulldogs outgained Jefferson in total yards, 178-87, in the second  half.  </P> <P> "We just keyed on (Thomas) in the second half," first-year Jordan Coach Edward  Woody said. "He is an outstanding back, so we knew we had to keep him off the  field with ball control."  </P> <P> In its three second-half possessions, Jordan went 66 yards in six plays with  Smith scoring on a six-yard run; 59 yards in five plays with Jackson running in  from three yards out, and 53 yards in eight plays capped by Jackson's touchdown  pass to McCray.  </P> <P> A last-minute drive by Jefferson (2-3-1) ended at Jordan's 13-yard line.  </P></p>

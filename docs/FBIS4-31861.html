			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] A debate is currently taking place in  the Czech Republic on the best way to privatize health care to  provide better care and operate more efficiently. A HOSPODARSKE  NOVINY article of 22 April indicated that, after privatizing  most other industries, it is now time to do the same for the  health-care system. A total of 5,419 projects have been  recommended for 644 health-care facilities, and 4,000 of these  still need to be decided on by the Privatization Ministry. A  total of approximately 10 billion Czech korunas [Kc] of  health-care properties have already been privatized.    Referring to the privatization of health care in another  article of the same issue, Jan Zamboch noted that "the road  there is actually a road back." One of the proposals calls for  a centralized office that would disburse insurance funds and  control prices for health-care services. Additional service  coverage would have to be purchased by individuals privately.  However, according to Zamboch, one objection to this plan is  that it would prevent competition and that politicians would  have too much influence over the health-care system; measures  would have to be taken to keep politicians out of such a  decision to make it more palatable for the average citizen.    An independent Health-Care Commission would decide on the  extent of critically required health care, regardless of cost  involved; the insurance would not cover routine health care that  citizens could provide for themselves. This would make it  possible for the patient to choose between purchasing services  directly from a doctor or through a commercial insurance  company. The resulting competition should make many services  less expensive. Zamboch rejected assertions that the quality of  care would deteriorate and argued that the threat to a doctor of  having an insurance contract canceled should lead to greater  efficiency.    According to an item in LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE of 11 May, in  which  a discussion between President Havel and Health Minister Ludek  Rubas is described, Rubas stressed that introducing nonprofit  organizations into the health-care system would violate the  principles of competitiveness between health-care facilities and  would cut down on efforts to improve the overall quality of  health care. Rubas conceded, however, that exceptions could be  made in cases of rehabilitation, child care, and long-term care.  Rubas assured Havel that no great problems should be  encountered in the course of transformation; the pace and nature  of this transformation remains in question. In any case, the  creation of some nonprofit organizations could be expected.    In the DENNI TELEGRAF of 7 May, Rubas also criticized the  low  pay of the medical profession, which he said is lower than for  other professions because wages were still being set by the  government. Rubas admitted, however, that money for higher wages  is not currently available. As one consequence, large numbers  of nurses left the Czech Republic for Austria, although,  fortunately, the Austrian hospitals now have sufficient  personnel, and newly trained Czech nurses are entering the  profession within the country. Also, insurance companies are  compensating the hospitals at a rate of Kc300 per bed, while the  actual costs are Kc500 and must be supported by the hospitals  themselves. Minister Rubas then stated that he feels that the  main task is to finish privatization of the health-care system.    HOSPODARSKE NOVINY of 25 April published an interview with  Deputy Health Minister Ondrej Typolt by Peter Misur. During the  interview, Misur expressed concern that, during the past two  years, expenses for health care in the Czech Republic increased  with respect to the GDP by almost 3 percent. Misur added that  an 8-percent rate would create a situation where "there are no  standard solutions." Typolt responded that a major problem is  the way government budgets are formed but warned against  imposing any solution that would only preserve the current  inappropriate structure of health facilities and lead to  inflationary increases.    In response to other questions, the deputy minister  indicated  that changes must be made in capital investments and that many  of the construction projects will have to cease and more effort  be placed on restructuring and modernization of the existing  capacities. Typolt indicated that the "health insurance system  must be changed from what is really a health tax to a system  that would compete on the basis of cost containment, not on  income." The minister said that he supported providing primary  health care from general insurance but indicated that more  controls may be needed over the health-insurance system. Typolt  also said that he expected health care and hospital-care  insurance to be combined by the year 1996. He concluded that a  comprehensive legislative proposal for the entire health-care  issue has been prepared and should completely replace the  current law.</p>

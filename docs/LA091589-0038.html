			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAL BOARD ACCEPTS PILOTS' $6.75-BILLION BUYOUT OFFER  </P> <P> UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, accepted a $6.75-billion bid from its  pilots and the company's management Thursday, clearing the way for the largest  buyout ever of an American company by its employees.  </P> <P> The deal, worth $300 a share, would also give a stake in the airline to British  Airways, bringing the strong transatlantic carrier closer to its goal of  becoming a global airline.  </P> <P> Although the buyout still faces obstacles, it would represent a victory for  United's pilots' union, which tried without success to buy the airline two  years ago. It also would be a triumph for UAL Chairman and Chief Executive  Stephen M. Wolf, who spearheaded the pilot-management coalition to avoid a  takeover by Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis.  </P> <P> How strongly other United employees support the transaction is still a  question. The airline's largest and most militant labor group, the  International Assn. of Machinists, said that the debt-financed deal threatens  the airline's future and "jeopardizes the livelihoods of the work force."  </P> <P> And a group that claims to represent United's 40,000 non-union employees is  considering legal action to stop the transaction. The group, called Coalition  Acting for the Rights of Employees, is angry that the airline can unilaterally  cut its wages to finance the deal.  </P> <P> Sources in the financial community said Thursday that the disagreements with  the machinists and the non-contract employees could threaten the proposed  buyout, if it is not resolved.  </P> <P> United is the nation's second-largest airline, next to American Airlines. It  was an attractive takeover target because it operates valuable Pacific routes  and owns, rather than leases, a large fleet of aircraft. Airline industry  analysts have said that a buyer can easily finance a bid by borrowing against  United's airliners and landing slots.  </P> <P> Wolf, in a statement, said that the buyout not only would "secure the future of  United Airlines and its employees" but it would "provide the best value to  shareholders."  </P> <P> "As the largest U.S. employee-owned company," he continued, "United Airlines  will keep its tradition of quality service and combine it with a new  entrepreneurial vigor."  </P> <P> Currently, the largest American company owned by its employees is Avis Corp.,  the rental car company. Other companies, such as J. C. Penney and Delta Air  Lines, have sold stock to employees, but not enough to grant control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Provisions  </P> <P> The agreement between the UAL board and its employees contained some unusual  provisions that indicated the battle for the airline might not be over just  yet. The board instructed its advisers to talk to any other possible buyers and  provide them with information needed to make an offer. The board's advisers are  First Boston Corp., a New York investment bank, and the New York law firm Davis  Polk &amp; Wardell.  </P> <P> The buyout offer doesn't contain any so-called "lock-up" agreements that have  become standard in highly contested takeover battles. By giving the buyer the  right to buy a company's most valuable possessions cheaply, these agreements  discourage other bidders.  </P> <P> These provisions apparently leave the door open to a new bid from Davis, and to  other possible buyers. Also said to be interested in UAL is Texas investor  Robert M. Bass, who, according to a source, held discussions this week with the  machinists' union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Davis Still in Bidding?  </P> <P> Davis, the billionaire oilman, triggered the battle for UAL six weeks ago when  he offered to buy it for $240 a share, or $5.4 billion. He later raised his bid  to $275 a share, and he said that he might go higher after he reviewed UAL's  confidential financial documents, such as leases and other contracts.  </P> <P> But Davis indicated early Thursday that he wasn't prepared to raise his bid  since he hadn't completed his examination of UAL's books. After the agreement  was announced Thursday, however, he had no comment.  </P> <P> This is the second time an airline has apparently slipped by Davis, the former  owner of 20th Century Fox. Earlier this year, he tried to buy Northwest  Airlines, but was outbid by Los Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi.  </P> <P> The labor-management proposal would give employees a 75% stake in the airline.  Management, including Wolf, would get 10% and British Airways would get a 15%  stake. Although the pilots are the only labor group among the buyers, United's  flight attendants said Thursday that they reviewed the proposal and might  participate.  </P> <P> The labor-management proposal would reportedly be financed with $7.2 billion  loaned by a consortium of banks led by Citibank and Chase Manhattan. The funds  would be used to finance the transaction and refinance some of UAL's  $1.2-billion debt.  </P> <P> In addition, British Airways would contribute $750 million in return for  preferred stock, and the pilots' union would contribute $200 million from its  pension fund. It would also receive preferred stock in return. Management,  including Wolf and UAL Chief Financial Officer John C. Pope, would contribute  $15 million.  </P> <P> The pilots have also said that they would contribute another $250 million in  wage concessions and increased productivity. The machinists, however, say that  the figure is inflated. For example, $40 million of the pilot contribution  isn't cash, but credit for lost wages during the 1985 strike. The machinists  don't think lost wages should count as equity.  </P> <P> Louis R. Schroeder, president of District 141 of the International Assn. of  Machinists, said in a letter to UAL's board that the machinists have "no  alternative other than to take all actions available to aggressively protect  our members against its negative ramifications."  </P> <P> The machinists could mount a legal challenge to block the transaction, or they  could strike after their contract becomes amendable next month.  </P> <P> In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL's stock closed at  $280.50, down $2.75.  </P></p>

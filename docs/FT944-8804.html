			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Blair underlines retreat from unions The Labour leadership yesterday delivered a double barrelled warning that it is serious about plans to reform the party's relations with the unions. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, told the unions that it was in their best interests not to be associated with one particular political party. Mr Blair's comments, in the leftwing magazine New Statesman, went significantly further than his earlier warnings that unions could expect no special access to a future Labour government. The significance of his remarks was underlined by Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, in a speech to a conference on relations between managers and unions. Mr Prescott, regarded as the most traditionalist member of Labour's leadership, said that the party would no longer take 'a partisan approach to industrial relations, sometimes in spite of our judgment of what is best'. The concerted declaration of Labour's independence from the unions comes as the leadership prepares for a battle with union leaders and leftwing MPs over the future of Clause IV, the party's commitment to widespread public ownership. Separation from the unions and the emasculation of Clause IV are regarded by Mr Blair's supporters as vital elements of his plan to modernise the party by distancing it from its traditional socialist roots. Mr Blair, who is expected to expand his view of the relationship between the party and the unions at a London conference tomorrow, told New Statesman readers that unions had a role in protecting working families from economic change. But he said that unions could protect their influence only by 'being a broad voice of the working people, not a direct party political voice, or one that is concerned for a narrow interest of individual unions'. He said that unions 'do not want, and will not get, favours from a Labour government'. Unions 'should be able to thrive with any change of government . . . because they speak for the broad interest of working families'. Mr Blair said the unions must adapt to change by developing better services or risk losing members to private-sector organisations that would 'cherry pick' their profitable activities. 'Just as Labour is now looking again at the culture, organisation and constitution of the party, so are many unions who see that the present structures and objectives are out of date,' he said.

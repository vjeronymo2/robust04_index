			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOOL ORDERS FALL; INDUSTRY IS OPTIMISTIC  </P> <P> Orders for machine tools fell 24.1% in November due to the sagging economy and  volatile Middle East situation, but they were still higher than a year ago, a  trade group reported.  </P> <P> Albert Moore, president of the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology, said other  causes for optimism included "continued export opportunities, particularly now  that the dollar is at a more realistic level, and the need for investment by  American manufacturers (which) mean business for machine tool builders."  </P> <P> The recent move by the Federal Reserve to lower key interest rates, which in  turn would aid domestic production and trade, also is encouraging for industry,  Moore added.  </P> <P> November machine tool orders fell to $203.4 million from October's $268.10  million, the association said. But they were 10.3% higher than the $184.40  million in orders in November of 1989.  </P> <P> Machine tools, including computer-assisted lathes, machining centers and  milling machines, are used to produce a wide range of articles -- from  household goods to heavy machinery and sophisticated weaponry.  </P> <P> Economists watch the orders as an indication of the future health of  manufacturing.  </P> <P> In its monthly statistical report, the trade association said machine tool  shipments had a value of $268.65 million, up from $253.75 million the previous  month, but 14% below the year-ago level.  </P> <P> Foreign orders totaled $41.50 million, up from $33.95 million in October and  $36.20 million in November, 1989.  </P> <P> Metal-cutting tool orders fell 24.6% last month to $137.45 million but were up  6.6% from a year ago, when orders totaled $128.90 million.  </P> <P> Metal-cutting shipments fell 2.8% to $183.45 million in November and were 19.8%  below last year's level.  </P> <P> Orders for metal-forming tools fell 23% last month to $65.95 million from  October's $85.70 million, but were up 18.8% over the $55.5 million of a year  ago.  </P> <P> Metal-forming shipments totaled $85.20 million in November, a 31.2% increase  from October's $64.95 million. They were up only 0.1% from the $85.10 million  of November, 1989, however.  </P></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Senior Tories call for more oil tax concessions SENIOR TORY backbenchers are putting the government under renewed pressure to make further concessions over its proposed changes to North Sea oil taxes. Six Conservative MPs last night tabled a group of amendments calling for a three-year transition period before the changes take full effect. The amendments may be considered when the Finance Bill returns to the Commons for its report stage next Monday. The move followed a 90-minute meeting at the Treasury involving three of the MPs, industry representatives and Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. One of the backbenchers - Mr John Butterfill, Conservative MP for Bournemouth West - said that Mr Dorrell had listened to the group's arguments very carefully. Treasury officials said last night that the new proposals would be considered but that the government was unlikely to allow further concessions. The additional amendments were welcomed by members of the oil industry last night. One large North Sea oil company said the new terms would encourage more sustained activity during the transition to the new tax regime. The renewed initiative comes less than a month after the government bowed to pressure by agreeing to extend some short-term help to companies worst affected by the changes, by making it easier for them to claim the Pounds 200m earmarked in the Budget for this purpose. The amendment committed the government to allowing companies to claim up to Pounds 10m each until the end of next year for exploration work affected by the abolition of tax relief. Under the Budget changes, the rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT) paid on existing fields would be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, while relief for exploration work would be abolished. Mr John Watts, Tory MP for Slough, said last night: 'If we had a three-year transition period as we have proposed, we could maintain a higher level of activity in the North Sea, the rundown of activity would be more orderly and there would be less loss of jobs.'</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: A resounding pitter-patter of political arm twisters - Bernard Gray looks at the lobbying process surrounding BAe and GEC's attempts to take over VSEL Lobby, lobby, lobby, the sound of political arm-twisters pitter-pattering around Whitehall has risen to a din in the last week. The bids for VSEL have turned a slow autumn for the political lobbyists into a bun fight. Both British Aerospace and GEC have teams of professional political lobbyists phoning every MP in the House of Commons phone book from A to Z; Sir Tim Bell is batting for GEC, while lobbying company PPU is doing the honours for BAe. Bigger strategic fish are being fried by heavyweight chefs within the companies themselves. Meetings in the normal course of business between the companies and civil servants are being turned to the subject of VSEL. Meetings outside the normal course of business are being called with senior civil servants and ministers to put the case for one side or the other. Both Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, and Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, have been much in evidence at the Ministry of Defence lately. Then there are the other board members who can lend a hand in time of trial. BAe has two political non-executive directors: Lord Hollick is a working Labour peer who runs the financial and media company MAI, while Lord Hesketh was previously a Conservative government chief whip in the Lords and is an ex-minister of the Department of Trade GEC's chairman, Lord Prior, served in Mrs Thatcher's cabinet, while Sir Geoffrey Pattie MP is a Conservative ex-defence and trade minister who is now co-chairman of GEC-Marconi, the company's defence arm. All can be expected to have quiet chats behind the scenes with friends and colleagues to make sure the right point of view gets home. The process they are trying to influence is that followed when a bid raises competition issues. The companies involved, and any customers or government departments affected, can make submissions to the Office of Fair Trading about what they think should happen. Since in this case submarines are only bought by the Ministry of Defence, the MoD's evidence to the OFT will be crucial. However, the Department of Trade may also make a submission about the industrial consequences of the bids. The Scottish Office may also get involved because the Yarrow yard on the Clyde falls within its patch, as does BAe's troubled Prestwick aircraft factory, which might just be under threat if the company's finances are not strengthened by a VSEL takeover. Each of the departments can make a separate submission, and may well do so. But given the highly-charged political atmosphere surrounding these bids, ad hoc groups of civil servants will be formed to try to iron out inter-departmental differences in advance. These officials will then put their recommendations to ministers, who may, or may not, accept them. Needless to say, ministers from different departments will also have discussed the issue in advance. Submissions are then sent to the OFT, which normally tries to decide within 21 days whether or not to refer a bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a full investigation. That should mean that the OFT rules on BAe's case by November 16. But because GEC's bid came later the examination may be extended to December 7. The OFT then makes its report to the president of the board of trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, who can accept or reject the findings. At this stage there will undoubtedly be a cabinet level discussion about the wisdom of any course of action. If Mr Heseltine clears both bids, the battle would then move to the stock market, where GEC's financial strength gives it an advantage. If he referred both bids to the MMC the issue would be in limbo for six months. If he referred GEC but not BAe, then BAe would probably win. The lobbyists will crawl all over each stage of the process trying to gain an advantage. However, the arguments are complicated because while they are ostensibly about competition in shipbuilding and who should own VSEL, they are in reality about who should run the British defence industry. So will it be GEC or BAe which wins the argument? That, unfortunately, is still an official secret.</p>

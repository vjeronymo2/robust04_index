Rojas was to have been transferred on 5 July as a result  of the FAC general's retirement.    It has been reported that the unexpected dismissal of the  National Guard commander in Zulia is a reprisal for his repeated  confiscations in the border area of Paraguachon of millions of  bolivares and U.S. dollars smuggled from Colombia, money that  could have been used in the alleged crime of legalization of  capital or money laundering.    The National Guard seized 47 billion bolivares last year  from  Arab businessmen who were taking money to Maracaibo to exchange  it for U.S. dollars and then transfer it abroad. The Eighth  Preliminary Criminal Court, through Judge Mirtha Alvarez de  Rios, issued an arrest warrant for the Arab businessmen on  charges of smuggling money to Venezuela.    Authorities recently confiscated $400,000 and 2 million  bolivares about to be smuggled into Venezuela, reportedly owned  by businessman Roy Harn, of Aruba, and a purported personal  friend of Commander Artuza Delgado.    In addition, $3,000 were confiscated at the border. This  money, and the remainder of the confiscated money, was deposited  in the Banco Central de Venezuela vaults in Maracaibo.    All of the confiscated money was deposited at Banco Central  in the presence of Drug Prosecutor Alfonso Marquez Saavedra and  Alix Boscan de Baptista, the 18th judge in charge of drugs.</p>

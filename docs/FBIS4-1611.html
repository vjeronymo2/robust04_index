			<p>BFN     [Text] Helsinki, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Finnish Prime  Minister Esko Aho said here today that Finland and China have  maintained very good and extensive friendly relations and that  finland is ready to further promote such ties with China in  various fields.    "Finland was among the first countries to establish  diplomatic relations with China (in 1950), and since then  bilateral relations have been stable and have stood the test of  difficult times," Aho said in a written statement released to  XINHUA.    Aho, who is to visit China on April 6-11 at the invitation  of  Chinese Premier Li Peng, said, "the forthcoming visit is  designed to further strengthen the Sino-Finnish friendly  relations."    He added that during the visit, he will hold talks with  Chinese leaders and learn about the progress of China's economic  reform, particularly its influence on China's foreign trade, and  about Chinese views on vistas of development and cooperation in  Asia.    The prime minister also said he will brief Chinese leaders  on  Finnish views on the situation in Europe.    On future development of Sino-Finnish ties, Aho noted that  the two countries have broad prospects in furthering their  relations and that trade between the two countries has been  extended to all speedily developed fields of Finland.    "Although a small country, Finland is advanced in certain  technologies and Finland is ready to share them with China," he  said.    "Finland's forestry and forest industry are well-known in  the  world and other fields in which China is interested include the  energy production and telecommunications," he noted.    "As a new field of bilateral cooperation, I want to stress  in  particular the significance of technology for environmental  protection. As China is paying increasing attention to  environmental protection, Finland can provide China with various  technologies in this field," Aho specified.    Aho, 40, has been Finnish prime minister since April 1991.</p>

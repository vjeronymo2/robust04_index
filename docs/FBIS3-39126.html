			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Marseille, France, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Fishermen  started a dawn blockade of four ports in southern France Monday  [14 February] as fishermen throughout France attacked lorries  suspected of carrying cheap imports of foreign fish.    Around 15 fishing boats blocked access to the ports of  Marseille, Fos sur Mer, Port Saint Louis du Rhone, and Port de  Bouc at 0700 (0600 GMT). More boats were set to join the  blockade during the day.    The fishermen, who have been on strike since Friday, have  called for a meeting with the right wing president of the  regional council, Jean-Claude Gaudin, to discuss their demands  for guaranteed fish prices and an end to foreign imports.    The blockade was mounted without violence, and without much  early effect on traffic, authorities said.    In a separate action early Monday, 100 Breton fishermen  intercepted two refrigerated trucks on the Paris-Lille motorway,  dumping several hundred kilograms of fish and goods they  believed to be cheap imports, sources said.    The fishermen, who had traveled in 30 cars from their  northwestern Finistere department, staged the two-hour protest  action at the toll post at Chamant.    They urged passing motorists to go through without paying  tolls. Police deployed nearby did not intervene and there were  no incidents.    The fishermen initially sought to head for the huge Rungis  wholesale market south of here -- where some 100 riot policemen  have been deployed -- but then drove north.    Around 30 fishermen occupied a toll post at Saint Arnoult en  Yvelines, south of Paris, for three hours after emptying the  fish cargo of two Spanish lorries, separate sources said. The  occupation, in which motorists were waved through the poll  without paying, ended at 0700 (0600 GMT).    The fishermen were reinforced by a 50-strong coach party of  fishermen who burned the salmon and cod cargo of two Spanish  lorries after intercepting them at a service station on the A10  motorway. All 80 fishermen headed for Brittany, sources added.    In Dreux west of Paris, police also intercepted a busload of  50 fishermen carrying clubs, pickaxes and flares.    Thursday, French fishermen massively voted to continue a  10-day strike, rejecting their union's call to return to work  and an aid package negotiated by their leaders with the  government on Tuesday.    The negotiations followed violence the previous week  culminating in a daylong pitched battle in the Brittany capital  of Rennes where a fishermen's delegation negotiated with Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur. Seventy-seven people were injured.    At France's request, the European Commission fixed minimum  prices until March 15 for seven species of fish.</p>

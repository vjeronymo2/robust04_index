			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 26 May (AFP) -- There is now a dispute  between the Congolese ministries of interior and defense over  the control of the gendarmerie, military sources announced today  in Brazzaville. Dissolved in 1970 following the implication of  several of its officers in a coup attempt against the late  President Marien Ngouabi, the gendarmerie was reestablished in  1992 with France's assistance and has about 2,000 men. It falls  under the Ministry of Defense. The disagreement between the two  ministries stems from Interior Minister Martin Mberi's wish to  have the unit under his control, the same sources added.    This disagreement could compromise the French Government's  support for the training of the gendarmerie units which will be  strengthened with the future recruitment of more than 200  24-year-olds, according to the same sources.    For his part, the French ambassador in Brazzaville, Raymond  Cesaire, who was received yesterday by Mr. Mberi, reaffirmed on  the official radio his country's willingness to contribute to  the lasting restoration of security in Congo, in particular,  through a support to the gendarmerie. "We want people to forget  the difficult period the country has just passed through in  order to achieve national reconciliation," Mr. Cesaire stated in  a reference to the 1993 clashes between opposition and  pro-government militiamen which left hundreds of people dead in  Brazzaville. The diplomat also stressed that France supported  recent bills on decentralization and general reorganization of  the police force.</p>

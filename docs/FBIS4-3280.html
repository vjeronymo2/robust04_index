			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Renfang (6392 0088 2455)] </F>   [Text] New York, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, Chinese  minister of foreign economic relations and trade cooperation,  said today [19 April] that Sino-U.S. trade can be described as  "proceeding with friction" because trade between the two  countries has been growing at an annual rate of 20 percent  despite the frictions and contradictions in Sino-U.S. trade.    Wu Yi made the statement at the "Symposium on Sino-U.S.  Trade  and Investment" sponsored by the Asia Association here. She  said: Bilateral Sino-U.S. trade has been developing very  quickly. The volume of trade between the two countries has  grown more than 10 times, reaching $27.65 billion in 1993 from  $2.4 billion in 1979. There are now 12,000 U.S. enterprises in  China. Of the $11 billion the United States agreed to invest in  China, $5.2 billion has actually been invested in China and used  by China. The United States has become the largest investor in  China.    Commenting on China's most-favored-nation status, Wu Yi  emphatically pointed out that the yearly discussion of this  issue has created an enormous sense of instability for Sino-U.S.  economic relations and trade. She said associating trade with  issues having nothing to do with trade is "extremely unwise"  [fei chang bu ming zhi 7236 1603 0008 2494 2535] and "lacks  strategic foresight."    Wu Yi urged the U.S. Government to act pragmatically, weigh  the advantages and disadvantages, do away with artificial  barriers, and properly resolve this problem so that Sino-U.S.  economic relations and trade can proceed steadily and in a  healthy manner.    Wu Yi attended the symposium in New York after attending a  meeting of the Eighth Sino-U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and  Trade in Washington. Over 300 representatives from U.S.  business circles attended today's symposium. Taking the floor  at the symposium, Ye Qing, vice minister in charge of the  Chinese State Planning Commission, and Jiao Sufen, director of  the Department of Investment under the Ministry of the Foreign  Economic Relations and Trade Cooperation, briefed those in  attendance about China's future development and investment.</p>

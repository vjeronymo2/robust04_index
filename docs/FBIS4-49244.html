			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, 2 May (XINHUA) -- While conducting thorough  investigations and research into military units in northern  Jiangsu from 22 April to 2 May, Zhang Zhen, Central Military  Commission [CMC] vice chairman, urged the broad masses of  commanders and soldiers to carry forward and promote our army's  fine traditions during the new historic era; to always nurture  the distinctive character of the people's army; to resolutely  take the road of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; to adhere to CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin's  "five-point" general requirements; and to further revolutionize,  modernize, and regularize the army to make new contributions to  safeguarding the national defense and socialist system.    While visiting the site of the New Fourth Army headquarters  and the New Fourth Army Memorial Hall in Yancheng on the  afternoon of 22 April, Zhang Zhen said with deep feeling: The  New Fourth Army fought here in the War of Resistance Against  Japan for eight years. The troops had very inferior weapons and  few bullets. What did they rely on to attain victory? They  relied on the party Central Committee's correct leadership and  Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant command, on the masses of  people's effective support, and on the army's fine revolutionary  traditions. At the end of his visit, Zhang Zhen respectfully  copied a Marshal Chen Yi poem: "How many old fighters of those  years are alive now? Millions upon millions of mighty new  soldiers are a consolation to those loyal souls." The copy was  presented to the New Fourth Army Memorial Hall. He also visited  the Bancheng Martyrs' Mausoleum, which was old site of the New  Fourth Army headquarters, and paid his respects to officers and  men of the New Fourth Army who were killed in action during the  War of Resistance Against Japan.    On his way to investigate and study various localities,  Zhang  Zhen referred to his own personal fighting experiences and  described the old Red Army's traditions. He said: Our army was  established personally by revolutionaries of the older  generation, including Mao Zedong; weathered tests, including the  25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan,  China's War of Liberation, and the War To Resist U.S. Aggression  and Aid Korea; and has many fine traditions. The fine  traditions include: the party's absolute leadership over the  army; the aim to wholeheartedly serve the people; effective  ideological and political work; the three main rules of  discipline and the eight points for attention [san da ji lu ba  xiang zhu yi 0005 1129 4764 1774 0360 7309 3137 1942];  political, economic, and military democracy at the company  level; and unity between the military and government and between  the military and the people. Revolutionary martyrs paid with  their blood as the price for these fine traditions that are our  army's valuable spiritual treasure. He encouraged the officers  and men to cherish historic honor and promote fine traditions.    Zhang Zhen emphatically pointed out: We should carry forward  and develop the traditions. First, we should understand what  our army's traditions are. Every division, regiment, and  company has its own glorious history. We should very properly  screen and summarize them respectively and carry them forward.  Proceeding with this understanding, we should also integrate  traditions with actual conditions in an effort to facilitate new  development in old traditions and add new contents to the  traditions under changed circumstances.    At a Red Army regiment and a military unit where the late  Wang Jie was attached when alive, Zhang Zhen held conversations  with grass-roots officers and men on ways to continually promote  fine traditions. He said: While conducting army building in  the new historic era, we have encountered many new circumstances  and issues. To resolve them, we should, on the one hand, arm the  minds of officers and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought  on army building in the new period. This is a basic  requirement. On the other hand, we should also carry forward  and promote our army's fine traditions. He urged cadres at  various levels to set an example in every aspect, to take the  lead in promoting the fine traditions, and to pass on the  cherished heritage of the people's army from generation to  generation.    Zhang Zhen urged the broad masses of commanders and soldiers  to particularly uphold the distinctive political character of  waging hard struggles under the new circumstances at present.  He pointed out: Although the economy has developed and living  standards have been improved, we cannot discard the tradition of  waging hard struggles. Building socialism with Chinese  characteristics requires that several generations of people  arduously perform pioneering work. Even after China has become  strong and the people have become rich, we will still need the  work style of continually waging hard struggles.    During his tour in north Jiangsu, Zhang Zhen also conducted  thorough investigations and research in units including military  schools and academies, logistics departments, and military  subdistricts. He also made a special trip to Huaian to pay  respects to and visit Comrade Zhou Enlai's old residence and  memorial hall.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry  today denied Moscow's ITAR-TASS report that the position of the  Ukrainian side at the negotiations in Sevastopol allegedly did  not correspond with the spirit of constructiveness  characteristic of the approach of the Russian side to the  negotiations, and also that representatives of the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry and Navy were allegedly trying to disavow the  Moscow agreement of 15 April.    The Defense ministry press service also stated that the  ITAR-TASS report does not conform to reality and that some of  the mass media distorted the undeniable fact that the Black Sea  Fleet belongs to two states, rather than to Russia alone.    As for the reference to the fact that the position of the  Ukrainian side with regard to a Ukrainian Navy base in  Sevastopol contravenes military theory, the Defense Ministry  press service is authorized to state that Ukraine has its own  military doctrine and follows its requirements aimed at ensuring  state independence.</p>

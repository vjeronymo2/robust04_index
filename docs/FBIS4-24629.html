			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Yushan (7627 6276 2619) from Beijing: </F> "Various Factions Take Action To Prevent Disturbances To  Solidify Themselves"]    [Text] It seems that China's hardliners are again gaining  ground. Many people believe that this has something to do with  Deng Xiaoping's recent state of health. There are many  indications that Deng's health is deteriorating and that he has  further detached himself from state affairs, though Chinese  official quarters and his relatives repeatedly dismiss such  reports as groundless. This is a recent development which  warrants attention.    All intra-party factions are trying to keep the situation  under control to capitalize on Deng's still being alive. In the  meantime they will take the opportunity to consolidate their  strength. Therefore they can reach a consensus on the question  of maintaining stability and even on pursuing a tough policy to  suppress civilian rebellious activities. The situation in the  period immediately before Mao Zedong's death in 1976 is a case  in point. At that time both "the gang of four," and Ye Jianying  and Hua Guofeng were loath to see disturbances created by  civilians for fear that such disturbances would affect their  plans and the Communist Party's position as the ruling party, so  they could unanimously agree to suppress the "5 April Tiananmen  unrest." The present situation is similar to that in 1976.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping's Health Is Really in Question </H5>   The discussion of Deng's state of health may remind many  people of the television pictures of Deng's public appearances  in Shanghai during the last Spring Festival period broadcast by  Chinese Central Television. According to a reliable source, the  Shanghai Television crew responsible for shooting Deng's  activities had intended to take as good pictures as they could  so that they could fulfilled the task assigned to them by  Chinese Central Television, but they found it difficult to  accomplish the task because they could not even record a  complete sentence by Deng. In the end Shanghai Television could  not but deliver all the pictures they took to Chinese Central  Television, which in turn submitted them to the Deng Xiaoping  Office for inspection. So the pictures shown by Chinese Central  Television were actually those selected by the Deng Xiaoping  Office. From this people can imagine what Deng's state of  health was like at that time.    The source continued: Deng's family members emphasize that  Deng is in good shape and that he is not in hospital. This is  correct, because even if Deng fell ill, doctors would stay at  his home to take care of him, as was the case with Mao Zedong.  The reports about Deng's health began spreading in early March.    The source added: However, that Deng is in poor health does  not mean he is as good as dead. Chinese leaders have excellent  methods of keeping fit and prolonging their lives. Chen Yun has  survived serious illnesses three times over the last five years.  Is he not still kicking now? Having had his blood changed (it  is reported that Deng also suffers from cancer of the blood),  Deng will also increase his life force.    Nevertheless, it is certain that the opportunities for Deng  to take personal care of state affairs will decrease  considerably. The Deng Xiaoping Office led by Deng Rong and  several persons trusted by the office have in fact taken over a  lot of Deng's workload.  <H5>  Jiang Zemin Steps Up His Efforts To Draw the Military Over </H5> to His Side    In Deng's few remaining years, his health will certainly  affect the several inner-party factions' struggle to consolidate  their positions. In fact people in Chinese political circles  are aware that the big shots in the CPC hierarchy have defined  their focal points of work to expand their influence over the  last six months. This tendency has become more evident recently.    Jiang Zemin placed his stress on the military. He was  clearly aware that he must obtain the support of the military  before he could have the situation well in hand and that he  badly needed such support at present. Therefore, he made  arrangements several years ago and obtained the gratitude of Liu  Huaqing and Zhang Zhen by, together with Liu, squeezing out Yang  Baibing and his followers. A military officer must perform  military exploits before he can have a secure position in the  military, but how can he perform military exploits in times of  peace? Under the circumstances, Jiang considered it military  exploits to obtain economic interests, or interests in the form  of promotion [wei jun fang qu de sheng qian li yi 3634 6511 2455  0648 1779 0581 6692 0448 4135], for the military. Hence, after  helping Liu displace Yang and his followers, he paid close  attention to personnel arrangements in the military. According  to a reliable source, Jiang examined any promotion of officers  at division level and above and interviewed those officers of  army level and above recommended for promotion.    During the second session of the eighth National People's  Congress [NPC] held last March, Jiang frequently attended the  group discussions of the People's Liberation Army delegation to  listen to their demands. He supported the argument that the  state must increase military expenditure by a big margin mainly  for the purpose of improving servicemen's living conditions (the  relevant proposals were adopted by the last NPC meeting). When  other delegations which had demanded that he attend their group  meetings made veiled criticism of his refusal to do so, Jiang  put on airs, saying "whoever has opinions can express them to me  directly."    It is safe to say that Jiang has recently reshuffled the  military leadership to a certain extent. Though he is still  unable to get absolute support from the military (partly because  those who were sacked remain unconvinced of his leadership and  partly because he has made fairly few contributions), he is  still supported by those military officers in power (including  Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and the retired Zhang Aiping), and  again his move did not cause serious concern to Deng. That is  how Jiang has pursued his line by enlisting support from the  military.  <H5>  Qiao Shi Expands the NPC's Authority </H5>   Qiao Shi has also worked actively in his own interests. He  has devoted his energy to the NPC and to procuratorial,  judicial, and public security organizations, which had been  under his leadership for many years. Since he was appointed NPC  chairman, he has proposed improving the NPC's operation at every  meeting. To this end, he recently tabled four specific measures:    1. Gradually grant legislative power to local people's  congresses. Local people's congresses should be allowed to  enact laws which have not been enacted by the central government  when they consider it necessary to do so on condition that they  do not go against the principles laid down by the central  government. The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has set  such a precedent.    2. Change the present legislative procedures. Many laws and  regulations are now first drafted by government departments and  then submitted to the NPC for examination and approval. This  practice concentrates the concrete contents and actions of the  administration of justice in the hands of the government system.  There is no supervision to speak of in this regard. The  government departments will legislate according to their own  needs. In Qiao's view, the people's congress should be  responsible for future legislation, and civilian experts can be  invited to draft certain laws, subject to the NPC's examination  and approval. The drafting of the "Securities Law" under the  leadership of Li Yining has provided such a precedent.    3. Change the practice of "enforcing regulations on a trial  basis before passing them into law" into the practice of "making  laws before enforcing them." The past practice is equivalent to  "groping our way across the river by feeling the stones on the  bottom." If regulations are not passed into law beforehand, the  regulations will be distorted or have their nature changed in  accordance with the government's actual needs. Therefore, Qiao  is trying to consolidate the NPC's authority.    4. Train law-enforcement personnel. In the past, there were  no laws to go by in China, but at present there are difficulties  in enforcing laws, or the law is not strictly enforced. This  has everything to do with the quality of law-enforcement  personnel. Therefore, Qiao stressed the need to intensify  training for law-enforcement personnel.  <H5>  Ding Guangen Stops the NPC From Publishing a Newspaper </H5>   Apart from the four measures, Qiao has also constantly tried  to reinforce the NPC's position. Earlier, a number of scholars  and staff members of the NPC proposed setting up an organization  to study the people's congress system. This was subject to the  approval of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department  because it involved ideology. But unexpectedly, the department  rejected the application. Consequently, Qiao was forced to  concern himself with the matter.    Again, the NPC so far has no newspaper of its own (the party  has RENMIN RIBAO as its mouthpiece; the central government  JINGJI RIBAO; and the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference RENMIN ZHENGXIE BAO). Earlier, some people suggested  making FAZHI RIBAO an affiliated organ of the NPC. But the  Justice Ministry, which owns the newspaper, declined the  suggestion, because the newspaper has been bringing in a  handsome profit to the ministry. Therefore, the NPC Standing  Committee pressed for publishing a newspaper, temporarily called  RENMIN ZHI SHENG BAO [PEOPLE'S VOICE], as its mouthpiece. This  had to be approved by the CPC Central Committee Propaganda  Department, but the application was turned down by Ding Guangen,  head of the propaganda department. Only after Qiao called Ding  directly was the application approved. It is still unknown when  the newspaper will come off the presses. Wang Xiaoyun, a NPC  staff member, is planning the work. All this indicates the  effort Qiao has made to intensify the NPC's position.    What were Qiao's intentions in doing all this? Consolidating  his own position or really reforming the NPC? His present  efforts will actually serve to strengthen the NPC's functions.  But how to prevent the NPC from degenerating into a tool of  power struggles remains a matter warranting attention.  <H5>  Zhu Rongji Dismisses Sun Weiben From His Post </H5>   Zhu Rongji has shown little ambition in his work (as he is  appraised by his subordinates as well as subordinates of other  senior officials). As he is mainly responsible for economic  matters and is decisive in handling matters--it was Zhu Rongji  who decided to remove Sun Weiben, secretary of the Heilongjiang  Provincial CPC Committee, from office and Jiang Zemin had no  objection to his decision--he will be able to strengthen his  position and I will say no more about him.    Li Peng has received little attention from the CPC  hierarchy.  He is now responsible only for foreign affairs (he is also  responsible for Hong Kong affairs, so a fairly hard-line policy  is being pursued. He is Zhou Nan's strongest boss). The view  shared by members of the CPC hierarchy is that if Li Peng does  not disappear from the political arena after Deng's death, he  will step down like Hua Guofeng with the change in the situation.    No matter what will happen to the present pattern of power  in  the future, the present reality is that all factions are trying  to reinforce their positions while Deng is still alive and that  they are reluctant to see any destabilizing factors affecting  their time and opportunity for reinforcing their strength. The  poorer Deng's health and the less he concerns himself with state  affairs, the more opportunities there will be for them.  Therefore, the CPC hierarchy has almost reached a consensus in  employing hardball tactics to maintain political stability.</p>

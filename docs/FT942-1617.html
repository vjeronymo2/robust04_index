			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel take-up may be 'adequate' The 3pm deadline for Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rights issue passed yesterday with the shares still weak, but underwriters expressing confidence in the likely level of take-up. Figures for the UK-listed portion of the issue, representing 25 per cent of Eurotunnel shares, will be released today. Analysts suggest that between 10 and 20 per cent of the UK shares may not be taken up. Shareholders were offered new units on a 3-for-5 basis at 265p, which compared with the price of 275p at 3pm. The shares rose at the end of trading and closed at 279p. Having maintained a 10p premium, underwriters expect the response to be 'adequate'. The more significant figure, acceptances from the 75 per cent of bearer shares traded (and primarily owned) in France, will not emerge until the end of next week, but the figures should be better. One underwriter expressed confidence in the heavy trading in the nil paid bearer shares, since buyers would be almost certain to take up rights shares. Under the French system, investors who take no action lose their rights. For Eurotunnel itself, the take-up makes little difference. It has raised its money and is adamant this is the last rights issue. Its only concern is that its warrants are converted. Next year the company is anticipating revenues of Pounds 198m from warrant conversions. Following the decline in its share price, the shares are at least 10 per cent below the likely adjusted conversion price for the 1993 warrants (the largest tranche), and conversion cannot be automatically assumed. This underlines the still precarious nature of Eurotunnel's finances, until it can demonstrate real traffic flows at least in line with projections.</p>

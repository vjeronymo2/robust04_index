Shevardnadze also initialled the Paris charter of the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) which  sanctioned the end of the Cold War.    Shevardnadze already signed the charter in 1990 when he was  foreign minister of the former Soviet Union.    Mitterrand, referring to Georgia's economic difficulties and  the Abkhazia secession, said Tbilisi "can count on the  solidarity of its friends."

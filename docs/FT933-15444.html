			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt sees a strong rise in post-bourse THE EXCITEMENT moved from Zurich to Frankfurt yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT moved from a negligible rise at midsession, with the FAZ index 2.16 higher at 663.65, through a gain of 18.89 to 1,719.76 in the DAX at the close to a DAX level of 1,739.67 in the late post-bourse, up by 2.3 per cent overall. Turnover soared from DM5.2bn to DM8.3bn. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that there had been forecasts a month ago of an extended consolidation, taking the DAX as low as 1,550, and wide expectations more recently of a 1,680 to 1,720 consolidation range. However, there had been indications that the economy has touched bottom, including this week's news of month-on-month gains (and reduced year-on-year declines) in the pattern of manufacturing orders in west Germany. 'Some stocks broke out of the range', said Ms Altmann. BMW rose DM11.70 to DM521 and Daimler DM13.10 to DM617.60, the latter accelerating to DM628 in the post bourse; and Volkswagen, which lagged behind on the session with a DM2 gain to DM355.50, went on to DM364 after hours. Mr Christopher Will of Lehman Brothers, a consistent bull of the sector, said that while sales to date in 1993 had been 'dreadful', and earnings this year are likely to be non-existent, some things were getting better; interest rates had come down and the D-Mark had weakened against the dollar. He calculated that carmakers would be able to price their exports to the US more competitively since the yen is rising against the dollar and the Japanese are raising their prices in that market; BMW is likely to raise its US sales ratio this year from 11 per cent to about 15 per cent of the total, getting better profits out of a recovering market and the stronger dollar. PARIS was lifted by technical trading late in the session, the CAC-40 index ending 8.61 higher at 1,943.73 after a day's low of 1,920. Turnover languished at FFr2.2bn. Peugeot featured with a gain of FFr14 to FFr594, partly on hopes for recovery in 1994-1995. SocGen showed a rise of FFr15 to FFr593 ahead of the launch of its ADR's in New York today. Kuwait's interest in signing a deal with a French defence group came too late to lift Matra Hachette or Thomson-CSF, which showed respective losses of FFr2.20 and FFr4.40 to FFr132.00 and FFr168.10. MILAN featured a strong performance from Fiat as rumours re-emerged of a possible strategic alliance with another car manufacturer and/or imminent asset sales. Fiat gained L294 or 4.8 per cent to fix at L6,400, and then rose by another L60 on the kerb. Analysts remarked that there was nothing new in the rumours and that the gains may reflect recent weakness. The shares remain some 9.5 per cent down on the year's high of L7,070 reached in April. The Comit index ended 0.30 lower at 533.27. Among insurers, Ras put on L416 to L27,108 and Toro L500 to L28,980. Benetton, which eased back slightly at the fix, came back with a L20 gain on the kerb to L18,539. The group repeated at a presentation on Tuesday its forecasts of a 8-9 per cent earnings growth this year, with sales rising to L4,000bn by 1996 from L2,500bn in 1992. AMSTERDAM saw a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 0.6 to 113.8. KLM firmed Fl 1.10 to Fl 28.80 on an improvement in June load data while Fokker went the other way, losing Fl 1.00 to Fl 16.00 on news of a Fl 334m convertible bond issue. ZURICH subsided on profit-taking, and selling of Nestle following Tuesday's Goldman Sachs downgrade in New York. UBS fell SFr17 to SFr1,170 after Tuesday's speculative gain of SFr53, and Nestle registered shed another SFr29 to SFr1,089 as the SMI index fell by 17.5 to 2,373.0. STOCKHOLM rallied after a weak opening helped by strength in Volvo and Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden index closed 8.30 higher at 1,097.90 in turnover of SKr777m. Volvo B shares advanced SKr9 to SKr422 on reports from France that the government there hoped a merger between the Swedish car maker and Renault would be ready by August. Ericsson put on SKr5 to SKr340 after a broker's upgrade. MADRID remained muted, the general index losing 0.17 to 257.66 in thin turnover. Banesto, which launched its Dollars 1.2bn equity offering, slid by Pta60 to Pta1,970. TEL AVIV fell for the third consecutive day, this time on mutual fund selling. The Mishtanim index closed 3.52 lower at 190.78. DUBLIN saw a 3.2 per cent drop in financials, and a 34.87, or 2.1 per cent fall to 1,594.46 in the ISEQ overall index, following rights issue news from the Bank of Ireland, which fell 11p to 250p; Allied Irish Banks fell by 10p to 262p, although analysts said that a cash call from AIB was unlikely.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 7                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1201.20    1198.86    1199.50     1201.90 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1252.66    1250.98    1252.31     1252.89  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1205.07    1209.39    1209.99     1211.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1254.82    1257.14    1259.25     1260.04  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jul 6     Jul 5     Jul 2     Jul 1    Jun 30  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1203.04   1197.01   1201.31   1213.21   1208.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1257.80   1253.51   1259.19   1270.98   1266.14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1211.66; 200 - 1260.52 Low/day: 100 - 1198.65 200 - 1250.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

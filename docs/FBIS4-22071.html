			<p>BFN     [Text] A one month-long cease-fire agreement between the  Fatah Hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' [Islamic  Resistance Movement] military arm, has been reached in the Gaza  Strip. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that a leaflet to  this effect was disseminated in the Gaza Strip today. It states  that the two sides will halt acts of revenge against  collaborators in order to enable them to dissociate themselves  from their support of Israel. The two groups will also put an  end to mutual acts of hostility and what they term unnecessary  strikes. It was also decided to set up a committee to  adjudicate conflicts between the sides during this cease-fire  period.    Our correspondent notes that Fatah leaders in the Strip have  not reacted to the agreement, but a Palestinian source says it  was reached with the knowledge of senior leaders in both  organizations.</p>

This is the philosophy with which President Glavkos  Kliridhis  approaches the discussion of the confidence-building measures,  which he has explained to various political officials.    The president estimates that international circles are  determined to press for the implementation of the  confidence-building measures, considering them the beginning of  the solution of the Cyprus issue.    In the meantime, political circles make the following  assessment: If there is no agreement on the "most important"  issues and aspects of the problem this time, the Cyprus issue  will remain unsettled in the long run and there will be gradual  legalization of the current situation through the recognition of  the pseudostate.    The same political circles stressed that in a period when  the  international community has recognized almost 20 new states and  ministates, it will not be particularly sensitive about  recognizing one more.</p>

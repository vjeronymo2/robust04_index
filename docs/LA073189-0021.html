			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWBORN DRUG EXPOSURE CONVICTION A 'DRASTIC' FIRST  </P> <P> As newborn Jessica Nicole Johnson gulped her first breath, she also took a hit  of cocaine.  </P> <P> So ruled a Florida judge who earlier this month found that Jessica's mother, a  23-year-old cocaine addict, passed the drug to her infant through the most  intimate of channels -- the umbilical cord.  </P> <P> The first U.S. criminal conviction of a mother who has given birth to a  drug-exposed baby threads a legal needle, focusing on the 60 seconds  immediately after birth when infants are physically separate from their mother  but still attached by the umbilical lifeline.  </P> <P> Judge O. H. Eaton's ruling that Jennifer Johnson was guilty of delivering  cocaine to Jessica has been hailed in some quarters as a new and legitimate  tool to protect the unborn and attacked in others as an unconstitutional  affront that makes pregnancy a crime for drug addicts.  </P> <P> Both sides agree, however, that with an estimated 375,000 infants tainted by  potentially fatal narcotics in the womb each year, the trend toward such  prosecutions will increase.  </P> <P> "Arresting a mother for delivering cocaine to her unborn child may be  considered drastic and extreme," Florida Gov. Bob Martinez said in a July 20  speech, "but it is only a matter of time before every state in the nation feels  the need to take drastic steps such as those we've taken."  </P> <P> The landmark conviction came less than two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court  upheld a Missouri law that restricts abortions and amid Martinez's Florida  campaign to make the procedure illegal.  </P> <P> "The hysteria associated with the abortion question permeated this case," said  Johnson's attorney James Sweeting, who argued that it is medically impossible  to determine whether the drugs were passed to the infants after birth or  before, when as fetuses they had no legal rights. "The politicians and  prosecutors here are trying to out-conservative each other."  </P> <P> Lynn Paltrow, staff counsel of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, called  the decision an "absurd" attempt to turn the fetus into a person under the law.  The ACLU plans to assist Sweeting in an appeal.  </P> <P> "Not only will the conviction drive the women who need prenatal care the most  away from treatment, but it is wrong because it takes a set of laws intended to  be used in one set of circumstances, the prosecution of drug dealers, and  applies them to another set," Paltrow said.  </P> <P> But the trial judge, who invited an appellate court review of his ruling,  contends the ACLU has missed the point.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge Offers View  </P> <P> "The prosecution here has been an effort to establish that pregnant women have  a responsibility to their unborn children," Eaton said in an interview. "I  think that's true. I cannot imagine why the ACLU feels sympathetic for mothers  who transfer cocaine to their babies."  </P> <P> Ironically, Johnson was arrested, in part, because she sought treatment before  Jessica's healthy birth on Jan. 23.  </P> <P> Johnson, who is now in a residential drug rehabilitation center that she  entered in May as a condition of her release from jail before trial, was denied  admission to an out-patient drug program last fall. Officials feared potential  liability if her fetus did not survive the stress of withdrawal, according to  testimony.  </P> <P> In addition, Johnson summoned paramedics twice last December and told emergency  room doctors that she was a crack cocaine addict who feared for her fetus. Each  time, according to testimony, she was sent home.  </P> <P> "What Jennifer did wrong was try to get help," Sweeting said. "She created a  paper trail that the prosecution used against her. She made a lot of statements  about her addiction that came back to haunt us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspected Child Abuse  </P> <P> Johnson's case, reported to police by social service officials when Jessica  tested positive for drugs after birth, arrived on the desk of Seminole County  Assistant State's Atty. Jeff Deen as a suspected child abuse report last March.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, Deen said he had been researching state laws since November for  an avenue to prosecute a growing number of drug-addicted mothers. He decided  that he could fashion charges from a law barring "delivery" of controlled  substances to a minor by arguing that narcotics could be "delivered" from  mother to child through the umbilical cord.  </P> <P> Deen said he acted in alarm over a growing number of cocaine-exposed babies in  the largely rural county just north of metropolitan Orlando.  </P> <P> State officials estimate that 10,000 drug-exposed babies will be born  throughout Florida this year, quadruple last year's 2,512 reports. In the  social service region that includes Orlando and Seminole County, 57 drug babies  were reported in the first three months of 1989, compared to 97 in all of 1988.  </P> <P> "We were seeing more and more of these cases. The question was, were we going  to do something or not? We were looking for a good test."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case Leaps Forward  </P> <P> Johnson's case leaped forward from among a handful under investigation.  </P> <P> "She had two cocaine babies already," the prosecutor said. "We had to say to  ourselves, 'Are we going to let Jennifer go on?' It was pretty clear she was  either going to die or have another cocaine baby."  </P> <P> By charging Johnson and winning a conviction, Deen said: "We cracked a barrier.  Right now this is novel, but we want this to be a routine tool. Do I envision  (a case) where a woman would go to jail? Yes."  </P> <P> Johnson, who has not yet been sentenced on the felony conviction, faces up to  30 years in prison.  </P> <P> Johnson herself agrees that pregnant addicts should be held responsible for the  well-being of their unborn children. But she believes that expanded and  possibly mandatory drug treatment, not prosecution, is the best answer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Started With Me'  </P> <P> "I don't think women should be found guilty, but they should be accountable,"  she said in an interview. "If people are not held accountable for what they do,  how do they ever get a grip on the problem? I guess they started with me."  </P> <P> Johnson, who grew up in a well-kept cinder block house on the fringe of an  all-black and desperately poor hollow, was schooled in the Scriptures by a  devoutly religious mother. In the rutted dirt streets surrounding her  neighborhood, however, crack was the major industry and recreation, and Johnson  succumbed soon after graduation from high school. She married a drug dealer at  20 and, by the time she was arrested, had four children and a $500-a-day habit.  </P> <P> "During the first two years, I chose to do drugs," Johnson said. "I liked  getting high. But the last two years, I couldn't help myself. I tried to stay  clean every day, but there was always drugs around."  </P> <P> She said she did no drugs during her first pregnancy but will not discuss the  second. She admits her addiction during the last two. None of the children, now  in the care of Johnson's mother and aunt, show signs of drug impairment,  according to testimony.  </P> <P> "I knew that it was wrong, but I wasn't fully aware of the damage that I could  have done," said Johnson, who hopes that she will be given a lengthy probation  rather than a jail term. "I knew I couldn't take care of my children. I'm an  addict, but now I'm doing something about it. I don't want to be the person I  was four months ago."  </P></p>

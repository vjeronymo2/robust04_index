			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UAW CHIEF DECRIES HIGH PAY FOR EXECUTIVES, URGES CHANGE  </P> <P> United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber, denouncing another year of  exorbitantly high pay for top auto executives, called today for fundamental  changes between management and labor to put UAW workers on a more secure  footing.  </P> <P> In opening a three-day conference in Detroit for the union's skilled trades  workers, Bieber said the nation's auto makers -- not the auto workers -- are  responsible for improving product quality and bolstering the competitive  position of U.S. manufacturers.  </P> <P> "America's industrial challenge is not a little bit management's fault and a  little bit the union's fault," Bieber told the about 1,200 union delegates at  the Westin Hotel. "It's management's failures, plain and simple, that have put  us in the precarious situation we face in so many sectors today.  </P> <P> "The big buck syndrome in Detroit is a disease that's still in need of a cure,"  union leader said. "The auto industry has real and pressing problems, but the  companies signal only arrogance and business-as-usual attitudes through these  excessive payments to senior executives."  </P></p>

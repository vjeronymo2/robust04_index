			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- In connection with the large Kurdish  demonstration in Frankfurt on 25 June, Turkey warned the German  authorities against "watering down" the ban on the illegal  separatist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK).    A spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in Ankara  on 27 June that "Turkey is disappointed at the fact that the  demonstration was changed into an action of a terrorist  organization." Turkey did not understand that following the ban  on the PKK in Germany, the flags of the PKK and photos of its  leader, Abdullah Ocalan, could have been shown unhindered in a  demonstration against Turkey, he said.    "We do not want a terrorist organization to be encouraged to  carry out new acts of violence, because the ban imposed upon  them has been watered down. That is why we will lodge  complaints with German authorities in Ankara, Bonn, and  Frankfurt in the next few days," the spokesman said. The PKK  has for 10 years waged a guerrilla war against Turkey for an  independent Kurdistan, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives.  It is also held responsible for the increasing bomb terror in  Turkish holiday resorts.</p>

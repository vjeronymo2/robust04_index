			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Unexpected lifeline for Maxwell victims: John Willman sees some hope for pensioners if they can pierce government secrecy NEWS that intelligence information suggested the dishonesty of Robert Maxwell before his empire collapsed offers the Maxwell pensioners another lifeline in their campaign for government compensation. Their chances of persuading the government to accept full responsibility for bailing out the Maxwell pension funds will be enhanced if it can be shown that government departments failed to act on information which revealed Maxwell's questionable activities. The pensioners' problem will be to establish that such information was in the government's hands. The response of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group to yesterday's FT revelations was to call for a judicial inquiry to examine the affair and identify the failings of the system. The pensioners' best chance of compensation probably lies with Mr William Reid, the parliamentary commissioner known as the ombudsman. The 1989 report of his predecessor, Sir Anthony Barrowclough, unlocked government funds for 18,000 investors who lost money when the Barlow Clowes group collapsed. Sir Anthony found the Department of Trade and Industry guilty of 'significant maladministration'. He criticised 'the lack of a sufficiently rigorous and inquiring approach', including the inadequacy of the regulatory machinery before April 1988 when the Financial Services Act was introduced. Announcing the payment in the Commons, Lord Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, justified compensation by the 'number of unusual features which taken together distinguish this case from other business failures'. Lord Ridley, then Mr Nicholas Ridley, added: 'It is also true that a large number of investors, many of them elderly, have suffered hardship'. There are clear similarities with the present case in the age of many Maxwell pensioners and the hardship they will suffer without compensation. But the pensioners will need to work hard to establish a case the ombudsman can consider, because the looting of the Maxwell pension funds took place after the introduction of the 1988 Financial Services Act. That act switched responsibility for policing the pension funds from the DTI to the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) and the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), both of which are excluded from the jurisdiction of the ombudsman. As the current ombudsman pointed out 10 days ago, he cannot launch an investigation without evidence of an administrative fault by a government department. One such fault might be that the powers delegated by the DTI to SIB and Imro did not adequately protect the interests of pension fund managers. To establish a case for the ombudsman to investigate, pensioners would need to show that representations had been made when the powers were delegated and that they were ignored or brushed aside. An ombudsman's investigation might also be triggered if it could be shown that the government had had information about Mr Maxwell's questionable activities - from the intelligence services, for example - and failed to pass it on to the regulatory authorities. It would be hard to prove either of these faults without access to documents in government files. Yet under the UK's secretive system of government, they are not open to public inspection. Hence the Maxwell pensioners' call for a judicial inquiry into the affair. In spite of the prime minister's commitment to more open government, the only way to cast more light on the proceedings of government in cases such as this is to appoint a judge or a privy councillor to examine all relevant papers.</p>

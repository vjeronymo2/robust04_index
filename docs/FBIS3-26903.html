Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui's  current trip to Southeast Asia has won recognition from the  opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).    Li, who started the unofficial visit on Feb. 9, is scheduled  to return to Taipei late Wednesday. He has met with Philippine  President Fidel Ramos, Indonesian President Suharto, and  Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Likphai during the three-country  tour.    H.I. Lu, chief of the DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan,  said Wednesday that the president's tour certainly has had a  positive impact on both Taiwan's international relations and  economic policy toward Southeast Asian nations.    The government has been promoting its "southern strategy" to  encourage Taiwan manufacturers to increase investments in  Vietnam and member countries of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations, which groups Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,  Indonesia, the Philippines, and Brunei.    "The DPP is positive toward Li's efforts in strengthening  Taiwan's external relations and in helping Taiwan investors find  more investment channels," Lu noted.    The DPP lawmaker, however, pointed out that the president  alone should not dominate Taiwan's foreign affairs. Foreign  relations should be the common responsibility of both ruling and  opposition parties, he said.</p>

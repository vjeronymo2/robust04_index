			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Carabineros Director] General Rodolfo Stange has  stated that his honor has been cleared. Government sources only  said that Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer's ruling has removed an  obstacle in the impasse between the Carabineros director and the  executive branch. Politicians and relatives of the three  beheaded professionals have reacted against the judge's ruling.    Gen. Stange arrived at 0830 this morning at the Carabineros  building. He said he was happy with Judge Pfeiffer's ruling,  which definitely acquits him of charges of serious disregard of  military duties.    [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] General, many  people insist that this is more an ethical than a legal problem.  What do you think?    [Stange] I believe testifying before a court is ethical, and  that is what I did. I cannot comment on the court ruling. I only  want the administration of justice in a situation in which I had  been involved in a case and pre-judged. I only want my name and  honor to be cleared.    [Reporter] Will you assume your duties in a normal manner?    [Stange] The normal duties I have always had because I have  never left my command. [end recording]    Concerning Judge Pfeiffer's ruling, there has been no  reaction from La Moneda Palace. The Defense Ministry released a  brief communique which states that following the acquittal of  the Carabineros director, an important obstacle has been removed  in finding a solution to the impasse created between Gen. Stange  and the government. No other statements have been made, although  it was learned that, notwithstanding the ruling, the government  maintains its position that Gen. Stange should leave the  Carabineros. [passage omitted]</p>

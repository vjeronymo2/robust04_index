			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FAMILY STANDING UP TO GANGS  </P> <P> Testifying against accused murderers would be difficult for anyone, but it is  an act of courage for a Santa Ana family who witnessed a gang shooting last  September. The shooting, one of the worst such incidents to ever occur in  Orange County, left two people dead, including a 4-year-old boy, and several  persons wounded. But it was only the beginning of terror for the family of  Isabel and Ralph Rodriguez, who, with their four children, watched in horror as  the shooting occurred near their home.  </P> <P> The child who died was a cousin of Isabel Rodriguez; the other victim was a  17-year-old who police believe was a gang member. The shooting is believed to  have resulted from gang rivalries, and three young men later arrested as  suspects in the killings are members of another gang.  </P> <P> Members of the Rodriguez family are determined to give their eyewitness account  at a preliminary hearing in February despite a reign of terror by neighborhood  thugs. The harassment has escalated from name-calling and beer bottles thrown  at their house to death threats, a fire bomb bouncing off a bedroom window and  an attempt to run down a Rodriguez child. Finally, last week, police arrested  two gang members for witness intimidation and other charges.  </P> <P> Despite the arrests, police have stepped up patrols in the Rodriguez  neighborhood. The family has taken to bedding down the children on the floor,  afraid of stray bullets. It is, as Isabel Rodriguez said, "pure hell."  </P> <P> A deputy district attorney said that the arrests and warrants are an indication  that witness intimidation will not be tolerated. To do so, he added would make  "a joke of the whole criminal justice system." We agree. Police must do  everything possible to protect the Rodriguez family now, and after they  testify. The children also must be assured of safety at school.  </P> <P> Not all witnesses would be as resolute as the Rodriguezes. We commend their  courage in standing up against frightening intimidation and for paying a  personal price to see that justice is done.  </P></p>

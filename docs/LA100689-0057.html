			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Republican Tricia Hunter, newly elected to the Assembly in a special 76th  District election, says she is already gearing up for the next campaign in the  spring. Hunter, who drew nearly 49% of the vote, ran as a pro-choice candidate.  She drew a strong Republican write-in opponent in Dick Lyles, who ran second in  the race. "It would be nice to enjoy this (victory) longer before starting to  think about the next race, but that's the reality of running for office. I knew  that when I got into this," Hunter said. The district encompasses parts of San  Diego and Riverside counties.  </P></p>

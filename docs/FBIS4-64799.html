			<p>BFN     [Text] Conditions in the military area of Alakurtti in  Russia are as Russia has stated, according to a delegation of  observers that has returned from there. The first Finnish  military delegation returned this afternoon from the observation  trip, which is part of the CSCE agreement. Finland has  previously made a few smaller assessment visits to individual  units in the areas near Finland. Our correspondent Ritva Saila  met the delegation when it returned.    [Begin Saila recording] The equipment in the  Kantalahti-Alakurtti area is of such a caliber that Finland  could be quickly cut in two in case of a crisis. It has been  said that the bridges and dams on the Kemijoki river could be  destroyed in a moment. Near the area of Salla, only a few dozen  kilometers from the border, there has for years been a motorized  infantry division of 6,000-7,000 men. However, in the last few  years equipment in that area has increased. According to  international information, a couple of helicopter regiments have  been moved there from Central Europe, mainly Germany. It is said  that they have 200 helicopters, including the fastest helicopter  gunships in the world, the Mi-24.    The Finnish military delegation that returned today from the  Kantalahti-Alakurtti area and its leader, Colonel Tauno Ylanne  from the headquarters of the northern defense area, are not  prepared to confirm this Western information.    [Ylanne] It is likely that this information is untrue  because, according to our observations -- or should I say we did  not observe this, but we only checked the information that the  Russians have given in the CSCE process -- we compared that  information. Quite simply I could say that in my view the main  thing is that we did not observe such -- in the area where we  moved -- such military activity that would somehow be contrary  to the CSCE agreement, different from what the Russians have  announced.    [Saila] Col. Ylanne stressed that the equipment in Alakurtti  corresponds to the information given by Russia.    [Ylanne] According to our observations, what they have  announced is more or less true.    [Saila] Are they defense or attack weapons?    [Ylanne] They are military weapons, and of course you can  use  them for both purposes.    [Saila] Could you in some way consider these as a threat to  Finnish security?    [Ylanne] No. In my view the arms as such cannot be viewed as  a threat to Finnish security, especially as we have such  friendly relations at the moment.    [Saila] It has been said that more troops are going to be  moved to that area; is that true?    [Ylanne] Well, the aim of our trip was not to find out about  that, but our aim was to observe military activities there at  the moment and during the time we were there. [end recording]</p>

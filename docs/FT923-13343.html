			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US groups say anti-EC action could hit jobs US IMPORTERS and distributors yesterday told an interagency Bush Administration committee that Dollars 1bn (Pounds 521m) in sanctions proposed against EC products would cause widespread US job losses and injury to the US economy. The prohibitive duties were proposed by Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, in retaliation for the failure of the EC to reform 'adequately' its subsidies programme for oilseeds. Her office last month released a proposed 'hit list' of imports worth an estimated Dollars 2bn - which includes wine, cheese, biscuits, gin, liqueurs, and tobacco. If the dispute is not settled in compensation talks - to be held in the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade through to August 18 - the Administration has threatened to impose sanctions on Dollars 1bn-worth of products on the list. However, officials of companies which have long-established ties with Europe yesterday made clear that any retaliation against the EC would boomerang. The impact would be particularly devastating on the wine, beer and spirits sectors, which are struggling to recover from two big rises in federal excises taxes in the past seven years as well as new state and local taxes. Typical of the testimony before the 'Section 301 committee' were the comments by Mr Fred Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. New tariffs on wines and spirits would lead to a Dollars 1.2bn payroll decline and total loss of 86,000 jobs in the industry, Mr Meister said. Unemployment compensation would cost Dollars 84m; the gross domestic product would fall by Dollars 4.9bn; and tax revenues would decline. If the EC follows up on its threat to counter-retaliate, the US could lose 25 per cent of its total whisky exports. Mr Gary Riedel, president of the American Soyabean Association, said he regretted any injury to other industries. 'If we don't come to terms, than those other industries would have no legitimate degree of certainty that their rights might not be infringed upon in the future,' he said. The controversy leaves the Bush Administration in a tough spot. Failure to act if the dispute is not resolved would receive widespread condemnation by the farm groups. Mr Bush has already been warned by Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader, and a group of other senators that any settlement must benefit the US soyabean sector. They also insisted that the administration must not accept any EC proposal which would put tariffs on EC oilseed imports.</p>

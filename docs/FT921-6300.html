			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Hard-Nose hedging This weekend will be a good one in which to refine your funk portfolio. For the election campaign may be starting to turn Labour's way. If it is, and if you have money to spare, you will want to place it in personal equity plans, index-linked gilts, the name of your spouse, beneath the mattress, in an offshore account under your aunt's signature - any good hiding-place you can find. I say 'be ready', not 'take action'. There is no need for investors or the well-paid to panic. Not yet. A few weeks ago, I characterised the then current opinion poll results as deuce, advantage Tories. Now the polls - plus something in the political air - suggest that the score is deuce, advantage Labour. This is a slight but not insignificant change. It needs some explaining. First the polls. The moving average of the last seven of them, all taken in February, comes out at 39 per cent Conservative, 39 per cent per cent Labour and 17 per cent Liberal Democrat. Ignore differentiated regional swings, special cases in the marginals and similar psephological technicalities. They usually cancel one another out. On a straightforward uniform swing, 39-39-17 produces a hung parliament, with the Conservatives commanding 14 more seats than Labour. The picture restructures itself if you focus on the four most recent polls, all taken in the second half of February. The score in terms of public support is still about evens, but there is a fractional difference in favour of Mr Neil Kinnock's party. The model on our FT computer reduces the Tory lead in a hung parliament to just six seats. The difference is important. With a 14-seat plurality, Ulster unionist support and a fair wind, the government just might cling to power. If it ended up a mere six seats ahead of Labour, the government would probably lose in the manoeuvrings that would follow the election. These computer games would be meaningless if it were not for the timing of the latest wobble in the monthly graph. The four latest polls were all taken after St Valentine's day - that is after the 'black Thursday' of February 13. On that fateful afternoon, it was announced that unemployment had risen in January by twice as much as expected, mortgage lenders had repossessed 75,000 homes in 1991 and manufacturers had cut their capital spending. The next morning, we were told that factory output was down by 5 per cent for the year 1991. Since then the hammer blows to public confidence in the government's management of the economy have coming thundering down with rhythmic persistence. Clearing banks have reported record losses, and announced large-scale redundancies. A huge increase in the public sector borrowing requirement has been excused in advance Only the Budget can save the Conservatives now - or can it? by the prime minister. On Tuesday, Mr Kinnock floored Mr Major with a parliamentary question: 'The prime minister is now borrowing billions to try to finance a pre-election tax cut. So will he tell us exactly which other taxes he will raise to pay for the bribe?' Yesterday's trade figures were dreadful, particularly on the export side. In yesterday's question-time exchanges, Mr Kinnock once again linked tax cuts with unbalanced budgets. He may eventually get this message through to a wider audience. We should, therefore, expect signs of hesitancy about the April 9 election date. Yesterday's Daily Express, one of the tabloids that might as well be an organ of Conservative Central Office, argued that Mr Major 'must not be bounced into an April poll just because the media and the opposition want it'. In theory, the Daily Express is right; in practice, this is not the Central Office line. The prime minister would lose more by seeming to be afraid of April 9 than he would by delaying and hoping for something to turn up. More to the point, he believes that the recovery awaits a Conservative victory. Thus boxed in, Mr Major now faces a test of nerve, particularly if Labour's apparently renewed advantage is pressed home next week. If it is, the game may slip away from him and we could be just 42 days from sitting stunned and bleary-eyed before our television screens as a beaming Mr Neil Kinnock struts before the cameras on the threshold of Number 10 Downing Street. The most senior of the Conservatives understand this very well. They affect to be confident of victory, but in private they are worried. Only the budget can save them now - or can it? Mr Major's present intention is to base his call for re-election on borrowing untold billions on the taxpayers' account in order to finance a lower rate of income tax. If he does - that is, if the package presented by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on March 10 knocks a penny or two off the standard rate, raises tax thresholds and awards a free beer mug or a nifty credit card wallet to everyone who votes Conservative - we will then see a living sociological experiment. The power of the crude handout will be tested before our very eyes. There are two schools of thought on this matter. One, the Lofty school, believes that this would be a tacky way to fight an election, and, worse, that it would be seen to be so. Mr Kinnock could expose it by rescinding part or all of Labour's proposals to increase taxes, arguing that if Mr Lamont can borrow to finance tax cuts, his chancellor, Mr John Smith, could borrow to finance expenditure, without actually raising taxes. The other lot, the Hard-Noses, believe that floating voters in the marginals will not be susceptible to such nuances. They will take the Tory money and vote to keep it. Your weekend portfolio planning should be adjusted according to which of these theories seems the more likely to be right. It is a question of how sophisticated and how selfless you think the electorate is. If you force me to choose, my money remains on the Hard-Noses, but with waning confidence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Asked to comment on an army newsletter article,  which says that a coup is not an evil thing and that it is one  of the methods in developing the country, Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai said we should not talk about coups. We should talk  more about democracy.    [Begin recording] [Chuan] It is better for us to discuss  democracy, not coups. We can solve problems through the  democratic system since we love this system.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is it time for us to solve  problems by rules and regulations, not threats and intimidation?    [Chuan] I have stressed all the time that we should deal  with problems in line with rules and regulations under the  democratic system. I hate threats because people have dignity.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that  it is just an academic paper about a coup, how it is staged, and  whether or not it will benefit the country. This has nothing to  do with countering government policy.    [Begin recording] [Wichit] It is an expression of opinion by  the writer. This is just a theory. It has no harm.    [Unidentified correspondent] Will it cause confusion since  the article is publicized in the army newsletter?    [Wichit] It depends on interpretation. I have not read the  article. Thank you for informing me about this. I believe that  it is rather an academic article.    [Unidentified correspondent] Have there been any moves in  the Armed Forces?    [Wichit] The military leaders have repeated on several  occasions that the Armed Forces are an apparatus of the  government.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that such an  article was meant as a hint at a time when there is political  confusion?    [Wichit] It is rather an academic article. [end recording]</p>

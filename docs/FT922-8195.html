			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Investors puzzle over German borrowing - Public sector funding could place a strain on the bond market GERMANY'S public sector finances are again stirring the interest of investors and analysts anxious to know how much the government will borrow from the bond market this year. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said last week that federal government borrowing is likely to fall to DM40bn in 1993 from DM45bn (Dollars 27.2bn) this year, largely because tax revenues have been higher than anticipated. He has also proposed an austerity programme aimed at reducing government borrowing. Borrowing by 'off balance sheet' government agencies set up to promote the economic reform of eastern Germany - such as the Treuhand and European Recovery Programme (ERP) - stays high. Analysts' estimates of the total German public sector deficit this year, including all government-backed funds and agencies, range from DM190bn to DM210bn, up from around DM170bn in 1991. How much will be financed in the bond market remains an open question. For example, the Treuhand, set up to manage state-owned east German industry ahead of privatisation, has so far funded only in short-term markets. But it may start long-term bond issuance in the second half of this year, competing directly for funds with the federal government. Equally, the ERP, set up to help with economic development in eastern Germany, is borrowing for the first time this year, aiming to raise DM25bn. Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers, noted that bonds account for 56 per cent of all outstanding German public sector debt, broadly defined. Using this rule of thumb, the market could be asked to absorb DM110bn new bunds, Unity bonds and quasi-government debt instruments this year. Others are less pessimistic. Mr Stefan Schneider, analyst at Nomura Research Institute, estimated total public sector bond market borrowing of around DM80bn. But to this must be added refinancing of outstanding debt, running at DM90bn according to government figures. Hence total bond issuance is likely to reach at least DM160bn, possibly as high as DM240bn, once borrowing by the post office and the state-owned rail system is included. Whatever the eventual out-come, borrowing on this scale could place a strain on the bond market. There are already signs of resistance, especially when market conditions are weak. Last week, for example, the ERP launched a debut DM5bn 10-year bond issue, but only around half the paper could be sold into a weak market. Analysts are split over whether government borrowing will depress bund prices for the rest of the year. Among the more optimistic forecasts, Mr Schneider predicted 10-year bund yields of around 7.5 per cent by the summer, from close to 8 per cent yesterday, as the government's deficit reduction package and better inflation figures improve sentiment. The impact of large-scale public sector borrowing will probably depend on the broader economic outlook for inflation and interest rates. 'In a bull market supply can be totally benign - in fact it can help to improve liquidity,' commented Mr Klaus Baader, bund market analysts at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Over the medium term, most observers now agree that Germany's total public sector debt outstanding will balloon from DM1,170bn in 1991 to around DM2,000bn by 1995. This will push the debt up to at least 55 per cent of GNP, and possibly as high as 70 per cent, depending on assumptions about growth. Even at the lower end of expectations, this is only a whisker away from the 60 per cent limit set in the Maastricht treaty for countries which can proceed to the next stage of European monetary union.</p>

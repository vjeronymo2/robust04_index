			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Bombs in central Manchester injure 64 TWO BOMBS exploded in Manchester city centre yesterday, injuring 64 people and paralysing the area throughout the day. The city centre was closed to traffic and thousands of office and council workers were evacuated while police searched for two more devices and blew up 10 suspect packages with controlled explosions. No more bombs were found, and all the suspect packages turned out to be items abandoned during evacuation. Damage to buildings was light but extensive, and consisted mainly of broken windows. The injured were all cut by flying glass, but only one person was kept in hospital. The first bomb exploded outside tax offices in Parsonage Gardens off Deansgate at 8.40 am as people were arriving for work. Seven minutes later the Samaritans received a telephoned coded warning, saying that four bombs had been planted. A similar warning was given to the BBC soon afterwards. The second bomb exploded in Cateaton Street near Manchester Cathedral at 10.07 am as police were clearing the adjacent Cathedral Street, where the telephone caller had said the bomb was hidden. Commander David Tucker, police national anti-terrorism co-ordinator, said he had no doubt from the methods used that the IRA was responsible. Both bombs contained about 2lbs of high explosive hidden in shrubbery. It was unknown if they were made of Semtex, but they were different from the fertiliser-based explosives used in recent London incidents. Mr Jim Paterson, the assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester, said: 'I think it is absolutely deplorable to place bombs and then give warnings that do not allow us to respond properly. They can only have been targeted at ordinary people on their way to work.' The Association of British Insurers yesterday wrote to Mr John Major asking the government to fill the gap left by the recent decision of many large insurers to drop cover against terrorist attacks next year. The association said one method might be to compensate businesses as the government has done for many years in Northern Ireland.</p>

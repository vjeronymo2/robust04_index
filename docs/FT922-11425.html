			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance and the Family: Get in gear for growth if you believe in recovery - Fund managers' strategies for UK equities A UK growth unit trust sounds almost the ideal vehicle for the small investor who believes that equities will enjoy long-term benefits from the re-election of the Conservative government. But recent trends have not been encouraging. The average trust in the sector has risen by a dismal 8.6 per cent over the past five years, even after the re-investment of income. Even over 10 years, the average growth fund has been outperformed by the average equity income fund. There is an argument, however, that these trends will not continue in the 1990s. If membership of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism creates a low-growth, low-inflation environment, then interest rates will fall. Returns on equities may not be great in nominal terms, but they will look good in real terms and compare well with the rates available from building societies. Within the equity market, dividends now form quite a high proportion of corporate earnings, reducing the scope for many companies to increase payouts substantially. The search will be on for companies which can produce better-than-average profit growth; that ought to be the province of UK growth fund managers. There are more than 150 unit trusts competing for investors' funds in the UK growth sector, with some Pounds 7.3bn under management at the start of April. They range in size from Arkwright Recovery, with under Pounds 1m, to M&amp;G's massive Recovery fund which, at Pounds 750m-plus, is more than 10 per cent of the sector. Over seven and 10 years, M&amp;G Recovery's record still looks good (10th out of 65 and ninth out of 45 respectively), but it has produced a below-average performance over the past three years. The same can be said for the Fidelity Special Situations fund, which is second in the sector over 10 years. It is 106th (out of 124) over three years, with an 18.8 per cent loss. Anthony Bolton, who has run the fund since launch, says he has had a difficult time over the past couple of years, and admits he has made some mistakes as the recession has badly hit the balance sheets of some of the companies in which he has invested. Bolton says, however, that the early stages of recession are always likely to hit his strategy. He tends to look for unfashionable stocks, and is prepared to buy slightly more risky shares, and to be more aggressive, than the average unit trust manager. The Capability Special Situations fund, which has been the best performer in the sector over 10 years, has also been remarkably consistent. It is fourth in the sector over one year and ninth over the past five years. And Kenneth Levy - who manages the fund - is also in charge of Capability Growth, the fifth-best performer in the sector since April 1982. Levy says that part of his secret is to look closely at price movements in the key stocks that make up a large proportion of the fund. 'If they look good on fundamentals but their price keeps falling, then we ruthlessly cut them,' he says. 'It's arrogant to think that you know more than the market place.' Despite this approach, Levy says the special situations fund trades stocks less than the average unit trust. Of the two funds in the table, Levy explains that the growth fund tends to stick to the large capitalisation stocks, while the special situations has greater flexibility. He has moved recently more towards medium-sized and smaller stocks (although not very small companies; he feels many of these still have problems). Over a shorter time scale, one fund which has seen remarkable success is Pembroke, which is managed by the John Carrington group. Second over three years, it is top of the sector over both one and five years. Nigel Thomas, who co-manages the fund, says he looks for growth stocks which can produce above-average earnings increases. He believes this strategy will continue to be successful during the recovery. Joe Mottley, who manages the AIB Grofund equity trust (top over three years) with Eileen Fitzpatrick, attributes the success to running a concentrated portfolio of only 35 or so stocks. A similar strategy is cited by Duncan Trinder, who manages the British growth fund for Gartmore (third over three years). He has focused on only 25 or so large stocks, which has enabled him to research them thoroughly and gives him sufficient liquidity to meet redemptions. Picking a fund manager is, of course, a hazardous business. Only a small number ever produce returns which beat the index. One answer to this conundrum, therefore, is to select a fund which attempts to track the performance of the index. Gartmore has been running such a fund since 1989, and this week announced that it was abolishing the initial charge. There will still be a bid-offer spread (of around 1.9 per cent); but with an annual charge of only 0.5 per cent, this will represent one of the lowest-charging funds on the market. The fund, which was launched in 1989, has so far tracked the FT All-Share index within 0.15 per cent in 36 out of 38 months (in the other two months, the errors were 0.2 and 0.3 per cent). Gartmore UK Index is classed as a UK General fund by Finstat, and its 15.9 per cent growth over three years places it 12th out of 85 funds in the sector. The minimum investment in the Gartmore Index fund is Pounds 5,000; for those with less to invest, Providence Capitol is launching a UK All-Share Mirror trust with a minimum of just Pounds 500. This fund will also try to track the All-Share and will have an initial charge of 5.5 per cent and an annual management fee of 0.75 per cent. Those who invest on April 29 will get a discount of 5 per cent on that day only. Murray Johnstone's UK growth fund, while not indexed, has only a 1 per cent initial charge. The fund is 31st out of 124 in the sector over three years, with a rise of 9.7 per cent. Anyone who wants to back any of these funds should be aware of the risks. It is no good expecting to double your money in six months; indeed, you should be prepared to take the risk that the market will fall 10 or 20 per cent in the short term. Investment is likely to bear fruit only over a five-year term; and, as the period since 1987 has shown, even five years may not be long enough to bring an investor healthy profits.  ---------------------------------------------------------------          BEST UK GROWTH TRUSTS OVER 10 YEARS  ---------------------------------------------------------------                    % growth Capab'ty Spec Sits  687.3 Fidelity Spec Sits  551.1 Arkwright Growth    522.6 Prolific Spec Sits  450.9 Capability Growth   448.6  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat.

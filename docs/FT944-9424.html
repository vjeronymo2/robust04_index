			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / EU plans to scrap farm price cushion One of the European Union's most expensive policies, originally intended to cushion farmers' incomes from currency fluctuations, is to be scrapped under plans Brussels will publish today. The policy, which is known as 'switchover', has cost the EU budget around Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.7bn) since it was introduced a decade ago. It has added 21 per cent to European farm prices, according to European Commission officials. One Brussels official yesterday heralded the near-certain abolition of the scheme as 'the death of a great dinosaur'. Only Germany, at whose behest the system was introduced in 1984, opposes ending switchover. But as current president of the EU it is in the invidious position of having to chair next month's meeting of agriculture ministers which should decide on the issue; this obliges Bonn to concentrate on winning consensus rather than allies. Switchover, part of the EU's complex 'green money' system for converting agricultural subsidies into national currencies, realigns farm prices in every EU member state to follow the upward movements of the strongest EU currency, invariably the D-Mark but often the Dutch guilder as well. Although designed to protect Germany's politically influential farmers, it has become an inflation machine which locks farm price increases permanently into the EU budget, over half of which goes on the Common Agricultural Policy. The Commission fought to abolish switchover after reform of the CAP in 1992 cut farm prices sharply. But Germany won a two-year extension following that autumn's turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism currency grid. But, after the decision in August 1993 to float all currencies within wide bands of the ERM, there have been no formal realignments and Brussels put the scheme in abeyance. Germany argues that, in practice, the 'hard' ERM currencies have continued to trade within narrow bands, putting farmers in the countries concerned at a disadvantage against currencies such as the lira, the peseta or sterling, which have 'floated' over the past two years. The Commission is unmoved and holds a strong hand. Moreover, it would be particularly hard for Germany, which complains that it is by far the largest contributor to the EU budget, to produce cogent arguments to retain or extend in time such manifestly indiscriminate compensation. 'The Germans have to recognise that every time the switchover is triggered, they're paying a third of the bill, while their farmers are only getting about a quarter of the take,' one Commission official said. What the Commission now wants is to target compensation on farmers who lose out on sharp currency realignments and pay them directly, rather than by increasing prices. But it may insist this is paid out of national budgets and would be tough on eligibility 'in the light of the 20 per cent windfall many farmers have had over the past 10 years' through switchover, one Brussels official said. Here too, the Commission is in a strong position. Any increase in EU aid which raises farm prices now quickly runs into three formidable and linked obstacles: a tight agriculture budget ceiling; a reformed CAP whose success depends on prices coming down; and EU commitments under the Uruguay Round world trade agreement to slash farm price support.</p>

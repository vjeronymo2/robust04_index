			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Germany There was relief all round yesterday that German money supply grew at an annualised rate of just 8.8 per cent in April. That may be well below market expectations, and enough to lay to rest any lingering fears of a Bundesbank rate increase. But it is still far too early to bring forward any expectations for the timing of a cut. The Bundesbank's action in draining funds from the market as call money slipped yesterday morning was a reminder that money supply performance is still bad. Granted, the figure is liable to distortion, but even the new lower rate of growth is too far outside the target range for the central bank to relax about the inflationary implications of credit growth. The prospect thus remains that monetary policy will continue on its present tight course for some time to come. There is a double disappointment here for those who have been claiming the UK could break free of the German interest rate tie. That argument was predicated in part on the erroneous assumption that Germany had suddenly become the sick man of Europe. In fact the wage round passed off more or less all right, there are grounds for hope that the budget deficit will be curbed, and money supply is at least heading downwards. Things are no longer bad enough to threaten the anchor position of the D-Mark in the ERM. That they are also not going well enough for any let-up in the adjustment effort means the rest of Europe will have to continue to share the pain.</p>

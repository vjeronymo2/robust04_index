			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Top S African merchant bank granted listing RAND Merchant Bank Holdings (RMBH), one of South Africa's top three merchant banks, has been granted a listing on the Johannesburg stock exchange from November 25, offering investors their first chance to invest directly in the company. The listing follows the merger earlier this year of Rand Merchant Bank with Momentum Life, a local insurance company. As a result of the merger RMBH holds 77 per cent of Momentum, which in turn owns 100 per cent of Rand Merchant Bank (RMB), the operating arm of RMBH. Together with UAL, the merchant banking arm of the Nedcor group, and Standard Merchant Bank, RMBH is one of South Africa's main merchant banks, with a reputation for innovation and entrepreneurial flair. RMB was instrumental in establishing the South African futures market in the mid-1980s. The listing also offers investors exposure to Momentum, considered by the market to have good recovery potential in the hands of RMB. In particular, it is thought that RMB will able to improve returns on the R9.2bn (Dollars 308bn) assets Momentum had under management at the end of June. The Johannesburg exchange has granted a listing for 55m shares, which analysts believe will trade at about R10 each, giving the group a market capitalisation of more than R500m. No capital is being raised through the listing, which is designed to make shares available to the investment community and to open the way for future funding. Currently, directors and management hold 46.3 per cent of RMBH, the Sage financial services group holds 26.2 per cent, Absa 13.1 per cent, and other institutions and individuals have 14.4 per cent. Absa, South Africa's largest bank by market capitalisation, is seeking to sell its stake as it already possesses merchant banking activities in the form of Absa Merchant Bank. Mr Louis Shill, Sage chairman, said yesterday that his company's stake in RMBH was a strategic investment which it intended to hold. RMBH will be listed in the insurance sector, reflecting the fact that about 70 per cent of group assets are in insurance, and the generally better ratings in this sector than in banking. It disclosed attributable profits of R37m in the year June 1992. Analysts believe, however, that under the terms of an exemption under the South African Banks Act, RMBH could have transferred as much as a third of its profits to internal reserves in the year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 18 Jun (TANJUG) -- Significant headway  has been achieved in the talks conducted by the Montenegrin  delegation in Great Britain, because there is a growing  awareness that the policy of sanctions against the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia and Montenegro is pointless, Montenegrin  Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said in his assessment of the  Montenegrin delegation's visit to Great Britain. The delegation  returned to Podgorica yesterday evening.    The stands of the international community -- primarily the  European Union -- on the futility of the policy of sanctions,  which have, in a way, been conveyed to the Montenegrin  delegation will, according to Djukanovic, encourage a flurry of  activity leading to the establishment of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, after which the sanctions against the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be alleviated.    Assessing the talks in Great Britain as extremely useful and  interesting, the Montenegrin prime minister stressed that it had  been mutually noted that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina is of  paramount importance, and that this will be followed by all  other moves on the part of the international community.    Respect was also voiced toward the principled policies  pursued by Montenegro, both in the sense of searching for a  solution in the region of former Yugoslavia and of normalizing  the situation in the entire area, Djukanovic said. He attaches  great importance to the fact that, by making this visit,  Montenegro's foreign policy, which does carry a certain amount  of weight in the eyes of the international community, has  announced the beginning of a new diplomatic offensive.</p>

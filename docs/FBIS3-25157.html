			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is some confusion over the TEC's [Transitional  Executive Council] stand on detention without trial. The [TEC]  Subcouncil on Law and Order, Security, and Stability said the  retention or repeal of Section 29 of the Internal Security Act  had never been on its agenda, nor had the council sought or  received advice on the matter from the police. Earlier the TEC  was sharply criticized for an alleged decision to retain  detention without trial.</p>

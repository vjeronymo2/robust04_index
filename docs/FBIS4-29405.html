			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on meeting between Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and </F> reporters in Seoul on 16 June on the draft resolution for UN  sanctions against North Korea -- by reporter Yang Sung-hyon]    [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu announced on 16 June:  "The government has accepted the draft resolution worked out by  the Untied States on the UN Security Council sanctions on North  Korea." He then said that he "will make every possible  diplomatic effort for this draft resolution to be adopted."    In an emergency meeting with reporters on the morning of  that  day, Minister Han said the above and added: "Our government's  intent has considerably been reflected in the draft resolution."    [Unidentified reporter] What is the composition of the draft  resolution worked out by the United States?    [Han Sung-chu] It is composed of a preamble and 20-point  text. It can be summed up into the preamble and seven sorts of  sanctions.    [Unidentified reporter] Is the Russian proposal for  eight-party talks mentioned in the draft resolution?    [Han] It does not directly mention the Russian proposal but  specifies that international talks could be promoted if North  Korea meets the demands expressed in the resolution.    [Unidentified reporter] Does it include any warning to North  Korea of sanctions that may be imposed on it if North Korea  declares its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty?    [Han] Yes, it does. For example, suspension of remittances  to North Korea and the freezing of assets are mentioned.    [Unidentified reporter] What is China's reaction to it?    [Han] I think China was notified of the U.S. draft  resolution on the evening of 15 June our time. However, I have  received no information on China's reaction. At present, it is  hard to predict the Chinese reaction. What China must  immediately decide is whether it will discuss the resolution  with members of the UN Security Council or will express its own  position on the draft resolution first. I think we shall learn  it soon.    [Unidentified reporter] How much has our intent been  reflected in the draft resolution?    [Han] The draft considerably reflects the result of working-  level discussions by the ROK, the United States, and Japan that  was confirmed during my recent visit to the United States. It  contains effective constitution [hyogwajogin naeyong]. I think  it will be a very strong means of pressure if it is adopted as  it is.    [Unidentified reporter] What influence has North Korea's  declaration of its withdrawal from the International Atomic  Energy Agency exerted upon the draft resolution?    [Han] It accelerated the speed of working out the draft,  rather than influenced its contents.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the UN Security Council  will proceed with the adoption of the draft by putting it to a  vote?    [Han] We have to see the result of further discussions on  it. However, whether it will be put to a vote or not depends on  North Korea's attitude, not on further discussions.    [Unidentified reporter] The draft resolution contains an  item forbidding the export of weapons. I wonder if it includes  the authority to search ships.    [Han] Embargo means more than the ban of exports. As is  seen in all other resolutions on sanctions, a formula on the  details of sanctions in this draft will separately be prepared.    [Unidentified reporter] What sanctions can we exercise?    [Han] Since it is based on international cooperation, I  think we have to play a big role when the draft is adopted. We  will have many to do so diplomatically and bilaterally [with  North Korea].    [Unidentified reporter] How are behind-the-scene contacts  between the United States and North Korea going?    [Han] Although U.S. media report that they have contacts  behind the scene, there has been no enveloped move between them.    [Unidentified reporter] What is your opinion on the  nullification or abolition of the declaration on denuclearizing  the Korean peninsula that is included in the draft on sanctions?    [Han] The government has mentioned that it is difficult to  implement the declaration on denuclearization, but it is not  reconsidering it. It is the government's basic principle that  the declaration on denuclearization should be implemented.</p>

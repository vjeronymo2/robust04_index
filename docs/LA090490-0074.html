			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STRESS: When principal Dan Graham's elementary school opens Thursday, more than  half of its 600 pupils will have recently said goodby to a father or mother. .  . . The school, run by the Irvine Unified district, serves the El Toro Marine  Corps Air Station, whence so many Marines have shipped out to Saudi Arabia. . .  . To cope with children's stress, the school will have extra counselors and a  psychologist and immediately encourage children to open up. Says Graham: "They  need to realize that it's OK to feel angry, that it's the reason they're  behaving differently." Kristina Lindgren and Tony Marcano  </P></p>

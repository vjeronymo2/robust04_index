			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LIST THAT MATTERS  </P> <P> I really enjoyed Robert Hilburn's article, but I felt that I had to set the  record straight about his comments on Living Colour.  </P> <P> Besides the fact that they should have been listed in the top five, I disagreed  with his suggestion that Vernon Reid is the only saving element of the band.  </P> <P> Although I agree that Reid's songwriting and musicianship is excellent, it is  only the combination of this with the other three elements of Living Colour  that makes them one of the best of the new groups.  </P> <P> When he quoted some "sample lines" of Vernon Reid's songwriting, he was  actually quoting drummer William Calhoun's song, "Pride," which shows his  strong songwriting skills. I must add, as a drummer myself, that William  Calhoun is one of the most talented of the new drummers. Also, the exceptional  bass playing of Muzz Skillings is an indispensable part of the band and can't  be ignored.  </P> <P> DAVID DAMITZ  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

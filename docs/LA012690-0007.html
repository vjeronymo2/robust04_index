			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S RETIREMENT OPENS SUPERIOR COURT SPOT;  </P> <P> THE LAW: ROSS G. THARP SAYS HE WON'T BE SEEKING REELECTION. SAN DIEGO MUNICIPAL  COURT JUDGE FREDERIC L. LINK ANNOUNCES HE WILL RUN FOR THE POSITION.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Ross G. Tharp will not run for reelection,  opening a spot on the bench that San Diego Municipal Court Judge Frederic L.  Link will run for, both judges confirmed Thursday.  </P> <P> Tharp, 61, said he delivered a letter Thursday to Judge Judith McConnell, the  San Diego Superior Court's presiding judge, announcing that he will retire to  write and travel "before heading for that big courthouse in the sky."  </P> <P> Eligible for retirement in late July after 20 years on the bench, Tharp's  decision not to file for reelection means there could be a contested campaign  for his seat on the 71-member court. Link, 46, a criminal law specialist with  nearly nine years on the bench, said he offers the community a "known  commodity."  </P> <P> Because a backlog of criminal cases frequently plagues Superior Court, selected  Municipal Court judges routinely are allowed to sit as Superior Court judges at  the downtown San Diego courthouse, and Link said he has "handled thousands of  felony cases" as well as three murder jury trials since taking the bench in  1981.  </P> <P> "Most people running for the bench are not judges, and you don't know what  their record is," Link said. "I have something they can look at."  </P> <P> The developments Thursday marked the informal opening of campaign season for  the 31 spots on the Superior Court bench up for confirmation. McConnell, the  presiding judge, said she understands that the 30 other incumbents are all  planning to file for reelection.  </P> <P> On Monday, the county's registrar of voters begins accepting formal papers from  incumbent judges or challengers announcing an intent to run. The filing  deadline is Feb. 7, said Barbara Walther, a senior clerk at the registrar's  office.  </P> <P> The filing period is the same for the county's Municipal Court, where 24 spots  will be up this year for confirmation, Walther said. Of the 24 seats, 10 are at  the San Diego court, six at Vista, four at El Cajon and four at Chula Vista.  </P> <P> The county's Municipal Court is administratively split into four districts,  unlike the Superior Court, which takes in the entire county.  </P> <P> Tharp's decision not to pursue reelection makes him the second judge within a  month to announce a departure from the San Diego Superior Court.  </P> <P> Unlike Louis E. Boyle, however, who left the bench at the end of December to  return to the district attorney's office in a move prompted largely by the  shortage of courtrooms and physical shortcomings at the downtown San Diego  courthouse, Tharp said he will miss being a judge.  </P> <P> The San Diego court, Tharp said, is the "finest in the state, if not the  country."  </P> <P> Tharp said he does not plan to immediately endorse Link for his spot because he  wants "to see who else is in the race before making a commitment."  </P> <P> "I have only the greatest respect for (Link), but I'm not sure if a retiring  judge, or any retiring officer, can exert any pressure on the electorate,"  Tharp said. "And, besides, I don't know if that's appropriate."  </P> <P> Link said he hopes to receive "significant backing" from police groups, lawyers  and judges. Late Thursday, Link said, he was endorsed by the San Diego Police  Officers Assn.  </P> <P> "I plan to continue to seek ways to improve the system for the citizens,  witnesses and victims who come into the courthouse," Link said. "The old ways  cannot be followed any longer. We must find and seek out innovative solutions  to the problems that the citizens demand be solved."  </P> <P> Link was appointed to the Municipal Court in June, 1981, elected to his post in  1982 and reelected in 1988. He served as the court's presiding judge in 1985  and 1986 and has a lengthy record of involvement in bench, bar and community  affairs.  </P> <P> Before taking the bench, Link was a deputy district attorney and a San Diego  lawyer specializing in criminal defense. He attended college at UC Santa  Barbara and law school at the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> Tharp served two years on the San Diego Municipal Court, from 1969 to 1971,  before then-Gov. Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Superior Court. He was  elected in 1972 and reelected in 1978 and 1984.  </P> <P> Tharp, a Republican, ran for the state Assembly's 78th District seat in 1980  but lost to incumbent Lawrence Kapiloff -- who, like Tharp, is now a San Diego  Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> From 1957 to 1961, Tharp served on the San Diego City Council. In private  practice for 14 years before moving to the bench in 1969, he went to college  and law school at Loyola University in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: What they had to say 'After being abandoned by his deputy, John Smith kissed Margaret Beckett with all the sincerity with which Doctor Crippen used to embrace his wife.' Sir Norman Fowler 'Who do the Liberals speak for? The short answer is that they speak for the person they last spoke to'. Sir Norman Fowler 'Much of the devil of Europe is in the detail of Europe.' Lord Tebbit former party chairman 'The senior member of the hired help employed by the nation-states to do the bidding of the Council of Ministers.' Lord Tebbit on Jacques Delors 'Those of us who backed the government's efforts to prevail against opposition from all parts of the House in the Maastricht debates did so to safeguard our idea of Britain's place in Europe . . Policies based on the lowest common denominator of agreement will lack impact and credibility.' Ian Taylor MP, Positive European Group, in Tory Reform Group magazine 'There is no doubt that there is deep, deep, disillusionment with the process of government . . ministers are acting as if they are servants of (Conservative) Central Office. They have broken the trust of the people.' Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge-Brownhills 'I can honestly say I have been coming to these things for 28 years and the only time I feel like joining the Communist party is coming to a Tory conference. It is just a recipe for creating trouble and disunity.' Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East 'I went to Blackpool once 20 years ago. You never go to Blackpool twice. The sea was awful, there are no nice restaurants, the accommodation is pretty rotten and, last but not least, it's so far away from everything.' Rupert Allason MP for Torbay</p>

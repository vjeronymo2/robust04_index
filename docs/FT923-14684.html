			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / People: Scholes Group settles on Baxter from FKI Alan Baxter, who ran FKI's electrical products group until last week, has been appointed chief executive of Scholes Group, the Wilmslow-based electricals group which lost both its chairman and chief executive designate in March. The appointment of Baxter, 42, follows growing concern among some institutional investors about the management vacuum at the top of a group which has been hit hard by the recession in the construction industry and cut its dividend last year. Earlier this year Scholes had tried to solve its management succession problems by recruiting Barrie Lawson as chief executive designate. But he did not survive a three-month settling-in period. Shortly afterwards, Reg Harrington, the chairman and chief executive, died. As a result Bill Riches, Scholes' 55-year-old finance director, took on the chief executive's job temporarily, but he said yesterday that the intention had always been to recruit a permanent replacement from outside. Unlike Lawson, Baxter is not subject to a three-month trial. Baxter brings considerable big business experience to Scholes. After spells at GEC Alsthom and Babcock Inter-national, he has been in charge of 22 factories and a 7,500 workforce at FKI. By contrast, Scholes has seven factories and employs 1,700. However, he will be running his own show. His decision to quit FKI follows the arrival of a new chief executive who had reorganised the FKI businesses around product lines with the result that Baxter could not be offerred a job of the same status as running FKI's entire UK electrical businesses. As part of the reshuffle, Riches becomes executive chairman replacing Richard Morgan, a former BICC finance director, who had been doing the job following Harrington's death. Morgan, who was appointed a non-executive director in November 1990, remains on the board. Philip Acton, Scholes' 34-year-old financial controller, joins the board as finance director. ***** Geoff Unwin, executive chairman of Hoskyns, the UK company bought by Cap Gemini Sogeti two years ago, has been appointed one of three presidents of the French-based parent, a signal honour for an Englishman in a company which relishes both its Frenchness and its position as leader of the European computing services industry. Unwin's fellow presidents are Michel Jalabert, one of CGS's longest serving executives, and Jacques Arnould, formerly chief executive of Sesa, another CGS acquisition. Unwin will be responsible for CGS's regional business across all its regional com-panies. He will remain chairman of Hoskyns but Tony Fisher and Tony Robinson, joint managing directors, will become group vice presidents in charge of the UK and Ireland. Unwin says CGS's challenge is to integrate its operations more closely in contrast to the loose federal structure which has operated to date.</p>

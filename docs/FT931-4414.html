			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Industrialists warn against tax increase A FRAGILE recovery may be on the way but could be jeopardised by negative factors such as a Budget tax increase, the Treasury has been told by its advisers from industry. In reports sent this week members of the Treasury's industrial prospects committee gave their views on activity in a range of sectors including oil, chemicals, carmaking and engineering. The reports were called for last week by Mr Alan Budd, Treasury chief economic adviser. They will be used in briefing Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, before his Budget speech next Tuesday. The committee, with a membership varying around 12, was set up last summer to strengthen links between the Treasury and industry. Mr Leslie Gunde, chief economist at engineering components group GKN and a member of the committee, said in his submission there were 'increasing indications' of sustainable economic recovery. He warned that 'any precipitate measures to increase tax revenues may well damage still-fragile confidence in industry'. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries and another committee member, said signs of recovery were mixed. Increasing taxes to curb the rising government deficit 'would be a very adverse move' because of its impact on confidence and demand. Ms Kate Barker, chief European economist at Ford, said that while the UK car market looked poised for recovery, this trend was being offset by worsening economic conditions in other parts of Europe.</p>

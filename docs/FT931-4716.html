			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Lords to rule on card fraud THE HOUSE of Lords is to be asked to rule on a legal test case over whether Barclays Bank should have to honour cheques with forged signatures backed by stolen cheque guarantee cards. Appeal Court judges said in a 2-1 ruling yesterday that Barclays should be liable to honour cheques when supported by old bank guarantee cards. The cards, which are no longer in use, have the terms of the guarantee printed on them, specifically excluding fraudulent payments. The judges gave Barclays leave to appeal to the House of Lords after lawyers for the bank said the ruling could cost it 'several tens of millions of pounds' if similar cases came to court. The Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, said he had considerable hesitation in rejecting the bank's argument that it should not have to honour such fraudulent payments. However, he said, the bank's claim about future possible losses might be exaggerated. The cards were phased out from January 1990 when Barclays' guarantee came into line with that offered by other high street banks. This leaves it to banks' discretion whether to honour such cheques - the deciding factor being whether the signature is a good enough forgery for retailers not to be reasonably expected to spot the fraud.</p>

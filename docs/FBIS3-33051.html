			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Gustavo Gabaldon, president of the Venezuelan  Institute of Social Security [IVSS], stated in an end of the  year message to workers that the new draft law on social  security to replace the present law and the regulations issued  under it has been favorably received by the president, who has  promised to consider it at a cabinet meeting during the next few  days.    The draft bill has also been discussed with senior  representatives of the president elect, who also received it  favorably.    Gabaldon said in his report that it will not be possible to  administer the IVSS properly with a financial deficit of almost  one billion bolivares monthly, due to inadequate income to cover  the basic expenditures of the institute.    The president of the IVSS proposed six urgently needed  measures to the president:    1) Seek passage of a Law on Public Credit, under which the  national government will cancel its debt to the IVSS of more  than 8.5 billion bolivares.    2) Pass appropriate legislation to restore the technical  reserves of the IVSS which are more than 300 billion bolivares  short, due to mistakes made in the past.    3) Provide by decree for total coverage of all employees of  the national government.    4) Seek a harmonious agreement between employers and workers  to raise social security contributions within the next 30 days  in such a way that this increase will be insignificant for those  with the least resources.    5) Raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from  55  to 60 for women.    6) Make changes in the percentages relating to each social  security fund to make them adequate under present circumstances  and separate the various funds, with different administrations  and accounting systems.    Gabaldon said that when he became president of the IVSS, the  institute was in a state of total collapse in the areas of  administration, operations, and finance, notwithstanding the  intense effort made by the Committee on Restructuring, which was  established under special legislation.    He said that the results of this work became known through a  draft social security bill which has still not been introduced  in Congress for debate. He pointed out that, notwithstanding the  advances made in terms of decentralization, through harmonious  cooperation with several state governments, the financial  deficit will continue and become intolerable if significant  action is not taken.    The president of the IVSS said that the following actions  have already been taken recently:     -  Improvements in the quality of IVSS  employees.    -  Introduction of strict controls over bidding,  purchasing, and payments.    -  Revision of general  procedures.    -  Introduction of a system of automatic payments  through the banks.    -  A total change in the system and control of  surveillance of property belonging to the IVSS.    -  A substantial  improvement in the processes of daily collections and  receipts.    -  A substantial reduction in debts owed to suppliers and  a considerable improvement in the system of  payments.    -  Elimination of the use of blank payrolls.    -  Payment of  pensions to workers.    -  A substantial improvement in making  payments to hospitals and centers of ambulatory health  care.    -  Raising the minimum IVSS pension to 9,000  bolivares.    -  Making up one year of arrearages of unemployment  payments; these obligations are now being paid on time.    -  Study of  an independent social security management system to improve the  Pension Fund.    -  Elimination of per diem allowances, unnecessary  travel within and outside the country, and unjustified overtime  payments, including the elimination of chauffeurs and escorts  for the president of the IVSS, members of the Board of  Directors, and directors of the institute.    -  Beginning the process  of appraisal and sale of unnecessary IVSS assets.    -  Beginning the  system of self-administration of hospitals under which they will  present their own bills and collect contributions from workers  not insured and from private persons or groups holding insurance  policies.    Gabaldon pointed out that there is still a long way to go,  but we have seen the light at the end of the tunnel through  which we have been traveling.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Bristol and Avon gain new lobby A PARTNERSHIP between the public and private sectors in Bristol and Avon has been set up to agree an economic strategy for the region and to promote it in the European Community. The partnership, to be run as a company called the Western Development Partnership in Avon, has initial funding for the first year of Pounds 250,000 from councils, industry and the Avon Training and Enterprise Council. Its formation follows long negotiations amid fears that the effects of the recession have been exacerbated in Avon and the south-west of England by the lack of a united voice to represent the region and promote inward investment. The partnership may eventually include neighbouring counties. The partnership is supported by councils including Avon, Bristol and Bath, and by companies, trade unions, professional bodies, universities and chambers of commerce. The chairman is Mr David Johnson, a Labour Avon county councillor, and the vice-chairman is Mr Tony FitzSimons, chief executive of Bristol &amp; West Building Society. They said in a joint statement: 'Around 20,000 jobs have been lost in Avon during the recession and a third of those won't come back even when recovery gets under way. Avon faces stiff competition from other parts of the UK and Europe, so we need to act swiftly and decisively to attract inward investment. At the same time, we want to help existing local businesses to succeed.' Other board members include Mr Chris Geoghegan, managing director of British Aerospace's Airbus division, Mr David Hider, regional chairman of British Gas South West, and Mr Alfred Morris, vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England. Mr Chris Garcia, a strategic planning consultant, has been appointed to devise a business plan, and a chief executive will be appointed in the autumn. Last week the Local Government Commission recommended that the county of Avon be abolished. Mr FitzSimons said that, in spite of the question over the county's future, the partnership had agreed to set up a framework to develop Avon as an important European area.</p>

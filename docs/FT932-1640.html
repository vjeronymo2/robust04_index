			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Venezuela's central bank keeps its head: What happened when all around were losing theirs VENEZUELA has this year passed through a political crisis that in times past would have brought a collapse in economic confidence and a run on the currency. Yet despite two failed military coup attempts last year, the suspension this year of President Carlos Andres Perez on corruption charges and forthcoming presidential elections in December, there has been no panic flight of capital. The credit for breaking the vicious cycle between political and economic stability is widely laid at the door of one of the institutional reforms promoted by Mr Perez: the creation of an independent central bank whose sole focus would be on maintaining monetary stability. The central bank's new autonomy hangs on a law that went on to the statute books on December 4. A new six-strong board was appointed by Mr Perez on December 23. The central bank president, Ms Ruth de Krivoy, was appointed for a five-year term. Her successor will be chosen by the president and must be ratified by a two-thirds majority of the senate. At the end of May, the bank completed its transition by withdrawing from responsibilities to provide export finance. 'The independence of the central bank has meant a profound change in the way politics and economics relate. Because we have more efficient decision making in terms of monetary policy, the central bank was able to move effectively to counteract the shock to the financial markets arising from the political uncertainty,' said Ms De Krivoy in an interview. The shock was a sharp drop in the demand for money caused by the political crisis. To counteract this and to protect the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, the central bank raised interest rates sharply. Benchmark interest rates (on 91-day central bank zero-coupon notes) almost touched 70 per cent simple around May 19, the day before the supreme court voted that there was a case for the impeachment of Mr Perez. More conventionally expressed in compound interest terms, assuming reinvestment, this is an annual interest rate of 90 per cent in a country where inflation is running in the mid-30s. As a result, foreign exchange reserves rose in April and were steady during May. The reflow of capital that occurred was a break with the past, suggested Ms de Krivoy. 'In the past, in an election year and with political uncertainties, our experience was that capital flows were a one-way traffic out of the country and would not have come back before the elections.' Bankers in Caracas agree that the central bank was an important bulwark against instability during the political crisis. But they criticise the bank for allowing interest rates to fall too rapidly in early May, which meant only that they had to be jacked up again sharply later in the month. The rapid fall in interest rates suggests to some that, nominally independent though the central bank is, it is prey to political influence. As benchmark interest rates fell below 42 per cent last week, some bankers reckoned rates had again - perhaps for political reasons - been allowed to fall too far for comfort. Some financiers believe Ms de Krivoy is walking a fine line between trying to establish the central bank's reputation as an independent agency while not exposing her own position for what it is: precarious. Unlike her successors, Ms de Krivoy was not confirmed by the senate, and the institution has little popular support. Furthermore, according to the new central bank law, the president and the directors can be removed by the president for a variety of reasons, including 'failure to perform the responsibilities of the position'. Thus while the central bank may have some independence when the executive is weak, as it has been this year, things would be different under a strong president. 'If (presidential candidate Rafael) Caldera becomes president, Ruth de Krivoy will be history,' said one banker. Mr Caldera, a former president offering a populist election platform, is one of two leading contenders. Furthermore, unless action is taken by Congress to cut the budget deficit, interest rates will have to remain high for some time, intensifying already significant pressure on the central bank. Ms de Krivoy does not deny that high interest rates will take its toll on the economy: 'Growth this year will be low.' She declined to be more specific, but growth of between 2 and 4 per cent does not seem out of the question, compared with last year's 7 per cent and the 1991 figure of more than 10 per cent. She said the central bank had taken the course that - given the political uncertainty and a budget deficit that remains a cause of concern to financial markets - it believed would minimise social costs, the impact on inflation and on international reserves. The key to sustainably lower interest rates, according to the central bank president, is a period of political stability and action by congress to reduce the budget deficit. This ran at 6 per cent of gross domestic product last year and is expected to be 4 or more per cent this year. Tax legislation will be needed this year - a proposed partial value added tax and a corporate assets tax - to bring it down to 2 per cent next year. Legislators differ on the probability of this going into law this year. The tax bills are likely to be included in an enabling law which congress must pass before its session ends on August 15 before the elections. This would allow the bills to be enacted by presidential decree. In the mean time, the central bank has some communicating to do. 'We have to explain that it's not just a matter of forcing interest rates to come down in a way that doesn't reflect the true situation of the country,' said Ms de Krivoy.</p>

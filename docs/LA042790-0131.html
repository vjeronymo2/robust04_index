			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOYERS ANALYZES APPEAL OF 'AMAZING GRACE'  </P> <P> How sweet the sound of a truly moving melody. Concerned parents, critics,  generals and protest activists -- all would agree that there is transforming  power in music. But can one solitary song, in and of itself, actually change  lives en masse?  </P> <P> Bill Moyers is hard-pressed to ascribe that much power to any song he knows of  but one.  </P> <P> "I heard 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic' at Robert Kennedy's funeral, and I  saw how that occasion lifted people from beyond themselves," says Moyers, who  worked in the Johnson Administration before achieving fame as a TV journalist.  "But I don't think I'd ever seen a song about which so many people confessed  that it had actually transformed their seeing, their feeling, their way of  looking at themselves and the world, as 'Amazing Grace.' "  </P> <P> Armed with the belief that slave-trader-cum-minister John Newton's 19th-Century  hymn is the most extraordinary composition known to our generation, and the  knowledge that it remains the most recorded melody of the sound era, Moyers  embarked on a mission to trace its impact -- from the abolition movement to the  civil rights movement and beyond -- with a feature-length documentary film of  the same name. Full of English history and modern Americana, Moyers' "Amazing  Grace" has its local premiere tonight at 9 as part of the AFI Film Festival in  Century City.  </P> <P> Certainly unlike any other hymn, "Amazing Grace" has taken on a hugely secular  as well as religious life, moving beyond the Protestant church into the popular  culture. Judy Collins, interviewed in the film, had a Top 20 single with it in  1970. Opera singer Jessye Norman, likewise included in the documentary, hushed  a rowdy rock throng at the Nelson Mandela birthday celebration two years ago in  England by singing it a cappella. Decidedly non-churchy rock and country  performers regularly include it in their acts.  </P> <P> "Somewhere in some boundary indefinable, it connects the sacred and secular  orders," said Moyers by phone from his New York office, in advance of his trip  to Los Angeles for tonight's post-screening discussion.  </P> <P> "It is truly a new country there. I think there's been a kind of stuttering  start -- and the Joseph Campbell series ("The Power of Myth") was part of this  -- of a deep and vital inquiry into the meaning of spiritual life in America  today. And it's neither wholly spiritual nor wholly secular. And there are some  hymns and poems that transcend either of those heretofore clearly defined  boundaries. It's not church, but it's not 'street,' either."  </P> <P> The hymn's crossover appeal lies in the fact that "it contains no  ecclesiastical doctrine known as such," said Moyers. "No single denomination  has proprietary claim to it. It evokes something from people rather than  telling something to people. And what it evokes, I think, is simply that  commonality of interest in the sublime that is a part of everyone's experience,  I think, even if it cannot be articulated in theological language."  </P> <P> Included in the film are interviews with a number of African Americans who are  initially taken aback to learn that the hymn's composer was, in fact, a  slave-ship captain before his conversion. Later, after he became a minister of  the Church of England and denounced slavery as an evil, his diaries from that  time became "perhaps the most important source of information about the slave  trade for the abolition movement," Moyers noted.  </P> <P> "It was news to many" of the blacks he interviewed, "but they somehow didn't  seem surprised. Again, I think that's part of the recognition that this is a  hymn that came from other than routine sources. I think they understood that  there was some kind of power to it that they hadn't perceived before, which is  actually why it spoke to them so incredibly, so richly."  </P> <P> Over the course of 87 minutes, viewers are exposed to Newton's hymn dozens of  times in dozens of wildly varying versions. Working on the documentary over the  course of the last two years, Moyers necessarily heard it hundreds more times.  Even the most graceless curmudgeon would have to acknowledge the song's  inherent, lasting power, but honestly, now -- did Moyers never think at some  point in the work that perhaps that he might not want to ever again hear some  small-town soprano sing of the grace that saved a wretch like Newton?  </P> <P> "No, I am being honest with you, I did not tire of it," said Moyers. "There are  so many variations of it, and once you move beyond just simply the wonder at  that, you begin to listen to the different inflections and the different  styles. And so it's an endless study in the kaleidoscopic qualities of a  powerful song and of music itself."  </P> <P> Though "Amazing Grace" will air on Moyers' home network, PBS, in the fall, it  is unlike most of his projects in that it will be seen to some extent on the  big screen -- thanks to the urging of friend Norman Lear, who urged Moyers to  exhibit it at festivals and in limited theatrical runs as "a community  experience" greater than the "isolated experience" of television.  </P> <P> "Essentially, it's a political film in one sense," said Moyers, "because it  does create a momentary sense of a community, and that's what the best politics  does."  </P> <P> This project also differs from Moyers' others in that it includes no narration.  </P> <P> "Not a line. But the people tell the story, and I'm simply carried along with  it as a kind of unacknowledged accomplice. You always have to have a  storyteller when you're telling a story, but the storyteller doesn't always  have to tell the story. In television in particular, the storyteller can simply  be a quiet presence around whom people organize their thoughts. We realized  from the beginning that this would need no narration if we produced and  directed it appropriately."  </P> <P> Moyers has been the source of some controversy in recent years among certain  segments of the church community, with accusations from some that "Politics and  God" unfairly portrayed biblical inerrantists in the Baptist camp or that "The  Power of Myth" promulgated New Age thought.  </P> <P> "I come out of the evangelical tradition and know them much more than I come  out of the fundamentalist tradition, and many evangelicals responded  affirmatively to Campbell because they thought he was acknowledging the power  of ritual and symbol in our experience," said Moyers. "But fundamentalists who  like to reduce everything to the jot and tittle weren't that appreciative."  </P> <P> Does he expect, then, to get back in their good graces, no pun intended, with  this latest project?  </P> <P> "Probably not. Because I'm not evangelizing, I'm not trying to make converts,  I'm not trying to win souls, I'm not trying to promote a dogma. And there's  nothing in the film that would restrict it to an exclusively Christian  community."  </P></p>

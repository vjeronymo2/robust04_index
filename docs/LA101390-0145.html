			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERDUE 'I DO'S' LAUNCH REUNION  </P> <P> He spotted her across the dance floor of a country-Western bar in Long Beach,  and when the two-step lessons started, Ed Johnson walked up and said, "I want  you. You're tall."  </P> <P> Thus began a romance that led to telephone bills totaling more than $3,000 and  a wedding Friday on the helicopter flight deck of the Vandegrift, a  guided-missile frigate that was one of the first two West Coast-based Navy  vessels to return home from the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> When Chief Petty Officer Johnson and Gail Hoover said their "I do's," it capped  a joyous reunion, not just for the 5-foot-10 bride and 6-foot-5 groom, but for  scores of families, lovers and friends who had been separated by the Long  Beach-based Vandegrift's seven-month tour of duty in Middle East waters. The  guided-missile frigate Reid also arrived Friday at its home port in San Diego.  </P> <P> The ship's return put an end to the anxiety that soared when Iraq invaded  Kuwait on Aug. 4, the very day the Vandegrift was to begin its journey home  from the region. Suddenly, the crew was ordered to battle stations, helmets on  and gas masks at the ready. The ship stayed on an extra five weeks during the  crisis, coordinating naval air defense and interdicting cargo vessels as part  of the blockade.  </P> <P> The crew and their kinfolk remembered the Stark, the guided-missile frigate  that was struck by an Iraqi missile in May, 1987, while patrolling the Persian  Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war. Thirty-seven were killed in the attack, which  was blamed on mistaken identity.  </P> <P> "I was confident we were going to bring home all 209 guys alive," said the  ship's captain, Cmdr. Chris Johnson, a Garden Grove resident. " . . . We  weren't going to be caught sleeping for one heartbeat."  </P> <P> And while their families worried about the sailors, the sailors worried about  quieter dramas back home, calling and writing to keep tabs.  </P> <P> "I was wondering if I was ever going to see him," Robert Myricks of North Long  Beach said, cradling 6-week-old Robert Jr.  </P> <P> "It was really crazy and hectic," Trina Myricks said of their son's first days.  Her husband was scheduled to be home Sept. 14, and junior was due Sept. 23. But  the baby arrived two weeks early. "It was part happiness, part sadness . . . I  don't want to go through that again," she said.  </P> <P> Irma Oropeza of Westminster watched her husband, Tony, hold their 10-month-old  son. "It's great . . . I'm glad to have a baby-sitter," she said, laughing.  "Now I can take a decent shower!"  </P> <P> No one, it seemed, was happier than the bride.  </P> <P> When Iraq invaded Kuwait, "I thought we were so unlucky," Gail Hoover said  before changing from jeans into her wedding gown. "Now I think how lucky it was  for him to be there." Other crews in the area still face the prospect of war.  </P> <P> Hoover said she thought she would never marry again. She is a 37-year-old  mother of two, and Johnson is a 35-year-old father of three. Both are divorced.  Hoover's 20-year-old son, Tom, donned a gray tuxedo to give the bride away.  Romance might have been on Johnson's mind from the start, but not so for  Hoover, a life insurance saleswoman. That night in The Silver Bullet, after he  saw her give her business card to another man, Johnson wanted one, too. "He  said, 'I need life insurance!' " Hoover recalled. "If you sell insurance,  that's like a dream."  </P> <P> During the next six weeks, they saw each other as much as possible. On March  15, the day the ship left Long Beach for the Persian Gulf, he proposed. She  said, "yes," and their courtship continued by mail and by phone.  </P> <P> Back home, she has two phone bills, one for $2,600 and one for $700. One of  their Buena Park-to-Bahrain conversations lasted 2 1/2 hours. They had decided  on the shipboard marriage, Johnson said, "because, after all, this was a day to  celebrate. We just wanted more reason to celebrate."  </P> <P> Earlier, someone asked Hoover the obvious question.  </P> <P> "Oh, I sold him the policy," Hoover said, laughing. "Now I'm the beneficiary."  </P></p>

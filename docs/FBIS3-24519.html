Borovaya, director, Biota </F> Scientific-Production Association]    [Text] An interfarm biological laboratory was organized in  1990 in Leningradskiy Rayon, Krasnodar Kray at the  Leningradskoye APO [Agricultural Production Association?].  Besides producing biological agents, its has been ordered to  reveal the most dangerous pests and diseases of agricultural  crops, to draw maps of their occurrence at farms, and to develop  the methods of effective use of different microbiological  preparations and monitoring the quality of biological agents  delivered to the rayon's farms. The Northern Caucasian  Scientific Research Institute of Phytopathology provided  technical and methodological assistance to the laboratory in all  of these years.    In the stage of initial development, our main goal was to  establish a collective of like-minded individuals capable of  organizing production of biological agents in the shortest time  possible, and to unite farm agronomists around the idea of  ecologically compatible plant protection. We believe we were  able to solve this problem successfully. The biolaboratory,  which has become part of the Biota Scientific-Production  Association, currently employs 12 persons, including Doctor of  Biological Sciences T. S. Ivanova (a nematologist), Candidate of  Biological Sciences A. P. Luda (a microbiologist), five highly  qualified specialists with a higher biological and agricultural  education, and four laboratory technicians.    The laboratory has equipment making it possible to produce  microbiological preparations such as rizoplan, bitoksibatsillin,  lepidotsid, baktofit, preparation-2 and trichodermin, and  preparations based on predatory nematodes.    The first lots of bacterial and fungal preparations were  produced in May 1991 according to procedures introduced at the  SK NIIF [not further identified]. In addition the laboratory's  associates underwent apprenticeship at the All-Union Scientific  Research Institute of Applied Microbiology (Obolensk), where  they mastered the methods of producing and using several  microbiological preparations. A highly active strain of  Trichoderma was revealed independently. It is now  being used in greenhouses of Leningradskiy Rayon to control root  rot. The laboratory is also developing preparative forms of  biological resources based on entomopathogenic nematodes that  are highly effective (70-95 percent) against wireworms and  potato moths. A total of 7,200 liters of biological preparations  were produced in 9 months of 1992.    During the time that the scientific and practical directions  of the laboratory's work were forming and it was financed out of  the budget of the Leningradskoye APO, its activity moved along  quite briskly. But the situation changed after transition to  full cost accounting. Difficulties typical of not just our  enterprise alone came into being. An acute need arose for  increasing production volume and fitting out the laboratory with  highly productive equipment (primarily fermenters of different  capacities), for erecting a separate production building, a  boiler plant and so on, and for solving a number of public  health problems. All of this requires considerable resources!  Realizing the concept of low-volume microbiological production  will doubtlessly require investors.    The problems of supplying laboratories with strains of  industrial microorganisms satisfying all of the requirements of  modern production, and of organizing advanced training courses  for laboratory associates, have not been solved.    There is a problem in keeping personnel employed year-round.  Everyone is busy in spring and summer, but in fall and winter  the few greenhouse complexes are unable to keep our work  profitable. We are looking for things for the people to  do--perhaps producing yeast for food industry, feed additives,  silage leaven for animal husbandry, and biologically produced  humus.    We would be interested in knowing how other collectives are  solving these problems.    COPYRIGHT: "``Kolos'', ``Zashchita Rasteniy'', 1993</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of the Sao Paulo Declaration issued at the end of </F> the Rio Group-EU meeting in Sao Paulo on 22 April and released  by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry on the same day]    [Text] The Fourth Institutional Meeting of Rio Group and EU  Ministers took place in Sao Paulo on 22 and 23 April 1994, in  compliance with the Declaration of Rome dated 20 December 1990.    The foreign relations ministers of the Rio Group and the EU  constructively and openly reviewed the issues that interest them  most.    The ministers confirmed that the two regions share common  cultural traits and political and socioeconomic values and  principles, and agreed on the steps they will take to attain  joint objectives and strengthen mutual relations.    The ministers underscored the scope and depth that the  dialogue between the two regions attained during the past year,  especially at the Copenhagen meeting and at the 48th UN General  Assembly meeting.    Within this framework the ministers approved the following  Declaration of Sao Paulo:  <H5>  Common Principles and Values </H5>   A. The ministers reasserted their governments' commitment to  representative democracy and to the state of law, and their firm  decision to secure full respect for universal human rights and  basic liberties, in keeping with the provisions of international  agreements on human rights. They thus rejected any attempts to  disrupt the democratic and constitutional order and proposed to  coordinate efforts aimed at the strengthening of democracy,  which implies especially the subordination of all sectors to  legally established civilian authority.    B. In keeping with the principles set forth in the  Declaration and Program for Action of the World Conference on  Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993, the minister agreed that  the right to development is part of basic human rights, the  human being is the central subject of development, and the lack  of development cannot be used as an excuse to justify disrespect  for internationally acknowledged human rights.    The ministers also recognized that democracy, respect for  human rights, and development are closely intertwined, and that  they all play an equally important role in the strengthening of  international cooperation and trust.    C. The ministers agreed that sustainable development,  protection of the environment and sustainable exploitation of  natural resources, economic growth, creation of productive jobs,  and a fairer income distribution will encourage full respect for  the principles set forth in this declaration and its effective  implementation.    D. The ministers pledged to help overcome the differences in  the level of social and economic development among the nations,  and agreed to protect social and labor rights in line with the  principles and provisions of the various International Labor  Organization conventions.    E. The ministers state that the strengthening of the norms,  regulations, and institutions governing the Multilateral Trade  System, as well as the removal of stumbling blocks to trade and  the rejection of arbitrary unilateral actions, are at the center  of international trade in accordance with the GATT principles.    F. The ministers condemn without reservation every form of  racism and xenophobia.    G. The ministers reaffirm the key role played by regional  integration in terms of the objective to promote political and  socioeconomic cohesion. This objective also entails the  involvement of all sectors of society in the development process  of each country, with a view to making it more competitive on  the international economic market.    H. The ministers condemn without reservations and labeled as  an unjustifiable crime all kinds of terrorist actions wherever  they are committed by anyone and for whatever reason, because  they endanger and eliminate human lives, offend the dignity of  the human being, and attack democracy and the state of law.    I. The ministers condemn the production of, trafficking in,  and unlawful consumption of drugs, as well as the laundering of  the profits generated by these activities.    J. The ministers agree in stating that cooperation between  the two regions is based on principles of solidarity that are  translated into support for social and regional development,  including objectives such as fighting poverty and protecting  less favored segments of the population, the promotion of  effective democratic systems, and complementary actions in  economic, trade, industrial, scientific, and technological areas  that would be mutually beneficial.    In accordance with these common principles and values, the  ministers agree in stating that the two regions should  strengthen their relations in the future, identifying the  appropriate structures for dialogue and for cooperation as well  as new instruments that would enrich the current framework of  their relations and mutual interest.    To ensure a greater impact and coherence, the ministers  agree  on the need to develop future actions within the framework of a  medium- and long-term strategy. To this end, they commit  themselves to promoting a broad analysis to define the  objectives and guidelines of this strategy.  <H5>  Joint Measures </H5>   Based on the above reasons, the ministers reached the  following agreements:    I. Political Aspects of the United Nations    1. The ministers agree on furthering the dialogue  undertaken within the framework of the United Nations.

The ministers acknowledge the importance of the  Ibero-American Conference, which will hold its fourth summit of  chiefs of state and government in Cartagenas de Indias,  Colombia, on 14 and 15 June.  <H5>  Fight Against Racism and Xenophobia </H5>   4. The ministers agree to do their utmost to fight the signs  of racism and xenophobia -- such as, for example, against  migrant workers and their families -- particularly through  implementation of severe laws and the promotion of intensive  educational campaigns.  <H5>  Terrorism </H5>   5. The ministers agree to intensify cooperation and reach  closer coordination to adopt concrete measures aimed at  eliminating terrorism.  <H5>  Drugs </H5>   6. The ministers commit themselves to implementing overall  solutions to the drug problem, including fighting drug  production, distribution, and illegal consumption, as well as  money laundering. They also commit themselves to adopting  measures preventing smuggling of chemicals and precursors that  can be used in drug production, and to creating alternative  sources of income for the rural producers affected by these  measures. The ministers also admit the need to promote  additional measures to reinforce national programs preventing  drug abuse and promoting rehabilitation.  <H5>  Disarmament and Nonproliferation </H5>   In the field of disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons,  the ministers agree:    A. To immediately urge all countries to renew their  commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of massive  destruction and their launching means in all their aspects.  Within this context the EU ministers welcomed the intention  recently expressed in Latin America to join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT;    B. To defend the preparation of a Nuclear Tests Prohibition  Treaty that will be broad, multilateral, and allow effective  controls;    C. To stress the recent progress attained in the  consolidation of provisions tending to totally prohibit nuclear  weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, as established by  the Tlatelolco Treaty;    D.

The ministers agree on the advisability of carrying out  an  additional high-level meeting between the Rio Group and the EU  on economic and trade matters before the Fifth Institutionalized  Ministerial Meeting is held. The ministers stress that this  specialized forum for permanent talks has proven to be very  useful in exchanging points of views on current events and  subjects of common interest, such as:    A. To study the effects of the Single European Market  [Mercado Unico Europeu], the eventual extension of the EU and  other contractual developments of the EU, as well as the Latin  American regional integration programs and free trade zones.    B. To analyze the effects of the trade measures adopted by  the two regions with the purpose of making joint efforts to  promote trade.    9. The Rio Group ministers reject the unilateral imposition  of political, economic, social, or environmental conditions on  access to markets within the framework of international trade  relations.    10. The ministers stress the importance of the trade  preferences granted by the EU to the Rio Group countries.    The ministers of the Rio Group express their conviction that  the reform of the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] should  maintain and increase its benefits for the Latin American  countries without any kind of conditions or discriminations  based on their social economic development, and it must also  extend its coverage, further deregulate trade, establish rules  of origin with the purpose of promoting trade, and adopt region  cumulative laws for all the Latin American countries.    The EU ministers hereby take into consideration the terms  expressed in this declaration, and express their willingness to  examine them. They recall that the real purpose of the GSP has  been and continues to be the promotion and diversification of  the economies of the developing countries with the purpose of a  more effective integration of the international economy. At the  same time the GSP constitutes on its own an autonomous  instrument subject to adjustment.    11. The ministers promise to adopt the necessary measures  to quickly implement the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round  of GATT talks.    The ministers agree to ensure that the World Trade  Organization will bring more openness and legal efficiency to  trade norms, including the controversy-solving procedures.    The ministers agree on the usefulness of carrying out a  joint  study of the opportunities that will be created following the  agreements reached in the Uruguay Round for the benefit of all  economic agents.    12. The ministers also agree on the significance of the UN  Conference on Multizone Fish Species and Highly Migratory Fish  Species located both inside and outside the exclusive economic  zones.    13. The ministers promise to continue to support the  different efforts to attain regional integration and  cooperation, aimed at the gradual and progressive formation of a  common Latin American market within a context of openness and  dynamic interaction in the international economy.    14. The ministers promise to encourage initiatives that will  increase investments between the two regions. Taking into  account the current dynamics of the flow of investments of the  private sectors of the two regions, the ministers agree to  encourage the signature of additional bilateral agreements  between countries of the Rio Group and the EU to promote and  protect investments and to avoid double taxation, and to adopt  measures to reinforce the protection of intellectual property  rights.    15. With the same purpose, the ministers recognize the  importance for the European Investment Bank to play a more  active role in Latin America. The ministers favor greater  cooperation between the European Investment Bank and other  financial institutions, especially with the Inter-American  Development Bank [IDB] with the purpose of possibly cofinancing  regional projects.    16. The ministers point out the importance of the recent  decision of global recapitalization of the IDB and of increasing  the stock participation of the EU members, as well as  reinforcing the Special Operations Fund.    17. The ministers acknowledge the importance and the great  level of cooperation there is between the two regions, and agree  to make an effort to attain a genuine partnership in the  economic, trade, industrial, scientific, and technological  fields for the benefit of the two regions.    With this purpose, the ministers mainly stress:    A. The intensification of cooperation activities at  regional,  subregional, and bilateral levels;    B. The consolidation of the current activities of the  training programs, the fast implementation of the "FORCE-RIO"  program and the possibility of broadening this kind of  cooperation;    C. The future cooperation in the scientific and  technological  fields to allow the participation of the member countries of the  Rio Group in the Fourth Program-Chart [Programa-Quadro] of  Science and Technology;    D. The fast implementation of the AL-INVEST [expansion  unknown] program and the expeditious implementation of measures  under the ECIP [expansion unknown] program;    E) The importance of the quick implementation of the  Inter-University Cooperation Program (ALFA) so as to intensify,  develop, and expand ties between the academic and scientific  communities of the two regions.    18. The ministers have decided to meet next year in France,  in accordance with the rotation rules.    19. The participants in the Sao Paulo Conference express  their deep thanks to the government of Brazil for its  hospitality and for the excellent organization that has made  possible the success of this conference. They likewise thank  the Brazilian people for the warm welcome they have given to the  delegations.</p>

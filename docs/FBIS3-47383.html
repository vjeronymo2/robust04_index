Wim Deetman, the head of the Dutch delegation, told  reporters  after a meeting with the president that the discussions on the  implementation of human rights in the country were based on the  principle that Indonesia and the Netherlands are sovereign and  independent states.    "Yes", Deetman said when asked whether the two countries had  different views on the implementation of human rights.    Commenting on Indonesia's decision to reject Dutch aid in  1992 after the Netherlands' announced suspension of assistance  to Indonesia in protest of November 12, 1991 incident in Dili,  capital of East Timor, he said, "That's the fact."    The Indonesian Government has since then refused Dutch aid  on  the grounds that The Hague had intervened in the country's  internal affairs. Indonesia considered a Dutch-sponsored  financial consortium a tool to intimidate Indonesia on human  rights questions.    Meanwhile, House Speaker Wahono told reporters after  accompanying the Dutch legislators during the meeting with the  president that the Netherlands remained to respect Indonesia as  a sovereign and independent state despite the different views on  the implementation of human rights.    They (Dutch legislators) are aware that the implementation  of  human rights depends on a number of things, such as the history  and background of the nation," he said.    The head of state and Dutch legislators also discussed a  possibility of using Rotterdam to serve as a gateway for  Indonesian export commodities to Europe.</p>

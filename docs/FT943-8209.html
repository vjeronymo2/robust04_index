			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Mercury World assets slip Managers of Mercury World Mining Trust were unable to keep pace with a rapidly-advancing mining share market in the period between December 15 and June 30. Net asset value per share fell by 3.85 per cent, from 97.2p to 93.6p. However, the investment trust said yesterday it was now fully invested. At the close on August 15 net asset value had increased to 100.75p. The trust raised Pounds 425.8m last December - the largest investment trust launch in the UK. Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, chairman, said the shares had 'traded at a level which has compared favourably both with the issue price and with the net asset value'. The shares, which reached a peak of 125p earlier this year, were last night unchanged at 107p. Recently the performance of shares in the natural resources sector had been restrained by more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of share offerings by mining and metals companies taking advantage of improved sentiment. Net revenue for the period from October 28 to June 30 was Pounds 2.12m on income of Pounds 6.34m. Earnings per share were 0.5p.</p>

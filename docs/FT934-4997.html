			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The housewife Pat Sanders, 52 Has grown-up sons, aged 31 and 26. She and her husband, Barry, a senior executive for Rentokil, the household services group, recently moved from Selby to Copthorne, West Sussex. Her views are coloured by the fact that her children are setting up home. Politics: last election voted Conservative. Suggested: 'Why doesn't he impose a departure tax for tourists leaving the country? It would raise millions and to people spending hundreds of pounds on a holiday a pounds 10 tax would barely make a difference.' Proved right: 'When I heard him announce the flights levy I was thrilled to bits. I couldn't believe it. I think with the cost you pay for air fares, pounds 5 or pounds 10 is negligible. I think it's a very subtle budget. It affects everybody but not as badly as I think a lot of people expected. He didn't really flesh a lot of it out.'</p>

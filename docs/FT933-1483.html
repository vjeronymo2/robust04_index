			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wind of change hits Cuban agriculture - This year's storms have brought tentative reform in their wake THE CUBAN government is reorganising its agriculture in an effort to lift production of domestic crops and end chronic shortages, as well as to strengthen the weakened sugar sector, on which the island's economy is heavily dependent. Cuban agriculture has been hit hard by a reduction in the availability of inputs because the economy is strapped for hard currency to finance imports. This has been compounded by two bouts of bad weather earlier this year that led to flooded fields and heavy crop losses. The government's new strategy is based on allowing increased private participation in agriculture, with the establishment of new co-operative and individually-run farms. But these will still operate within the framework of a centrally-controlled economy. It has also announced that the impending sugar harvest will start earlier than normal, and will be shortened, to allow cane farms more time to plant for future harvests, and to give the industry a chance to recover from the lack of chemicals and machinery and the effects of the bad weather. A freak storm in March, which brought high winds and heavy rain, flattened and flooded thousands of acres of canes and reduced the sugar content of the plants that could be reaped. It also destroyed and blocked roads in farming areas and damaged several of the country's 157 sugar mills. Cuba's citrus industry also suffered, as did potato and fruit growers. The cost of the storms to the economy, including damage to roads, buildings and agriculture, was put by international aid agencies at between USDollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn. In early June the island's agriculture was again hit by heavy rains brought by a tropical depression. In the wake of shortages of locally-produced food caused by the bad weather, the Cuban government has said it will give some degree of administrative and financial independence to the new co-operative and individual farmers, who are being given state-owned land. The intention, said the government, was to increase the output of a range of agricultural products, including sugar, by giving farm workers an incentive to produce. Their earnings will be determined by the productivity of the co-operatives. The new co-operative farms will continue to be supervised by the state while exercising autonomy in day-to-day management. They will work the land for an indefinite period, will own and dispose of what they produce, and will have their own bank accounts. The changes, which the government says are 'innovative', are coming seven years after the sudden termination of another programme to encourage private farming and marketing of domestic food crops. The government said then that some private peasant farmers and distributors had become corrupt and too rich at the expense of consumers. This year's bad weather compounded already serious problems for the sugar industry. Mills had been running about 25 per cent behind target at the end of February, mainly because of the government's inability to import adequate fuel and replacement parts. Cane production and milling had also been set back by shortages of chemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides, and spares and fuel for harvesters, trucks and tractors. The faltering economy has been dealt a body blow by the failure of this year's harvest. Production was 4.15m tonnes, 40 per cent less than last year and half the level reached in better years. The government was forced to cancel shipments to some buyers, further reducing foreign earnings. The government is basing its plans for a recovery on growing more cane, and is apparently expecting another poor harvest next year. Mr Nelson Torres, the sugar minister, has said the next harvest will begin and end early, making way for increased cultivation 'in order to have a much greater volume of cane for the next harvests'. The minister has exhorted workers in the sugar industry to be more efficient, and said the government was hoping that the next harvest would be bigger than the last. Analysts have said that the volume of cane that Cuba will produce for the next harvest, and the state of the mills, indicated higher output next year, but not more than 5.2m tonnes.</p>

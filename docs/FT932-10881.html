			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Market depressed by state of the economy Wall Street US STOCK prices traded in a narrow range yesterday as concern about the state of the economy depressed market sentiment and kept many investors on the sidelines, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.91 at 3,449.10, having spent all day no more than a few points either side of Tuesday's closing values. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended up 0.47 at 444.52, while the Amex composite finished 1.13 firmer at 425.89, and the Nasdaq composite up 5.10 at 680.26. Trading volume on the NYSE was 272m shares, and rises out numbered declines by 1096 to 769. Economic concerns continued to overhang the markets. In spite of Tuesday's stronger car sales, the bulk of the recent data has painted a picture of an economy slowing down from the high rates of growth achieved at the end of 1992. Yesterday's economic news came from the Federal Reserve, which released its "Beige Book' report on the economy. It stated that there had been a modest improvement in economic conditions recently, and that retail prices had remained stable. There was little reaction to the report, primarily because attention was focused on tomorrow's April employment figures, which will give the most recent reading on condi tions in the all-important labour market. Dealers and investors were also keeping a close eye on developments in the bond market, where prices traded erratically after the Treasury, as expected, announced plans to change the mix of the government debt. In future, the Treasury will sell 30-year bonds only twice, instead of four times, a year. The difference will be made up with bigger sales of shorter-dated govenment securities. Cable television stocks, which jumped sharply on Tues day in the hope that new federal regulations on the industry would not be as tough as originally feared, fell yesterday amid profit-taking and after a leading brokerage house, Gold man Sachs, made negative comments about the sector. Time Warner fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/8 in volume of 1.9m shares, Cablevision dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 30 3/4 and on the Nasdaq market, Tele-Communications fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 and Comcast slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 19 3/8 . ITT rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 3/4 on the news that it has entered an agreement to sell its Dollars 2bn port folio of consumer loans to an investment group led by Gold man Sachs. The purchase price of the deal was not revealed. Airline groups AMR fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 67 3/8 and UAL dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 133 1/2 after an analyst at Salomon Brothers downgraded his ratings on the two stocks. On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/8 after the company won an Dollars 80m global services con tract from banking group JP Morgan. Canada TORONTO shrugged off early losses and a sell-off in New York to post moderate gains in heavy trade. The TSE-300 closed up 7.64 points to 3,786.81 on turnover of 58.54m valued at CDollars 595.84m. Advances led declines 373 to 328. The Consumer products and communications sectors gained favour as investors move to expand portfolios. Consumer products were up 67.36 or 1.04 per cent, to 6,521.47.</p>

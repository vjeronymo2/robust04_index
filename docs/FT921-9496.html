			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / SNC move on Bangkok Skytrain project SNC, Canada's biggest engineering group, with Japanese, German and Thai partners, will finally move ahead on the Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.37bn) Bangkok Skytrain transport project. SNC will be a small equity partner in the Skytrain consortium and provide design and engineering services worth nearly Dollars 500m. Bombardier will build the hardware based on Vancouver's Skytrain. The 40km Bangkok system, due in operation in 1997, will have 37 stations, and some preparatory work has already been done. The cost has risen more than Dollars 500m since the original bid in 1988. Since then the Thai government has changed and Lavalin, the original Canadian consortium member, went bankrupt.</p>

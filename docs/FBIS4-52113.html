			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has agreed to meet US  President Bill Clinton at the White House on May 6, Foreign  Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Wednesday.    The meeting, the first at official level between the two  leaders will take place at 2.45 p.m. (2.45 a.m. May 7 Malaysian  Time), he told reporters here.    The prime minister will be accompanied by the Malaysian  Ambassador in Washington D.C. Abdul Majid Mohamed to the  bilateral talks, Abdullah said, adding that Dr. Mahathir will be  in the US from May 5 on a private visit.    I see this meeting as very important for US-Malaysia  relations, and also due to the fact that the US is our third  largest trading partner and the biggest investor in Malaysia, he  said.    The embassy in Washington was making the necessary  arrangements for the meeting, reported to be at the invitation  of President Clinton.    However, the agenda for the meeting was not available.  Abdullah said he had yet to be informed on the details [words  indistinct] expected international issues like the conflict in  Bosnia and economic matters would be discussed during the  meeting. Malaysia has been playing an active role on the Bosnian  issue.    The White House invitation to Dr. Mahathir was disclosed by  its assistant secretary of state for Far East and the Pacific  Affairs Winston Lord during a Worldnet Dialogue, a satellite  news conference, organised in conjunction with the US-ASEAN  dialogue scheduled for two days from May 9.    Lord said that Washington was keeping an open mind on the  Malaysia-initiated East Asia Economic Caucus, EAEC, so long as  the concept did not sideline the US.    He said Clinton sent an invitation letter to Dr. Mahathir  for  the meeting at the White House.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Rumours surface of jumbo Swedish issue RUMOURS about a further jumbo borrowing by the Kingdom of Sweden, this time in US dollars, dominated the international bond market yesterday. The talk is that the next stage of the country's borrowing programme could be for up to Dollars 2bn over five years under a global programme, at a spread of between 50 and 60 basis points over comparable US Treasury bonds. 'It's a question of when rather than if,' said one banker. 'But you could say the same of several sovereigns.' Rarity was a key word among the new issues which emerged. The quality-sensitive Swiss market is pausing to catch its breath after the recent volume of paper, particularly in private placements, but quality remains in demand. Lead-manager UBS described BMW Finance, which is raising SFr150m through an eight-year public issue, as an attractive name with scarcity value with particular appeal to retail investors. Other banks said the issue was more aggressively priced than the quality merits, although the rarity value helped it trade within fees in the grey market. Also described as having rarity value was the Fl 300m eight-year issue from Akzo, the Dutch chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, which has been absent from the market for several years. Led by Rabobank Nederland, the first Euro-style guilders issue for almost a month was rapidly increased from Fl 250m at launch, reflecting a general shortage of longer term new issue paper. Some traders were slightly surprised at the DM100m 10-year reverse floating-rate note for Deutsche Genossenschafts Hypothekenbank. They would expect such transactions to be for smaller amounts and to be done privately rather than publicly because they are normally targetted to specific investors. The interest rate will be fixed at 10 per cent for the first two years, and thereafter at 21 per cent minus twice six-month Libor. High interest rates, exchange controls and EMS turmoil are among obstacles hindering significant expansion of the Spanish fixed income market, though it shows promise, Standard &amp; Poor's writes in its weekly newsletter, Reuter reports.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Call for day off to beat rail strike COMPANIES should work out which jobs employees could do from home on Friday or give them the day off because of the threatened national rail strike, the Institute of Management said yesterday . Staying at home 'would be better than sitting in a traffic jam for three hours, arriving at the office in a stinking mood and then having to leave after a couple of hours', the institute said. Not everyone could work from home, the institute said, 'but you can do a fair amount of work or catch up on reading and correspondence'. The one-day strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union is over threatened compulsory British Rail redundancies and the use of outside contractors. In a separate dispute, many London buses will also be off the road on Friday. Bus staff are protesting, in their third day of action, over wage cuts and longer working hours. The rail and the bus strikes coincide with a one-day strike by the National Union of Mineworkers over pit closures. The Institute of Management's advice to employers to draw up contingency plans appeared yesterday to be largely unnecessary, and there was little enthusiasm for the idea of a day's holiday for staff, or working from home. The banks did not expect to have to close any branches: Midland, for example, will provide coaches for its staff. Legal &amp; General is also laying on coaches, and groups of employees are arranging to share cars. Workers at local BT centres could find themselves distracted from their duties by extra bodies - staff unable to reach their workplace are supposed to report to their nearest office. BT admitted it was usually difficult to find volunteers anything to do for the day.</p>

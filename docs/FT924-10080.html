			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Observer: Can of beans Alexandra, aka Heidi, Sprungli is back. The new 44-year-old wife of the 72-year-old Swiss chocolate king Rudolph Sprungli was on Swiss television last weekend to deny some of the more colourful allegations about her past. The August marriage inspired the Swiss media subsequently to publish a flurry of photographs and testimonials suggesting that the career of the new Mrs Sprungli had ranged rather more broadly than merely waitressing, inheriting a large sum of money after marrying an older man who died within 18 months of their wedding, and being a member of the obscure religious sect, I AM. Little had been heard from the happy couple themselves post the nuptials, but now the chocolate pot has taken another stir. Looking like a sergeant in the Salvation Army with virtually no make-up and her dark hair pulled tightly back in a bun, Alexandra/Heidi nearly denied the allegations: 'If you took all the things said about me and added them all up, only about 5 per cent is true.' The incriminating photographs of her in bra and suspender belt were montages, she said, with her head on someone else's body. Shareholders of Lindt &amp; Sprungli, who may have worried about reports that the new Mrs Sprungli would take over management of the company can rest reassured. 'My second wife will certainly not become president of the company,' said her perfectly attentive new husband.</p>

Press statement issued by the General Committee:    The General Committee held a meeting yesterday under the  chairmanship of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of  the General People's Congress [GPC]. The General Committee  discussed a number of topics on its agenda and the current  developments, particularly the results of the signing in Amman  of the pledge and accord document as well as the serious  deterioration which preceded, coincided with, and followed the  signing. This deterioration has threatened, from the first  moment, the implementation of the document and aimed at emptying  it of its national content on which all political forces were  unanimous to tackle the exacerbating situation, At the top of  this are the irresponsible acts, which are contrary to the  contents of the document on the political, media, military, and  diplomatic levels.    In light of this, the General Committee reiterated the clear  principled stand of the GPC vis-a-vis the pledge and accord  document as well as the responsibility of all parties,  particularly the government coalition and the Political Forces  Dialogue Committee, to fulfill the commitments included in the  document. These commitments are represented by the urgent  tackling of the situation, basic steps, and resolutions and  stands that must be embarked on by the constitutional  institutions within the framework of their tasks, powers, and  obligations defined by the pledge and accord document as well as  by the responsibilities that must be shouldered by the Political  Forces Dialogue Committee to implement the document on the fixed  dates.    The General Committee also condemns all acts that aim at  weaseling out of this responsibility as well as the deception  which hides nonnational objectives and which reveals intentions  not to implement the accord. The General Committee also  denounces the reckless acts regrettably carried out by the  leaders who are dominating the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] to  escalate anew the existing crisis, to kill innocent citizens and  the sons of the Armed Forces and security, as what happened in  the Abyan Governorate, and to embark on unjust acts that  threaten the homeland today and in the future, its national  sovereignty, security, and stability. These acts expose the  hidden and rancorous intentions against the people, their unity,  their freedom, and democracy. These acts have been blatantly  exposed on the internal and external levels.    The General Committee reiterated the need to work wisely and  with responsibility to foil these acts and to champion the  principled constants in which the people believe and to which  all sons of the homeland are committed. The General Committee  reiterated the need to work in particular toward protecting the  pledge and accord document and mobilizing popular and official  efforts to implement this accord, which came to reinforce the  victory of unity and democracy and to deepen the option of true  democracy which was highlighted by our lofty and steadfast  people through their free will on 27 April last year being the  source of the work of the branches of power and the maker of all  gains and achievements.    The General Committee greeted the Hashemite Kingdom of  Jordan  -- king, government, and people -- for the great efforts it made  to contain and tackle the crisis in our country and to sign the  pledge and accord document being an important national  achievement that will entrench the march of unity and stability  in the homeland.    The General Committee also expressed its appreciation for  all  ongoing efforts made by the sisterly and friendly states in this  direction.    The General Committee appealed to all members of the GPC and  all citizens in all governorates to exercise full vigilance  toward everthing that aims at encroaching on the homeland's  unity, security, and stability and at threatening the existence  of the state and its constitutional institutions. The General  Committee appealed to all to remain united to protect and  safeguard constitutional legitimacy and to support the  implementation of the pledge and accord document each in his  position.    The GPC will continue its work and struggle with all the  country's good people and their political, social, and popular  forces to safeguard unity and Yemen's existence and future  through work, production, freedom, and democracy.</p>

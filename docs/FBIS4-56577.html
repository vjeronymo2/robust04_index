			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the Chamber of Deputies has taken  some new steps to disentangle the situation. Frantz Robert Monde  wrote to the U.S. President and the UN secretary general asking  them to try to convince President Aristide to nominate a new  prime minister in Haiti. It is the latest attempt at mediation  from the president of the Lower Chamber, who indicates in his  letter that any failure of this initiative would lead the  parliament to fill the state vacuum. Here is a summary of the  letters of President Monde to U.S. President Bill Clinton and to  the UN secretary general, with Clarence Renois:    [Begin Renois recording] It is a new approach by the  president of the Chamber of Deputies. Frantz Robert Monde  specifically addressed the president of the United States. He  began by criticizing the attitude of the Democratic congressmen  of the Black Caucus who, according to him, desire a solution to  the Haitian crisis, even if it involves weapons and genocide.  The president of the Chamber of Deputies also deplored to the  U.S. president the behavior of President Aristide who, according  to him, is trying to provoke an upheaval among the officers of  the Haitian Armed Forces, and who stubbornly refuses to nominate  a new prime minister because it would favor the application of  the legislators' plan.    Frantz Robert Monde, in writing, called on President  Clinton's wisdom and clear-mindedness avoid the influence of the  Black Caucus Democrats who, he says, are exploiting Haiti's  crisis to pursue and defend their own interests. Frantz Robert  Monde also pleaded with the president of the United States in  favor of a national solution to the Haitian crisis. Only  negotiations among Haitians, and the unemotional support of the  international community can save what can still be saved in  Haiti.    The president of the Chamber also addressed the UN secretary  general, soliciting his support in prompting Jean-Bertrand  Aristide to nominate a prime minister. I call on your humanism  and your high sense of morality, writes Frantz Robert Monde, who  foresees, and I quote: If the United States does not succeed in  convincing the president-in-exile to fill the political vacuum,  the parliament will be left with a last resort, recognizing the  persistent refusal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to obey  the Constitution's provisions.    Following the consultations in Port-au-Prince, here is now  the president of the Chamber of Deputies involving himself in a  new approach, this time with the international community,  specifically the world's highest authorities in order to find a  solution to the crisis. It is only after consultations with U.S.  President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  that Frantz Robert Monde will consider applying the articles of  the Constitution to emerge from the political deadlock.

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The Property Market: A mild sense of relief - Vanessa Houlder on whether history will repeat itself Few sectors promised to benefit more from the UK's decision to enter the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in October 1990 than commercial property, which held out hopes of interest rate cuts and more inward investment. After a disappointing two years though, sterling's suspension this week from the ERM has been greeted by the property sector with relief - tempered by astonishment and concern at the wild gyrations in government economic policy. The reasons for this relief stem from the reversal of Wednesday's interest rate rise to 15 per cent; tenants, investors and overborrowed companies gratefully applauded the step-down. In some quarters, encouragement was also drawn from the damage inflicted on the government's policy of taking sterling into the ERM at an overvalued rate against the D-Mark and high real interest rates. Any resulting boost to the economy will ultimately reduce the oversupply of space, the property sector's most fundamental problem. Perhaps the biggest question mark hangs over prospects for inflation; it was inflation which helped to lift the indebted property sector out of the slump of the early 1970s; this was because of lower real interest rates and the role of property as a traditional hedge against inflation. But not everyone believes that history will repeat itself. The deflation gripping the economy is very different from the economic climate that prevailed in 1967 - the time of the last devaluation - and 1976. Moreover, even if retail price inflation takes off, it is not clear that asset values will follow. In the view of Mr Robert Fowlds of Kleinwort Benson Securities, property values will only rise in response to a weight of money moving into the sector. This, he thinks, is unlikely given that institutions are no longer restricted by exchange controls. Falling interest and exchange rates in the US have done little to halt asset deflation, he says. Even the idea that inflation is good for property is challenged. 'If the result of devaluation is to lift inflation, we are back to the stop-go policies that are unhelpful to property,' says Mr Peter Evans of Debenham Tewson Research. 'What the property market needs is steady economic growth.'</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: Abu Dhabi remains bitter over closure ABU DHABI, the majority shareholder in BCCI, said last night it agreed with Lord Justice Bingham that the Bank of England's supervisory role had been deficient, but defended itself from criticism of its role in the BCCI debacle. In a carefully worded statement, Abu Dhabi said: 'The majority shareholders are surprised that, as the principal driving force behind efforts to uncover the fraud in BCCI and then to restructure the bank so that it could operate on a sound and proper legal basis, they have been the subject of criticism . . . particularly in the light of their reliance on the regulation of the bank by the Bank of England, and on the audit reports issued by Price Waterhouse.' Privately, Abu Dhabi officials were making it clear that they remain bitter about the way BCCI was closed by the Bank after restructuring negotiations had reached an advanced stage. They admit that Abu Dhabi had been told in April 1990 by Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of BCCI, that deposits belonging to Sheikh Zayed al Nayan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, had been misappropriated, but say that this did not constitute a reliable statement. They argue that Mr Naqvi, currently detained in Abu Dhabi along with 17 other former BCCI executives, had previously shown himself to be an unreliable witness, and that his information had been provided verbally and not written. In their evidence to the Bingham inquiry, Abu Dhabi and its solicitors, Simmons &amp; Simmons, have argued that there is no evidence that the Bank would have behaved differently if it had received details of the Naqvi interview. They also cited the pressure the Emirate faced during the Gulf war as a reason for the alleged lack of communication with the regulatory authorities. In recent weeks British Foreign Office officials have been working behind the scenes to offset any potential diplomatic fall-out from the Bingham report. But the strength of criticism contained in the report could have a negative impact on crucial defence contracts that the UK is hoping to sign with Abu Dhabi. UK government officials also hold private fears that a diplomatic row could erupt as a result of the report. Some Abu Dhabi officials claim their reputation has been impugned by its contents.</p>

App. 10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury Department, 15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, on February 1 and 2, 1994, of the following debt management advisory committee: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Public Securities Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on February 1, followed by a charge by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working session. On February 2, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on February 1 and will be open to the public. The remaining sessions on February 1 and the committee's reporting session on February 2 will be closed to the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. 10(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C. App. 10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101&hyph;05, that the closed portions of the meeting are concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest requires that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice from representatives of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations. Historically, this advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major segments of the financial community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee under 5 U.S.C. App. 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption covered by 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance is responsible for maintaining records of debt management advisory committee meetings and for providing annual reports setting forth a summary of committee activities and such other matters as may be informative to the public consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. 552b. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 11, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Frank N.

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Fashion: High life, low life, smocks and frocks - Dressing for the Professions, The Artist / It's a dirty business but there is still room for that individual touch IN THE world of the cartoonist, all artists wear goatee beards, smocks and berets and balance a palette on their hands. While the image is readily applicable to 19th century painters such as Honore Daumier, most of today's practitioners would consider such a stereotype to be a ludicrous misrepresentation of their trade. But allow yourself some artistic license. Adapt this visual metaphor to the present day and you will find that it is still relevant to many. Oil painting is a dirty business and people who do it cover up their everyday clothes so as not to soil them. They may choose denim overalls instead of smocks but the principle is the same. Similarly, artists tend to express their individuality through sartorial choices which are often equivalent to our caricature's facial hair and beret. Whether dressing for work in their studios or for their latest private view, artists can usually be divided between 'high lifers' and 'low lifers.' While dandies such as Cecil Beacon upheld tradition and opted for a lavender smock and matching paint rag, Francis Bacon threw on any old scruffy clothes for painting and wiped his hands on the curtains of his room. Leonardo da Vinci distinguished himself from less creative peers in Renaissance Italy by growing a very long beard. Arch self-publicist Salvador Dali opted for the waxed moustache and cape of a circus conjurer. Andy Warhol's trademarks were his silver wig, Raybans and Levi's 'blue jeans.' David Hockney wears odd socks and mismatches the colours of his hearing aids, while Gilbert and George pose as extraterrestrials in badly-fitting demob suits. Patrick Procktor serves as an ideal case study of the contemporary artist. Standing 6 ft 7 in tall with a lived-in face and foppish manner, he straddles the divide between high and low life types. Like other epicureans of a certain age, the 1960s loom large in his psyche: he has a penchant for necklaces, picked up in the Far East, and paints in an Egyptian kaftan. 'I wear either my kaftan or a baggy, striped painting jacket by (British designer) Paul Smith,' he says. 'They are both loose and comfortable as one does not want to be straitjacketed. I had a beautiful smock in the sixties with embroidered violets on the pocket, but its essence was to get paint on.' Procktor recalls that, while at The Slade Institute in London, fellow student Don McCardy, the Californian lifelong friend of Christopher Isherwood, the British novelist, painted in crisp, white shirts with scarlet sleeve garters to keep his cuffs up. 'All eyes were out on stalks,' says Procktor. 'Few of us had washing machines and most of us worked in jeans so thick with paint they could stand up in the corner.' On the opening night of his exhibitions at the Redfern Gallery in London ('a living nightmare'), Procktor wears black tie to greet chums, clients and critics. 'I have never yet worn tails but it is tempting,' he says, adding: 'I also tell my mother not to wear colour as it detracts from the walls.' He chose monochrome again for a recent appearance in court on a drink-driving charge. 'I wore a black pinstripe suit and black shirt, like a Soho crack dealer,' he says. 'Many artists are frustrated actors. There is a self portrait by Walter Sickert in the Garrick club in London in which he is wearing riding breeches and pink frock coat even though he never hunted. Blurring divisions between formality and informality is a recurring theme in fashion which amuses me.' Emily Patrick is another artist with a heightened sense of theatricality. Born to an eccentric farmer who designed dresses for his wife and two daughters, Patrick has inherited a love of Bohemian frocks which she makes herself from curtain chintz bought at Peter Jones' home furnishings department in the Sloane Square store. These come out for her private views at Agnews and reveal a stubborn resistance to modernity akin to that of the traditional Old Bond Street gallery. A touch stiff and heavy perhaps, they are nevertheless dexterously cut in pretty styles which merge Thai influences with those of folkish, eastern European national costume. 'I loathe fashion but adore clothes,' she says. 'Fashion aims to make everyone look the same. I prefer gentle tones to brash colours and prefer brocade bodices and full skirts to today's shapeless grunge and awful executive suits.' When Patrick was commissioned to paint a portrait of the Princess of Wales, she was in a quandary about what to have her sitter wear. She scrutinised photographs of Diana attending functions in a multitude of garish suits and, after much deliberation, asked her to pose in a delicate, floral shirt by Laura Ashley and an innocuous skirt. 'Clothes are vital to portraits,' she says. 'Toulouse Lautrec relied on costumes to form compositions while Pablo Picasso kept clothes simple to create a timelessness in his figurative work.' Patrick wore her usual painting clothes for six one-hour sessions with Princess Diana at Kensington Palace. She works in mole skin knickerbockers and country cardigans, chosen for comfort rather than protection; she is a tidy worker and credits this to the fact she is a woman and a Cambridge architecture graduate, unused to slopping about in art school studios. 'I wear breeches to sit astride my easel as I like to feel free and nimble,' she says, adopting the position of a cellist. 'I don't make a mess.' The strange thing about artists is that, although no two are ever remotely similar, they are nearly always instantly recogniseable as artists. Pop artist Jo Tillson attributes this paradox to facial expressions. 'I just need to look into someone's eyes to know whether or not they are artistic,' he claims. The other physical factor uniting the breed has to be public displays of sartorial individuality and recognition of the need to dress practically for work. Then again, when asked to comment on Daumier's smock and Procktor's kaftan, Patrick raised her eyebrows incredulously. 'I wouldn't wear either,' she said. 'Long, full sleeves would drag on the paint.'</p>

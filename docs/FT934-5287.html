			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils under pressure Another torrid session in the crude oil market, which saw Brent crude slip below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark at one point, triggered yet another bout of heavy selling pressure in an already bruised oil sector. Oil shares were the market's weakest performers last week after Opec surprised the market by holding its overall production level at 24.5m barrels a day. There had been hopes that Opec would cut output by around 2m barrels a day to try to stem the weakness in oil prices. And there were fears in international oil markets yesterday that Iraq may be permitted to resume oil sales in the middle of 1994, putting further pressure on Opec output quotas and prices. Yesterday, it was the oil majors rather than the exploration stocks that were roughly handled by the market, with US holders said to have continued to sell stocks such as BP and Shell aggressively amid talk of downgraded oil price and earnings forecasts. Shell dropped 12 1/2 to 665 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 6.5m, with the market additionally upset by reports that Gencor's purchase of Billiton, Shell's minerals and mining subsidiary, may have run into trouble. BP, which bore the brunt of some big downside pressure from the US late in the session, lost 7 more to 325 1/2 p in a large turnover of 13m. The exploration and production sub-sector outperformed the senior oil index, but nevertheless looked set to come under renewed fire. Lasmo, beset by worries about the dividend, eased further to 116p on 5.4m volume. Enterprise dipped 4 to 433p on 2.3m traded and Hardy fell 13 1/2 to 143 1/2 p. GEC, the flagship of the UK's electronics and heavy electrical industry, was one of the worst performers among the Footsie constituents as the market became increasingly nervous ahead of the group's interim figures tomorrow. Some fairly aggressive selling pressure saw the shares close 4 off at 333p on turnover of 8.1m, the fifth most heavily traded stock in the market. One close follower of the company described it as 'almost a utility but without the yield and dividend cover of most', and said the market had been slightly spooked by worries about difficult trading conditions which could provoke a series of profits downgrades of full year estimates. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo saw its shares rise 16 to 671p ahead of a key presentation on research and development this morning. There was also active business in traded options. Glaxo last held an R&amp;D presentation two years ago. Since then the group has launched three products, and now that they are in the market, pharmaceuticals experts will be looking for new developments to combat erosion of market share in Zantac, the anti-ulcer product which accounts for around 44 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. A return of speculation over the future of the stake held by Rank Organisation in Rank Xerox underpinned a rise in the shares in a firm leisure sector. Rumours of the sale by Rank to its venture partner Xerox have been in the market for some months, but were given fresh impetus at the weekend in an interview with the Rank chief executive. The sale of the Xerox stake could raise up to Pounds 1.5bn and effectively wipe out Rank's debts. However, while leisure specialists accept that the issue is on the agenda, most believe it is still some years off. Rank shares were up 7 at 883p, after touching 897p. Troubled theme park group Euro Disney rallied 10 to 360p on speculative buying. Stories swirling around the stock continue to suggest some imminent moves by the bank creditors to take a more forceful role in the company's financial restructuring. Optimism over the likely effect of today's Budget on consumer spending impacted favourably across consumer-related stocks. In the drinks sector, shares were marked higher on additional hopes that the chancellor would not come down too heavily on excise duty. Among the main beneficiaries, Scottish &amp; Newcastle added 10 at 492p, Bass - reporting results tomorrow - 14 at 493p, Grand Metropolitan - with figures due Thursday - 19 at 409p and Greenalls Group 10 at 381p. Merrydown was a notable omission, slipping 8 to 210p on disappointment at the group's dividend. Stores were buoyant. Boots rose 10 to 544p, Dixons 7 to 265p, WH Smith 'A' 20 to 485p, helped by a BZW buy note, Next 11 to 199p and Kingfisher 12 to 679p. Bank shares made rapid progress, as did life and composite insurers as financial sector specialists remained convinced there will be no big changes affecting life policies and pensions in the Budget. Barclays, up 13 at 569p, led the banks higher, while Prudential jumped 7 1/2 to 357 1/2 p, spearheading the life sector. Westland Group advanced 9 to 235p as vague takeover talk pointed to GKN. The latter's shares put on 7 at 491p. AAF Industries jumped 11 to 49p after announcing an Pounds 18.4m deal. BBA Group retreated 11 to 178p on reports of a downgrading from Cazenove.

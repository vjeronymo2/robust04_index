			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Six people were arrested at Boston's Logan International Airport after an  argument aboard a Continental Airlines flight from Newark, N.J., escalated into  a fistfight in the aisles minutes before landing, police said. The pilot of  Continental Flight 358 had to pull the DC-9 out of its landing pattern and  circle the airport until the combatants returned to their seats. The fight,  between a New Jersey couple and a Medford, Mass., family, resumed as the plane  taxied to the gate around 5 p.m., officials said. State Trooper James Deyermond  said police were unsure what provoked the argument. The suspects will face a  variety of charges on arraignment Monday, including interfering with a flight  crew, disorderly conduct and assaulting police officers at the gate. The New  Jersey couple were released on $150 bond and the Medford family members were  released on personal recognizance.  </P></p>

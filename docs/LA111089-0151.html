			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> JAIL TAX: Blaming voters' rejection of the transportation tax on the lack of a  visible, well-known leader, Sheriff Brad Gates said Thursday that he plans to  be out front next year when Orange County considers a half-cent sales tax  increase to pay for a new jail. . . . Gates thinks voters will approve a tax  raise when he lines up police chiefs and judges to support efforts to add  Juvenile Hall space, expand the courthouse and build a jail in Gypsum Canyon. .  . . And Gates is putting his political money where his mouth is: He'll be on  the same ballot, running for reelection. Dana Parsons  </P></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Coffee to cost more - At a Glance Soaring prices on the coffee futures market this week will leave consumers paying more for their supermarket purchases of instant unless the market quickly collapses. The coffee futures price at the London Commodity Exchange has risen by over 150 per cent this year from Dollars 1,198 a tonne in January to break through Dollars 3,000 a tonne this week. On Monday, prices hit a 7 1/2 year high, after frost damage in Brazil. The market is expected to remain strong at least for the next six weeks, while the Brazilian crop is particularly vulnerable before the harvest. Over the longer term, the coffee market is buoyed by rising demand and a slip in production as a result of extremely low prices in the past couple of years.</p>

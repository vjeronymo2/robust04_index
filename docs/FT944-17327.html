			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead MONDAY: George Simpson presents his first results at Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace component supplier, since his arrival from Rover to take over as chief executive. The revival of automotive business suggests 1993-94 pre-tax profits of around Pounds 60m -Pounds 80m against Pounds 50.3m last time, with total dividends maintained at 7p. But provisions could amount to Pounds 100m as Simpson takes Lucas into another round of cutting costs - including the possibility of job cuts and plant closures - and rationalising the product range. MONDAY: Scottish Television's pre-tax profits are expected to have risen from Pounds 3.13m to Pounds 3.9m in the first half, but advertising revenues could be weak. Analysts will look for a response to this week's disclosure that Mirror Group Newspapers has increased its stake from 15 to 20 per cent. TUESDAY: St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, is forecast to announce a rise in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 22.1m to roughly Pounds 25m. Magazine and book printing should show some recovery, but there are concerns that large customers may try to lower printing costs to counter higher paper prices. WEDNESDAY: Lloyds Chemists, which runs the UK's second-largest chain after Boots, is expected to announce annual pre-tax profits of around Pounds 56m. The City is also looking forward to a sharp increase in the total dividend, possibly to more than 9.5p. WEDNESDAY: Gardner Merchant, the largest contract caterer in Europe, announces its interim results. But plans to float the group appear unlikely to go ahead until next spring. Last year the group, bought by the management from Forte for Pounds 402m at the end of 1992, made annual profits of Pounds 46.9m on Pounds 1bn turnover. THURSDAY: Body Shop International, the UK-based natural cosmetics retailer, will attempt to forget a summer of criticism over its ethical credentials and focus attention on its trading prospects as it announces interim results. Analysts are looking for a healthy increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10m to about Pounds 11.5m. Total sales are forecast to have increased 15 per cent, with those in the US about 30 per cent ahead.</p>

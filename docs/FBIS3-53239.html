Expressing deep concern at the recent  events there, an External Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New  Delhi this has resulted in heavy loss of life and destruction.  He called upon the international community and the countries of  the region in particular to urgently address the political and  security situation in Afghanistan. Reiterating New Delhi's  strong support to the unity, integrity, and independence of  Afghanistan, he said India is willing to contribute to any such  initiative.

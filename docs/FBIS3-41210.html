			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Smugglers' Fiasco"] </F>   [Text] Igor Parashchak, head of the Lvov Oblast Ukrainian  Security Service [SBU] press center, said that for the first  time ever, two individuals, both Lvov residents, were detained  on the border between Ukraine and Russia attempting to smuggle  almost 30 kg of narcotic poppy straw. Their plans were foiled  by agents from the Lvov Oblast Ukrainian Security Service  Administration who arrested the suspects.    Findings obtained in a preliminary investigation conducted  by  a department chief of the above-mentioned agency have been  proved beyond any doubt in court. In a verdict announced last  week, M.I. Kotov and M.V. Kanunnykov were sentenced,  respectively, to 11 years in a maximum-security labor facility  and seven years in a maximum-security correctional facility.  The personal property of the convicts was confiscated.    It should be noted the operational investigation was  conducted by the Lvov Oblast SBU Administration in conjunction  with the former Russian Ministry of Security.</p>

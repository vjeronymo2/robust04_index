			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- Slovak President  Michal Kovac said last night he could imagine resumption of his  cooperation with former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar if  Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) wins the  early elections. However, there are indications that Meciar is  not willing to do so, Kovac said in a televised discussion.    If Meciar accepts the assignment to create a new cabinet and  then initiate the replacement of the president, Kovac would  defend himself. If he fails, he would democratically resign.    Kovac said he did not expect any political formation to gain  a simple majority in the elections. He said he considered a  broad coalition government the best alternative for Slovakia  after the elections, adding he would welcome the present variant  without top political leaders.    Only one month has passed since Kovac's significant speech  before the Slovak parliament, in which he proposed the creation  of a broad coalition government. Kovac today described as  positive the changes which the society underwent within such a  short period. He appreciated the calming down of the political  situation, the quick agreement on the election date, the smooth  constituting of the new coalition government, and the  accommodating reaction of foreign countries.    Kovac expressed his conviction that in a short time, changes  would occur within the HZDS and democratic principles of  political work would be pushed through. However, if the thesis  "HZDS is Meciar and Meciar is Slovakia" continues to be  promoted, Kovac would reconsider his HZDS membership. The  membership has been suspended since he became president last  year.    Kovac admitted he had been little active in relation towards  HZDS bodies since the very beginning of the conflict between  Meciar and himself. He justified this mistake by the fear that  he might be accused of interfering with the HZDS's internal  affairs.</p>

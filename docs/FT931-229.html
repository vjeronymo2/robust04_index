			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / 3i may look for outside funding THE UK's largest venture capital company, 3i, is considering the possibility of raising outside finance alongside its own funds to invest in continental Europe. The company was anxious to play down the significance of its deliberations. 'We look at all sorts of different ways of fund-raising,' said Mr Neil Cross, international director. 'We have looked at the possibility of raising funds to invest alongside our own money over the years. We have been exploring that again.' 3i has built up a network of offices in France, Germany, Spain and Italy and is keen to increase its activity at a time when other venture capital organisations are cutting back. In recent years it has invested Pounds 40m to Pounds 45m a year in continental Europe. Traditionally 3i has funded new investments from its own resources and by making bond issues, and still has considerable liquid funds available, Mr Cross said. However, the company's dependence on its own resources has proved a limitation in funding larger deals. Last June it announced an alliance with Prudential Venture Managers to invest in UK management buy-outs. 3i's move appears to have emerged from its meetings with US pension funds, the largest source of venture-capital funds internationally. It has been preparing for a Stock Exchange listing for several years but the difficult economic climate has led to delays and speculation among some UK venture capitalists that the flotation may not take place. Senior 3i executives have expressed concerns that a flotation which did not raise new money for the company would serve little purpose.</p>

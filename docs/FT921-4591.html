			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Deficit theories pro and anti Unease is already being expressed at the thought of Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, adding further to the British budget deficit by cutting taxes. The argument on the subject will not be between the government and Labour opposition. For by saying that Labour would borrow 'to build', rather than to cut taxes, Neil Kinnock has already served notice that he is likely to accept whatever deficit the Conservative government chooses to run and to argue that it should be used for public spending instead. But nor will it do to contrast too crudely John Major's profligacy with Thatcherite prudence, although there is a contrast to be drawn. The famous 1981 Budget, which raised taxes towards the end of the last recession (and drove 364 economists to protest) still left a budget deficit amounting to 3 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product, or only one percentage point or so less than is likely in the coming financial year. Sir Geoffrey Howe, the then chancellor, accepted (if reluctantly) that budget deficits rose in recession. His worry was that the pre-recession starting point was far too high and that a structural correction needed to be made. The contrast is that after the 1981-82 Budget, the underlying trend was clearly downwards. Lamont will hardly be able to claim this for the 1992 Budget. Nor can any comparison be made between the two pence cut in the basic rate in the 1987 pre-election Budget and anything that happens tomorrow. For in 1987-88 the deficit was known to be falling rapidly and in the end turned into surplus. The common sense, financial prudence argument against extra borrowing is that today's borrowing is tomorrow's taxes. Raising taxes to service the extra debt will be politically unpopular and cause economic distortions. The argument applies to every penny of discretionary borrowing and does not presuppose a 'debt trap' in which the budget is out of control or any other catastrophe. The argument for extra borrowing is the old so-called 'Keynesian' one that it will stimulate spending and thereby help recovery from recession. For if an active fiscal policy really does make real GDP higher than it otherwise would be over a period of years, this would be a real gain to offset against the transfer burden on future taxpayers. The case against any extra borrowing then boils down to the assertion that any output gains will be either too small to justify the risk, or temporary in the sense that they will be lost when the government curbs demand in the next boom. In that case the extra servicing cost on future taxpayers will be incurred for nothing. There is a wise-guy argument why a stimulus would be ineffective. This argument is known by the pompous title of Ricardian equivalence, but it has more to do with the contemporary US economist, Robert Barro, than the early 19th century English economist, David Ricardo. This says that taxpayers know that borrowing will have to be serviced and ultimately repaid, and thus increase their savings accordingly, starting now. In that case the borrowing does no harm either. For it makes no difference if government finances itself by taxes or borrowing. One would hesitate to stake one's life on the Barro doctrine. For it is difficult to believe that abolishing taxes altogether, or alternatively, doubling them, would have no effects for good or ill. But over moderate ranges Ricardian equivalence has worked better than might have been expected. The failure of the US budget deficit to have the horrifying inflationary effect that some predicted and the failure of the very large British budget surplus in 1988-89 to do much to slow the economy or offset inflation are points in Barro's favour. My own doubt is the more straightforward one that a big demand stimulus of any kind could easily halt or reverse the the progress in reducing inflation. Even now, inflationary psychology has not been completely eradicated and past experience has shown how easy it is to stimulate the economy when it is already about to move upwards. Why would not the the same objection apply to a monetary stimulus, if the Bundesbank allowed it? The difference is that an interest rate can easily be reversed, while something like an income tax reduction, even if it takes the form of a higher tax starting point, becomes embedded and extremely difficult to reverse. Any extra red ink in the Budget needs then to be justified by one of two alternative criteria. Either the stimuli ought to be rather like monetary policy in being easily and perhaps automatically reversible. This would point to indirect taxes and temporary investment incentives rather than income tax cuts. Alternatively, they need to contribute to the long-term growth of the economy, so that some benefit is left even if there is no Keynesian stimulus. But it is far too simple to equate such expenditure with 'investment' in the Budget accounts. It would be all too easy to translate Kinnock's borrowing-to-build into higher pay for workers on council contracts. And there are changes, such as eliminating work disincentives at the bottom of the income scale or selective spending on, for instance, science and engineering teaching, which could increase the economy's growth potential, even though they count as current. My conclusion would be that some extra borrowing would be justified for investment, defined very broadly, and not in accounting terms. But this is not what I expect. The result of tomorrow's borrowing will be little good and moderate harm. I am much more interested in what happens to interest rates in Germany.</p>

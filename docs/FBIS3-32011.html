The shootout occurred as two U.S. diplomatic cars were  driving along the avenue that links the U.S. Embassy to the  Mogadishu airport, when their escorts opened fire on a crowd.  The soldiers fired -- even using heavy-caliber weapons --  because they thought the Somalis were trying to block the road  along which the caravan was to pass, when in reality the crowd  was just waiting in front of a food distribution center.    The massacre followed statements by the general  undersecretary for UN operations in Somalia, (Kofi Annan), who  criticized Washington's decision to withdraw its troops before  31 March. The UN official said he considered that decision a  mistake because it might encourage violent actions aimed at  sabotaging the peacekeeping operations.</p>

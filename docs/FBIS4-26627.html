			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Third-round talks  between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the  United States aimed at finding a solution to the nuclear issue  and improving relations between the two countries are to be held  in Geneva in the first week of July.    A DPRK spokesman said: "We expect the talks to be on a fair  and equal basis so that a substantial agreement may be reached  for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue and for the  improvement of relations between the DPRK and the United States  as a whole."    Meanwhile, the DPRK also announced today that it will allow  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based  U.N. nuclear watchdog, to keep its two inspectors and monitoring  equipment in place at the Yongbyon facility.    In Washington, President Clinton said Wednesday [22 June]  that Pyongyang has agreed to freeze its nuclear program, adding  that Washington would now resume diplomatic talks and drop a  call for U.N. sanctions.    "Although these developments do not provide a solution to  the  problem they do mark a new opportunity to find a solution,"  Clinton said at a news conference.</p>

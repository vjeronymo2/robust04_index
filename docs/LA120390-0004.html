			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COST OF WAR  </P> <P> In The Times' special section (The Line in the Sand, Nov. 25) concerning the  Mideast, (Desert Shield commander) Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf is quoted as  saying, "We ought to think a little bit about what the cost is going to be. Not  only to us, but to the enemy, too."  </P> <P> Cost to the enemy? What does he think the situation is, a swap meet? Is he in  the military or in the Peace Corps? I wonder what Gens. Eisenhower, MacArthur  or Grant would have to say about that?  </P> <P> If Schwarzkopf wants to cut costs on both sides, then he should challenge  Saddam Hussein to a duel and hope that the best man wins. Or is he just another  (Civil War Gen. George) McClellan?  </P> <P> PAUL C. DILLMAN, Buena Park  </P></p>

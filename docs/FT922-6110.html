			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ekofisk production halted after fire NORWAY'S OIL industry watchdog yesterday ordered the closure of the big North Sea Ekofisk oil and gas complex pending clarification of the cause of a brief fire which broke out on Monday night in an air filter on one of the field's platforms. 'We have informed Phillips Petroleum that oil and gas production from the Ekofisk complex will have to be shut down until we have a reasonable explanation for the cause of the fire. Phillips will have to formally apply to the directorate to reopen production from the field,' explained Mr Jan Hagland, an NPD official. The field produces about 250,000 barrels of crude a day, but three nearby fields - Valhall, Gyda and Ula - which produce a combined 330,000 b/d will also be affected as their output is transported by pipeline to the Ekofisk field centre. Also affected by the closure is about 1bn cubic feet of gas per day which is transported from the Ekofisk complex to Emden, Germany to supply a consortium of European gas buyers. Mr Hagland said that a team of NPD experts is assisting Phillips in seeking to determine the cause of the fire. The fire occurred just hours ahead of an earlier planned maintenance shutdown by Phillips in which Ekofisk production would have been shut down for approximately 90 hours. Mr Hagland said that if the Ekofisk closure was maintained over an extended period it could have implications for production from the giant Statfjord and Gullfaks fields, which have combined oil output of just over 1m barrels a day.</p>

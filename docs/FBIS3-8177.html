In the ambassador's view, the verdict of the court is unjust  because neither Lysenko nor the Ukrainian Security Service  carried on spying activity to the detriment of Poland. He  treats the detention of Lysenko as "the activity of influential  circles that are acting against the reconciliation of the two  states." The ambassador expects that "in democratic Poland,  justice will prevail."    Udovenko revealed that the Ukrainian embassy had held secret  talks on the Lysenko case with 15 influential personalities in  Polish political life. The Ukrainian side was concerned that  the case did not worsen mutual contacts. He said that, inter  alia, the visit of the State Protection Office [UOP] head to  Ukraine had not yet ensued on account of the trial.    The ambassador expressed thanks to Lysenko for "endurance  and  patriotism, and for not agreeing to be recruited by the UOP."  The major himself, present at the news conference, told  journalists that he was blackmailed and encouraged to change his  citizenship, and to pass on state secrets to the Polish side.</p>

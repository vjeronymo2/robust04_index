			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGNON BREAKS AWAY, TAKES LEAD;  </P> <P> LEMOND DROPS 26 SECONDS BACK IN UPHILL BATTLE, BUT . . .  </P> <P> If the favored Frenchman, Laurent Fignon, wins the Tour de France, he will be  able to look back on the final 2 1/2 miles of the excruciating climb up l'Alpe  d'Huez Wednesday as the test of his endurance and courage that separated him  from his challengers, most notably American Greg LeMond.  </P> <P> Known as "le puncheur" because of his ability to put away opponents when it  appears as if he is destined to defeat, Fignon, a two-time champion, attacked  near the end of the tour's most demanding stage, leaving the struggling LeMond  behind and reclaiming the leader's yellow jersey with only four days remaining  in the 21-stage, 2,030-mile race.  </P> <P> "Suddenly, I felt as if I had wings," Fignon said.  </P> <P> Behind by 53 seconds when the 100.4-mile, 17th stage began at Briancon, Fignon,  28, has a 26-second lead over the second-place LeMond, who was unable to  respond when the Frenchman found the reserve to pull away on one of the tour's  most challenging climbs.  </P> <P> "My legs began to feel like lead near the end," said LeMond, 28, who in 1986  became the only American to win the cycling's most prestigious race. "I can't  describe the pain I had to go through at the end. I was beyond my limits."  </P> <P> But victory is still within his grasp. If Fignon does not extend his lead  significantly during the next three stages, LeMond is capable of catching him  in the final stage, a 15.2-mile time trial Sunday from Versailles to Paris. It  would be the first time since 1968 that the champion has been determined on the  final day.  </P> <P> LeMond said last Sunday that the ideal situation for him would be to trail  Fignon by about 15 seconds entering the final time trial.  </P> <P> No matter what occurs between now and then, this already will be remembered as  one of the the most exciting of the 76 tours. That is due in large part to  LeMond, who was not expected to be a factor after missing much of the last two  years with various injuries. He was near death in March of 1987 from a gunshot  wound suffered in a hunting accident.  </P> <P> But LeMond has earned the yellow jersey twice this year, most recently last  Sunday when he reeled in Fignon during a time trial as the cyclists entered the  Alps and carried a 40-second lead into the tour's final week. He extended the  lead to 53 seconds over Fignon Tuesday, although the American admitted  afterward that he was fatigued and expressed concern about the next stage.  </P> <P> Of the six most difficult climbs on the tour, three of them faced the cyclists  Wednesday. The worst was saved for last, 8.3 miles almost straight up the  formidable l'Alpe d'Huez.  </P> <P> Gert-Jan Theunisse of the Netherlands won the stage in 5 hours 10 minutes 39  seconds. But that was inconsequential as the three leaders, LeMond, Fignon and  defending champion Pedro Delgado of Spain, waged their own race.  </P> <P> Delgado began the day in fourth place, 2:48 behind LeMond. As the best hill  climber among the three leaders, Delgado was expected to make his move. But  with only 2 1/2 miles remaining on l'Alpe d'Huez, he was still in a pack with  LeMond and Fignon. They left France's Charly Mottet, who was in third place  after Tuesday, behind at the foot of the hill.  </P> <P> That was the point of Fignon's ambush as he left LeMond and Delgado far behind.  Delgado finally went after Fignon, catching him about one mile later. But  LeMond was spent at the end of a punishing day in blistering heat.  </P> <P> Delgado finished second in the stage, but his time was the same as Fignon's,  1:09 behind Theunisse. LeMond finished fourth, another 1:19 behind.  </P> <P> "I saw LeMond's shoulder go down, and he didn't react when I went away," Fignon  said. "Delgado had to make a big effort to catch me, and he couldn't attack. I  didn't want to lose a single second to Delgado, and I achieved it."  </P> <P> Delgado moved into third place overall ahead of Mottet, but the Spaniard is  1:55 behind Fignon and may find it difficult to make up time with the most  difficult of the Alpine stages behind him. The cyclists will remain in the Alps  for the next two stages, but neither is nearly so demanding as the one  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I was surprised by Fignon's attack," Delgado said. "It will be difficult to  win the tour now, but I don't want to give up. I will try something in the next  two days. Anyone can have a bad day, after all."  </P> <P> With about 250,000 people crowding the slopes on the final hill, Fignon  recaptured the yellow jersey on its 70th anniversary. On July 19, 1919, Henri  Desgrange, who founded the tour, decided to show off the leader by putting him  in a distinctive color.  </P> <P> Whether Fignon can keep the yellow jersey may not be determined for another  four days.  </P> <P> "We always say that the rider who wears the yellow jersey at l'Alpe d'Huez wins  the tour," he said. "I hope it's true this time, but the race is not over yet."  </P> <P> Jeannie Longo of France moved steadily away from the field, scoring another  convincing stage victory in the women's Tour de France.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive day, Longo won easily, winning the 50-mile seventh  stage from Briancon to St. Jean-de Maurienne in the Alps.  </P> <P> Maria Canins of Italy, like Longo a two-time champion, was second, 1:33 behind.  She trails Longo in the overall standings by 7:04. American Inga Thompson took  22nd in the stage but stayed third overall as she was in a group that finished  2:52 behind.  </P></p>

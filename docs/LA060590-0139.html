			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN SCHOOL MAY LEASE CAMPUS  </P> <P> Despite grumblings from school district officials, the City Council is going  ahead with plans to sublease the former Oxford Junior High School to a private  Christian school. "Basically, everything is in its final form," said City  Manager Darrell Essex.  </P> <P> The council made one last revision to the lease at a meeting last month, he  said.  </P> <P> After learning that the city was thinking about leasing the school, officials  of the Anaheim Union High School District sent a letter protesting the  proposal.  </P> <P> "There was some concern about leasing it to a school that competes with the  district," said Bobbi Zane, public information officer for the district.  Because the school district holds the lease, the city will have to obtain  approval from district officials before the new school can open, Essex said.  </P> <P> Currently, the city leases the school from the district and allows the Parks  and Recreation Department to use the facilities. The school was closed more  than nine years ago because of declining enrollment.  </P> <P> Several private groups also sublease portions of the site, but none of these  organizations will be affected by the Christian school's coming in, officials  said.  </P> <P> Greater Long Beach Christian school wants to move 700 students from their  present location in Paramount in southeast Los Angeles County to Cypress. The  Cypress location would include students in grades seven to 12 and 46 staff  members.  </P> <P> Three modular units will be added to house a weight room, band room and  maintenance facility. If the lease is approved, the school is expected to open  in the fall. The school district will consider the lease at its June 14  meeting, Zane said. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

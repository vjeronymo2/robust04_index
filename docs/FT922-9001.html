			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Civil engineers see rise in orders CIVIL engineering companies are more optimistic about work prospects than at any time during the past two years, according to a survey conducted after the general election last month, Andrew Taylor writes. According to the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, which surveyed more than 150 construction companies, more are predicting a rise in orders over the next 12 months than are expecting a fall. This is the first time there has been more optimism than pessimism about orders since April 1990, the federation said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Eiji Suzuki, former chairman of the Third Ad </F> Hoc Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform, by  unidentified staff member; place and date not given: "Suzuki  Says, `Sectionalism Among Bureaucrats, Zoku Members Will Destroy  Japan'"]    [Text] The Third Ad Hoc Council for the Promotion of  Administrative Reform [the Third Administrative Reform Council  for short] has closed its business after 123 rounds of  deliberations in three years. People expected a great deal of  achievements from the council; yet, in its final report the  council practically failed to plunge a scalpel into the work of  reviewing special corporations, thereby inviting strong  criticism that the report "has had the teeth taken out of it."  Looking back on the report, Mr. Suzuki says: "I received a great  cut in my marks for that. I feel great remorse." What on earth  was the "wall of bureaucrats" which Mr. Suzuki bumped  against?  <H5>  "Obstruction" Was Made in Such Way </H5>   [Suzuki] People ask me what grade I will give to the final  report and whether it is a passing grade. But I would not have  submitted the report if I had thought it to deserve a failing  grade.    The latest one was named the "final report." In a strict  sense, the report was so named simply because it was submitted  last, and the Third Administrative Reform Council presented six  reports in all by then. Therefore, I would like to have the  council evaluated through all of the reports. When the  securities financing scandal took place, the Third  Administrative Reform Council fulfilled the task of establishing  a watchdog agency, and it also proposed enacting the  administrative procedures legislation.    Proposals we made in the three-year period were all good.    However, it is a matter of deep regret that, among the  proposals, I received a great cut in my grade over one related  to the issue of reviewing special corporations. It was not  fulfilled due to obstruction by "zoku Dietmen" [group of Diet  members who exercise in a particular field the policymaking  expertise and contacts generally acquired through service as  chairman or vice chairman of the appropriate party policy  deliberation committee]    [SHUKAN GENDAI] The Third Administrative Reform Council was  inaugurated in October 1990 and studied the way administration  should be toward the 21st century. Its final report advocates a  shift "from bureaucratic leadership to private autonomy" and  calls for installing an "ombudsman's panel on regulation" to  further ease control and establishing the "New Civil Service  System Deliberation Council" intended to study and discuss the  public servant system. The report also carries a proposal that a  study be made on reorganizing government ministries and  agencies. Naturally, strong resistance was expected to be made  from bureaucrats who were anxious to protect their vested  rights, and the issue of reviewing special corporations agonized  Chairman Suzuki until the last moment.    There are 92 public corporations and business foundations  categorized as special corporations, and many of them have now  lost their reasons for existence due to mutually overlapping  business activities. The council attempted to reduce their  number through amalgamation and abolition; however, in the end  it could neither practically mention special corporations by  name nor indicate reform procedures in its final report.    A reporter who covered the Management and Coordination  Agency  made the following remarks in this connection:    "Concerning the measure to merge and abolish special  corporations, 34 were picked for the measure from among 92  corporations in a midterm report in April. Hearings began to  reduce the number to a little over 10 in May, when the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] zoku Dietmen and bureaucrats launched a  large counterattack.    "Upon learning that they would be summoned to the hearings,  bureau and division directors made prior visits to zoku Dietmen  to `ask for their instructions.' Then, zoku Dietmen applied  pressure on them, saying, `Do not attend the hearings.' The  officials thus refused to attend hearings. Then came the general  elections, through which the LDP became an opposition party. The  council thought that it got a good chance, but it was already  too late. Hearings for checking assigned tasks of respective  corporations are indispensable to naming special corporations in  the report, but it was too late for the council to hold the  hearings in time for the October report."    [Suzuki] I thought that Japan's politicians had an aptitude  for seeing, speaking, and acting from high perspectives.  However, they forgot the people and the nation and spoke from  the standpoint of the business world and on the basis of their  sectionalism. This is indeed regrettable and unpleasant.    No sooner had I intended to take countermeasures than the  general election campaign began. I was asked to be prudent until  the end of the election on the grounds that it would disturb the  election if I dealt with the politicians and did this and that  during the campaign period. So I waited, and what I saw was the  shift of power to the other side.    However, I think that it is an unusual practice for the  administration not to attend meetings (hearings) one-sidedly in  obediance to the zoku Dietmen's voice, and there should not be  such a practice for anything in the world. This unexpectedly  revealed that politics so far had essentially been for the  business world despite politicians' remarks that they stood on  the side of the people.    [SHUKAN GENDAI] Mr. Ken Moroi (chairman of Chichibu Cement  Co.), a member of the Administrative Reform Council, made the  following remarks in this connection: "Zoku Dietmen form a group  in each government ministry and agency to serve as a kind of  protective body whose coalescence with administrative and  financial officials is now being called into question. At that  time, officials did not show up in the hearings, manipulated by  the LDP zoku Dietmen. There is not this kind of resistance now  because Japan has a coalition ruling camp at present."    Mr. Haruo Nishihara (former chairman of the Private  Universities Association), a member of the Administrative Reform  Council, also said as follows: "I heard that there was zoku  Dietmen resistance in some [LDP] divisions, but the resistance  was rather made by bureaucrats and the workers of respective  special corporations. Those workers stressed that `our  corporation is engaged in national programs, and so you should  not pick us.' However, there came a change of government, and  the Hosokawa cabinet was formed. The council intended to set  about its task again in earnest, but there was not enough time  with only three months left before the final report."    [Suzuki] I got many demerits for this; however, to make up  for them I passed burdens to ministries and agencies concerned,  asking them to study the directions given by the report and work  out policies within the next two years with regard to all 92  special corporations. I was obliged to take such a step, and as  chairman, I feel great remorse for this really clumsy  development.    Well, when I think cool-headedly, I feel that it is the  Administrative Reform Council's system itself that is making  administrative reform difficult. In carrying out administrative  reform, the council has to make its proposals through the  administrative organization, and efforts end in failure unless  the proposals finally pass through meetings of administrative  vice ministers at respective ministries and agencies. No single  line provides for such a process in the Administrative Reform  Council Installation Act, but the proposals cannot be presented  even to the cabinet conference without the consent of all  attending these meetings.    Officials participating in the proceedings have gained their  rights and expanded their spheres of influence through longtime  habits. They are not as large a family as one that was once  formed around the former Japan Railway, but anyway they like  measures to enlarge their power. On the other hand, they are  opposed to curtailing their power through rationalization even  if it is a good step for the nation. They consider only their  rights. The most hateful thing for successive vice ministers and  bureau directors was to see any of their sections pared down  during their term of office. They feared that their careers  might get hurt and their names remembered unfavorably because of  such a measure. All this must be tided over in carrying out  administrative reform; therefore, I cannot help saying that  administrative reform is being carried out amid the  self-contradiction contained in the system itself.    Administrative reform and political reform are so closely  connected that they are frequently likened to a vehicle's two  wheels, and I felt keenly that strong political power is  necessary to make administrative reform really effective. The  Japan Railway Corporation, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public  Corp., and Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corp. were privatized  when Mr. Doko led the Provisional Council for the Promotion of  Administrative Reform. The steps were possible because Mr. Doko  was great, but they were also possible because Prime Minister  Nakasone stood firm. Bureaucrats hinted at their resignations to  show their opposition, but the prime minister accepted all of  their resignations without hesitation. This is how political  power was used when the steps were taken.    Mr. Miyazawa, too, was eager for administrative reform. When  we were tackling the special decentralization system (the pilot  autonomous body system), he was thinking before I did about what  my council should do, and it was rather me, not him, who was  queried. He asked, "Mr. Suzuki, how will you handle such a  case?" Mr. Miyazawa was a distinguished statesman, but he was  not quite active in pushing things forward. That is his  personality.    [SHUKAN GENDAI] A council member said as follows in this  connection: "There was resistance from bureaucrats and zoku  Dietmen, but another reason [for the failure of the final  report] was that Mr. Miyazawa was not very eager for  administrative reform. There was also concern among council  members that if they put forward too ideal a plan, the chance  for its realization would be small and so they gave  consideration to producing a realizable plan."    [Suzuki] Administrative reform is carried out under a system  with such self-contradiction. However, Japan's successive prime  ministers were not accustomed to using a top-down approach based  on leadership. For example, during the Gulf war, Japan could  have shown a quicker response to the war if its politics had  been oriented toward a top-down formula. It was not the prime  minister alone that should be blamed for the delayed response.  The delay took place because the entire Japanese politics was  ruled by a bottom-up formula, a system in which decisions are  made through a bottom-up process.    Consciousness reform has not yet been accomplished, and in  this sense the work of decentralization will indeed be  difficult. Centralized power politics does not accord with the  current age. People talk about decentralization, but they do not  cooperate once the actual work begins to promote it. When Mr.  Hosokawa (the incumbent prime minister) was serving as chief of  the "Affluent Life Division," the Administrative Reform Council  proposed what was called the new basic autonomous body. The  bottom lines of this basic autonomous body are that "local  administration ought to be carried out by localities themselves"  and that the main objects of local politics are problems closely  connected with livelihood. Then the following question arises:  Which should be chosen as basic autonomous bodies, the  prefectures or the cities, towns, and villages? It is naturally  cities, towns, and villages that are closely connected with  livelihood.    However, there are now 3,300 cities, towns, and villages  across the nation. Some autonomous bodies have populations of  300 or less than 1,000. In such circumstances, it would be  difficult to adequately carry out work for the residents' health  and welfare. Therefore, the council began studying a plan to  make the size of the basic autonomous body at least equal to the  scale of the old han [a feudal domain] with a population of  about 300,000. As soon as the study began, the heads of local  autonomous bodies raised vehement opposition to merging towns  and villages. Opposition was particularly fierce from  prefectural governors although they should be in the position to  promote decentralization.    After all, they intend to defend their spheres of influence.  A village chief is a village chief, whether he is the chief of a  large village or a village of 300 people.    Prefectural governors are essentially opposed to building  cities designated by cabinet orders as well, on the grounds that  the step decreases their power.  <H5>  Abandon Control, Central Rule </H5>   Why will such a thing happen? It is because while working,  they hold a zero-sum game concept, a notion that when power is  conferred upon one, someone else is losing an equal amount of  power. Reform means building a new world, and so the central  government should assume large strategic areas such as national  defense, the stability of international money, and international  contributions, while the prefectures carry out things necessary  for the regional economy, entrusting practical issues closely  connected with daily livelihood to cities, towns, and villages.  Therefore, I would like to ask them to think with a plus-sum  concept, not with a zero-sum concept.    In addition, local politics from now will find the need to  adopt prefectural incorporation and the doshu system [doshu--a  local administrative unit, wider than the prefectural area, now  being conceived in a decentralization plan] because the  prefecture alone is too narrow for carrying out local politics.  Affairs to be handled by local politics should not be limited to  those entrusted from the central organs. It should also study  how to deal with education through the adoption of the doshu  system and prefectural incorporation, whether it is good to  continue the conventional uniform education enforced across the  nation, and what industrial policies will be effective under the  doshu system and prefectural incorporation. Some people may feel  a fear as to giving greater power to the heads of local  autonomous bodies because of the so-called general contractor  scandal involving them. Therefore, lest a similar incident  should occur again, my council recommended that cities, towns,  and villages be made the center of the basic autonomous bodies,  that budgets and competent workers be distributed to these  areas, and that politics be carried out before the eyes of  residents. Corruption without exception takes place in hidden  places as seen in the Kyowa, Sagawa, and general contractor  scandals. This is why it is necessary to promote basic  autonomous bodies where residents can see politics before their  eyes.    Japan has thus far carried out very good policies, but we  are  now in utterly different circumstances. We have brought about  the second-largest economy in the world by striving to chase and  outrun West Europe under the motto of building our nation  through the increase of production. In doing so, we needed to  make regulations and standards, develop people with equal  ability, and carry out concentrated mass production. However,  Japan's method of earning foreign money by mass-producing and  exporting specific items was completely denied in the Japan-U.S.  Structural Impediments Initiative talks as well. Japan has now  reached a point where it has to make a great turnabout, because  it can no longer bring up its next generation with its regulated  society and centralization of power. It must decentralize itself  by abandoning its central rule and make a great turnabout by  taking the position of deregulation in principle and regulation  as exceptional.    Political measures in this direction have actually been  taken  a little faster, but the real work is yet to be done with regard  to various systems. It is the prime minister's job to translate  our reports into action, and Prime Minister Hosokawa is indeed  flexible like a lithe bomboo. If he had been like a pine tree,  he would have already broken in half, but he always regains his  original form like a bamboo tree. As for me, I believe I have  run at full speed, and it is now the prime minister's turn to  show the power of execution.</p>

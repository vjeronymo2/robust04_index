			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Financing: Private US debt market plugs the funding gap LONG-TERM, fixed-rate money these days is hard to find. Banks often do not want to lend it: capital and credit concerns have made them unwilling long-term lenders. Public bond markets are not interested unless the borrower is a top-class name, and even then do not provide money for longer than 10 years. So it is a relief to a growing number of European corporate treasurers that the private US debt markets are plugging the gap. In 1985, foreign companies accounted for only 2.5 per cent of the debt placed privately in the US. The proportion has grown steadily ever since, save for a brief dip in 1990, reaching 18.1 per cent last year - or Dollars 17.8bn. British companies have led the way. The latest round of deals, announced in recent days, includes Pilkington (which had sought Dollars 200m but increased the deal to Dollars 300m due to demand), and Smiths Industries and United Newspapers (which raised Dollars 100m each). All have used the money to repay short-term borrowings. In all, British companies raised nearly Dollars 5bn last year. Swedish, Dutch and German companies managed another Dollars 4bn between them. Some 20 to 30 of the US's biggest insurers account for the bulk of the market. US insurers hold around two-thirds of their investments in fixed-income securities, compared with a typical holding of 15 to 20 per cent by UK insurers, and so have a vast appetite for new fixed-income investments. At the moment, many non-US companies are getting a better reception from these insurers than US ones. This is partly because the insurers have turned their back on higher-risk investments at home: US insurance industry regulators, prompted by insurance companies' junk bond losses, imposed new rules in 1990 on the credit quality of their investments. At the other end of the spectrum, many US companies with a better credit standing have turned to the public bond markets to take advantage of the high level of demand in the past two years. That has left US investors short of domestic assets to buy. 'Effectively, they are underinvested,' says Mr William Coles, of Salomon Brothers. One result is a new love-affair with foreign companies. Investors have begun to look overseas more actively for companies to invest in to replace the decline in US business - and investment banks have put more effort into developing deals to bring to the investors. Prudential Insurance Corporation of the US, for instance, now has a subsidiary in London to seek out investments. Among the deals it has been responsible for arranging was a Dollars 100m 15-year facility last year for Scapa Group, a maker of coatings for pulp and paper. For corporate treasurers, one of the attractions of private placements in the US has been the freedom from the Securities and Exchange Commission's disclosure requirements. However, there are other drawbacks. One is the type of covenants that investors demand. Typically, these include interest cover and gearing ratios that are more onerous than those imposed by unsecured bank lending. US investors also ask for a covenant governing 'event risk', allowing them to opt for repayment in certain circumstances. These extra safeguards are perhaps not surprising given the disadvantageous position a long-term, unsecured creditor is in. 'No one wants to be the longest lender to a corporation,' says Mr Ron Tannenbaum, head of private placements at UBS in London. Another potential drawback is the attention of rating agencies. All debt securities held by insurance companies in the US are rated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners: the ratings are used by regulators when setting each insurer's reserve requirements. Many deals are also pawed over by ratings agencies, however. In part, that is because more are issued under the SEC's rule 144a, which allows for a limited market to develop (about one-third of the issues by foreign companies last year were under this rule). Moody's Investors Service has caused some waves by issuing unsolicited ratings on private deals. At least one company, Usinor Sacilor, of France, withdrew a planned private placement when the agency said it would issue a rating. Ratings by commercial agencies may already be desirable in the 144a market and in time could become standard, according to IBCA, the UK-based agency. If so, that could remove one of the current attractions of the market for investors. In time, more European companies could turn to the private placement markets that are developing in their own back yard. One investment bank in London estimates the European market to be worth Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn a year. But it is what the bank calls a 'private private market' (deals are not announced, unlike the US). It is also highly fragmented: investors tend to prefer domestic investors, rather than those from overseas. And each domestic market has developed its own characteristics. For instance, the market for permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs) issued by UK building societies, though nominally a public one, is to all intents and purposes a private market, with mainly UK institutional investors tucking the paper away into their portfolios. Hence the strong German private placement market, or the developing one in the UK, are seldom open to foreign companies. Until that changes, the US will remain the most obvious source of long-term debt finance for many European companies.</p>

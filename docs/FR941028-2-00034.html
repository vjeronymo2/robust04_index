			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the purpose of the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS is focused on assessing the reasonable alternatives for a government-owned, long-term, assured supply of tritium, programmatic NEPA coverage of this contingency option, which would only be needed in the event of a national emergency, would ensure that the public is informed of the Department's overall planning for meeting tritium requirements_both contingency (until a long-term, assured source is on line) and long-term. This analysis would be generic and would not identify any specific commercial reactors that might be used if such an option were ever required to be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An IP for the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, to be issued after comments on this notice have been received and reviewed, will explain more fully the scope of the PEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's initiatives for further public involvement in the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS are intended to provide the public complete, accurate, and timely information, and to facilitate effective participation in the NEPA process. The initiatives include a series of fact sheets describing various aspects of the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS as well as other program activities. These fact sheets will be mailed to those on the program mailing list throughout the remainder of 1994 and 1995. To provide substantial opportunities for feedback to the Department, the initiatives include the use of a toll-free telephone number; placement of program information, including this notice, on an electronic bulletin board to enable comments and feedback to be transmitted electronically; and a speakers bureau to fulfill requests for DOE officials to speak with the public. In addition, once the Tritium Supply and Recycling draft PEIS is published, the public will be invited to review and comment on the document. During the comment period, the Department will conduct a series of interactive workshops to provide further explanation of information in the document and to provide the public with an opportunity to present comments, questions, and concerns, and to discuss them with DOE officials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE is in the process of updating the mailing list for the Tritium Supply and Recycling program and the Stockpile Stewardship and Management program. A fact sheet on this notice, along with a mailback response form, is being sent to all those on the current Reconfiguration mailing list. The purpose of the mailback response form is to allow individuals and organizations to indicate their continuing interest in receiving information regarding either the Tritium Supply and Recycling program or the Stockpile Stewardship and Management program. Interested parties wishing to remain on the mailing list for either the Tritium Supply and Recycling program or the Stockpile Stewardship and Management program must complete and return the mailback response form or call 1&hyph;800&hyph;776&hyph;2765 with the same request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS will identify and analyze direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts resulting from the tritium supply and recycling alternatives. These include potential impacts from constructing and operating the proposed facilities, including: impacts to air quality, water resources, plants and animals, land use, historic resources, archaeological sites; socioeconomic impacts; impacts associated with generating radiological and nonradiological wastes; impacts associated with transporting radioactive materials; and the potential consequences of both normal and accidental radiological and nonradiological releases on the public and worker health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IP for the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS will be completed after comments on this announcement have been considered. It is expected to be completed in January 1995. The Draft Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, which will include preferred alternatives for tritium supply and recycling functions, will be completed no later than March 1, 1995. Following the publication of the Draft Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, public hearings (interactive workshops) will be held, and a Final Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS is expected to be completed by November 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Tritium Supply and Recycling Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No sooner than 30 days after issuance of the Final Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, DOE will issue a Record of Decision (ROD) to document its decisions. The ROD will explain how DOE has balanced environmental considerations against other relevant factors, such as economic and technical considerations, and the Department's statutory mission, in reaching its decision. Following the ROD, project-specific NEPA documents will be prepared as necessary to support actual implementation of the ROD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All interested parties are invited to submit their comments on the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS by regular mail as explained in the section entitled ``Addresses'' at the beginning of this notice, or by calling the Tritium Supply and Recycling toll free number at 1&hyph;800&hyph;776&hyph;2765.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tomoo Yamaguchi, political commentator: "The </F> Existence of Taisaku Ikeda Cannot Be Ignored" second in a series  entitled "The Persons Who Sustain the Hosokawa Government"]    [Text]  <H3>  Yamagishi Wants To Flaunt Being a Person To Be  Reckoned With </H3>   The one who is commonly recognized to be a person who  performed great service behind the scenes in regard to the birth  of the Hosokawa coalition government is Akira Yamagishi,  chairman of Rengo (National Confederation of Trade Unions).    In the election of Rengo officers that was held last  September, Yamagishi was elected to a third term in recognition  of his efforts and achievements directed toward establishment of  the coalition government.    Even so, it was not the kind of thing one could call  unanimous; it was because rival candidates stepped down  reluctantly. It was certainly not a smooth election to a third  term; there were such things as an argument for replacing  Yamagishi emerging from local industrial unions connected with  the former Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan],  which originally backed Yamagishi for chairman of Rengo.    An argument for bringing in a new generation came from major  private-sector local industrial unions, and there also welled up  a reaction against a Yamagishi line which leans excessively  toward politics.    Certainly Rengo has suffered a series of defeats in the  spring labor offensives of the last few years. Alienation of  workers from unions has also become conspicuous, and although  Rengo is a national center that mustered 8 million workers, the  actual situation is that it has things which are far from what  one would call the main headquarters of labor unions.    Moreover, the labor environment has become harsher and  harsher because of the bursting of the bubble economy and  stagnation of business conditions. With real discharging of  workers and so on being carried out by such means as employment  adjustment, layoffs, and company restructuring, the existence of  labor unions is now about to be called into serious question. If  Rengo is only for such fortunate workers as those in major  private-sector unions and in public-sector unions, its meaning  as a national center will also disappear.    It is also natural that calls to return to the labor  movement  come from within Rengo. There is even a feeling that most Rengo  executives from Yamagishi on down have become "labor  bureaucrats" rather than leaders of labor unions.    Because of the end of the East-West cold war structure,  ideological rivalry has disappeared. The word "working class"  has also become an obsolete word. It is to be expected that not  only politics, but labor unions as well, are pressed by the  necessity to grope for new policy lines.    It appears that Yamagishi tried to flaunt his sense of being  a person to be reckoned with by intervening in politics with  Rengo for a background.  <H5>  Thesis of Ozawa's "Purification" Is a Staged Event </H5>   Yamagishi was the one who first granted an indulgence in the  question of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general  Ichiro Ozawa "turning over a new leaf."    Yamagishi spoke out on the thesis of Ozawa's purification,  saying "The past is the past. Everyone has a past. I think that  for a person who up till now was at the heart of the government,  and knows the delicious taste of politics, to abandon power by  his own volition, resolving to take a big risk by wagering his  political life, cannot be done by an average person. I think  that Ozawa's political `purification' was completed by the  formation of the new party. It is not a matter to go on  discussing forever."    Ozawa appears to have been overjoyed by this statement. It  is  said that when, even after that, Sadao Yamahana, who was  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], said  "the public still has doubts regarding the connection between  Ozawa and the Sagawa scandal," Ozawa spoke immediately.    Ozawa said, even showing anger toward Yamahana, "It is no  good because people say things, like Yamahana does. If you make  up your minds on a coalition, get a firmer grip on yourselves.  If you once say things clearly, like Yamagishi, everyone will  stop asking."    But at a subsequent press conference, Yamagishi stated the  true meaning of the thesis of Ozawa's purification, saying "My  saying that Ozawa's purification was completed was a political  judgment. I do not think that his purification is complete,  either. I said it because I thought Ozawa would feel indebted to  me if I came to his aid when he was being attacked. Even after  forming a coalition government, he will probably not be able to  do something like refusing what I ask." It was, so to speak, a  type of "staged [yarase]" statement.    However, the truth be what it may, Ozawa and Yamagishi drew  closer to each other rapidly through these circumstances.    During the lower house election as well, Ozawa devoted  himself to burrowing underground, hardly appearing on the  surface. During that time he conferred with Yamagishi at Rengo  headquarters more than once.    While on the one hand Yamagishi is said to have performed  great service in the birth of the Hosokawa coalition government,  he has been branded a "Class-A war criminal" who caused the  crushing defeat of the SDPJ because there were also cases in  which SDPJ candidates who were excluded from recommendation by  the Rengo selection lost in the election, but more than that,  one cannot deny an overall lowering of the the SDPJ's image by  Rengo making the selection.    But according to a survey of the voting behavior of members  of the Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union (NTT's union),  which is Yamagishi's original parent body, the rate of support  for the SDPJ was 52.6 percent. The result has become clear that  77 percent voted for SDPJ candidates in the last lower house  election. Moreover, concerning recommended candidates in  national elections, the number who say "even a Liberal  Democratic Party candidate is all right" if he is sympathetic to  the Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union, has risen to all of  43 percent.    But in a February 1992 survey, the rate of support for the  SDPJ in the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union  was 26.5 percent, and in the All Japan Federation of Electric  Machine Workers' Unions was 13.3 percent.    This means that the rate of support for the SDPJ in the  Japan  Telecommunication Workers' Union is still high, compared to the  All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union and the All  Japan Federation of Electric Machine Workers' Unions, but even  though they are members of unions under the Rengo umbrella I  cannot believe they are voting in accordance with Rengo  headquarters' recommendations and support directives.    It is no exaggeration to say that Rengo has already been  reduced to a shell, not only in such labor-movement activities  as the spring offensives, but also in the aspect of a political  movement.  <H5>  Rengo's Demands Will Not Be Realized </H5>   Be that as it may, how much meaning does establishing a  nonLDP coalition government hold for Rengo?    To be sure, labor-management relations within companies and  workers' rights are of course all very well, but it is necessary  to win a share of the pie in the aspect of government policy.  Because such things as shortening working hours, the tax system,  and all types of pensions are policy questions that are  necessary and vital to workers.    But if it becomes a matter of those who are working, that  is,  "workers," it means expanding to a national scale. If it becomes  a matter of winning rights for one segment of workers, however,  problems are generated. Consequently, there cannot be a  coalition government for the benefit of Rengo.    But Yamagishi is delighted at the birth of the coalition  government.    Yamagishi, who visited the prime minister's official  residence immediately after the birth of the Hosokawa  government, beamed as he shook hands with Prime Minister  Hosokawa, saying, "I feel as though I have come home." He may  have had the thought that he built the coalition government.    This was probably because when former prime minister  Miyazawa  and Yamagishi conferred, Yamagishi was treated coldly, without  even a handshake.    Just because a coalition government has been created does  not  mean that Rengo's demands are about to be realized.    In the time of LDP cabinets Rengo kept demanding income tax  reductions. The argument for a broad reduction in income tax as  a decisive factor in a policy to stimulate business conditions  is being advanced from all sides, but the response of the  government is not very different from that in the time of LDP  governments.    The government is adopting a cautious attitude because of  the  problem of revenue sources. An increase in the consumption tax  rate has become a precondition for tax reduction. At one time  Rengo united with the SDPJ and opposed introduction of the  consumption tax.    The situation is now such that an increase in the  consumption  tax cannot be avoided, but if it is this method, it would be  possible to reduce income tax by any amount at all, even if it  were not the coalition government.    Furthermore, the question of starting to pay welfare  pensions  at age 65, which Rengo opposed, has also become a situation in  which it seems likely to be settled in the direction of LDP  governments.    Yamagishi was welcomed warmly by Prime Minister Hosokawa,  but  that does not mean that Rengo's demands, themselves, will be  respected.  <H5>  Is the Breakup of Rengo Also in Sight? </H5>   The Hosokawa cabinet is maintaining a high rate of support  as  usual, but it is probably a matter of a certain kind of  freshness manifesting itself as hope because the characteristic  hue of the Hosokawa cabinet has not been shown in concrete  policy.    It is natural, because the coalition government parties  agreed to carry on LDP government in basic policies, but one  cannot sweep away the question: In that case, what is the  purpose of the coalition government?    Of course, starting with the succession of suspicious  incidents, at the peak is the question of a 500 million yen  contribution from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin to former LDP vice  president Shin Kanemaru, which further developed into questions  of illegal contributions and evasion of taxes on a grand scale.  Needless to say, corruption because of long rule by the LDP  burst forth.    Speaking from that viewpoint, the fact that the coalition  government put an end to the LDP's long rule has great political  significance.    However, Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa was at the core  of  the former Tanaka-former Takeshita faction, which was referred  to during the long rule of the LDP, in particular, as  "one-faction rule," and he controlled a part of power to the  extent that it was spoken of as "Kanemaru-Takeshita-Ozawa."    Because of Kanemaru's resignation from the Diet, the former  Takeshita faction split up, and Ozawa was defeated temporarily  in the power struggle. That Ozawa and his associates, the  Hata-Ozawa faction, endorsed the no-confidence motion against  former Prime Minister Miyazawa and proceeded to form a new party  was Ozawa's counterattack against the anti-Ozawa forces.    The birth of the Hosokawa coalition government was, so to  speak, a concentration of the Ozawa versus anti-Ozawa power  struggle.    In a word, it means that Yamagishi supported Ozawa's  struggle  for power. Power struggles are inseparable from politics. In  that sense, one cannot simply reject them, but what kind of  meaning does the establishment of a non-LDP coalition government  hold for Rengo? That point remains unclear.    Nevertheless, Yamagishi is moving energetically to cause the  SDPJ to turn toward a more realistic line. The SDPJ may cease to  exist even if Yamagishi does not move.    One can pass it off as the trend of the times, but will not  the result be that Rengo will end up also losing the political  base on which it depends?    There is probably also the logical view that, if the SDPJ  ceases to exist, Rengo need only join hands with such new forces  as Shinseito and the Japan New Party; but in that case the  influence of Rengo would become markedly weaker.    Or, I even suspect that Yamagishi might foresee the future  of  Rengo as a national center, and have the breakup of Rengo in his  sights.  <H5>  The Close Relationship of Ozawa and Ikeda </H5>   In contrast with Yamagishi, who acted openly, the one who  did  not once come out publicly, but is said to have supported  Shinseito's Ozawa, is Taisaku Ikeda, honorary chairman of Soka  Gakkai.    The LDP is doing things like demanding that Ikeda be  summoned  as a witness; that is because it is strongly conscious that  Ikeda is behind Ozawa.    Shinseito and Komeito are said to now be in total unity, and  [Ichiro] Ozawa and Komeito Chief Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa have  such a close relationship that they are called the "Ichi-Ichi  combination."    It is said that the greatest factor in Ozawa embarking on  formation of Shinseito was because Soka Gakkai and Komeito  promised complete support.    In Nagata-cho all sorts of information flew about concerning  the relationship of these two.    There are such items as "the Soka Gakkai gave Shinseito's  Ozawa 3 billion yen," or some such, and ones that said "10  billion yen," and "the Soka Gakkai became the guarantor, and  Shinseito received a loan of 5 billion yen from Mitsubishi Bank."    Of course, it is uncertain how much truth there is in these  bits of information. Speaking from the proverb that where there  is smoke there is fire, one can also suspect that there was  probably some providing of funds, and on the other side one can  also say that it is beneficial information. Because there is no  way for anyone other than the persons involved to confirm  questions about funds.    But in the last lower house election, Shinseito's funds were  more abundant than those of the LDP.    The LDP provided each candidate with an endorsement  allowance  of 5 million yen and with 20 million yen for campaign expenses,  but Shinseito gave an endorsement allowance of 5 million yen and  30 million yen for campaign expenses, and it is said that 60  million yen was given, depending on the candidate.    The situation was such that an executive of the Obuchi  faction of the old Takeshita faction, who had once been a close  comrade of the members of Shinseito, was shocked, asking, "Why  does Shinseito have so much money?"    Up till now Soka Gakkai has depended on Kakuei Tanaka and  Noboru Takeshita. As a huge religous organization, Soka Gakkai  has all sorts of problems. There are many problems which require  political power: doubts being raised about it as a religous  corporate entity because of rivalry with the Ishiyamadera sect,  suspicions regarding transactions in paintings by Renoir, it is  being pressed to file revised reports because of a tax audit of  Soka Gakkai headquarters, criticism of the thesis of unity of  politics and religion in Komeito and Soka Gakkai, and so on.    But Takeshita, upon whom the Soka Gakkai relied up till now,  is in the situation of having to leave the LDP because of  intervention of the right wing and gangs when the Takeshita  government began; and with the breakup of the Takeshita faction,  which was his base, he can no longer be relied upon.    To the Soka Gakkai, it was in a situation in which it had to  create a political force on which it could rely. Ikeda sekected  Ozawa as his partner.  <H5>  Soka Gakkai and Komeito Have Influence </H5>   When Ozawa was LDP secretary general, he supported Hisanori  Isomura in the Tokyo gubernatorial election and was defeated, so  he took responsibility for it and resigned the post of secretary  general, but it is said that the one who originally recommended  Isomura as a candidate for governor was Ikeda.    It is judged that the problem of the Tokyo gubernatorial  election was the turning point in the close relationship of  Ozawa and Ikeda. Ichikawa is said to have been their go-between.    It is said that Ozawa never speaks out actively at meetings  of the representatives of the coalition governing parties (made  up of general secretaries and secretary generals). It is said  that the one who has the power to lead the meeting in Ozawa's  stead is Ichikawa, and that has become the conventional wisdom.  To put it in another way, it is probably a matter of the  cooperation between Ozawa and Ichikawa being that close.    It has been reported by all that the selection of Management  and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro Ishida, Posts  and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, Labor Minister  Chikara Sakaguchi, and Environmental Agency Director General  Wakako Hironaka, who joined the Hosokawa cabinet, was done by  Ikeda.    In the last lower house election, Komeito replaced many  candidates with younger ones. Former chairman Junya Yano, for  example, was forced to step down in spite of having had some  years to go before the mandatory retirement age. They cannot win  election unless they have the support of Soka Gakkai. The will  of Soka Gakkai is absolute.    Conversely, if they are endorsed officially by Komeito, 90  percent are elected, without name recognition or anything else.    Komeito counters the LDP's "criticism that it combines  religion and politics" by arguing that "Soka Gakkai is nothing  more than a simple support organization," but it is clear just  by looking at election results that it is not a simple support  organization.    Moreover, Taisaku Ikeda's influence is so strong that Soka  Gakkai is called "the teachings of Ikeda."    It is said that in the last lower house election also  Komeito  and Soka Gakkai supported Shinseito candidates across the board  in election districts where they were not competing with Komeito  candidates.    The "concept of a new new party" is about to become a  reality  between Shinseito and Komeito, and there is no impediment  whatsoever on the Komeito side.    Ichikawa says things like "If it were to become a system of  two major political parties, it would be all right to disband  Komeito," but looking at it in strategic terms, is this not an  attempt to grasp the power of one of the two large political  parties? Because so long as Soka Gakkai exists, its  organizational strength will truly be everlasting.    Ozawa insisted upon "power surpassing that of Komeito" as  the  condition for forming a new party. Was this not because,  speaking from Ozawa's philosophy of numbers being power, he  thought that with a force smaller than Komeito he would be  unable to eliminate the influence of Komeito and Soka Gakkai?    Whatever the situation in the upper house, Shinseito  surpassed Komeito in the lower house. Which means that, in that  point, Ozawa's plan was able to be achieved provisionally.    But in order for Ozawa to continue to maintain influence  within the coalition governing parties, Komeito's cooperation is  indispensible in the current situation. This also means that  Ikeda's support is necessary.    However, there is no talk of Ikeda having made any request  directly to the Hosokawa coalition government.    Yamagishi cannot be compared with Ikeda in strength of real  influence, but Ikeda is in the strange position of not being  able to move in an open manner. It lies in the special nature of  the leader of a religous organization, but on the other hand, it  is also certain that he is an entity which the Hosokawa  coalition government cannot ignore.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by AFP correspondent Francis Kohn] </F>   [Text] Ocosingo, Mexico, 5 Jan (AFP) -- AFP has verified  that after three days of fighting the Mexican Army recovered  control early this morning of Ocosingo, 160 km from Tuxtla  Gutierrez, capital of the southern Mexican State of Chiapas.    The bodies of Zapatista guerrillas in the streets of this  town, with 8,000 residents, are a testimony of the bitter  fighting that took place.    Journalists have verified that Army Infantry Battalions 17  and 73 occupied the city Wednesday morning. Journalists have  counted 37 bodies, apparently members of the Zapatista National  Liberation Army [EZLN], which seized Ocosingo.    Most of the dead had head wounds. Inside the Municipal  Marketplace, where the stench of death pervades the environment,  12 bodies laid. Next to some of them were wooden rifles turned  into rudimentary bayonets.    Armed Forces personnel at the site refused to comment, and  no  official report on the number of casualties has been made.  According to certain reports, however, more than 100 people  could have died in Ocosingo.    The townspeople, who had been hiding for three days, took to  the streets this morning with white flags to inspect the damage.  They covered their noses to avoid the stench.    The mayor's office, located in the main square, and its  interior were burned to a cinder. The neighboring bank saw the  same fate, and the facades of many buildings are riddled with  bullet holes.    Resident Jorge Gomez said that "there were several hundred  guerrillas, and they only brought us misfortune."    According to several witnesses, some of the rebels were  heavily armed, but others--mostly young Indians--carried only  old rifles or machetes.    According to these witnesses, the leaders were not Mexican  but Guatemalan and Salvadoran.    Jorge Gomez added: "I think the peasants were fooled by  professional guerrillas who led them to a carnage."    The road leading to San Cristobal de las Casas and Ocosingo  was blocked with felled trees and large rocks. The Army was all  but absent.    Nevertheless, the presence of the Armed Forces around San  Cristobal was heavy, and the press was barred from that road on  Wednesday.</p>

According to the new  so-called Agents' Law [adopted on 8 March], the parliament's  National Security Committee will have to select three judges  whose duty will be to screen citizens.    Let us start with the most interesting aspect of the law: It  is backdated to 1 January 1994 and will be in force untill 30  June 2000. The relevant documents are closed to inspection  until the year 2030. Well, this puts the whole affair in a  different light. [passage omitted]    [Mecs] [Passage omitted] Back in the autumn of 1990, right  at  the beginning of the parliament's tenure, Gabor Demszky, then  deputy, and Peter Hack, an excellent lawyer, submitted an  excellent bill, which could have settled the matter. The  government parties voted down the proposal, it was not even put  up for debate in the parliament.    Then the government submitted several times a less well  thought out and less clear bill that went on and on. Prime  Minister Peter Boross participated in the debate of the bill in  various capacities -- as a minister without portfolio  supervising the secret services, and later as interior minister,  and finally as prime minister -- and every time he voiced his  doubts.    So, perhaps the kind of behavior that characterizes this  matter is hypocrisy. On the one hand, they were pushing the  propaganda for this bill, on the other, the government and the  government parties did everything in their power to see that  this law should not be adopted until the end of this  parliament's tenure.    And here it is: The parliament adopted a law for the next  parliament in the 11th hour, without sufficient preparation, and  with the hastily thought out proposed amendments of the  Constitutional Committee. And this is morally very  objectionable behavior, and on behalf of my party I dissociate  myself from it. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] However, you personally will have to search for  the judges who will carry out the task of screening. [Passage  omitted] What does not come to light from the Agents' Law is how  far the investigation goes back into the past. For example,  there are questions about whether or not someone was a member of  the Arrow-Cross Party. So how far are we going back -- 40, 50  years? [Mecs] [Passage omitted] It is rather a matter of  principle. However, the law, in its opening paragraphs, lists  the predecessor organizations it applies to and the PRO  [Political Police Department -- Politikai Rendeszeti Osztaly]  that was formed in February 1945, and thus its agent network and  officer corps fall under the law. [passage omitted]    However, on the basis of various considerations, the  government confined the terms of the law to the activities and  employees of the III/3 Department [reference to the Interior  Ministry's secret police group during the communist regime] and  its predecessors. Thus, the informers who worked for the Army  or the military police are exempt, and so are those who were  planted in the emigration abroad and who caused immense damage.  [passage omitted]    However, an even bigger problem is that, in effect, the  implementation of the law will fail because, at the last minute,  the National Assembly's Constitutional Committee smuggled into  the law a provision that covers the editors and editor in chiefs  of privately-owned papers with a circulation exceeding 30,000.  This, we think, is unconstitutional on several counts.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] [Passage omitted] Do you think that the  reporting  of suspected former agents by members of the public will now  become a fashion? [passage omitted]    [Mecs] It is very difficult to make reports like this  because  those in the know are former staff in the Interior Ministry, the  officers of the III/3 Department, and a few leading former  politicians. [passage omitted] However, there is no defense  against slanderous accusations because the amendment that  intended to create the possibility for any citizen to ask for a  vetting against himself was rejected by the National Assembly.  I fear that there will be many sly slanderous charges and  people will not be able to clear themselves. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Are you sure that the documents of the reports  survived? Some people doubt that the documents are authentic.  We know that around the change of the regime there were  cleansing and paper laundering at various departments. [passage  omitted]    [Mecs] [Passage omitted] Indeed, very many papers were  destroyed but even more survived. The staff of Istvan Horvath,  did not select properly, but panicked and had all sorts of  things destroyed. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Did you expect, when debating the law, that  people would confess voluntarily? [passage omitted]    [Mecs] Look, this law is not, in effect, a penal law, it  only  exerts pressure on somebody to resign. He, who -- as a result  of pressure regrettably became involved into the secret service  and has since purified himself, having gone through a catharsis  -- is a valuable person who is acceptable to society.

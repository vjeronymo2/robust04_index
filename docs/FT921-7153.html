			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Textile recovery dependent on the domestic consumer - Daniel Green looks at prospects for the industry THEY ARE leaner. Many of them are fitter. But after a year of false and dashed hopes, UK textile companies are still unable to celebrate even the hint of a recovery The results season which starts on Thursday with Courtaulds Textiles, the second biggest company in the sector, should confirm that 1991 failed to live up to expectations, and could indicate that prospects for recovery in 1992 are equally grim. In the closed season ahead of the figures companies are not allowed to talk about trading. But City analysts are in no doubt that life in the textiles business remains tough. 'We are not looking for any material domestic volume growth this year,' says Hoare Govett. SG Warburg has reduced profit forecasts across the sector for both 1992 and 1993. Textile companies have been hard at work cutting costs. With falling interest rates, this should limit the damage to pre-tax profits. Much of the cost control has come in the form of job losses. The biggest textiles company, Coats Viyella, which reports its final results at the end of March, has laid off more than 10,000 people over the last three years. Courtaulds Textiles cut its workforce early in the recession because it was working on 'pessimistic assumptions', says its chief executive, Mr Martin Taylor. Some aspects of the recession have underpinned margins, if not volumes: Retailers are demanding rapid changes in designs, short production runs, just in time delivery and better quality control. They are prepared to shun the cheapest segment of the market to achieve this, and higher unit prices can mean better margins. Falling inflation eases one of the long term structural problems in the textile industry, that of runaway costs. General inflation is historically higher than the rise in the price of clothes: since 1982 clothing and footwear prices have risen by less than a quarter while the retail prices index is more than 70 per cent up A fall in wool and cotton prices - raw cotton is about one third cheaper than six months ago - has reduced costs for some. And the continued love affair with natural fibres helps repeat sales because artificial fibre mixtures last longer, says Mr David Parker, chairman of Sherwood Group, the third biggest UK sock maker. Textiles companies face increased reliance on their biggest customer, Marks and Spencer. It has suffered less than many of its high street rivals in the recession and plans to increase the number of its outlets in the rest of Europe. The buying power of M and S is one factor that is encouraging the continued consolidation of the UK textiles industry. Coats Viyella is the largest non-food supplier to M and S. Last year it bought thread-maker Tootal after a bitter takeover battle. If Coats' results next month show substantial savings as a result of the acquisition, the commercial pressures for more mergers can only increase. Yet these considerations may have only a marginal effect on the fortunes of the industry. The performance of the economy as a whole remains uppermost in executives' minds. 'The most important factor in this business is still domestic consumer confidence,' says Mr Colin Purvis of the British Textiles Confederation.</p>

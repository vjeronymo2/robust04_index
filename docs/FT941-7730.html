			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Year-end boosts Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, yesterday reported a 28 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 181.2m, following strong contributions from its investment banking and securities trading businesses. The final quarter took profits for the fiscal year 1993 to Dollars 786.1m, compared with Dollars 510.5m the previous year. Net revenues for the final quarter were up 33 per cent to Dollars 925.4m, and for the full year up 38 per cent to Dollars 4.16bn. In the latest quarter, Morgan Stanley's principal trading business - trading securities for itself and its customers - was especially strong, with revenues rising 83 per cent to Dollars 286.1m. During the year, the bank said results from customer-related global fixed-income and equity businesses and commodities and foreign exchange trading were particularly positive. Investment banking revenue in the fourth quarter rose only 7.5 per cent to Dollars 244.9m, but over the year it increased 28 per cent to Dollars 1.24bn, as debt and equity underwriting volume and growth in demand for financial and advisory services both rose. Among its merchant banking deals during 1993, Morgan Stanley singled out the revenues generated by the initial public offering of Southern Pacific Railroad and the second offering of Kohl's Corporation stock. Commission revenues in the quarter rose 35 per cent to Dollars 110.1m, and earnings from asset management and administration climbed 54 per cent to Dollars 74.8m. On the cost side, non-interest expenses rose 35 per cent in the three months to Dollars 677.7m, due primarily to a sharp rise in employee compensation payments, which are linked to the firm's profitability. Morgan Stanley also announced an 11 per cent increase in its regular quarterly dividend to 30 cents, and plans for an additional Dollars 150m buy-back of common stock. During fiscal 1993, the firm strengthened its capital base through issues of new long-term debt and convertible preferred stock. As of January 31, its capital stood at Dollars 9.8bn. Yesterday's results had little impact upon the bank's share price, which was unchanged at Dollars 70 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

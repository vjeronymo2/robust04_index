			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS WIN TO GAIN TIE ATOP WEST;  </P> <P> MCCASKILL DEFEATS RED SOX AS BOTH HE, CLUB CONTINUE SURGES  </P> <P> And on May 17, where did you expect the Angels to be?  </P> <P> Face down, maybe? On the outside looking in? At wit's end . . . or at the  bottom of the American League West standings?  </P> <P> Well, this morning, 38 games into the 1989 baseball season, you can now refer  to them as the first-place California Angels.  </P> <P> Actually, they share the distinction with the Oakland Athletics and the Kansas  City Royals, who also own records of 25-13. But considering where the Angels  have been recently -- last place in '87, 29 games out in '88 -- this is not the  time to quibble.  </P> <P> Tuesday night's 7-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox before 26,043 at Anaheim  Stadium was the Angels' fourth in a row and their 15th in their last 18 games,  equaling the best start in the club's history.  </P> <P> And, fittingly, Kirk McCaskill, the surprise of all Angel surprises, was the  winning pitcher. McCaskill, coming off two injury-ravaged seasons, won for the  fifth time in six decisions, limiting Boston to two runs in eight-plus innings  before turning matters over to reliever Greg Minton.  </P> <P> Moreover, McCaskill stopped the heavy-hitting Red Sox on a night when a bed  might have suited him better than the pitching mound. McCaskill turned in his  eight-plus innings while working with a churning stomach, caused by a touch of  flu.  </P> <P> "The first three innings, I was in a daze," said McCaskill, whose 1.06  earned-run average remains the best in the American League. "After every  inning, (Manager Doug Rader) would ask me, 'How do you feel?' and I said I felt  I could go out there.  </P> <P> "So, he kept putting me out there."  </P> <P> McCaskill hardly dazzled -- he gave up 10 hits and two walks, retiring the side  in order only once -- but he endured. Were it not for a defensive gaffe by  Angel left fielder Chili Davis, McCaskill probably would have limited Boston to  a single run.  </P> <P> The Red Sox scored their first run in the third inning when Davis misjudged a  fly ball by Wade Boggs, letting the ball sail over his head for a triple. Boggs  then scored on a single by Marty Barrett.  </P> <P> Other than that, the only run Boston could manage against McCaskill came in the  fourth, when Dwight Evans beat out an infield single to deep shortstop and  scored on a double by Jody Reed.  </P> <P> "Considering he had a stomach virus, I thought he did a remarkable job," Rader  said. "I wanted him to get through five innings -- and he almost finished the  game. That's very much to his credit."  </P> <P> McCaskill's surprising stamina also impressed Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan.  </P> <P> "I didn't think he'd last as long as he did," Morgan said. "He looked sneaky as  hell in the beginning, not as good later, but he hung in there."  </P> <P> Of course, seven runs and 12 hits can make hanging in there an easier  proposition. The Angels scored on their first at-bat of the game, received four  RBIs from Johnny Ray and knocked starter Mike Smithson (1-3) out of the game  before the fourth inning was complete.  </P> <P> Claudell Washington led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run off  Smithson, his third of the season, giving McCaskill an instant 1-0 advantage.  </P> <P> After Boston forged a momentary 1-1 tie in the top of the third, the Angels  reclaimed the lead in the bottom of the inning when Washington doubled and  scored in front of Ray's first home run of the season.  </P> <P> Ray, who also singled in the first inning, added a run-scoring double in the  fourth inning and drove in a fourth run with a sixth-inning sacrifice fly.  Despite missing three weeks because of a wrist injury, Ray is tied with Davis  on the club with 17 RBIs, trailing only Devon White with 22.  </P> <P> Washington added two RBIs and matched Ray's hit output with a home run, a  double and a single. Wally Joyner contributed a double and a single, Lance  Parrish had an RBI double and Jack Howell, beginning to show signs of life with  the bat, added three singles to raise his batting average from .170 to .192.  </P> <P> "Every night, somebody picks up somebody else," Ray said. "Last night, it was  Devo. It's not one player doing it all -- it's a mix."  </P> <P> And that mix, Ray suggested, is all the more potent, now that the Angels have  mixed in a few veteran players who have experienced the sensation of winning.  </P> <P> "Claudell, Bert Blyleven, Parrish -- we've got guys who are competitive and  think they can win," Ray said. "That has an effect on the other players."  </P> <P> It is still early, very early, but so far, that effect has been enough to stir  a team that sleepwalked through a season-ending 12 consecutive defeats in 1988.  </P> <P> "All this means is that we're all playing pretty good," Rader said, trying to  downplay the three-way tie for first place. "It's too early to get excited  about that. But we're happy to be in the position we're in."  </P> <P> As they say, it sure beats the alternative, which had been the Angel way ever  since 1986.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Tony Armas' comeback lasted all of one day. After spending 35 days on the  disabled list because of a strained left hamstring, Armas was re-activated for  Monday's game. He played five innings at first base, long enough to  re-aggravate the injury. Tuesday, after having the hamstring examined by team  physician Lewis Yocum, Armas was returned to the 15-day disabled list. The  Angels recalled first baseman-outfielder Jim Eppard from Edmonton to fill the  roster vacancy. Angel Manager Doug Rader called Armas' injury "a shame. He  worked so hard to come back and we tried to put him at a position that would be  less stressful on his legs. But it was going to happen some time, if that's all  it took to re-injure it. Evidently, he's had an awful lot of damage in there  over the years. The degree of scar tissue must be tremendous." Eppard, who  batted .283 in 56 games with the Angels last year, was hitting .243 with one  home run and 13 runs batted in this year with Edmonton. He is expected to join  the club tonight.  </P> <P> Not wanting to risk having another player return to the disabled list, Rader  kept shortstop Dick Schofield (groin injury) out of the starting lineup.  Monday, Schofield played four innings in relief of Kent Anderson, but  complained of more discomfort afterward. "The groin is bothering him again,"  Rader said. "He's probably going to need a couple of days to get over it, once  and for all. It's nothing serious, but it's enough to be aggravating.". . .  After undergoing a successful cornea transplant in his right eye, Angel owner  Gene Autry was released from a hospital Tuesday and is expected to be present  for tonight's induction of Jim Fregosi in the Angel hall of fame. Fregosi, a  six-time All-Star shortstop and the first Angel manager to win a division  championship, becomes the second member of the hall of fame, joining 1988  inductee Bobby Grich. Angel first base coach Bobby Knoop, Fregosi's double-play  partner during the 1960s, and KTLA broadcaster Bob Starr will also participate  in the pregame ceremony.  </P> <P> The first day of the Boston Red Sox's first visit to Anaheim this season wasn't  entirely a day at the park. Third baseman Wade Boggs spent 3 1/2 hours in  Irvine with Margo Adams and lawyers, giving depositions in preparation for  their scheduled trial, while Red Sox teammates spent the day trying to avoid  getting subpoenaed. Among those targeted by Adams' attorney, James McGee, are  Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Rich Gedman, Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd and Marty Barrett.  McGee claimed Rice and Evans had been successfully served, but both players  denied receiving subpoenas. And how did the deposition hearing go? "It wasn't  something you'd take your family to," Boggs said.  </P> <P> DODGERS RAINED OUT  </P> <P> Even though Tuesday's game is postponed, Fernando Valenzuela will keep his spot  in the rotation and pitch tonight.

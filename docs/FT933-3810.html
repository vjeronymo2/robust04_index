			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Scoop puts Unilever on US map - Frank McGurty on Kraft's sale of its entire frozen dessert business ICE CREAM is one of life's simple pleasures, but keeping pace with the fickle tastes of ice cream fanciers has become a complex challenge for the world's big consumer products groups. For Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group and Europe's biggest ice cream producer, the product accounts for an estimated 30 per cent of its food profits. But for Kraft General Foods, America's largest producer, ice cream has been a source of repeated frustration. Growth has been lacklustre, its margins soft and the market share of its key brands - Breyers and Sealtest - has eroded. This week Kraft, part of the Philip Morris tobacco and food group, decided that it had had enough. It announced that Unilever had agreed to buy its entire US frozen dessert business, with annual sales of about Dollars 500m. Added to Unilever's existing US turnover of about Dollars 200m, the acquisition vaults the Anglo-Dutch group to the top of the US league table, with almost a fifth of a market worth about Dollars 3bn annually. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed but analysts say the price was about Dollars 300m. For Unilever, the move represents another step in a strategy of diversifying its product range in the US, and follows its purchase of several smaller US ice cream concerns. The acquisition 'puts Unilever on the map' in the US, says Mr Jack Salzman, who follows the food industry for Goldman Sachs, the New York securities house. Indeed, the size of the Kraft business and the strong name recognition of the Kraft brands offer Unilever an opportunity to build on its strengths, and perhaps to replicate its success in the Dollars 4bn European market, where it commands a 40 per cent share. Until now, Unilever has focused on the so-called 'novelty' segment, with ice cream bars and other confections made for immediate consumption. The Kraft business, which packages most of its products in large containers and sells them through supermarkets, introduces Unilever into the US bulk ice cream sector, the biggest part of the market. At the same time, however, Unilever inherits many of the problems faced by Kraft. Overall, sales of bulk ice creams are growing at a sluggish 2 per cent rate, according to Nielsen Market Research. Breyers and Sealtest are faring even worse, with the brands' combined sales contracting in the year to June 15. The duo still commands more than 15 per cent of supermarket sales; and Breyers is still number one, but its share and the size of its lead have been shrinking. The challenge has come at both the high and low ends. On one hand, consumers have shown more willingness to seek out bargains, as they have in many grocery categories. Generic or 'private label' ice creams now account for more than 28 per cent of supermarket sales. Growth has largely come at the expense of the national brands such as Seal-test on the lower end of the branded spectrum. In response to strong price competition, Kraft was forced virtually to 'give the product away', according to Mr Howard Waxman, editor of the Ice Cream Reporter, an industry newsletter. Operating margins were hovering at about 2 per cent, according to one analyst's estimate, much less than the 8 to 10 per cent margins which Kraft realises on its more profitable lines. The highest profitability in the business is found at the opposite end - the super-premiums. By catering to the whimsy of ice cream fanciers and their inclination to indulge in the best quality, spare-no-expense super-premiums such as Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade and Grand Metropolitan's Haagen Dazs have flourished, while the premium segment, led by Breyers, has wilted. As part of its acquisition, Unilever picks up Kraft's super-premium ice cream, Frusen Gladje. With the Kraft brands being squeezed at both ends, what attractions did the business hold for Unilever? Mr Salzman points out that the deal provides Unilever with an excellent channel for distributing its novelty lines to US supermarkets. Production facilities in several states are also included. However, Unilever may need to invest heavily in building its own direct-to-store distribution system if it expects the business to grow - a move Kraft was reluctant to make. While the acquisition will bolster Unilever's US presence, it also presents dangers. Margins are far less than it realises in its European ice cream business, and Breyers and Sealtest show little promise of rebounding. Consequently, most observers expect the group will look for 'synergies'. One possibility is Unilever using the Breyers name to create cross-over products which capitalise on the unusual flavours and ingredients of its novelty lines. Unilever declined to comment on its plans for the business. It has the luxury of time. The acquisition comes at summer's end and the group can wait several months before acting. It is apparent, however, that a fresh marketing strategy is essential if Unilever is to succeed where Kraft did not. 'If they are going to stand pat, then they probably haven't done a smart thing in buying the business,' says Mr Waxman. 'But if they are going to create something new, then Unilever may just pull the rabbit out of the hat.'</p>

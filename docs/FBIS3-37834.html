However, there was hope  for the future, he added.    He mentioned in a televised interview that Head of the  Georgian delegation, Jaba Ioseliani, had made a statement on the  'ethnic cleansing' carried out in the Abkhazian region of Ghali.  Ioseliani also blamed the Abkhazian party for failure of the  agreements on return of refugees to this region achieved at the  previous January round of the negotiations.    A member of the Abkhazian delegation, Plenipotentiary  Representative of Abkhazia to the Western Europe, Vyacheslav  Chirikba, stressed that the negotiations were hampered by the  categorical and uncompromising statements of the Georgian  delegation, which impeded the negotiations and adoption of  constructive decisions."    According to him, the Abkhazian party continues to stand for  deployment of peacekeeping forces on the Georgian-Abkhazian  border of the Inguri River. The Georgian delegation insisted  that these forces be brought to Abkhazia to control all its  territory.    Speaking on return of refugees, Chirikba said that the  Abkhazian delegation had confirmed the preparedness to receive  all refugees except those who had committed military crimes  against Abkhazians.    Chirikba announced that the parties had put forward their  proposals on the status of Abkhazia which was to be discussed in  a few days.    The Abkhazian plenipotentiary representative's press service  told Interfax that three main issues were to be considered in  Geneva - refugees, the status of Abkhazia and deployment of the  peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone.    The Abkhazian delegation is headed by Abkhazian Premier  Sokrat Jinjoliya. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister, Boris  Pastukhov, represents the Russian party.</p>

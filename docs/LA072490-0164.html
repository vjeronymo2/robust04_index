			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOFT MARKET CITED AS DOW PROFITS FALL 50% ON 4.5% SALES RISE  </P> <P> Dow Chemical Co. said today that a soft market for its plastics and chemical  products cut second-quarter profits 50% despite a 4.5% increase in sales.  </P> <P> The second quarter is usually Dow's strongest, but sales volume failed to  increase from the first quarter and anticipated price increases didn't  materialize, the company said.  </P> <P> "Industry fundamentals weakened in early June and are softer than a year ago  when demand and prices were near all-time highs and supply generally was  tight," said Enrique C. Falla, Dow financial vice president.  </P> <P> In addition, plant maintenance shutdowns and production outages in several  plants increased Dow's manufacturing costs, the company said.  </P> <P> Dow said net income fell to $364 million, or $1.34 a share, for the three  months ended June 30, from $728 million, or $2.70 a share, for the second  quarter of 1989.  </P></p>

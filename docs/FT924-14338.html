			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Sterling rates softer CASH rates in the sterling money market continued to ease yesterday as traders grew increasingly confident that the Bundesbank would reduce official rates at its council meeting next week, writes James Blitz. There were rumours that the UK authorities would reduce base rates in the morning because the currency rallied to DM2.5106 against the D-Mark overnight, but the rate cut did not materialise. Nevertheless, the market continues to be caught up in speculation that a cut in German official rates is in the offing. How likely is such a cut ? The speculation is founded on the recent trimming of the rates at which the Bundesbank deals in the German money market down to 8.9 per cent, a level 60 basis points below the Lombard rate. This suggests that the Bundesbank could take 50 basis points off the Lombard rate, currently at 9.5 per cent, without affecting the structure of market rates. However, Miss Alison Cottrell, an international analyst at Midland Montagu in London, suggested that the Bundesbank may not ease official rates for some time yet. The huge interventions to support European currencies in recent weeks would make an official easing unlikely. For the moment, the market is putting its money on a cut before December. The December Euromark futures contract finished the week at 91.79, roughly unchanged on the day, a level that presupposes that German 3 month money will be at 8.21 per cent at the year end. The December Sterling contract closed at 91.86, down 3 basis points on the day, assuming that 3-month money will be at 8.14 per cent by the year's end. Cash rates in the sterling money market were also softer. Three-month money, a key indicator of how the market thinks base rates are moving, closed at 8 13/16 per cent on the offered side, down  1/16 per cent on the day. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. In the morning, it purchased Pounds 361m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, Pounds 101m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 332m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent. In further operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 188m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 25m of Band 2 bank bills, providing late assistance of Pounds 65m.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Bank casts a wider net to fund PSBR - Capital &amp; Credit After last year's effortless run, the Bank of England may find funding the UK public sector borrowing requirement more of a challenge this year, especially if difficult market conditions persist. However, a much lower PSBR for the current financial year, coupled with the Bank's increasingly innovative approach to gilt issuance, is unlikely to make supply a major problem for the gilt market, most analysts say. Helped by falling interest rates and a global bond market rally, funding last year's Pounds 45.9bn PSBR was child's play, enabling the Bank to overfund by an estimated Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn. Overseas investors, including highly leveraged hedge funds, were keen buyers of gilts - but that backfired early this year, when many overseas players dumped their positions amid widespread inflation jitters and rising US interest rates, all of which sent world bond markets into a tailspin. Having posted the most spectacular gains last year, the gilt market was especially badly hit. Salomon Brothers' World Government Bond Index shows 10-year gilts have fallen by 7.96 per cent in the year to date. The ultra-long end has fared even worse, dropping about 10 per cent. Funding the deficit, albeit a much smaller one, may prove more tricky in these conditions. Investors are keeping a low profile, preferring large cash positions to braving the unpredictable market. Moreover, many gilt houses have suffered heavy losses, prompting some to reduce their exposure sharply . The most recent casualty was discount house Gerrard &amp; National, which pulled out of gilt market-making last week saying 'the obligations and risks of gilt-edged market-making exceed the benefits and rewards'. Still, most economists don't expect the gilt market to be overwhelmed by this year's funding programme. With an estimated Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn overfunding from last year to carry forward, one auction under the belt and the Pounds 6.8bn of bank and building society purchases from 1992 - 93 also going towards this year's funding, 'our PSBR forecast of Pounds 35bn (compared with the Treasury's Pounds 38bn) implies net gilt sales of around half that completed in the last year', says Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. This implies that Pounds 12bn, or roughly a third of the funding for this year, has already been completed. What is more, the Bank of England appears to have adopted a more innovative stance, as illustrated by its recent issue of floating-rate gilts, the first since 1979. By issuing floaters, the Bank is 'tapping a different source of institutional cashflow', says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. 'They're widening the net and are attracting banks and monetary institutions who may not have looked at gilts.' Floaters have a particular appeal to banks and building societies, which buy them to match their short-term liquidity needs. They also attract investors who expect interest rates to rise over coming years and want bonds whose coupons will increase as rates rise. For the government, 'floating-rate funding has the advantage of securing finance, without worries about bunching or refinancing, while enabling the Exchequer to benefit from a further fall in interest rates', says Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu. While non-bank appetite for floaters may be limited, bank demand could be more substantial, he says. At its recent auction of 6 per cent gilts due 1999, the Bank made another small shift from its usual approach: rather than being partly paid (where investors pay for only a portion of the paper and settle the rest several weeks later, delaying the fungibility of the paper with the existing stock), the issue was fully paid and the bonds immediately became fungible. This relieved a technical shortage in the five-year benchmark stock, traders said. Talk of other possible innovations includes convertible gilts, where the Bank issues shorter-dated paper that can be converted into long-dated stock at a later stage. It hasn't issued convertibles since the late 1970s but their appeal to investors at times of interest rate uncertainty may prompt the Bank to revive the instrument. Moreover, the conversion into longer-dated stock would allow the Bank back-door access to the long end of the yield curve, which it has been starving of supply for months because it does not want to lock in excessively high rates for the long term. Concentrating issuance at the short end - seven out of the last eight auctions were for gilts of 10 years or less - has led to severe illiquidity at the ultra-long end, causing the yield curve to flatten markedly. However, few observers believe the Bank is completely boycotting the long end. 'We would expect some long and ultra-long issuance this year, but while yields are at current levels we expect it to be taps rather than a full-blown auction,' says Mr Briscoe. Most analysts expect the Bank to hold another 10 auctions this year, each raising about Pounds 2bn to Pounds 2.5bn, with the remainder raised through tap issues of existing stock.</p>

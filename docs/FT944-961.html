			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks on nutmeg pact break down The world's two major nutmeg producers have suspended negotiations on a new joint marketing agreement amid concerns about the involvement of a European marketing company and will resume their discussions in March. Indonesia and Grenada, which account for 75 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, of world nutmeg production, have been seeking a marketing agreement to stabilise world prices for the spice. Grenadian producers have objected to the involvement in the talks of BerCatz, a marketing company, which would get a 5 per cent commission on sales under the agreement with the producers. 'The Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association is totally opposed to any joint marketing arrangement which gives BerCatz a percentage, simply because the company is not a producer,' said Mr Cliff Robertson, chairman of the association. Grenadian producers would back a new agreement only if it was between producers of Grenada and Indonesia, as this was the only way to achieve a higher price for the commodity on the international market, he said. Producers in the two countries have been trying to agree on a protocol to stabilise and then to increase world market prices but have steered clear of recreating their cartel, which collapsed six years ago following the liberalisation of the industry in Indonesia. While not planning to set prices, the producers want to co-operate in monitoring the volume of the spice offered for sale on the world market. Before the talks were suspended, producers in both countries were discussing proposals to keep supply at about 9,500 tonnes per year, marginally less than current world demand and 2,500 tonnes less than the current combined production of both countries.</p>

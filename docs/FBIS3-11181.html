We received no immediate replies. The  righteousness of our struggle was getting lost amid slander and  mistrust. Only one reply reached us at the time and it was that  of our brothers in the Civic Action National Coordinating Board  for National Liberation (CONAC-LN), who offered the support of  their legal commission.    We stated our thanks for this gesture, and we gave these  people our trust. They will do everything within their power to  legally support us. Our needs are great. We welcome the  devotion and selflessness of our brothers in the CONAC-LN, and  we address the Mexican people to ratify what we recently told  these brothers: All the legal affairs of the EZLN will be  entrusted to the CONAC-LN's legal commission.    Liberty! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully yours, from the  Mexican Southeast.    [Signed] CCRI-CG of the EZLN    [Dated] Mexico, March 1994</p>

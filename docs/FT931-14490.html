			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Italian Bonds: D-Mark issue may boost treasury's confidence BY increasing its debut D-Mark Eurobond to DM5bn from DM4bn last week, the Republic of Italy highlighted the level of interest in its paper, in spite of uncertainties over the government and bankers' discontent about the liquidation of the Efim state holding company. The Deutsche Bank-led deal should give the treasury confidence to issue further Eurobonds to reduce its over-dependence on the domestic bond market. Economists have long called on Italy to diversify its borrowings in view of punishing levels of lira interest rates. With the new government having sought to cut spending and raise revenues through a L93,000bn (Dollars 62bn) 1993 budget reduction package, by far the bulk of the budget deficit now comes from interest payments on past debt. In the past three years, Italy has extended its debt profile. First seven, then 10-year domestic bonds were introduced, to a warm welcome from investors. The longer-term paper has allowed the treasury to improve debt management by reducing its exposure to market every time a huge slice of short-term bills has to be rolled over. However, short-term paper of less than a year's maturity remains the mainstay of the debt mountain. Only gradually will longer term domestic issues, and, just possibly, more Eurobonds, bite into the stock of debt, making it easier to manage, and, the authorities hope, cheaper to finance. Last week's D-Mark deal showed it could be done. The current 5 percentage point spread between five-year D-Mark and lira interest rates highlights the appeal of borrowing in the German currency. True, there is an exchange rate risk, but most economists believe the lira-DM exchange rate of around L925 seriously undervalues the Italian currency. The treasury could even come out at a profit. Borrowing D-Marks also allows the Italians to replenish their heavily depleted reserves and perhaps build up ammunition for future defences once the lira re-enters the exchange rate mechanism. Tapping the D-Mark market could also help the Bank of Italy repay the Bundesbank the L27,000bn in assistance given during last year's foreign exchange turmoil, although some economists believe the bulk has already been repaid. A further boost to Italy's coffers could come with formal approval today from EC finance ministers for an Ecu8bn multi-tranche balance of payments loan, approved by the EC's monetary committee last week. Mr Mario Draghi, the treasury's director-general, says Italy could raise up to Dollars 15bn this year on the Euromarkets. Mr Draghi stressed the Dollars 10bn to Dollars 15bn borrowing range was not a fixed target, but would depend on market conditions and bankers' advice. But with their first D-Mark deal successfully put away, the temptation will surely be to press on. Domestic political factors play an important part in that calculation. For Mr Giuliano Amato's government, success on the international capital markets has far wider implications than might be expected. After the buffeting of the Efim affair and last year's downgrading of its credit rating, Italian ministers have heralded the D-Mark bond as a sign of restored confidence and recognition that Italy's finances are on the mend. Hence bankers are wondering how the Italians will divide the rest of the money they would like to borrow in 1993. More D-Mark issues are a strong possibility, given the attractive terms for last week's Italy bond. The conclusion is that Italy will launch many more transactions - when virtually guaranteed of their success.</p>

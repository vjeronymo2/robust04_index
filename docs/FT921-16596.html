			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Quiet end to 1991 THE MONEY markets ended 1991 on a quiet note with little change in interest rates in the main market centres before the new year holiday. In London the key three months inter-bank rate was unchanged at 11-10 15/16 per cent, with dealers still anticipating a  1/2 point rise in base rates early this year. Six months money was also unchanged at 11-10 15/16 per cent and one year money was steady at 10 15/16 - 13/16 per cent. Money dealers said the pressures from the rise in German interest rates before Christmas continue to be felt in the London market. Sterling's weakness inside the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System raises the possibility that the UK will be forced to follow other European governments and raise British interest rates. The differential between market rates and base rates could also put pressure on the banking system and eventually force the government to concede higher rates. On Tuesday, however, sterling was slightly firmer against the D-Mark and this took some of the immediate pressure off market rates. This was reflected in the futures market, where the March short sterling contract rose slightly as the pound gained in strength. The March contract finished 2 basis points higher at 89.21, having traded between 89.16 and 89.23. The March contract currently implies an interest rate of 10.79 per cent. In the cash market, overnight money rates fell as the Bank of England once again initially provided the market with more than enough liquidity for its daily credit needs. The Bank began by forecasting a large money market shortage of Pounds 1.4bn. Maturing treasury bills and assistance drained Pounds 696m, while bills repurchased by the market absorbed a further Pounds 821m. Exchequer transactions drained Pounds 150m and bankers balances below target a further Pounds 70m. This was partly offset by a fall in the note circulation which added Pounds 325m of liquidity. Across the rest of Europe, French rates continued to firm despite an injection of liquidity by the Bank of France. Call money rose to 10- 13/16 per cent from 10 5/8 - 3/4 per cent. Dealers said the failure of the franc to respond to the rise in French interest rates was behind the rise in market rates.</p>

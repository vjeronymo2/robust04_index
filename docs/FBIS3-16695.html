			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar -- In the first six months of 1994 it  is envisaged that a form of compensation should be retained by  increasing pensions in line with the growth in consumer prices.  From 1 February compensation to pensioners is to be increased  from 11,700 rubles to 20,000 rubles and from 1 May to 29,600  rubles. This was reported today at a session of the Russian  Federation Government Presidium by Vasiliy Barchuk, chairman of  the board of Russia's pension fund, during an examination of the  draft budget of the fund for the first six months of 1994.    He explained that the fund's draft budget presupposes that  its income amounts to almost 17 trillion rubles, and its  expenditure to approximately 16 trillion rubles. Of the  budget's income, 16.1 trillion rubles derive from insurance  contributions from employers and citizens, and 784 billion  rubles come from the republican budget.    In his speech Vasiliy Barchuk drew attention to the "need to  ensure the timely payment of state pensions, otherwise we will  have serious social conflicts."    In this connection Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that "the  government cannot allow pension payments to be overdue; we have  to act in a precise manner here." The chairman of the  government has warned leaders of the regions which delay  payments to the pension fund that this practice is inadmissible.  At the suggestion of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the draft budget of  the Russian Federation pension fund for the first six months of  1994 was approved as a whole by the presidium of the government.</p>

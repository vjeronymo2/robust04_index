			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] In Malawi the consensus seems to be that the  election campaigns have gone off without conflict, but concern  has been expressed over allegations of voter intimidation  involving the traditional Nyau groups in the rural areas. From  Malawi Andrew Meldrum reports:    Those drum beats and war cries are the trademark signs of  Malawi's much feared Nyau dancers. The Nyau dancers have become  a controversial element of Malawi's election campaign. There  are charges that the dancers have been intimidating rural people  from attending opposition rallies and from registering to vote.  The numerous Nyau societies costly guard their secrecy and it  is taboo for the dancers to be seen without a mask completely  covering their faces. Some Nyau masks are covered with  feathers, others are of large grimacing faces.    For the past 20 years Malawi President Hastings Kamuzu Banda  and his Malawi Congress Party [MCP] have used many Nyau dancers  for their political purposes. The Nyau would force villagers to  attend a congress party rally, for instance, or would attack a  rural person who had been criticizing the ruling party.    Now there are many complaints that the Nyau dancers have  been  intimidating rural voters in Malawi's election campaign.  Charles Joya, spokesman for the Independent Electoral  Commission, explains why his group launched a formal complaint  against the Nyau dancers.    [Begin recording] [Joya] The Nyau dancers have been used to  disturb meetings of other political parties. It has been mainly  confined to those districts in the central region, but in the  past few weeks we haven't had any major problem in that area, so  maybe the parties who were using the Nyau dancers have stopped  using them, but that was a problem particularly about a month or  two months ago.    [Meldrum] Charles Joya said incidents of Nyau intimidation  significantly decreased after the Electoral Commission issued a  report in April making specific allegations. Nyau dancers are  colorful and exciting, but the Electoral Commission says the  secret society should not be frightening or otherwise  influencing Malawi's rural voters. [end recording]    Well, if there is anyone in Malawi who should have their  finger on the policy regarding some of these allegations of  intimidation and vote-buying it is the Reverend Aaron Longwe.  Director of a local human rights organization, he was inspired  to start the group in 1992 after various spells in prison, and  after a year of operating in secret, he received government  recognition. Well, his organization has been monitoring the  election campaign. Andrew Meldrum asked him if these  allegations were indeed true.    [Begin recording] [Longwe] These are true stories. One of  our field officers has been to quite a number of places  following up such cases. It is indeed true, most specially in  the central region, where the Malawi Congress Party leadership  have gone out with the chiefs to confiscate or to buy  registration certificates from voters. It is indeed that the  Nyau dancers as well have threatened or disrupted the rallies in  many places, also in Dowa, Kasungu and Nchinji. We have also  had cases of the Young Pioneers who have been going disguising  themselves as MCP opposition members and disrupting other  people's meetings.    [Meldrum] So, you do believe that human rights issues are  very important in this first multiparty election that Malawi is  having in 30 years?    [Longwe] Human rights is quite very important. So far, we  have been issuing press releases condemning all these atrocious  things that are taking place in this country. We are condemning  the leadership both from the ruling party, as well as the  opposition, and we have been trying to raise an awareness  through the media, explaining to them of the importance of human  rights.    [Meldrum] Do you think Malawian people, particularly in the  rural areas, have an appreciation for human rights, and that  they are willing to work to maintain the human rights that they  have won?    [Longwe] They are very ready. We had some ladies who came  from the rural areas, it was so encouraging to hear them express  themselves by saying that now we have got our own freedom, and  we shall never lose it, and we shall fight for it.    [Meldrum] You believe that tribalism and regionalism is a  problem here in Malawi?    [Longwe] These are two main big problems. Even now in our  campaign trails, we assume these are becoming more and more  clearer that even the leaders themselves they are advocating  regionalism and tribalism, which is very sad.    [Meldrum] Now, there are many people who say that because of  Malawi's long history of repression, whoever wins, either the  MCP, or the Aford [Alliance for Democracy] or UDF [United  Democratic Front] will take on the same strong measures, the  same repression that had been used before. Do you think the  Malawi people will allow that, and what will your organization  do?    [Longwe] So far, as a human rights organization, we have  simply asked for a commission of inquiry, and what we want is  simply accountability and scrutiny to the past atrocities. We  don't want to incriminate anybody, but we simply want to address  these issues, so that they are not repeated, through the human  commission, which I believe, soon after the general elections  shall be placed. We shall make sure that no one is deprived or  is arbitrarily thrown back into prison, or that there is  vengeance in this country. We shall make sure that we control  the whole situation.

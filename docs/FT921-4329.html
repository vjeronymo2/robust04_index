			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Insurers are 'losing out' in Europe THE BRITISH insurance industry, traditionally regarded as a world leader, is losing out in the European market, according to research published by Datamonitor, a London-based management consultancy. Barriers to cross-border competition in Europe have been broken down in the past five years, and leading French, Swiss and German companies have increased their share of the European market while most UK companies have made little impact. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers, yesterday said the report ignored a number of initiatives by UK companies on the Continent in recent years. Datamonitor says UK companies have chosen to expand in north America and Australasia. Nevertheless its figures, which cover Europe's 15 largest insurers, show that UK companies have been unable to increase significantly their already small shares of Continental markets. The report adds: 'British presence in emerging insurance markets such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece is well behind that of its European competitors.' The research suggests tough regulatory regimes in many European countries have dissuaded many UK companies from expanding in continental Europe. Mr Ian Harcus, one of the authors of the report, said: 'UK insurance managers are used to a much freer rein.' Of the UK's leading insurers, only Commercial Union has made headway. It earned 32.7 per cent of its European premium income from outside the UK, although this largely reflected the strength of its Dutch subsidiary Delta Lloyd, acquired in the early 1970s. French insurers - whether mainly state-owned such as Union des Assurances de Paris or mainly privately-owned such as Groupe Victoire - have been in the forefront of European expansion. Victoire, which bought Germany's second-biggest company, Colonia, in 1989, now derives nearly 46 per cent of its European business from outside France. Victoire and UAP increased the amount of their non-French European business by 107 per cent and 65.8 per cent respectively between 1986 and 1990. Europe's biggest insurer, Allianz of Germany, has also expanded aggressively in Europe. It derives 48.7 per cent of premium income from Europe outside Germany. Switzerland's leading insurers, Zurich, which earns 45.8 per cent of its European income from outside Switzerland, and Winterthur, earning 39.9 per cent outside the country, are also well placed.

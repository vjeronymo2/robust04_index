			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Japanese institutions forsake the world's investment markets Japan's life insurers, among the world's largest institutional investors, and once the most aggressive in pursuing investment opportunities overseas, put almost no money into foreign securities in the six months to the end of September, a leading industry official said yesterday. Mr Takahide Sakurai, chairman of the Life Assurance Association of Japan, said life insurers had poured all of the net increase in their assets during the period into long-term domestic fixed interest securities, loans and yen-denominated public and corporate bonds. They had also transferred money from short-term funds into those instruments. Mr Sakurai's remarks confirm unofficial reports that the insurance companies' have continued to abstain from investing abroad so far this year. That abstention has been a principal factor in the strength of the Japanese yen in foreign exchange markets. In the first half of the current financial year, which ends next March, the life insurers' total assets increased by about 7.5 per cent from a year earlier, Mr Sakurai said. But while domestic stock investment was 'neutral', there had been almost no overseas investment. In the 1980s, as Japanese savings increased rapidly and the insurance market was liberalised, life insurance companies invested heavily in overseas securities. Between 1986 and 1990, their holdings of foreign securities quadrupled, reaching Y17,800bn (Pounds 112bn), more than 15 per cent of their total assets. Since then, following heavy losses on both fixed interest and equity investment, mainly as a result of a rising yen, they have scaled back their investments abroad, and for the last three years have been repatriating funds. This year their portfolio of foreign securities is expected to fall to close to 10 per cent of their total assets. Mr Sakurai said the life insurers, who will report their half-year results later this month, would not see an early recovery in their earnings. 'We still can't see the brightness in the economy', so often referred to in official government economic reports, he said.</p>

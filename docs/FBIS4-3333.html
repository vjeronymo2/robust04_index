			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cai Hong from the "Opinion" page: "Decrees </F> Construct Legal Basis for Religious Rights"]    [Text] Two decrees issued by the State Council earlier  this year will ensure legal protection for legitimate religious  activities and exchanges between Chinese religious groups and  their overseas counterparts on the basis of friendliness and  mutual respect, according to a prestigious figure in China's  religious circle.    "The two mandates mean a breakthrough in establishing a  legal  framework for China's religious sector," said Dr Han Wenzhao,  vice-president of the China Christian Council.    The decrees issued on January 31, are the Regulations for  the  Control of Sites of Religious Activities and the Regulations for  the Control of Religious Activities of Aliens in the Territory  of the People's Republic of China.    In drafting the regulations, Chinese authorities solicited  opinions of the religious circles.    "We are satisfied with the decrees," Han said, "since the  two  regulations will act as legal protection for normal religious  activities and exchanges between Chinese religious groups and  their overseas counterparts on the basis of equality and mutual  respect."    The two laws affirm the Chinese authorities respect for  foreigners' religious freedoms. Aliens are guaranteed the right  to participate in normal religious activities and to have  friendly exchanges with Chinese religious circles.    According to Han, the edicts have seized headlines and  gripped imaginations abroad. Some foreigners assumed the  regulations meant that new controls would be imposed on  religious activities in China.    "Most of the foreign articles I have read are inaccurate,"  Han said. He criticized reports that triggered unnecessary  apprehension among the overseas friends who are concerned with  Chinese affairs.    He maintained that the two rules would be instrumental to  encouraging Chinese religious associations' ongoing friendly  exchanges with their counterparts in other countries.    "If there are some restrictions, they are designed for the  foreigners who are engaged in illegal, guileful activities in  China," Han said.    The regulations uphold the principle articulated in China's  Constitution that the country's religious groups and religious  affairs should not be directed by overseas forces. No foreigner  should interfere in China's religious affairs.    The eighth article of the regulations on the management of  religious activities of aliens, for example stipulates that  "foreigners must not set up religious organizations, offices or  sites in China, recruit religious followers among Chinese  citizens, or appoint religious ecclesiastics."    Just 10 days after the promulgation of the two laws, seven  people from the Hong Kong Revival Christian Church, including  the Reverend Dennis Balcomb, were detained for several days in  Henan Province for their illicit religious activities.    The incident touched off erroneous stories in some overseas  newspapers.    The Reverend Balcomb is not a new name in China. He wrote a  statement of repentance several years ago when he was given a  serious warning for similar illegal undertakings, Han said.    Today, peace and development are the common pursuits of  people worldwide, requiring an environment of conciliation.  Objective and accurate reporting will help create better  understanding between different peoples.    Although the Cold War has drawn to a close, the influence of  the media from that time lingers. Quite a few people abroad  have taken it for granted that the atheistic Chinese Communist  Party (CPC), the ruling party in China, racks its brains to wipe  out religion.    "Biased, they turn a blind eye to or disbelieve in the  achievements made by the State's religious policies," Han said.    The reality of' Chinese Christians has long been ignored by  the foreign press.    When visiting the United States in 1993, Han talked about  Christian honesty and ethics with Christian journalists from the  major news media.    He called for impartial reporting, both domestic and  overseas, to enhance understanding between China and the rest of  the world.    Han notes that only a few foreigners are malicious to China.  Many Christian associations and individuals abroad deem the two  Chinese decrees as fair and reasonable.    Han said his Christian council is grateful for the  clarification made by 21 foreign Christian reverends residing in  Hong Kong.    The past decade has witnessed dramatic changes in China's  Christendom. According to Han, 8,000 churches are now open to  Christians. On top of that, China has set up 13 seminaries to  train clergy for its 6 million to 7 million Christian believers.    Since 1985, the Amity Foundation, founded by Christian  believers in China, has been sponsoring around 80 foreign  teachers annually for China's institutions of higher learning.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Court rules in satellite TV wrangle THE Court of Appeal yesterday ended a legal wrangle between British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a stake, and Tatung UK, a manufacturer of satellite receiving equipment, Gary Mead writes. The court ruled that BSkyB had no agreement with Tatung that its D-Mac satellite receivers would be the preferred technology. The case stems from November 1990, when two rival satellite television companies, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) and Sky Television, merged to form BSkyB. The former BSB was compatible with Tatung's D-Mac receivers, but after the merger the alternative system used by Sky took over. Yesterday's case will have a bearing on similar actions pending against BSkyB by three other electronics manufacturers, Nokia, Philips and Ferguson. Tatung was refused leave to appeal to the Lords.</p>

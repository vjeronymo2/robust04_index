			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Straw fights back over council tax Labour yesterday stepped up its campaign for May's local elections by claiming that three of the five highest council taxes in the country were levied by Conservative authorities. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, accused the government of using selective and inapplicable data to back its claim that Labour councils would charge higher levels of council tax than the Conservatives next year. Tackling what could be the most critical issue in the forthcoming local elections, Mr Straw said the government had no basis for claiming that Labour councils would charge an average of Pounds 129 more council tax than Tory-controlled authorities. The government arrived at this figure using the average rate of council tax to be levied on properties in band C - valued between Pounds 52,000 and Pounds 68,000. Mr Straw argued that the calculation was deceptive because band C rates were typically lower in Conservative areas where there was a preponderance of homes in the higher-valuation bands, ranging from E to H. 'The Tories produced those council tax band C figures in a lame attempt to prove that Tory councils were cheaper,' said Mr Straw. 'They convinced no one, not even themselves.' Using a different method of calculation - average council tax payments per household - Mr Straw argued that Labour councils would charge Pounds 40 less than the Conservatives next year, and Pounds 26 less than the Liberal Democrats. On this basis, a Local Government Chronicle survey of council taxes levied in 205 shire districts found that Labour authorities charged an average of Pounds 466.65 compared with Pounds 502.91 for Conservative councils and Pounds 503.31 for the Liberal Democrats. However, the same survey also suggests that several of the lowest-charging authorities will be Tory-controlled. These include Wandsworth (Pounds 136.15), Wellingborough (Pounds 225.79), Westminster (Pounds 267.83) and Rochester (Pounds 364.45). Low-charging Labour authorities include Great Yarmouth (Pounds 375.50) and Southampton (Pounds 395.82), the survey says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JACK STRAW'S TAX FIGURES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten Most Expensive Councils                          Political              Average                            Control          Council Tax  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Elmbridge                      NOC*          Pounds 671 Chiltern                       Con           Pounds 634 Tandridge                      NOC           Pounds 620 Wokingham                      Con           Pounds 616 Surrey Heath                   Con           Pounds 612 Ribble Valley                  Con           Pounds 606 Three Rivers                   NOC           Pounds 605 Haringey                       Lab           Pounds 599 Camden                         Lab           Pounds 597 Wansdyke                       NOC           Pounds 596  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * No overall control Source: Labour Party  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling Sterling's sharp fall this week is a measure of the dilemma facing the government. Without a resurgence of growth, the PSBR is likely to deteriorate further when the government is already expected to be raising Pounds 1bn a week gross during the next financial year. Since there can be no fiscal stimulus, the only lever left appears to be interest rates. Yet lower rates threaten to weaken the pound, raising fears of a fresh inflationary push. That is hardly welcome when the underlying rate is already pushing up towards its target ceiling of 4 per cent. Financial markets were wrong to anticipate that this week's poor economic data would prompt the government to cut rates. With unemployment growth accelerating, though, it may sooner or later have to cast its inflation worries aside. Equally important, a steeper yield curve may be needed to fund next year's PSBR. The question is how much of this has already been discounted by sterling. A market perception that the exchange rate was low enough to allow room for eventual appreciation would encourage foreigners to buy gilts. Next week's auction will provide some clue as to whether this point has been reached.</p>

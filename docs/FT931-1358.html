			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Caracas to cut spending ezuela's public sector deficit was expected to fall to 3.4 per cent of GDP from more than 6 per cent last year, Mr Ricardo Hausmann, minister of planning, said yesterday, reports Joseph Mann from Caracas. Pressure on the beleaguered government of President Carlos Andres Perez has prompted further efforts this year to reduce official spending and boost revenues. The government had already promised cuts of 20 per cent in public spending. Taxes and royalties on petroleum exports, the main source of the Venezuelan government's revenues, have fallen dramatically in recent years as exports have declined. The Perez administration is also hoping it can raise extra revenues from privatisation.</p>

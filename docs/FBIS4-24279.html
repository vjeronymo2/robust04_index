			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chaotic Growth"] </F>   [Text] Nineteen years after independence, Mozambique is a  case of chaotic economic growth.    On one hand, there is a productive sector that is being  increasingly pushed into activities that are typical of an  informal economy. On the other hand, there is an "unstoppable"  informal commercial sector which ends either at the doorsteps of  the black market or of organized crime, though it starts  precisely with the fast moving privatization of the state  apparatus.    Within the state sector civil servants behave more like mini  private enterprises, using the taxes paid by the productive  sector as the financial basis of their own businesses which, by  and large, imply growing levels of extortion from the productive  sector.    The situation is becoming so rampant that if there is  anything that can unite entrepreneurs of the so-called formal  sector -- which has no businesslike solidarity -- it would be a  common action against taxes, plunging civil servants into  unemployment, including those who adhere to ethics in their jobs.    In any case, some 60 percent of the General State Budget,  including the payment of civil servants' salaries, already comes  from foreign funds. In plain language, that means that 60  percent of our sovereignty needs to be reacquired. In other  words, 19 years after its independence, Mozambique is far less  independent than in 1975.    The possibility of a recovery is today more viable than in  October 1992 when the Rome accord was signed.    It was sufficient to have a few months of peace and a good  agricultural season (92/93) for the statistics to show a 19  percent growth. This figure does not give us a reason to  celebrate -- the starting point being so insignificant -- but it  is undoubtedly an indication of our real working capacities and  sense of initiative.    In cities today thousands of Mozambican households once  again  receive food from relatives somewhere in the rural areas, there  are thousands of retailers doing business across the border, and  hundreds of truckers are in business for most of the year.    There is, therefore, an atmosphere of growth in terms of  quantity and variety in business transactions. That atmosphere  proves that it can withstand the political uncertainties of a  country heading to multipartyism.    Out of the chaos in which those transactions take place, and  of the standards that gradually emerge, a system regulating the  economy will eventually surface. It will be free of the  claustrophobia that characterizes the colonial and socialist  formal sectors, and of the dangers posed by the crumbling of a  state as seen in Rwanda.    Elsewhere, in a scenario that cannot be defined, the country  will find a balance between central command and individual  enterprise. The 19 percent growth is perhaps an indication that  that may happen sooner than expected.</p>

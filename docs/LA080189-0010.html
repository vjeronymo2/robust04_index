			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN FORM AND FUNCTION, MIDEAST TERRORISM IS -- OR SHOULD BE -- PREDICTABLE  </P> <P> Once again, Middle East terrorism has reached out across 8,000 miles to shock  and horrify the American people. Once again, we discover that there is precious  little that can be done militarily without doing more damage to U.S. interests  than to the terrorists. And once again we are tempted to ignore a critical  lesson: that more bloodshed will ensue as long as the region's politics resist  basic change.  </P> <P> In the last few days, longstanding patterns of behavior in the Middle East have  reasserted themselves, like some earthly version of celestial mechanics, with  each entity moving in assigned and predictable ways.  </P> <P> To the extent that it can be dated, the current crisis began earlier this year  when the new Bush Administration indicated that it was serious about  Arab-Israeli peacemaking, in contrast to its predecessor, which, at its best,  was lukewarm. But every effort to move toward peace also stimulates those who  prefer the status quo, because they either profit from turmoil or fear the  future.  </P> <P> Thus, as the United States sought to help politics "ripen" in both Israel and  the Palestine Liberation Organization, it had to steel its nerves against acts  of terrorism, laid to Palestinians, that seemed designed to discredit the  new-found diplomacy of the PLO's chairman, Yasser Arafat. Israel's coalition  government had to resist assault from the right over Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir's proposal for elections in the occupied territories. His leadership was  further threatened by charges that, in talking with Palestinians, he was  somehow negotiating with the PLO.  </P> <P> As much as anything else, Israel's kidnaping last week of Hezbollah leader  Sheik Abdel Kareem Obeid, presumably to try swapping him for three Israeli  soldiers held captive in Lebanon, was a product of this political logic -- a  bow by Shamir to his right so that he could continue moving to his left. The  response by a group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed of the  Earth was equally in the character of the Middle East: to apply pressure on  Israel by striking at the United States.  </P> <P> Whether or not the figure portrayed in the grisly videotape was Lt. Col.  William R. Higgins, and whether or not he was murdered this week or months ago,  the United States is again faced with the unique dilemmas of terrorism,  compounded in this case by threats to other Americans held captive in Lebanon.  Uncertainty surrounds the identity of the group carrying out the execution and  even its precise motives: Did it act simply to secure Obeid's release? Or did  it also want to drive a wedge between the United States and Israel, or to  discredit the fledgling peace process? Or perhaps this was at least partly an  effort to deter Western nations from developing better relations with Iran  under President Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose election last Friday coincided with  the Israeli raid.  </P> <P> There is no clear way to apply the massive military power of the United States  -- thus the renewal of national frustration that terrorism so often produced  during the Carter and Reagan years. There will be debate about the wisdom and  the efficacy of dealing with the terrorists -- "caving in." And there will be  dispute about whether Israel should be asked to let Obeid go, as the United  States pressed it to release 766 Shiite prisoners in 1985 to secure the release  of Americans held captive on hijacked TWA flight 847.  </P> <P> The classical mechanics of a Middle East crisis took a further turn when  President Bush cut short a two-day trip to return to Washington, convened the  National Security Council and set lights burning late at night. As he  demonstrated in dealing with Panama earlier this year, there can be virtue in  saying much as part of doing little when little is all that can be done. But  the Middle East imposes its special logic, and Bush seems to be ignoring a  cardinal lesson of the Iranian hostage crisis: Dramatizing presidential  involvement raises the stakes, it provides added opportunities for terrorists  to manipulate American public opinion, and it magnifies any failure to find  actions that are both effective and prudent.  </P> <P> In the days ahead, each figure in the apparatus of Middle East politics will  make his moves, and then this episode, too, shall pass. But it will surely not  be the last, repeating itself perhaps in another guise, with yet more human  suffering.  </P> <P> During recent years, U.S. debate has turned on whether there is urgency in  prosecuting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Until Egypt took itself out  of the military equation, the answer was clearly "yes." But during the years  since then, the risks of U.S. diplomatic reticence have been far less clear.  What is happening now in the region should end the argument: For the United  States, there will be no peace of mind until there is peace in the Middle East.  </P></p>

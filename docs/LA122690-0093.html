			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HUMBUG! For the first time in six years, the Orange County Fire Department  won't hold its postseason Christmas tree burns. . . . "The burning was so  dramatic," recalled a spokesman, showing "hundreds of spectators that the trees  will flash and be fully engulfed in two or three seconds." But air-pollution  authorities denied a permit after the burnings became so popular that other  agencies wanted to join in. Tom Hamilton and Mark Landsbaum  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 8 (ATA) -- The Ad Hoc Commission of  the Council of Europe, led by Lord Finsberg had today a meeting  with representatives of the press in Albania. The commission  showed interest in the application of the press freedom in  Albania and listened to opinions by press representatives of the  position and the opposition present in the meeting.    Expressing the desire for Albania's membership in the EU,  the  chairman of the Professional Reporters' Association and  editor-in-chief of ALEANCA DEMOKRATIKE, Prec Zogaj, expressed  the concern of his association over the Press Law passed by the  parliament, describing some of its articles as "repressive."  According to Mr. Zogaj, these articles "overpass the claims of  the law as a means to discipline the press."    Ylli Rakipi, chairman of the Reporters' League of Albania,  which includes 95 per cent of all reporters in Albania, said  that "there are more newspapers than reporters in Albania. The  Albanian press lacks professionalism and the ethic of journalism  rather than the freedom of the press. You can find in the  Albanian press directs offence, sometimes going so far as  threatening to death the head of state," Mr. Rakipi said.    Thoma Gellci, editor-in-chief of ZERI I POPULLIT, asserted  the fact that the press freedom has changed a lot as compared  with the past but he laid the stress on the fact that  information in newspapers that represent certain parties is  under the parties' control and the presentation of the opposite  opinions is not a practice.    "When through my freedom I cause damage to others' freedoms  then it means that there exists no democracy," a reporter of the  RD [RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE], Edi Paloka, said, adding that there  is a lack of journalistic ethic in the Albanian opposition press.    Director of the newspaper KOHA JONE, Nikolle Lesi, expressed  his support for reporters Martin Lekaj and Aleksander Frangaj,  considering their punishments as "a pressure of the state over  the press organs."    RTV reporters Bujar Muharremi and Zamira Koleci pointed to  the fact that free press has just appeared in Albania and it  needs ethic and professionalism.    Rafael Floqi, an ATA reporter, concentrated on the  professional weak points of the Albanian press. He said that "a  totally independent press does not yet exist in Albania, because  even those papers considered to be independent still express  certain political tendencies. There can be no talk of the lack  of press freedom," Mr. Floqi said, "when about 70 per cent of  the number of the newspapers belong to the opposition."    The representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Council  of  Europe showed interest in the possibilities existing to get the  information. They asked whether government forums invite  representatives from all newspapers in their press conferences.  In general all reporters accepted that such invitations have  been made.    All reporters present in the meeting replied positively a  question by Mr. Lambert Kelchtermans, member of the committee,  asking them whether they agreed that Albania become a member of  the Council of Europe.</p>

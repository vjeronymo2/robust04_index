			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Securities losses force Fuji Heavy to lower forecast FUJI Heavy Industries, the Japanese maker of Subaru cars, said it would post parent pre-tax losses of Y4.8bn (Dollars 35.82m) for the year ended March 31, 1992, against a December forecast of Y1bn taxable profits, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Fuji Heavy, which is affiliated to Industrial Bank of Japan and Nissan Motor, posted pre-tax losses of Y63.62bn in 1990-91, mainly due to poor domestic and US sales. It also lowered its forecast for parent net profits to Y500m in 1991-92, from a December forecast of Y7bn, against losses of Y66.46bn in 1990-91. The downward revision was based on an appraisal of its securities losses, it said. It lowered its forecast of parent sales slightly.</p>

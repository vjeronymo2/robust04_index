			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov </F> by Aleksandr Ryabushev in Simferopol; date not given: "Yevgeniy  Saburov: Vice Prime Minister Worth $30"]    [Text] Simferopol -- Yevgeniy Saburov's Moscow team does  not suit the Crimean parliamentarians. The vice prime minister  has left the Supreme Council for the umpteenth time without yet  being able to get his cabinet of ministers ratified at a  session. Why?    [Saburov] The deputies simply had a poor grasp of the  situation. Clan mentality is very developed in the Crimea. A  battle is under way. New people have come to power in  parliament who are hungry and have an interest in ensuring that  ministerial portfolios go to their men. They are guided not by  the interests of their voters, but by short-term considerations.    [Ryabushev] How is this reflected?    [Saburov] First and foremost I have proposed a minimal  cabinet -- eight ministers. Three of them are Muscovites --  Agriculture Minister Sergey Nikolskiy, Finance Minister Lyudmila  Zaytseva, and Economics Minister Andrey Chernyavskiy -- the rest  are Crimeans. But this breakdown did not suit parliament -- it  wants to ratify its own overblown cabinet of ministers which  will not be subject to my confirmation. They want it to include  a Ministry of Health, a Ministry of Education, and a Ministry of  Mountains and Beaches. On the one hand, you can understand them  -- after all, most of the new members of parliament are teachers  and doctors. But I need primarily economists and specialists who  understand that there are as yet no funds to pay for ministers  in the social and cultural sphere. That money needs to be  earned. That is why I propose to create ministries which will  be able to do so. Ministers must, above all, be professionals,  not officials. They must be able to earn their pay.    [Ryabushev] Incidentally, what are you paid?    [Saburov] Believe it or not, I am the cheapest vice prime  minister; my current pay is 1.5 million karbovantsy -- or $30 at  the market rate. The president earns $40. My acting ministers  earn $25.    [Ryabushev] Is it worth feeling like a Muscovite hostage for  money like that? After all, you earned 15 times more in Moscow.    [Saburov] I have come here to sincerely help to develop the  Crimean economy. My friend Yuriy Meshkov invited me. After  all, I am a Crimean -- I was born in Yalta -- so I do not feel  like an outsider here and I intend to continue to try to  persuade parliament to ratify my version of the cabinet of  ministers.    [Ryabushev] You met with Max Van Der Stoel, CSCE high  commissioner for ethnic minorities, 2 June. What did you talk  about?    [Saburov] I outlined the situation in the Crimea for him,  and suggested that he provide help in ensuring European training  for our parliamentary deputies. I talked about what we need to  do in order to find a way out of the Crimean impasse.    [Ryabushev] And what does need to be done?    [Saburov] We need to hold talks, rule out the use of force,  develop the economy, and harmonize Ukrainian and Crimean  legislation [privesti v normu zakonodatelstva Ukrainy i Kryma],  removing laws that contradict each other. Incidentally, the  CSCE high commissioner and UN expert Vladimir Butkevich, who  currently heads the Ukrainian Supreme Council working group at  the talks with the Crimean Supreme Council commission, agree  with this.    [Ryabushev] How do you see the future of the Crimea?    [Saburov] First and foremost, within Ukraine, and with  transparent borders. Dual citizenship along the lines of  European standards. Well organized social and cultural links  with Russia. Private international capital. Recreation and an  elite agricultural sector. Transport arteries, airfields,  ports, and a bridge of friendship between East and West.</p>

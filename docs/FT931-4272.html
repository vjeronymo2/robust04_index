			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (14): Early days yet  -Consultant's Critique 'IT'S a product - ship it]' is a running joke in my company. It is usually uttered when a new program runs for the first time. But we know that a project is only finished when all the customers are happy. In some companies, managers are pushed into announcing success prematurely for PR and marketing reasons. Hornet/WASP is not yet finished. While promising, it can hardly be an example to other businesses until it is working across BT. I would need to return in one to two years to make an accurate judgment. More interesting is the process that BT uses to evaluate proposals. Many companies trust in spreadsheets and graphs which are ultimately based upon figures derived on the back of cigarette packets. In contrast, BT has formalised project evaluation. It even has a team of project appraisal specialists who help project managers derive the required figures. To its credit, BT does require net present value (NPV) as one of the top criteria although it cannot bear to part with the outmoded internal rate of return or payback period. BT's drive to standardise work processes is a classic method of attempting to reduce costs and increase control. Their choice of 'best current practice' has benefits but considerable risks. Whatever they choose in IT strategy will be obsolete in five years' time. BT must ensure that a drive to standardise does not inhibit innovation. With many hungry new companies entering the telecoms market, BT must not allow itself to be technologically eclipsed. Key points of this case: It isn't finished just because the trials look good. All new projects need to be assessed accurately using modern techniques. Standardisation can reduce costs but provision must be made for ongoing innovation.</p>

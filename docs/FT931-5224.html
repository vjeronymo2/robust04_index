			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Hawks and Handsaws: Norman Lamont, we love you WITH THE UK Budget looming, the time has come to speak the unspeakable: Norman Lamont must stay. He has become a national treasure. Our debt to him is bottomless. Crises have not toppled him. Scorn has not unmanned him. He is unbowed by rudery. He just keeps smiling through. We may not rate him as chancellor of the exchequer but as a lightning-rod for our misfortunes he is almost Churchillian. The penny dropped for me last Monday when the newspapers carried photos of the G7 finance ministers at the end of their London meeting. In the centre of the front row was good old Norman - head thrown back, eyes closed in ecstasy at some G7 joke, teeth scrubbed and twinkling, eyebrows artfully combed, his tie a brilliant blue. I thought: God knows how you do it, Norman, but you are still not unhorsed. Hawks &amp; Handsaws has more than an idle interest in Norman Lamont, for it was this column, in February 1991, that first suggested that he was heading for the quicksands. In the months that followed, the economy dived deeper and deeper. Norman became a laughing stock. Yet still he stands before us, resolute and insouciant, like a bookmaker at the Derby, confident of laughing last. It has now become plain that all Britain's troubles should be attributed to the prime minister, not to his chancellor, for John Major has been revealed as fatally cackhanded. Major used to be a Brixton councillor, and so he should have remained. But he entered national politics and was eventually sucked up, in the vacuum around Margaret Thatcher, until he popped out, like a cork from a musty bottle, at the very pinnacle of UK politics. In the meantime, Norman Lamont has taken the flak, shouldered our troubles and acted the role of national scapegoat, on whose head we have symbolically placed our multiple sins and woes. The policies were always Major's, yet we heaped our scorn on Norman. He reminds me of Hercules. One day soon, I hope, someone will do for Norman Lamont what Nicholas Tomalin did for Princess Anne in the Sunday Times in November 1973 - deliver him from ridicule. At the time, we were all fed up with Princess Anne. We thought she was a snob, and dim and dull to boot. It was part of Tomalin's genius as a journalist to detect in Princess Anne a quality we had not noticed. He called it her 'redeeming nullity.' Her irrelevance was her point. She was an innocent and an anachronism, in the best possible sense. 'I think it highly unlikely,' wrote Tomalin, 'that she has ever smoked pot, acted in a happening, signed a petition for the Jackson Five, canvassed for Shelter or Release, frugged, freaked-out, been to Biba, or done any of the other things normal healthy young contemporary girls feel obliged to do.' Britain had lost an empire yet found a role - watching Princess Anne on TV while she went bravely over the jumps on her horse, Hyperion. We needed Princess Anne. Almost from that moment, her fortunes soared. As a result, most of us today can gaze upon Princess Anne, now happily remarried, without so much as a retch. Saving Princess Anne was a bit like saving the whales - something for which posterity will thank and honour us. And if they and she could be saved, we can save Norman Lamont. We must look closely at the chancellor and acknowledge this simple truth: in the days of plague ahead, we will need his cheerfulness and stoicism, his singing in the bath and his bookmaker's laugh, more than ever before. In summarising his case, Nicholas Tomalin wrote: 'One could go on listing reasons for approving of Princess Anne forever. Name any aspect of modern life, and she can satisfy it in some way or other (usually, as I've explained, by having never heard of it). Everyone says that as we strive to accustom ourselves to a new, second-rate role in the world, we must concentrate on doing really well the less ambitious things. No more hubristic attempts to build Concordes or rule the world; just small, ingenious, innocent activities . . . These are good because they are within our competence. Princess Anne is something real, good, and suitably unambitious. We should be grateful for her.' Take my word for it: if we love Princess Anne, we shall shortly love the chancellor.</p>

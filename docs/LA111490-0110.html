			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMITH'S PREFERENCE IS MARINOVICH, BUT . . .;  </P> <P> USC: FOLEY REMAINS IN COMPETITION TO START AT QUARTERBACK FOR THE TROJANS  AGAINST UCLA.  </P> <P> Todd Marinovich and Shane Foley will compete for the starting quarterback job  this week as USC prepares to play UCLA Saturday in the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> But Coach Larry Smith seemed to indicate Tuesday that his preference would be  to go with Marinovich, who was lifted in the second quarter of Saturday's game  against Oregon State and didn't return.  </P> <P> "Between the two of them, I don't think there's any question that Marinovich is  best suited for our offense because we want balance," Smith said. "Marinovich,  from that standpoint, gives you the best mixture."  </P> <P> But, Smith added, it is difficult to ignore Foley's efficiency.  </P> <P> A seldom-used backup player before Marinovich was suspended by Smith last month  for cutting class, Foley completed all nine of his passes against Oregon State,  throwing for 115 yards and two touchdowns in a 56-7 victory at Corvallis, Ore.  </P> <P> Marinovich completed three of eight passes for a career-low 23 yards, missing  on five of his last six before Smith pulled him in favor of Foley.  </P> <P> Marinovich faltered because he lacked patience, Smith said.  </P> <P> "You always want a quarterback who will gamble and go for big plays, but  there's a time and place for it," Smith said. "I need the consistency -- take  what (the defense) gives you."  </P> <P> Smith said he hoped to use only one quarterback against UCLA.  </P> <P> "I'm not a two-quarterback guy," he said. "I don't believe in musical chairs at  quarterback. I would much prefer to go with one guy and go the whole way with  him. But sometimes circumstances don't allow you to do that."  </P> <P> Has the talent level at UCLA dropped significantly in the past two years, as  Bruin Coach Terry Donahue has indicated?  </P> <P> "Not one bit," Smith said. "The first thing I told our players in the scouting  report (was), we're facing the best collection of speed, on both offense and  defense, that we've played.  </P> <P> "They're young in spots, just like we are. But you take the speed in the  secondary, the speed at linebacker, the speed at tailback, the speed at wide  receiver -- they're not down a bit. In fact, they may be ahead. They're not as  experienced, maybe, as they've been, but the talent and the speed are there."  </P> <P> Almost lost in USC's dismantling of Oregon State was the abysmal play of its  kickoff coverage team, which allowed Dwayne Owens to return six kicks for a  school-record 237 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> And with Notre Dame's Raghib Ismail headed his way on Nov. 24 -- not to mention  Shawn Wills, who has averaged 25.9 yards a return since replacing Brian Brown,  UCLA's all-time kickoff return leader -- Smith is concerned.  </P> <P> "Every kickoff guy in the country has looked at our films and they're mighty  brave right now," Smith said. "What we need to do is nail a few of their butts  back there inside the five- or 10-yard line."  </P> <P> Easier said than done.  </P> <P> USC ranks last in the Pacific 10 Conference in kickoff coverage, giving up 25.7  yards a return.  </P> <P> Owens wasn't the first kick returner to burn the Trojans:  </P> <P>  -- Russell White of California averaged 41 yards on four kickoff returns  against USC, including a 63-yard return at the start of the game and a  49-yarder that led to a touchdown in a 31-31 tie.  </P> <P>  -- Qadry (Missile) Ismail of Syracuse, younger brother of Raghib (Rocket)  Ismail, had a 55-yard kickoff return against USC, the Orangemen's longest of  the season.  </P> <P>  -- Gary Brown of Penn State had a 39-yard return against USC.  </P> <P>  -- Robert Smith of Ohio State had a 35-yard return against the Trojans, the  Buckeyes' longest of the season.  </P> <P>  -- Glyn Milburn of Stanford had a 45-yard return against USC, the Cardinal's  longest of the season.  </P> <P>  -- Michael Bates of Arizona had a 37-yard fourth-quarter return against the  Trojans, setting up the Wildcats' fifth touchdown in a 35-26 victory.  </P> <P>  -- Phillipi Sparks of Arizona State had a 47-yard return against USC, the Sun  Devils' longest of the season.  </P> <P> Smith said that several defensive starters, including free safety Stephon Pace  and linebackers Scott Ross and Kurt Barber, have volunteered to participate in  kickoff coverage this week.  </P> <P> "Why?" Smith said. "Because the starters on the defense don't want to come on  the field and play half-field defense.  </P> <P> "We don't stand a chance if we're (continually) playing half-field defense.  We'll have 35 points scored on us if we don't get something done about it."  </P></p>

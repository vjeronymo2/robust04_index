			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Property: A helping hand with holiday lets but there will often be a management service to help with lettings. However, buying a cottage in the middle of nowhere is a different matter. There are agencies that handle such places - but it will be up to you to find them. A comparative newcomer to this field is French Country Lettings. Covering all of France would be a mammoth job so the agency draws a line from Dieppe down to the Languedoc and will take on rural properties anywhere west of that if they are up to standard. Nicky Cambrook, who learnt about property with a London estate agency, started FCL in August 1990. 'Our first season was fraught with war, high interest rates and recession,' she says. 'But now we are extremely busy.' She finds there is a demand for this type of agency and is building up a portfolio, from her present base in Somerset (0963-34066). Ideally FCL likes to hear about properties for letting by September, which leaves time for inspection before inclusion in the following year's brochure, which comes out in November, although there is a spring supplement for later entrants. The agency's first brochure has a variety of properties. There is a farmhouse with a 40 ft sitting room, in four acres, an hour from the coast in Brittany, a converted windmill with circular rooms. In the south, a village house in a hamlet in the Cevennes national park, north of Montpellier, is a conversion from a silkworm loft. It is on three floors and sleeps seven. This lets at Pounds 840 a week in high season, Pounds 500 in low season. At the other end of the scale a studio apartment in a modern block next to a marina on the Vendee coast, sleeping two, lets for Pounds 210 a week in high season, Pounds 115 low season. FCL will only recommend, not stipulate, a letting figure. It requires owners to contract a property to it for at least the season (April 1 to October 31). During this period an owner may reserve six weeks, of which two can be high season, for his own use. In addition a property can be offered, if an owner wishes, for out of season holidays. FCL finds there is also a small market for longer term letting (six months or more) while people house hunt or decide if they would like living in France. The agency charges a one-off registration fee of Pounds 50 plus VAT, to cover start-up expenses of featuring a property, such as photography and office administrative costs. Its commission rate is 20 per cent of the gross rental. This includes advising on rent and presentation, producing and distributing a lettings brochure, advertising, dealing with enquiries and bookings, collecting rent and sorting out any complaints. In a Weekend FT article on Malta on December 7/8 last year, the amount of stamp duty payable by foreigners purchasing property in that country was incorrect. This was due to a computer error. The correct amount of stamp duty payable is 13.55 per cent.</p>

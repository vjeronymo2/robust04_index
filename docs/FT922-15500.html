			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Croda at Pounds 21m but sees strong start to year CRODA International, the chemicals group, reported annual results broadly in line with industry expectations after significant cost cutting in the face of recession. Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds 21.3m on sales down 4 per cent at Pounds 352.5m. Earnings per share fell from 17.45p to 10.9p and a reduced final dividend of 4.75p gives a total for the year of 7.5p, down 32 per cent on 1990, in line with the interim statement. Mr Keith Hopkins, chief executive, said that sales in the first two months of this year were 'well up' on comparable months last year as a result of stronger demand for chemicals for the cosmetics and packaging industries. Gearing was unchanged from the half-year at 39 per cent although the interest charge nearly doubled to Pounds 6.1m as less interest was capitalised. Capital expenditure, which at Pounds 16m last year represented the end of a large investment programme, was likely to fall to Pounds 13m this year. Mr Hopkins said the group was concentrating on expanding foreign markets, particularly in Europe and the US, as only 62 per cent of sales were currently overseas, a relatively low level for the chemical industry. COMMENT Croda is closer to the consumer than most chemical companies, so it is not surprising that its sighting of recovery has come before its competitors. Having taken out significant costs this year, it is well positioned to take advantage of the recovery. This, however, may be restricted by the higher interest charge coming through now that the large capital spending programme has been completed and less interest is being capitalised. While some brokers are forecasting pre-tax profits close to Pounds 27m, a figure of Pounds 25m seems more likely, giving earnings of 12.6p and a prospective multiple of 13.</p>

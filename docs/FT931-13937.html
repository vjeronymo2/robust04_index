			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Jaguar seeks 25% sales rise JAGUAR, the luxury carmaker, aims to increase sales worldwide by more than 25 per cent this year to about 28,300, Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday. The company, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is trying to halt the drastic decline it has suffered in the past four years in which its sales have more than halved and in which it has fallen into heavy losses. Mr Scheele said Jaguar was aiming to launch its planned new range of smaller sporty saloons - intended to compete with the likes of the BMW 5 Series - by 1998. The company would decide in the spring whether the new car, code-named X200, would be part of the world luxury car programmebeing planned by Ford in the US to provide a range of medium-sized luxury cars for both North America and Europe. Jaguar said that its retail sales worldwide fell last year by 12.4 per cent to 22,478 - the lowest level since 1982 . The fall was from 25,661 in 1991 and from a peak of 49,494 in 1988. Production fell last year by 10.5 per cent to 20,593 - the lowest level since 1981 - from 23,0918 in 1991 and from a peak of 51,939 in 1988. Mr Scheele said the company's financial performance had improved last year from the record pre-tax loss of Pounds 226m suffered in 1991, but he refused to disclose detailed figures. The Jaguar UK workforce, which has been reduced by 44 per cent in the past two years, fell to 6,759 at the end of last year from 7,928 a year earlier and from 12,050 at the end of 1990. The company forecast yesterday that the main impetus for its sales recovery would come from the US, where it is seeking to increase sales by more than 40 per cent this year to 12,500 from 8,681 last year. Its US sales, which fell by 7.4 per cent last year from 9,376 in 1991, have fallen by nearly two thirds in the past six years from a peak of 24,464 in 1986. Mr Scheele said that the company also planned to increase significantly its marketing effort in Germany and Japan, where sales dropped heavily last year. In Germany it is seeking to increase sales to more than 3,000 this year from 1,881 in 1992. In Japan, where its sales fell by 38 per cent last year, Jaguar is aiming to raise registrations to 2,500 from 1,501 last year. Jaguar also aims to enter a series of new markets in order to bolster its worldwide sales. This year it plans to start sales in China for the first time.</p>

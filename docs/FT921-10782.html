			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Merlin Intl losses reduced to Pounds 21.3m Merlin International Properties, the troubled Isle of Man-based company, announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.3m for the year to June 30, against Pounds 25.9m previously. The company is dependent upon the support of its bankers. Its auditors have prepared the accounts on a going concern basis, saying the company's continued trading relies on the successful implementation of its corporate plan. 'There is no prospect of our shares being relisted until we can show that the company has achieved financial stability and secured a viable future,' the company said. Merlin made exceptional and extraordinary provisions of Pounds 15.3m against Australian and US interests. In particular, it put Pounds 4.9m for non-payment of a debt from the Hayson Group, Pounds 3m against the investment in the Enterprise Development Company in the US, and a Pounds 3.2m extraordinary charge for a debt from a former subsidiary now in liquidation. Losses per share were 84.4p (105.6p).</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Thinking big in Bregenz - Summer Festivals WHEN BREGENZ built its Seebuhne, its opera-stage on beautiful Lake Constance  -really on it, not beside it, utilising a neglected islet - nobody would have thought they were testing Providence. For many years it was just a picturesque place for staging summer operetta and musical comedy, for a popular audience in the lakeside bleachers. It afforded pretty lighting-effects on the waters between; if the show was Eine Nacht in Venedig, there could be gondolas. And if it rained, as in Bregenz it very often does, that was no great tragedy. All that changed when Jerome Savary and then David Pountney were invited to produce real operas, and succeeded beyond expectation: Bregenz now has a significant opera festival. The islet has grown into a massive Captain Nemo construction, honeycombed with secret tunnels, machinery and electronic circuits for generating giant-scale wizardry. In case of rain, the new Festspielhaus on the shore can accommodate a fraction of the dampened audience, but only for a 'concertante' version of the opera they came to see. When patches of sun and flash showers alternated all day on Wednesday, with the international press in town for Pountney's new production of Verdi's early Nabucco, municipal anxiety was great. In the event Providence smiled: Ulf Schirmer's brisk conducting of the overture got gently sprinkled, but after that nothing more came from the constantly threatening clouds. The missing thunder and lightning were fully compensated by the roaring stage-effects, by Stefanos Lazaridis's spectacular sets (barbaric splendour for 'Nabucco'/Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian forces, piously severe white-and-black expanses for the downtrodden Jews), by bold attacks on the principal roles and by Pountney's aggressive reading of the opera. 'Aggressive', because nobody - in a largely Austrian audience - is allowed to forget that this is an opera about the persecution of the Jews. Amid the ancient-world trappings, there are modern army uniforms and machine-guns. During the overture, schoolchildren are marshalled into a black boat and shipped away, their confiscated violins flung into the water. The great 'Va pensiero' chorus is delivered by agonised families behind a metal fence, topped with barbed wire, confronting the audience along the full breadth of the playing-area. Beyond the brutally underlined message, Pountney indulges in no Freudian games or surrealist trickery. The singers go through the traditional grand-opera paces (sometimes from dizzying heights), as they must in such a huge venue. Since the opera is played almost nightly, the principal roles are doubly, triply and even quadruply cast. Nobody needs to force, however; with the sophisticated amplification - for singers and unseen orchestra alike - more lyrical detail comes across than in many opera houses. In the first-night cast, Covent Garden's Gregory Yurisich outdid himself as a towering, tortured Nabucco, his mad scenes ever more sonorous and subtle. As his daughters Abigaille and Fenena, respectively nasty and nice, young Jane Thorner-Mengedoht wielded a curious, husky voice to strong dramatic purpose and Vesselina Kasarova was true and sweet. The latter's Jewish lover Ismaele was the eager, virile Paolo Kudriavchenko; Michail Krutikov lent his imposing bass to the high priest Zaccaria. With the Vienna Symphony, choruses from the Vienna Volksoper,Sofia and Bregenz were admirably energetic. The naughty thought occurred that since digital tape must be in play, if later casts should prove weaker they could just mime to the first-night soundtrack: hardly anybody would twig. Performances held most nights until August 22.</p>

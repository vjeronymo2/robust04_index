			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (7): Residents determined to have last laugh - Lifestyle JUST as Cambridge may be a romantic dream in the minds of those who never studied there, Milton Keynes has become a nightmare in the minds of those who have never lived there. The British, who will label anything a white elephant unless it is an overnight success, have come to sneer at Milton Keynes, seeing only concrete cows, 15m trees three feet high, and roundabouts with one entry and one exit. But the residents refer conspiratorially to 'MK', conjuring up images of more exotic initials such as LA, and bask in another annoyingly British emotion: smug self-satisfaction. But after 25 years of being a stand-up joke the residents of Milton Keynes appear determined to have the last laugh. It is difficult to find any coherent argument against the proposition that MK is a success as a lifestyle. What kind of lifestyle is another matter entirely. The Queen recently disappointed MK, prefering to give another contender, Sunderland, the honour of cityhood in celebration of the 40th anniversary of her accession. If Milton Keynes was a racehorse it would be out of Letchworth by Hampstead Garden Suburb. It may be doing itself a disservice by trying to run in the city stakes. Much of the derision aimed at MK comes from efforts to attain the status accorded cities. But while many who would agree that MK is not a city: should the citizens care? What's wrong with living in an immaculately planned garden suburb last seen wandering across the Buckinghamshire countryside? What is more this garden suburb has been adapted, rather brilliantly by Walter Bor and Lord Llewelyn-Davies, for the car. The average worker has to travel 10 minutes to get to work. The lifestyle of Milton Keynes is home- and sports-based and glued together by the motor car. More than 70 per cent of households have cars, compared to a national average of 63 per cent. With six sets of traffic lights and a unique grid system of vehicle-only roads, transport is swift and largely stress-free. (The road plan was originally referred to as a 'rationalised Los Angeles'). The home in MK is an electronic playground: 53 per cent of households have cable television (one of the highest percentages in Britain), while 65 per cent have a video recorder, compared to 47 per cent nationally. The city's famous linear parks and lakes are sporting havens, and the Redway grid system of cycle paths and footpaths promotes a healthy alternative to the road grid. The community is a young one. Ten per cent of MK's population is aged between 25 and 29, compared to 8 per cent nationally, while just 12 per cent of the population is over 60, compared to 21 per cent nationally. Many of Milton Keynes residents came from London in the 1970s. The clean-cut outdoor life which has been realised in the city can be seen as a reaction to the comparative squalor of many of the capital's traditional inner-city areas. The 'green pull' of Milton Keynes is an increasingly strong location factor, especially in the development corporation advertising, and the city is proud that street pollution is two-thirds of that in traditional UK cities. But the population mix has changed, and the 1988 household survey of the MK region found that only 35 per cent of the residents had come from London. Significantly about 3 per cent of the 1988 population came from neighbouring Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, or Northamptonshire. About a fifth of households in the region moved to their present home from addresses in Milton Keynes. Satisfaction with the lifestyle is common. Four out of five residents profess to be satisfied with the way the city has been planned while 75 per cent are happy with the housing on offer. The proportion of owner-occupiers has increased over time, as has the number of shared owners, a local trend of increasing significance. In the past 22 years, some 44,000 homes have been built in Milton Keynes, most of them with gardens. Traditional city entertainment in Milton Keynes has not had such a success rate. The opening of The Point, the UK's first 10-screen multiplex cinema, has done something to redress the balance but the city centre still lacks magnetism. The Leisure Plaza, opened in 1990, provides an ice-rink, room for 2,500 spectators and a 36-lane bowling alley. The new ecumenical church of Christ the Cornerstone may provide the city with a soul, and its 120ft dome a much-needed landmark, but the city centre still resembles a ghost town. The city does have social problems. There is little single-person housing. Both the divorce figures and repossession rate are above the national average. There are 2,000 homeless people in the region. But none of that should be allowed to disfigure MK's achievement. The city has a growing number of radical supporters, among them Mr Tim Mars, popularly known as 'the guru of Milton Keynes', and the author of privately produced tour brochure on the region. 'I liked the city so much I lived there,' says Mr Mars, who now describes himself as 'an enforced exile'. He believes the city's lifestyle is closest to that of California, but with parks and lakes replacing the beach, and while agreeing that 'cityhood' is a mistaken aspiration for MK finds 'suburban' equally misplaced. Mr Mars found that Milton Keynes was unlike other new towns: it wasn't shabby and it was not built as a romantic fantasy of a worker's playground. He insists that 'from the inside out' MK is not dominated by the car, but by the Redway, cycle paths, and well-lit footpaths. In Milton Keynes he finds a definition of the aspirations of many of its residents: life is private, mobile, rural, and close to the city. It is certainly true that for the people who live in this gentle garden suburb, life is less stressful, healthier, and more efficient than for the vast majority of Britain's citizens.</p>

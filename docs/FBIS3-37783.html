			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav </F> Kostikov by Aleksey Burmistenko, TRUD international desk editor;  place and date not given: "President's Strong Move"]    [Text] [Burmistenko] What is your assessment of the  political consequences of the Russian president's actions  regarding the Sarajevo conflict?    [Kostikov] B.N. Yeltsin's initiative has led to a major  Russian diplomatic victory not only on the European stage but on  the world stage as well. Without a single shot being fired,  without threatening anyone or posing a risk to our soldiers'  lives, and without spending a single ruble, Russia has  effectively won a most important battle for its world status.    It is not just that Russia has returned to the sources of  its  historical political role in the Balkans by protecting the  Serbs, who are close to us in religious, cultural, and national  terms. Russia has firmly marked out the parameters of its  influence in Europe and the world. It has become clear that no  small or great power can fail to take account of Russia's  position and national interests. It has become clear that no  international organization of a universal or military character  can make effective decisions unless it takes account of Moscow's  voice.    The illusory nature of the notion that any major problem in  Eastern Europe can be resolved behind Russia's back has become  apparent.    It has become clearer that though it is withdrawing its  military contingents from Central and East European countries,  in full accordance with Russia's new foreign policy doctrine,  Moscow remains a powerful and significant presence in Europe by  virtue of its national policy.    [Burmistenko] The communist opposition has recently accused  B.N. Yeltsin of diminishing Russia's status as a great power.  Is there any basis for this?    [Kostikov] The Russian president's actions and their  consequences have revealed a fact that is extremely important  for world politics as a whole. They have stressed the role of  the great powers, and particularly of Russia, in resolving  international conflicts. Let us recall how much time, effort,  and talk have been expended by the United Nations and NATO in  order to deal with the conflict. As a result of all these  diplomatic maneuvers, the world very nearly found itself on the  brink of a world crisis which threatened to spill over into war  and drag in the major powers.    The Russian president has made a single strong chess move,  and the threat has been averted and preconditions have been  created for a definitive settlement. So I think it would be  more accurate to talk about B.N. Yeltsin's role in restoring  Russia's status as a great power.    [Burmistenko] What impact might the resolution of the  Sarajevo conflict have on the internal political situation in  Russia?    [Kostikov] Let us recall how many spiteful and often  venomous barbs have been cast in Boris Yeltsin's direction on  this score by our ultranationalists. There are few deadly sins  the president has not been accused of: betraying our national  interests, forgetting our national dignity, selling Russia off  to the evil West, and surrendering Russian positions to the  United States, and how much political speculation there has  been! Only lazy people have not gone to former Yugoslavia in  order to accumulate political capital, so to speak.    Without leaving Moscow, President Yeltsin has achieved what  the political chatterers could not and did not achieve. He has  actually demonstrated the provision enshrined in the new  Constitution which says that the Russian president is the  guarantor of the country's national interests. Calmly, without  haste and without excessive publicity and ballyhoo, he has shown  that as of today he is the indisputable leader of Russia.    It is sufficient to ask just one question: Who other than  Yeltsin could currently say things, and say them in such a way,  that he will be listened to in Sarajevo, Europe, and the world?  Nobody else, in my opinion. This, incidentally, sheds indirect  light on the issue which the communist opposition is currently  making such a fuss about: Should Russia make haste to hold  presidential elections? Should all sorts of commissions be  established to investigate the events of 3-4 October with a  single and clearly provocative objective -- to give the  president a "nasty nip."    [Burmistenko] Can we expect some other new steps from B.N.  Yeltsin regarding the resolution of the crisis in Sarajevo?    [Kostikov] The president's opponents have always maintained  that Yeltsin is unpredictable, extravagant, and impulsive....  Over the past few days, during the Bosnian crisis, we have if  you like seen a new president of Russia: A predictable,  calculating, and crafty diplomat who is sure of himself and his  country's policy. By his initiative, the president has created  good preconditions for resolving the crisis. I think this  political capital should be carefully developed and built up by  diplomatic efforts. Without excluding the leaders of other  countries, of course, or international organizations. It seems  to me that an international conference at the highest level is  called for in order to settle the issue once and for all. And  Russians can rest assured that their national interests and the  interests of Russia's traditional allies will be reliably  protected.</p>

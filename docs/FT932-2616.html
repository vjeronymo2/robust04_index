			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (11): Profitable symbol of regeneration / Profile of Szczecin shipyard LESS than two years ago the state-owned Szczecin shipyard was on the receiving end of much appreciated technical and managerial advice from Swan Hunter, the UK shipyard, about how to raise productivity and improve efficiency. Last month the Polish shipmakers were dismayed to find that the UK shipyard had been taken into receivership, but delighted that their own had become in some ways a symbol of the regeneration of former loss-making state enterprises. The turn round started in April 1991, when the management, headed by Mr Ryszard Kwidzinski, came to the conclusion that there was no real prospect of government or other external help and that management and workers had to rescue the shipyard with their own efforts. 'We started looking for practical, non-political solutions, drew up a business plan and hawked it from bank to bank,' he recalls. In July, 1991, Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the then prime minister, visited the shipyard and agreed to change its formal status into a joint stock company, albeit with 100 per cent of the shares owned by the Polish treasury. To gain credibility with the banks, to whom the shipyard owed 2,500bn zloties (Pounds 100m), management negotiated with the 5,200 workers a series of reforms. The changes linked wages to productivity; changed the production system to reduce stocks; concentrated resources on fewer ships at a time; introduced a double shift; revamped management and introduced computers; and brought the privatised design bureau back into the company. More than 700 workers either changed jobs or left the yard, while the financial and auditing departments were expanded, along with the introduction of modern cash management. The results have been extraordinary. Shipbuilding time was reduced by 50 per cent to 180 days from start of construction to sale. Instead of as many as 24 ships at varying stages of completion around the yard, it now has two ships under construction, two being fitted out, two in the planning stage and two in the pre-fabrication shops. This year the company will deliver 15 container ships of 12,500dwt each, worth Dollars 280m, all to foreign owners - mainly German, but also to South African, French and other buyers. It expects to make a 5 per cent profit, without a single zloty in government subsidies. 'We now have the best delivery times in Europe and full order books over two years ahead,' Mr Kwidzinski claims. The return to profitability would not have been possible without an agreement with the banks and 1,800 other creditors, including suppliers. Without a debt rescheduling the shipyard could have been declared bankrupt and all would have lost. Instead, small creditors owed up to 200m zloties were paid in full. Those above that level, including the the biggest creditors, PKO bank and Bank Gdansk which together were owed more than 1,000bn zloties, agreed to be repaid in 20 quarterly tranches, with a year's grace and without any interest - despite inflation of about 32 per cent. 'The choice before the banks was to get something, or nothing,' Mr Kwidzinski underlines. Looking ahead, management is preparing for privatisation within two years with strong management and worker buy-out elements. A last-ditch attempt by the small Solidarity 80 union to derail the privatisation through the intervention of President Walesa appears to have failed, after the president was presented with the full facts of the case.</p>

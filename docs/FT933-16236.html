			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Arts: Prince's pupils return to basics - Architecture It is hard to believe the place has existed for only one year. How can such richness, variety and intelligence have been gathered and organised in such a short time? I recommend the end-of-year show of the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture to any reader who has a few hours to spare. This well-designed exhibition is open this week at the home of the new school, 14-15 Gloucester Gate, London NW1. I have had an interest in the establishment of this alternative school of architecture but no direct input into the teaching programme, and so I feel I can offer the reader an inside view while looking critically at the product of the first year's teaching. The unusual thing about this new school is that it was set up by the Prince of Wales as a home for a radical and completely alternative way of teaching architecture. The Prince, and others, recognised a need to found a school that would be a catalytic meeting point for students and teachers where a true journey of exploration into the richness of art and architecture could begin. On show this week is the work of the first 28 foundation course students. The full title of their programme is 'Foundation Course in Architecture and the Building Arts' and it is unique in Britain. Not many schools of architecture begin their first term with a lecture from Sir Laurens van der Post that describes all humans as being builders at heart. His point, that we have lost the capacity in many of our buildings to reflect our own values, is well worth making. In the modern visual world, 'we look for a reflection of ourselves but see none, listen for an echo of our values but hear nothing'. The Prince's school aims to return building to the realm of common sense in a way that does not fragment and separate the various building processes. This is a large agenda but an impressive start has been made in the first year. Students are pushed very hard. To emphasise the holistic nature of building creation, they all study life drawing, painting, drawing from nature, modelling in clay and carving in stone. These are seen as basic ways of learning to see and measure and of beginning to understand materials. One exhibition, of a group of clay modelled heads set against a display of bamboos, is very touching and beautiful. There are some excellent plant drawings and some good figure drawings. Use of washes and water colours has been well absorbed - however the oil painting has some way to go. Once these representational arts are mastered, the student moves rapidly into project work and design. Looking at nature and the life model is important because it grounds the students' visual experience in a knowledge of proportion and structure. Students follow simultaneously a course in architectural history which emphasises that architects are guardians of a great heritage existing as a source of inspiration. When the modern movement in architecture tried to kill history it only revealed the poverty of its own powers of invention. History is evident in the students' work not in the form of slavish imitation but as a clear inspiration. They do learn to draw the classical orders but simply, as we all should, as part of any civilised person's knowledge. I was impressed by the community projects that the students had undertaken in four places in London and in Salisbury. It is absolutely essential for students to understand the planning process if they are to tackle areas like Hulme in Manchester - one of the most deprived and difficult inner city areas in the country. One student project has already achieved a concrete result. The derelict pier at Nine Elms in Wandsworth is to be saved as a result of a discussion process and development study that was instigated by the institute. One particular student - Ivan Kniazev from St Petersburg - made a spectacular and practical contribution to the problem of the derelict pier. He produced a magnificent drawing of his idea to convert the pier into a ship for all kinds of public activities. The students have so won the hearts of Wandsworth's planners that they are to make a presentation concerning all of the borough's riparian land. This presentation, 'London's Liquid Asset', will take place on a Hydrocat (the latest river bus) with the head of planning and the mayor of Wandsworth on board. Another practical link between the institute and the world outside involves the Macmillan cancer nursing scheme. The Macmillan Design Challenge awards will be shown at the institute on July 22. It is impressive that such a young school should be having such an impact and it is encouraging. From this autumns, the institute will take graduate students on courses that are recognised by the Royal Institute of British Architects; bridges are being built between the profession and one of its sternest critics. Even the most entrenched old-fashioned Modernist could not fail to be fired by the enthusiasm and breadth of the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture. Its diet is too rich to be dogmatic and too questioning of fundamentals to be other than constructive. It clearly has a bright future. End-of-year show until July 9. 10am-5pm (until 8pm Weds) Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, NW1</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Dreams of privatisation: The restructuring of the German steel industry as part of the upheaval in the sector throughout Europe has elicited widespread protest. FT writers report on the hopes and fears of two communities in east and west Germany THE workers at Ekostahl, Eisenhuttenstadt, reckon they have done their bit in reducing the workforce and capacity. 'There are only 5,000 people now working here,' says Mr Gunther Reski, head of the plant's workers' council. 'But in practice, only 3,500 have full-time jobs. The rest are part-time, on training, or else are on job creation schemes. Before 1990, 11,000 people were employed here.' Ekostahl, 100km east of Berlin and near the Polish border, was built by the former East German communist regime in 1951. The 50,000 inhabitants of Eisenhuttenstadt, an annex of the giant steel mill, are dependent on the plant, which used to buy iron ore from Russia and sold its finished products back to the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. 'We were producing over 2.1m tons a year. We've brought production down to 900,000 tons. Now we are looking for a break,' says Mr Reski, a 51-year-old steelworker who has spent the past 30 years with Ekostahl. The workers are pinning their hopes on an ambitious plan that would eventually result in the privatisation of parts of the company. The first phase, already agreed in principle by their owner, the Treuhand - the agency responsible for privatising the east German economy - entails modernisation of the cold steel works, for DM310m (Pounds 131m). The second phase would turn Ekostahl into a mini-mill, inspired by the highly successful Nucor plant in North Carolina. That would require an additional DM750m. The workers are waiting anxiously for a decision on the aid package. But they are also hoping that IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering trade union, will not press for a strike at the plant. 'A strike is the last thing we need,' says Harold, a 32-year-old Ekostahl employee. 'IG Metall wants a 26 per cent wage increase to equalise wages between eastern and western German workers. But if that means a strike, I would opt for a job, not a higher wage. Many of my friends think the same.' Eisenhuttenstadters also worry about a strike, due on April 1 after IG Metall has balloted its members. 'We can't afford strikes, because the workers will lose money. We can't afford strikes, because it might deter buyers for Ekostahl,' says Britta, who has recently set up her own food shop. Local IG Metall officials, and owners of new, small businesses, are aware of the dilemma. Job security is vital for their future, and the town's. They explain how the 36 ancillary work shops formerly owned by Ekostahl have been privatised, and are surviving. Mr Kurt Rakoczi, manager of a local insurance company, says if Ekostahl does not get the go-ahead for modernisation, the town, and the fledgling privatised sector, would die. They have already set up a solidarity fund for unemployed workers. 'We are still prepared to make sacrifices for Ekostahl because we believe the mini-mill could work here,' says Mr Reski. 'What is the alternative?'</p>

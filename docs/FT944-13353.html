			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Browning-Ferris advances 41% on acquisitions Acquisitions and a strong improvement in recycling prices helped Browning-Ferris Industries, the US waste company, to report a 41 per cent jump in annual net income to Dollars 278.7m, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr William Ruckelshaus, chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased with the results, which included a 55 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 82.3m. Sales for the quarter were 34 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.24bn, and 24 per cent up for the full year at Dollars 4.3bn.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- During the  discussion of the agenda at the Crimean Supreme Council's  session today, Yuriy Meshkov, the republic's president, proposed  that the composition of the government should be approved  immediately. He then interrupted his speech to give the floor  to Crimea's acting internal affairs minister, General Valeriy  Kuznetsov. The latter announced, in particular, that "a plane  with Ukrainian First Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Valentin  Nedryhaylo and special forces [spetsnaz] on board secretly  arrived in Simferopol in the early hours [on 19 May]. A  surprise attempt to seize the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry  building was made right away. That attempt was barred by  resolute actions by the personnel of the Crimean militia. A  military coup is under way." In Valeriy Kuznetsov's words,  Valentin Nedryhaylo tried to read to the militia personnel a  Ukrainian presidential directive dismissing the leadership of  the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry, appointing "Kiev  governors" and subordinating the Crimean Internal Affairs  Ministry to the Ukrainian president, bypassing the Crimean  Supreme Council and president.    It was proposed at the session that Valeriy Kuznetsov's  candidacy for the post of Crimean internal affairs minister  should be approved urgently and even without any discussion, but  because of the [Crimean Tartar People] Kurultay group's  disagreement this proposal was not passed. A commission was set  up in order to verify Valeriy Kuznetsov's report. The Crimean  Supreme Council's commission for military issues and the  Republic of Crimea's security, and the republic's procurator are  members of the commission. The deputies discussed the candidacy  of Valeriy Kuznetsov for the post of Crimean internal affairs  minister. Voting on his candidacy was postponed until the  commission completes its work.    The president of the Crimean Republic proposed that the  session should consider and approve a resolution in reaction to  the Ukrainian president's decree "On converting the Crimean  Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ukrainian  Ministry of Internal Affairs main directorate for internal  affairs in Crimea", as well as approve the composition of a  coordinating commission formed by the government to go to Kiev  for negotiations on cooperation and delimitation of powers in  disputed policy areas. Yuriy Meshkov also proposed the  immediate approval of two more appointments, the heads of the  Crimean security service and the Justice Ministry. According to  the Crimean president, while the Ukrainian leadership continues  its attempts to destabilize the situation in Crimea to help  Leonid Kravchuk hold on to the presidential seat, there is no  other option than to approve the ministerial appointments to  preserve stability on the peninsula.    Valeriy Kartavtsev, head of the Ukrainian Security Council  Secretariat, told UNIAN that a meeting of the Council on 18 May  discussed the issue of Ukraine's territorial integrity following  the latest developments in Crimea. In his opinion, the  Ukrainian president and the newly elected Supreme Council can be  expected to take action if the violation of Ukraine's  Constitution continues. Militia Colonel-General Valentin  Nedryhaylo, first deputy minister of internal affairs, flew to  Crimea after the Security Council meeting.    According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs'  main  center for public links, on 19 May at the Crimean Ministry of  Internal Affairs, the results were summed up on the granting of  practical assistance by the bodies and subunits of Crimea's  internal affairs to officials from Ukraine's Ministry of  Internal Affairs. Militia Col-Gen Valentin Nedryhaylo, first  deputy minister of Ukraine's internal affairs, took part in the  summing up. He read a decree of the Ukrainian president to the  leadership of Crimea's Ministry of Internal Affairs, "On  reorganizing the ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of  Crimea into a chief directorate of internal affairs of Crimea of  Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs and on subordinating this  directorate directly to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs."    In accordance with this decree, administrative and  management  buildings, armaments, means of transportation, and other assets  are transferred for use by the chief directorate of internal  affairs of Crimea. The additional post of deputy minister of  Ukraine's internal affairs -- head of the main directorate of  internal affairs of Crimea of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal  Affairs, is being introduced to the staff of the central  apparatus of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Militia  Colonel V. Chernyshov [name as received] was appointed to this  post.    The main center for public links of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs of Ukraine also announced that a statement from Valeriy  Kuznetsov, acting internal affairs minister of the Republic of  Crimea, about an attempt by spetsnaz to seize the Crimean  Ministry of Internal Affairs building was "another attempt to  deceive the public of Crimea and Ukraine."</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Financial institutions test Swiss demand for FRNs THREE financial institutions yesterday took advantage of a pocket of demand among Swiss investors, to issue subordinated floating rate notes totalling Dollars 600m. JP Morgan &amp; Co, the US bank's holding company, Credit Local de France, the French local authority financing agency, and the German government-backed Landeskreditbank all raised 10-year subordinated debt which counts as Lower Tier 2 capital under Basle capital adequacy rules. All three deals were structured in the same way, with a floor, or minimum interest rate, of 5 per cent and a cap, or maximum interest rate, of 10 per cent. Dealers said that Swiss investors have been buying up 'floored' floating-rate notes of strong credit quality in the secondary market for some time. However, the amount of paper available is limited, since little such debt has been issued since the mid-1980s. With US interest rates at historically low levels, an initial coupon of 5 per cent proved attractive to Swiss investors. US money market rates are around 3 1/2 per cent. As a result, many Swiss investors were prepared to accept a cap of 10 per cent, in return for a high initial coupon. Another important aspect of the paper's appeal was its high credit quality. Dealers said the market would likely be closed to investors rated less than double-A - a high cut-off point for subordinated debt issues, which generally have lower ratings than senior debt issues. Dealers said Swiss demand for such paper was nevertheless finite, and the heavy volume of issuance yesterday had taken up much of the slack. JP Morgan's Dollars 200m issue arranged by Kidder Peabody was generally considered to have been the best received, due to the rarity of the name, and the benefit of a head start. Elsewhere, Paribas arranged a Dollars 40m issue of floating-rate notes backed by the cash flows due from the sale of a Boeing 757 by Ansett Worldwide Aviation to the Argentine government.</p>

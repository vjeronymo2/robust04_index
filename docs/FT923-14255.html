			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Andes oil pipeline agreed The state oil companies of Chile and Argentina, Enap and Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, have signed a letter of intent to build a 424km oil pipeline across the Andes at an estimated cost of Dollars 200m, writes Leslie Crawford in Santiago. The pipeline, which will be ready in late 1993, will link oil fields in the Argentine province of Neuquen to an Enap refinery in Concepcion, southern Chile.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Test Methods <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of this rulemaking, the EPA proposed two new reference test methods (Method 25D and Method 25E) to be added to 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A. Method 25D is a test method for the determination of the volatile organic concentration of waste materials. Since proposal, the EPA decided it is also appropriate to use method 25D to implement other EPA air standards being developed under authority of the Clean Air Act. The promulgation of some of these other air standards prior to today's action required the EPA to promulgate Method 25D in a separate rulemaking (refer to 59 FR 19402, April 22, 1994). Comments and responses relevant to Method 25D for this rulemaking are in the BID for the final rule and in the dockets pertaining to this rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 25E is being promulgated today. Method 25E is the test method for determining the organic vapor pressure of wastes. The sampling requirements for Method 25E have been revised since proposal to provide for sampling of the waste in a tank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Summary of Final Rule Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA estimates that implementation of the subpart CC standards will reduce nationwide organic emissions from TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers by approximately 970,000 Mg/yr. In addition, the EPA estimates that nationwide organic emissions from 90-day tanks and containers will be reduced by approximately 73,000 Mg/yr. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control of organic air emissions addresses many air quality problems including ambient ozone formation, adverse human health effects from inhalation of air toxics, and, to a lesser extent, depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ambient ozone concentrations exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in many metropolitan areas throughout the United States. Thus, the rule promulgated today will contribute to progress in attaining the NAAQS for ozone in nonattainment areas and also in preventing significant deterioration of the air quality in those areas of the United States currently in attainment with the NAAQS for ozone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's action will also significantly reduce the risk to the public of contracting cancer posed by exposure to toxic constituents contained in the organic emissions from hazardous waste management activities. The cancer risk to the entire exposed population nationwide (i.e., annual cancer incidence) from exposure to organic emissions from TSDF is estimated by the EPA to be reduced from approximately 48 cases per year to a level of 2 cases per year. Annual cancer incidence as a result of exposure to organic emissions from 90-day tanks and containers is estimated by the EPA to be reduced from approximately four cases per year to less than one case per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maximum individual risk (MIR) is a measure of the added probability of a person contracting cancer if exposed continuously over a 70-year period to the highest annual average ambient concentration of the air toxics emitted from a TSDF site. There are approximately 2,300 TSDF locations in the United States. The MIR for all but approximately 20 of these facilities is estimated by the EPA to be reduced by implementation of the subpart CC standards to a level that is less than 1 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &cent; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The target MIR levels historically used by the EPA for other promulgated RCRA standards range from 1 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &cent; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4 to 1 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &cent; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Because the MIR values for a few TSDF are estimated to remain higher than the historical RCRA target, the EPA is continuing to evaluate the waste management practices and the individual chemical compounds composing the organic emissions at these TSDF. Following this evaluation, the EPA will determine what other actions are necessary to attain the health-based goals of RCRA section 3004(n). The omnibus permitting authority in section 3005(c)(3) can be invoked to supplement or add to the requirements in today's rule, should the rule be determined to be insufficient to assure protection of human health and the environment at a particular facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (In A Nutshell): Venture capital famine forecast Small firms may be starved of venture capital finance when the economy starts to recover following a sharp fall in the amounts of venture capital raised in 1991, Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures (F&amp;C), a development capital fund, has warned. Independent UK venture capital firms raised only Pounds 400m in new funds last year, less than half the Pounds 850m raised in 1990 and well below the Pounds 1.7bn figure the year before that, according to estimates by F&amp;C and Venture Economics, an industry research group. Independent venture capital firms have had difficulties raising finance in the past year because of the poor performance of many of the funds raised during the 1980s. But the independents account for only part of the venture capital market and the F&amp;C figures exclude 3i, the largest venture capital firm, and the 'captive' funds belonging to the banks and other financial institutions. The amounts invested by independent venture capitalists also fell last year, though less sharply, F&amp;C estimated. Investments were Pounds 900m in about 600 companies compared with Pounds 951m put into 618 companies in 1990 and Pounds 1.2bn into 574 companies the year before that.</p>

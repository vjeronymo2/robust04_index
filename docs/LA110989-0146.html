			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN JUAN PLANS 'CENTRAL PARK' TO PROTECT ITS VANISHING OPEN SPACE  </P> <P> Nestled between Trabuco and Oso creeks lies an undisturbed piece of yesteryear,  where wooden farmhouses and fruit stands can still be found under the shade of  majestic eucalyptus and live oak trees.  </P> <P> It is the northern entrance to this historic city, a rural buffer zone that  separates the traditional home of the swallows from the increasingly urban  landscape that marks neighboring Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> But, city officials warn, residential and commercial developers are already  wooing owners with promises of high returns in exchange for the 120-acre  agricultural preserve -- a quiet refuge of orange groves and persimmon patches  along Camino Capistrano, north of Junipero Serra Road.  </P> <P> Eager to maintain the area in its current state, city officials will today  unveil an ambitious plan for a $20-million bond issue to purchase the preserve  and transform it into a city-owned "Central Park."  </P> <P> At an 11:30 a.m. press conference, to be held on the proposed park site, city  officials are expected to announce that they are considering calling a special  April election. The bond sale needs approval by two-thirds of the city's  registered voters, according to Michael McNamara, a private financial  consultant hired by the city.  </P> <P> If the bond sale is approved, property owners would be assessed an average of  $5.83 per month for the next 20 years, McNamara said.  </P> <P> Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said city officials envision a sprawling park with  tree-lined walkways, horse paths and baseball and soccer fields, all anchored  by a community and senior center. The plan would also preserve some of the  agricultural land and orange trees in community garden settings.  </P> <P> The plan, Hausdorfer said, is another example of San Juan Capistrano's  commitment to keep the city as rural as possible in the fast-developing South  County.  </P> <P> "San Juan has a long history of caring about values more than economics," he  said. "This is open space that cannot be replaced."  </P> <P> Citing Tuesday's failure of Measure M, a half-cent sales tax measure for  transportation improvements, Hausdorfer conceded that efforts to raise taxes in  the county do not appear to be popular.  </P> <P> But, he added, "San Juan (residents) have had a long history of saying: 'We're  different, and we're going to do some things differently.' "  </P> <P> Some property owners in the proposed park area have long been critical of the  city-imposed agricultural preserve category, which prevents them from  developing the property unless it is sold. They were skeptical that the city  would raise enough money to succeed with the park idea, which was first raised  in 1975.  </P> <P> "They are not going to buy any 120 acres with $20 million," said John Swanner,  68, who owns 38 acres of the farmland along with his brother and two cousins.  "They've been talking about doing this for years."  </P> <P> Swanner and other landowners have complained that the agricultural preserve  category, which went into effect in 1977, has limited their options on how they  can best use their property.  </P> <P> In the meantime, they say, they are losing thousands of dollars by paying  rising property-tax assessments for land that is not producing sufficient  revenue.  </P> <P> There are more than 40 property owners who have shares in four separate farming  estates in the proposed park area. Many of the owners are related to the  original farmers who first planted the orange groves in 1916.  </P> <P> "The farmers have held the land (rather than sell it to developers), and  they've been the losers because of it," said Bill Bathgate, a caretaker and  part owner of some of the preserve land. "They've waited patiently for the city  . . . to put it crudely . . . to put up or shut up."  </P> <P> Developers who purchase the property would have to apply to the city to remove  the agricultural preserve restrictions but could then develop the property,  according to city zoning law.  </P> <P> The idea to carve the city's only large park out of the farmland was first  proposed by the Planning Commission in 1975. Under the proposal, the City  Council was asked to approve a bond purchase to acquire 136 acres of farmland  at a cost ranging from $4 million to $7 million.  </P> <P> The council rejected the plan by a 3-2 vote.  </P> <P> "City policy (at that time) was to continue with an agricultural use," said  former councilman Roy Byrnes, who favored purchasing the land through the sale  of bonds. "After that, the decision to do a bond was never forced on the city."  </P> <P> The farming area is one of two large undeveloped parcels left in the city. The  other farm area is bounded by Alipaz Street, Camino del Avion and Del Obispo  Street.  </P> <P> The city is also studying that parcel of land for purchase to protect it  against future development.  </P> <P> The series of ridgelines that wind through the city have also been permanently  protected from development by city ordinance.  </P> <P> Hausdorfer said if the land were to be developed by private companies, they  would have to pay up to $50 million to shore up the eroding creek beds that  converge on the southern tip of the agricultural preserve.  </P> <P> They would also have to provide a safe crossing for the Atchinson, Topeka &amp;  Santa Fe Railway tracks, which bisect the land.  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers Warning Talbot calculated head depth wrong IF, like me, you dread the weekly visit to the supermarket - all that queuing and heavy shopping bags - then you will be pleased to hear, if you live in London, that The Food Ferry Company has come to the rescue. If you order Pounds 20 or more worth of goods - not difficult these days  - it will deliver your shopping for an additional Pounds 2.50 (Pounds 3.50 for those with an 081 telephone number). Prices look fair - about 5 percent more than the local supermarket. Ring 071-498-0827 for a loose leaf directory of more than 1200 product lines (which is updated regularly) and then you can order your groceries on the phone, by fax, or even by remote control (if you have Westminster Cable TV.) The Food Ferry Company will be on your doorstep that same day, and it will deliver between 5.30 pm and 9 pm. Lucinda de la Rue ANY visitor to the West Country or Bath in particular will benefit from the fact that Stephen Ross has returned to the kitchen. Ross made his name at Popjoys in Bath in the 1970s, and then at Homewood Park, one of the most successful country house hotels of the 1980s. After selling Homewood Park he and Penny, his wife, opened The Queensbury Hotel in Russel Street, Bath (tel: 0225-447928, fax 0225-446065) as a small, 24-bedroom, comfortable hotel which intentionally did not have a restaurant. Now he has succumbed and opened The Olive Tree restaurant in the hotel, where the name and menu reflect his enthusiasm for Mediterranean cooking. Prawn and cous-cous salad, Provencal fish soup, a wild mushroom souffle omelette and a choice of risottos are just some of the dishes. Open lunch and dinner, Tuesday-Saturday; about Pounds 18 for three courses and coffee. Set price lunch is Pounds 12.50.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Many Americans remain fat because they refuse to exercise while they diet,  according to the Centers for Disease Control. CDC researchers reported that  43.6% of overweight men and 63.9% of women tried to lose weight only by eating  fewer calories, and 24.3% of heavy men and 34.7% of the overweight women  increased their physical activity but did not diet. "We need to incorporate  physical activity along with caloric restriction," said Eddas M. Bennett, a CDC  epidemiologist. "One is not better without the other. You really need both."  The CDC survey found that 34 million Americans -- about one in four adults --  are overweight by 20% or more. Bennett blamed the unwillingness to exercise on  the preoccupation with fad diets and a "more sedentary" life style.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> A WITNESS TO THE PANAMA INVASION: FEAR AND PRIDE LIVED SIDE BY SIDE  </P> <P> What has traditionally been a silent, holy night -- the early hours of  Christmas morning -- was this year a night filled with the sounds of AC-130s  (Spectras), fighter planes and helicopters flying all over Panama City and the  American military bases.  </P> <P> Although there wasn't as much shooting that night as the previous nights, the  mood and spirit of Christmas was different. Midnight Mass had been canceled.  Only two days earlier, the church, a quarter-mile from the house at Albrook Air  Force Station where we were staying, had taken a hit. Albrook was completely  dark; even the antique lampposts in the streets had been destroyed for our  safety.  </P> <P> Christmas this year, when my family and I were visiting Panama, was a time for  anticipation, thanksgiving and hope. I had never been so proud to be an  American and to have witnessed such an event, even though our lives were at  serious risk. The execution of the mission was superb, and our soldiers handled  the operation with precision. Most importantly, I was overwhelmed with joy to  see the happiness that filled the Panamanian people's hearts, knowing that the  threat, power and rule of former dictator Manuel Noriega finally was over.  </P> <P> The memories of excitement and yet horror of that early morning of Dec. 20 are  so vivid in my mind that I still feel anxiety and fear. I wondered then if I  would ever live to tell of the traumatic event.  </P> <P> I was in bed, not yet asleep, when I heard several gunshots at approximately  midnight. I ran into my parents' bedroom in our friend's house and found them  asleep. I figured that the gunshots might have been my imagination, since I had  been told earlier that evening that something might happen.  </P> <P> On our trip to Panama only a few days earlier, a military officer warned me  that "once an American gets killed by Noriega's men, the United States will  have reason to intervene." In fact, the morning after the Marine officer had  been killed, I was shocked to see around 30 or 40 troops in front of the  military base church while Mass was being said. One could feel the tension in  the air, and it seemed inevitable that "something" was going to happen.  </P> <P> Around 12:45 a.m., I knew it wasn't my imagination. All I could hear was boom,  boom, boom. At first I was excited, singing and jumping for joy, because I knew  that this was what the Panamanian people had prayed for for so long. Being part  Panamanian, I could understand the hopes for a new beginning that could now be  within reach for Panamanians. The thought of bringing back democracy to Panama,  where people could live a life different from the one they had been forced to  live for the past 21 years, was exhilarating.  </P> <P> Filled with all this excitement, I at first ignored the fact that that my life  was in danger. I naively felt as though I was an outsider looking into a glass  bubble where I could see endless tracers flying through the sky about a third  of a mile from the house. The explosions of buildings, including the Transcito  (a building used by the Panama Defense Forces), lighted the sky like fireworks.  </P> <P> We ran downstairs to the outside carport beneath the house to get a better  glimpse. The house was within 100 yards of the Albrook flight line. We were  there for only a few minutes when a combat-ready soldier ran by and ordered us  to get back into the house and stay low. After we went back upstairs, our  friend, a priest, with whom we were staying, told us: "I have already asked the  Lord to forgive all your sins."  </P> <P> It was the combination of these two incidents that made me realize that there  wasn't a "glass bubble" separating us from the invasion. Suddenly, I was  shocked, imagining the possible consequences of this event and at the same time  having flashbacks of my life. I felt like I was living a horrible nightmare.  </P> <P> As the next days went by, we avoided windows and doors, kept almost all the  lights out and practically crawled everywhere. It was also virtually impossible  to sleep at any time because of the anxiety. By Friday morning, we felt it was  safe enough to take a peek outside and get some fresh air. When we heard  automatic gunfire echoing around us, we realized we had experienced a false  sense of security. Several troops ran by and asked us to go upstairs and keep  low. We then heard mortars exploding; our troops were retaliating against and  neutralizing some snipers.  </P> <P> Later that day we found out that an American-dependent wife had been killed  several doors down from our house. The only time our family really ever got out  of the house, until we came back to the United States, we saw armored carriers  and vehicles driving all around Albrook Air Force Station.  </P> <P> I'm sure that many people question the necessity of this invasion. I honestly  think it was Panama's last hope. When we first arrived, I have to admit that  the environment had changed drastically since our family's last visit only  three years earlier. As we drove from Howard Air Base to Albrook, I saw areas  that once were controlled by the U.S. military, including the "Ferrocarril" (a  railroad station), Balboa and perimeters of the American bases, practically in  ruins. When our family was stationed in Panama in the late 1970s, I remembered  all these areas as being in immaculate condition.  </P> <P> I felt sadness in my heart to see how this country, which once was so beautiful  and full of life, now was going downhill. Most, if not all, Panamanians blame  this on one person -- Noriega -- and the corruption of his reign.  </P> <P> The attitudes of the Panamanians had also changed. It is alleged that, in the  past, people who opposed Noriega mysteriously disappeared. Of those, many were  threatened, tortured and killed by his men. This intimidation led to the  oppression of the people. Within the past several months, a few of my relatives  in Panama were threatened and detained for no apparent reason. I am grateful to  be able to say that they are safe and doing well now.  </P> <P> However, with the continuous oppression of the Panamanians and endangerment of  American lives, something had to be done. It is important to note that once the  invasion took place, the vast majority of Panamanians not only praised our  soldiers for being there, but also helped identify which Panamanians were  "pro-Noriega" and which weren't.  </P> <P> Even now when I look back on this historic event, the images are still fresh in  my mind. In fact, when I arrived at Kelly Air Force Base on our return to the  States, and even since I have been back home in Orange County, it has been hard  to sleep peacefully at night. The planes I heard flying out of Kelly and even  now those from John Wayne Airport remind me of the same AC-130s, fighter planes  and helicopters back in Panama.  </P> <P> But, regardless of the anxiety I still encounter, I am thankful to have been  able to witness the U.S. invasion of Panama and to have returned safely.  Although the Panamanians didn't have a "silent night" this Christmas, they had  much to rejoice about. They received the greatest gift of all -- the end of a  dictator's reign and corruption and the return of democracy to Panama.  </P></p>

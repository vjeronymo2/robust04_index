			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpenko, editor in chief of VECHIRNIY </F> KYYIV, under the "The Editor in Chief's Column" rubric: "The  Press: Today and Tomorrow"]    [Text] Preliminary results of a subscription campaign have  now been summed up; the campaign has proceeded with difficulty  and slowly, through severe clashes between editorial offices and  the monopolistic postal department, against an overall  background of the continuing pronounced impoverishment of the  population. The monopoly won out in this instance, too: The  price of subscription and delivery of the press exceeds all  outlays on publishing it--the cost of newsprint (at present, one  tonne already costs as much as 15 million karbovantsy),  printing, wages, internal outlays of editorial offices, and so  on. This is happening while the quality of postal services is  deteriorating markedly: More and more complaints are being heard  about a failure to deliver periodicals on time.    The only comforting point is that, apparently, the first  blow  has been dealt to the monopoly of the postal department,  certainly not a lethal blow but a perceptible one: Alternative  structures have come along that undertook to take subscriptions.  These are the newsstands of the former Soyuzdruk [Main  Administration for the Distribution of the Press of the USSR  Ministry of Communications], which have broken away into the  freedom of leasing from the powerful clutches of the Central  Postal Office of Kiev, various small enterprises, and the  editorial offices themselves. Difficult trials still lie ahead  for them; it is not easy to stand against a monopoly. However,  already the first holes are in the once unsinkable vessel of the  Ministry of Communications.    What did the results of the subscription campaign indicate?    First, they testify to the fact that the impoverished  population, stripped by our dear government, is no longer able  to afford the spiritual nourishment--periodicals. As recently as  a few years ago, the average resident of Kiev subscribed to  three or four publications; last year, many people switched to  one, whereas in the current year, even one newspaper has become  unaffordable to many.    Second, this subscription campaign indicated that  everything in the domain of the press is upside down.  Previously, the struggle for a large circulation was considered  a matter of prestige in our country; it still is abroad. During  the last subscription campaign, many editorial offices abandoned  the chase after circulation: After all, the greater the  circulation of a newspaper, the more difficult the life of the  editorial office is and the greater the losses that await it in  the near future. At present, there are virtually no profitable  newspapers. I see nothing strange about the circulation of  newspapers dropping yet again. Even the state press, which  exists mainly thanks to the state budget, cannot withstand the  current price gouging. Newspapers of the type of FINANSOVYY  KIYEV and RYNOCHNAYA PLOSHCHAD, which at one time lured citizens  by supposedly being free, have announced subscriptions and put  themselves on the same footing as others.    Third, despite the high prices for periodicals and  everything else, the impoverishment of the people, and  competition from free television and radio, citizens of Ukraine  have displayed their high intellectual standards, considerable  spiritual needs, and, in addition, their civic awareness: The  results of the subscription campaign were more favorable then  could be expected. SILSKI VISTI has secured a large circulation  by the standards of this time, 312,000 copies, thus  demonstrating yet again the stability of the only nationwide  newspaper for rural areas. HOLOS UKRAYINY got 205,000 copies,  URYADOVYY KURYER--182,000 copies, MOLOD UKRAYINY--70,000 copies,  NEZAVISIMOST--55,000 copies, UKRAYINA MOLODA--81,000 copies,  PRAVDA UKRAYINY--79,000 copies, and LITERATURNA UKRAYINA--27,000  copies. An insanely impudent and expensive advertising campaign  notwithstanding, KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI failed to retain its  circulation generated by scandal features, but nonetheless got  subscriptions for 150,000 copies, which proves yet again that  there is a social need for such a newspaper, too.    Just as the editorial office had planned, VECHIRNIY KYYIV  reached the intended circulation, between 40,000 and 45,000  copies, together with some retail sales. We are not able to  "hack" a greater circulation in the environment of an economic  crisis. For this reason, we were forced to give up the  Russian-language edition; we are grateful that the majority of  readers perceive this step with understanding. However, our  subscribers had an opportunity to ascertain one thing: The  editorial office has done everything possible to meet its  obligations to the readers. As had been promised, we did not  charge additional subscription fees in the middle of the year  and did not reduce the size or frequency of publication of the  newspaper. We published five times per week at a time when some  five-day newspapers became weeklies. Our readers are receiving  all the 250 issues of VECHIRNIY KYYIV due to them annually. We  are also planning to publish the newspaper five times a week in  the coming year. We have helped our low-income subscribers as  best we could by establishing a charitable foundation and  helping them to obtain subscriptions for the next year.    What does the next year, the Year of the Dog, hold in store  for the press? Figuratively, ours will be the life of dogs. The  state publishing house--for the nth time!--has increased prices  for printing services, and the Central Post Office of Kiev is  counting on tripling (!?) the fees for delivering the press in  the second quarter. Prices for newsprint (which is delivered  exclusively from Russia) will hardly stabilize; even now, these  prices reach world levels.    How will the press survive under such conditions? The state  press will be sustained from the state budget, that is, at our  expense, regardless of whether we want this or not. The press of  commercial structures will depend on how thick the wallets of  their masters are: There is nothing to be done--such is the law  of the market. The independent press, i.e., such that does not  serve the power structure, does not have owners and does not  want to have them, and that in which labor or journalist  collectives act as founders--such a press has nobody to attach  its hopes to, except the likewise impoverished readers. The  authorities will hardly help this press, because it sticks in  its craw. However, one thing is clear: The day on which the last  independent newspaper goes down in Ukraine will be the beginning  of the end for democracy. Actually, the offensive of the current  power structure against openness and democracy and their  embodiment, the mass media, has already begun. Live broadcasting  of the meetings of the Supreme Council sessions has been  suspended on the ridiculous pretext of ensuring an equal footing  for candidates for deputy; TV commentators now assure us through  the lips of their masters that the session is proceeding in a  clear-cut and fine manner. The minister of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine has forbidden officers to write in the civilian press if  the topics of these presentations transcend the confines of the  military statute. Strange things are happening at our  degenerating television: Reassignments in the top leadership  echelon are not aimed at a fundamental improvement in  programming, but rather at the reliability of the censorship  screen--God forbid that some unsanctioned thought should get  through. So a television person is assigned to manage radio  broadcasting, and a radio person is transplanted to television;  neither one knows the new business perfectly. Ideas are hatched  instead about suspending the relay of radio broadcasts to the  Kiev area on the city network, thus driving a wedge into the  relationship between urban and rural, areas which is not ideal  to begin with. The youth studio Hart is instead being hampered,  and episodes that criticize the policy of the current  authorities are not being allowed on the air. A familiar  situation, is it not?    Add to this the fact that, contrary to the law that bans the  censorship of the mass media, structures of the former  censorship department that was invented by the Communist Party  in its time still survive in our country; of course, they are  being sustained from the budget. Who needs this? Does someone  believe that a time will come when this organ for smothering  free thought will be needed? This is a purely rhetorical  question.    Nonetheless, let us be optimistic. Our society has already  matured to such a stage as to not allow the winding-down of  democracy. We have entered the wide world, and there no longer  is at present--nor, one hopes, will there ever be--an iron  curtain separating us from the world and the world from us. Let  us in unison oppose the offensive against glasnost in every way  we can. We will not let them tighten the noose around the neck  of the independent press. Support the press morally,  organizationally, and, those of you who can do it, also  financially, and the press will become a mighty weapon of the  society in the struggle for the assertion of democracy.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Markets: Having their cake and eating it - Serious Money WHEN THE chairman of Britain's largest building society says he cannot sell his customers the right products, it should be a clear signal to consumers - if they did not know already - that something is seriously wrong with the financial services industry. Jim Birrell, the outgoing chairman of the Halifax, said this week that the Halifax wanted to try to change the rules on 'polarisation' under which financial products are retailed. His remarks add to the increasingly circular debate on how consumer interests are best protected under the system laid down by the Financial Services Act in 1988. 'Polarisation' is the name given to the system under which those who sell financial products are divided into two separate groups. Financial intermediaries can either sell the products of one company only - ie, become its 'tied' agent - or set up as an independent financial adviser, where they can sell anyone's products. Originally, polarisation was designed to protect both IFAs and the consumer. Tied agents must tell their clients that they are acting for one company only. 'Multi-tying,' whereby agents would tie themselves to two or three companies in order to offer a wider range of products, was thought to confuse customers and was resisted by IFAs as threatening their interests. It was also open to abuse because multi-tied agents could give the impression that they were independent. This has not worked out as it should. One unintended consequence of polarisation has been that instead of protecting independent financial advice, it has largely disappeared from banks and building societies (although most retain separate IFA arms), mainly because life companies offer higher commission to tied agents than to IFAs. Moreover, polarisation has not stopped customers being confused. Even though the bank or building society salesman has to declare the tie, customers do not necessarily realise the implications. They cannot be blamed for assuming that large institutions such as the Halifax, which act in a competitive environment on mortgage and savings rates, also have a competitive range of financial products. But there was never any reason why one provider - the company to which the institution is tied - should have a monopoly of the best financial products. The provider with a good record for with-profits plans for pensions will not necessarily have the highest performing unit trusts. After toying briefly with independent financial advice in the wake of the Financial Services Act, Halifax opted for a tie to Standard Life, one of Britain's largest insurance companies. Halifax is now restless. Birrell said this week that 'there are other sectors of the financial services market where Standard Life is not the best provider.' The society wants to expand through multi-tying. His remarks highlight the speed with which high street banks and building societies made their choice between the interests of their customers and their own profitability after the implementation of the Financial Services Act. Asked why Halifax did not opt to retain independent financial advice if it wanted to be able to sell products of more then one company, Birrell was honest - 'the remuneration is better as a tied agent,' he said. The tie earned Halifax Pounds 177m in commission in 1992, a hefty proportion of the group's total profit of Pounds 680m. Birrell also said that Halifax found that its customers did not know whether it was independent or tied. Unfortunately there is little reason to believe that the consumer would necessarily be in a better position with multi-ties. There is no getting away from the nub of the problem, which is that better regulation is needed in the industry and that financial salesmen and advisers should be made to disclose the commission they receive for selling a product. Consumers should be allowed to know the total they are paying for a financial product, in simple arithmetic. It is these deficiencies which have contributed to the fading influence of the independent financial adviser, who is independent only to the degree that he receives payment for his services from many life companies and financial providers, instead of one. Diligent IFAs who resist the temptation to oversell, risk losing their reputation because of the misdeeds of their less scrupulous colleagues. Members of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for IFAs, were liable for large payments to the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which threatened the loss of IFAs to tied agent status. The insurance companies which use IFAs have been prevailed upon to pick up a large part of the tab for the ICS. The Office of Fair Trading made a good beginning towards reform by calling in March for more disclosure. Unfortunately, it limited this recommendation to IFAs and not to tied agents - with the danger that banks and building societies will manage to kill off most of the IFA market, further reducing consumer choice. It is small wonder that Halifax wants to alter polarisation to preserve for itself the benefits of tying, while widening its product range. It wants to have the best of both worlds. By the same token, consumers must look after their own interests by continuing to press for disclosure and for higher standards of advice and regulation in the industry.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Where are our Madisons? It is easy to feel dismay about the Maastricht debate. For two issues - national sovereignty and representative government - have become hopelessly embroiled and must be separated if we are to think clearly about the pros and cons of the treaty. Representative government can exist when sovereign rights are united (as in the UK) or when they are divided (as in US federalism). But neither form of the state guarantees representative government. The middle ground of British opinion - including both those who reluctantly feel it is best to ratify Maastricht and those who unhappily conclude it should be rejected - is chiefly concerned with the latter issue. Those who reluctantly support ratification fear that they may be sacrificing self-government to the development of the Community, while those who oppose ratification fear that their concern with self-government may be misunderstood as blind nationalism, as turning away from Europe on the simplistic ground of preserving national sovereignty. And both sections of middling opinion are right to fear what they fear. The future of representative government in a more unified Europe ought now to be the central issue. Until the 18th century it was an axiom of European political thought that the larger the political unit, the more likely it was to be governed despotically. Only with the help, first of the British model of government and then of American federalism, was that axiom partially revised by liberal constitutional theory. But that does not mean that the causes which had previously led thinkers to take such a dim view of the prospects of self-government outside small communities ceased to operate. Yet in recent decades politicians have become almost cavalier about the political or constitutional dimension of the European Community. Take, for example, the casual way in which the population of eastern Germany was absorbed. For 60 years some 17m people there had been subject to despotic government, first of the right and then of the left. Can anyone doubt that habits and attitudes formed under such regimes survive, or that an education in representative government and constitutional issues is required to root out authoritarian attitudes? Rostock provides a warning. Sadly, French leaders have concluded that the best response is to 'bind' Germany to the rest of Europe by imposing a centralised decision-making authority which resembles nothing so much as the French state. Doubtless the French hope that such a structure will preserve their de facto domination of the Community, despite the increased size and economic power of Germany. It was the urgency of this French design which led to the Maastricht treaty, which does not begin to address constitutional issues squarely. Such issues were scarcely identified, let alone addressed, by European leaders at Maastricht. Why not? Since the second world war, the language of economics has driven out the language of politics and particularly the language of constitutionalism. Yet the latter was the great achievement of liberal thought in the 18th and 19th century, and it was directed especially at one problem - how authority and power can be dispersed in a political system so that tyranny is prevented, without making efficient and just government impossible. The pursuit of economic integration in Europe has resulted in a curious outcome. A Community inspired by liberal democratic principles has increasingly acted on quasi-Marxist assumptions - assuming that when economic progress had been achieved, other institutional improvements would follow inevitably or as a matter of course. But that is a form of economic determinism which has been discredited intellectually and practically. Nothing reflects this dominance of economic over political language more than the hasty, last-minute assertion of the 'subsidiarity' principle. For what does subsidiarity mean? Is it a political principle  - in which case it acts merely as camouflage for a free-for-all in which the outcome is by definition compatible with the subsidiarity principle, since there are no clear criteria governing the distribution of power? Or is it a constitutional and juridical principle? But if it is the latter, then subsidiarity implies a movement towards a federal Europe, with an agency - presumably the European Court - being vested with the right to settle conflicts of jurisdiction and create spheres of authority. And if so, what are the terms of reference for the Court, what normative framework will guide its decisions and serve to legitimate them? And are those terms adequate? It was the thrust of liberal constitutional theory in the 18th and 19th centuries to consider and deepen our understanding of such questions. Its most celebrated principles - the separation of powers, entrenched rights and forms of federalism - were means to that end. To suppose that a quick tour around European capitals to reach a consensus on 'how subsidiarity works' is now enough represents an intellectual regression which could have dreadful practical consequences in the long run. It is shaming for Europe in the 1990s that when its leaders meet to discuss the shape of the future EC they do not begin to match the vision of those who drafted the US Constitution in the late 1780s. Where are our Madisons, Hamiltons and Jeffersons? If the language in which the EC identifies and creates itself becomes largely economic, then the prospects for self-government in Europe are grim.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine and Austria, which are separated by only a  few hundred kilometers, should influence one another, and my  meetings with Ukrainian officials are yet another step toward  preserving peace in Europe. This was said at a news conference  by Austrian Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, who is currently  on an official visit to Ukraine. As Ukrainian Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy noted, both countries advocate the development  of mobile and effective armed forces. The exchange of  experience at all military levels between Ukraine and Austria  will play an important role in ensuring European stability. The  defense ministers spoke in positive terms about NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, which envisions equal conditions  for all countries. They also announced the signing a joint  statement on cooperation between the Ukrainian and Austrian  Defense Ministries. Dr. Werner Fasslabend also met with Dmytro  Chernenko, Ukraine's minister of machine-building, defense  industries, and conversion.</p>

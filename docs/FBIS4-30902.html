			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- Price dumping is  unacceptable to the Czech Government, and to accuse the Czech  Republic of such a thing is absurd, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  said after yesterday's cabinet meeting, in connection with the  anti-dumping procedures initiated by the European Union against  nine Czech cement producers. The whole affair is an example of  what is bad in trade relations between the European Union and  the Czech Republic, Klaus said.    Trade barriers are a problem for the Czech Republic, which  would welcome the abolition of duties before 2001, the deadline  set by the association agreement, he continued. The  anti-dumping procedures were initiated on March 28 against  Slovak and Polish as well as Czech producers. The European  Commission, at the request of the German Association of Cement  Producers, opened an investigation similar to a trial, in which  the accused are represented by lawyers.</p>

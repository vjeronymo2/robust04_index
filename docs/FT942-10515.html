			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Recovery at Hindustan Motors Hindustan Motors, India's second largest carmaker and a GP Birla group company, confirmed its recovery from recession for the year to March 31 by making a net profit of Rs176m (Dollars 5.6m), against a loss of Rs305m in the previous year. With higher car sales and improvements in the earthmoving equipment and power products division, turnover rose to Rs6.44bn from Rs5.04bn. The company, which is in talks with General Motors of the US about a possible joint venture in India, said it had been able to reduce costs during the year and there would be further savings with the ongoing modernisation of car production facilities. MRF, India's biggest producer and exporter of tyres, recorded a 15.1 per cent increase in net sales to Rs5.38bn for the six months to end-March from Rs4.68bn in the same period last year. The company's tyres met with greater demand from motor vehicle manufacturers and also in the replacement market. However, because of higher input costs, gross profit was up only 2.8 per cent to Rs420m.</p>

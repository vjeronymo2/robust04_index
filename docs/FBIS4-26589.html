			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- China has set up over  400 firms involved in overseas labor services, and they are  undertaking contracted projects in more than 170 countries and  regions throughout the world.    The latest report from the relevant government department  shows that a total of more than 48,000 overseas labor service  projects have been signed since 1979 by various types of Chinese  service companies, involving 34.16 billion U.S. dollars, with an  accumulated turnover of 20.74 billion U.S. dollars.    The report also indicates that in the first four months of  this year the overseas labor service contracts signed reached  2.05 billion U.S. dollars with a turnover of 1.44 billion U.S.  dollars, a hefty rise from the same period of last year.    In 1993 China signed over 11,600 such contracts worth 6.8  billion U.S. dollars, with an overall turnover of 4.538 billion  U.S. dollars, and about 174,000 experts and skilled workers were  sent abroad.    Over the past few years China has contracted various  projects  in industry, agriculture and the service industries, including  oil refineries and textile factories.    China's overseas services industry began almost at the same  time as the reform and open policies were initiated in the late  1970s and early 1980s. Before this, China used to render free  labor services abroad, the official said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The remaining 20 comments, although supporting the extension of special bulk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-class rates to voting registration officials, seek an expansion of the types of matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that those officials may mail at the special rates. Like other mailers eligible to use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special rates, voting registration officials would be permitted to enter only bulk third-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter at those rates. The commenters assert that the proposed rule would not result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any real savings for voter registration mailings for these reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The bulk rates are available only if the mailing contains 200 or more items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sorted by ZIP Code;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Third-class mail has to be generic only and, therefore, may not contain any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references to personal or unique information, as required in most mailings under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Voter Registration Act (NVRA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Mailings under the NVRA are either single items of a First-Class nature mailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in response to a registration application or ``forwardable'' mailings; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) All mailings required under the NVRA must be given First-Class service, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rates would not apply to any ``return if undeliverable'' or ``forward'' action, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential to the NVRA mailings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, these 20 commenters urge that the Postal Service, in order to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the intent of Congress in the NVRA, do the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Amend the Domestic Mail Manual to permit registration materials to be mailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First-Class at the special bulk third-class rates or some other rate that is lower than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular First-Class;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Permit voting registration officials to use special bulk third-class rates for mailings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the NVRA, regardless of the service requested or the quantity involved; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Help ensure citizen participation in the election process by providing special third-class rates for all official registration mailings, lowering the number of pieces required for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NVRA mailings, and allowing voters to submit ballots and registration cards through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mail at no expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the outset, the Postal Service notes that the eligibility for the special rates is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as restrictive as these commenters appear to believe. It is true that matter considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``actual and personal correspondence'' must be entered as First-Class Mail and not as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-class mail. However, this requirement does not mean that matter entered at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special rates must be generic and devoid of any items unique to the addressee. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instance, a mailpiece would not be disqualified ordinarily at the third-class rates for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion of information typically on voting material such as an account number or file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number, name and address of the addressee, the polling place, congressional district,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislative district, school board district, councilmanic district, election district, and precinct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (As a related example, library cards are generally eligible for third-class mail.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, although third-class mail generally must consist entirely of printed matter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than handwritten or typewritten matter, the addition of a handwritten or typewritten  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name and address is permitted. Questions about third-class eligibility of a particular piece  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be raised with local postal officials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The need for forwarding, return, or address correction services also would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude the use of third-class mail. Although these services are not automatically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for third-class mail, they can be obtained by adding the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endorsements to the mail. Extra postage is assessed only for pieces that require such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. Election boards or voter registration commissions can minimize the volume of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pieces forwarded or returned either by using the National Change of Address (NCOA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system to maintain current address lists or by obtaining residential change-of-address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information from PS Form 3575 as provided by Domestic Mail Manual A910.6.0.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service believes that the proposed rule requiring matter of voting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration officials to meet the requirements that other mailers must meet to qualify for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the special bulk third-class rate is consistent with Public Law 103&hyph;31. That Act states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Postal Service shall make available to a state or local voting registration official the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for any class of mail that is available to a qualified nonprofit organization under 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 3626 for making a mailing that the official certifies is required or authorized by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. Organizations authorized to mail at the special bulk third-class rates may mail only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their bulk third-class matter at those rates. Third-class mail consists of mailable matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that weighs less than 16 ounces, is not mailed or required to be mailed as First-Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mail, and is not entered as second-class mail (except as permitted or required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

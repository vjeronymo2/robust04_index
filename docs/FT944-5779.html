			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (17): Consultant's critique It is much easier to tell if the ground is uneven when driving a car than when riding a bucking bronco. There are far fewer variables to deal with and the car does not have quite as many inherent instabilities. To improve quality in process industries, reduce variability as far as possible. If a system is stable, it is much simpler to spot rogue results and to take corrective action early. Philips has to control all stages along the production line. Any error in temperature may ruin a large batch of glass. It is effectively a single critical path and losses are lost for ever - there is little or no slack. Rapid corrective action reduces the size of variations as well as their duration. In the past this has been managed with paper-based methods such as Shewhart charts. Results are plotted, the average calculated and upper and lower limits drawn. If a result is found outside those limits, then it warrants investigation. The narrower the band between the two limits, the better the delivered quality. The system that Philips uses is a good match for its requirements. It provides a response that is fast enough even if it is not a true real-time system. It achieves the desired goals at a low cost and is simple enough to be maintained locally. A more complex system might give finer control when working but be more risky if it were to fail. Most importantly, the system will allow Philips to enter the market for computer monitor screens which demand higher quality than televisions. It enhances future prospects as well as current productivity. Lessons from this case: Avoid the temptation for an all-singing, all-dancing system. Match the solution to the requirements. Decrease variability to increase the quality.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology: Stopping the flood - Nearly a third of the water supply in England and Wales is lost through leakage. Jane Martinson reports on new ways to plug the gaps Thames Water, Britain's biggest water company, postponed building a Pounds 500m reservoir at the end of last year chiefly because of growing confidence in its ability to plug leaks. Technological advances in leakage control could mean that no new large-scale reservoir will be needed for a decade or more. Charles Hurst, leakage control manager at Thames Water, estimates that an integrated system of leakage detection across Thames Water's distribution network will render a reservoir the size of the proposed one at Abingdon in Oxfordshire - some 10 sq km - unnecessary until 2015. The current postponement is for five years. Leakage is an important issue in the run-up to the water industry's first review since privatisation. Oftwat, the industry regulator, will be reassessing the basis for annual price rises for the next five to 10 years. Figures from Ofwat reveal that an average 29 per cent of the water supply in England and Wales is lost through leakage. Both it and the National Rivers Authority have said they will not favour any plans for large-scale capital investment projects until companies take action on leakage and consider installing meters. 'It is a major development for a company to put off a big reservoir,' Hurst says. 'There were pressures from Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority but confidence had been built up through the company because of the results we have achieved with leakage.' Thames Water's advanced leakage detection equipment is able to record the size and location of underground leaks much faster and more accurately than older methods. The company reports that its 'breakthrough' is saving up to 60m litres of water a day. Water supply in the area dropped last year by 250m litres a day, partly because of cost-cutting by industry. Hurst estimates that without an adequate leakage detection programme a new medium-sized reservoir would be needed every three years to meet growing demand, estimated by Thames Water to be between 0.5 and 1 per cent per year. Conventional techniques for finding underground leaks are time-consuming and costly. For flow rates to be measured, the water supply to an entire neighbourhood is usually cut off. Mains have to be recharged and although such 'step tests' take place during the night when readings are more accurate, customers are often left without water for hours. The old equipment was slow to monitor changes and the measured flow rates had to be taken away for analysis during the day. Although 10 per cent of leaks are responsible for roughly 90 per cent of water lost, it was not possible to measure the exact size of a problem, which often led to mains repairs teams digging down to find only a tiny leak. Thames Water contacted Reten Acoustics of Gwent, which developed the Quick Report Leak Spotter. This instrument translates water flow into electric signals through a rotating turbine which gives off magnetic pulses. It then measures the time interval between pulses. The pulse can be timed to one thousandth of a second, much faster than previously, and give a much more accurate gauge to the size of the problem. An instant computer read-out is conveyed to engineers. The valves in the pipes need to be shut off for only minutes to check flow rates. A big leak can be detected immediately. Hurst says: 'The concept of what we are doing is very simple but, until now, we lacked the technology.' In conjunction with a leak noise correlator which pinpoints the leak's location, the equipment identifies how fast the leak is flowing. Where large-scale repairs are unnecessary, pressure control valves are used. These work on the principle that excess pressure feeds leaks and is therefore wasted. By reducing pressure, the water lost through leaks is reduced. Thames Water will introduce variable-outlet pressure control valves in London to remove unnecessary pressure at night. The developments at Thames Water are not unique, but they highlight the flurry of technological activity in the field of leakage control in recent years. Stan Bessey, chairman of the National Leakage Initiative set up by the Water Services Association and the Water Companies Association two years ago, says: 'Britain leads the field in leakage technology now. This is despite, or perhaps because of, the high leakage levels.' Britain's lead stems partly because of its ageing water system, helped by a Pounds 28bn capital investment programme started in 1990. Thames Water spends more than Pounds 20m a year in leakage detection. The money spent on 20 Quick Report Leak Spotters (about Pounds 1m) was recouped 'very quickly', says Hurst. But it remains to be seen how these improvements in leakage control will be paid for after the review. There is some conflict over whether Ofwat will allow Thames Water to increase prices to pay for better control or whether the company will have to meet the cost through greater efficiency. Thames Water says that the significant investment needed to set up an entire leakage control system in the distribution network will form part of discussions with Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, this spring. Byatt, in an attempt to 'halt this endless escalation in prices' in the industry, seems unlikely to agree that customers should pay more for greater better leakage control. A spokesman for Ofwat said: 'In most cases companies have got to improve efficiency within existing price limits.' Thames Water, while keen to advertise it is winning the war against leakage through its use of technology, may yet have a fight on its hands over who is to pay.</p>

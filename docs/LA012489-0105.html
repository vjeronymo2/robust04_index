			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOKIES PUSH ABORTION FUNDING  </P> <P> Abortion rights groups Monday distributed fortune cookies filled with reasons  to support state-financed abortions for poor women, the day after the 16th  anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions.  </P> <P> "It's letting them know that it makes good political choice to vote  pro-choice," said Shireen Miles, state coordinator for the National  Organization for Women.  </P> <P> The cookies were distributed to members of the Legislature, which for the last  11 years has tried to restrict abortions under the state's Medi-Cal health care  program. Each year, the state Supreme Court has overturned the restrictions.  </P> <P> The cookies contained statements and poll results indicating broad public  support for abortion rights, Miles said.  </P></p>

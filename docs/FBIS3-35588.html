Participants unanimously spoke in favor of creating an  economic cooperation zone, granting their territories special  status, and instituting direct financial accounting between  enterprises in the border oblasts of Russia and Ukraine.    The adoption of the statutes of the council of the leaders  of  border oblasts of Russia and Ukraine was a concrete expression  of the coordinated approach by the Russian and Ukrainian sides.  A permanent working body -- the council's executive committee  -- was set up to coordinate cooperation between the regions.    Participants appealed to the presidents of Russia and  Ukraine  to conclude an intergovernmental agreement between the two  countries and to adopt the necessary legislative acts in the  shortest possible time.</p>

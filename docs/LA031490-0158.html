			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TALKS ON GERMAN UNITY WILL INCLUDE POLAND IN DISCUSSIONS OF BORDER  </P> <P> The four World War II Allies and the two Germanys, ending their first session  of talks on German unity, said today that they have agreed to include Poland in  their discussions when they deal with the Polish border.  </P> <P> Dieter Kastrup, head of the West German delegation, said the group -- the  Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France and East and West Germany --  discussed procedural issues and had a first exchange of views on an agenda for  future talks.  </P> <P> Kastrup did not say how Polish representatives will participate in the talks  among the two Germanys and the World War II allies.  </P> <P> The decision was a triumph for Warsaw, which launched a diplomatic drive for a  say at the talks when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried to keep open the  border issue and to force Poland to swear off postwar reparations claims.  </P> <P> Kohl has pledged to support a treaty fixing the border.  </P> <P> "The participants agreed Poland will be invited as soon as questions are  discussed . . . that especially affect its borders," Kastrup, a senior official  of the West German Foreign Ministry, told journalists after the daylong  meeting.  </P> <P> Almost one-third of Polish territory is former German land handed over to  Warsaw after the war to compensate for Polish territory seized to the east by  Moscow.  </P> <P> The border issue blew up this month when Kohl, increasingly assertive as  Germany nears unity, tried to pressure Poland to please right-wing voters eager  to reclaim that land.  </P> <P> The attempt sparked protests abroad and aroused fears that the new Germany, a  superstate of 78 million people, would throw its weight around like its  historic predecessors.  </P> <P> Kastrup said delegations at these talks, held at a round table with the two  Germanys sitting side by side, discussed procedural issues about the talks due  to last several months.  </P> <P> The discussions, dubbed the "two-plus-four" talks, are aimed at agreements on  whether a united Germany is neutral or in the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, where its borders will be and what Berlin's status will be.  </P> <P> "They also had an initial exchange of ideas on about which topics are to be  handled on the agenda of future sessions," Kastrup said.  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry officials will meet again in East Berlin soon after East  Germany's first free elections Sunday, and alternate between Bonn and East  Berlin thereafter.  </P></p>

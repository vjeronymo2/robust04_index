			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (4): Consolidation is the new priority - After record growth rates, the economy has reached a plateau of success IN most countries, a yearly 8 per cent economic growth figure would throw finance ministers and central bankers into paroxysms of joy. Not so in Malaysia. Last year Malaysia's overall GDP growth was indeed 8 per cent, but the figure was described merely as 'creditable' by Bank Negara, the country's central bank. Malaysia has been used to flying in the clear skies of economic success, with soaring GDP growth rates of 9 per cent in 1988, 8.7 in 1989, nearly 10 per cent in 1990 and 8.6 per cent in 1991. The buzz word now is consolidation. The economy, say the official planners, is taking a breather. A combination of continuing tight counter-inflationary policies at home and a less than buoyant market abroad means that GDP growth will further moderate to between 7.5 - 7.8 per cent this year. 'The prospects for a slow and moderate recovery in the major industrial countries could well be a blessing in disguise,' says Bank Negara. 'It would provide some much needed respite for the Malaysian economy to consolidate its position - to alleviate outstanding infrastructural and supply impediments and pave the way for sustainable growth with stability over the medium term.' But overcoming those impediments, which include serious labour shortages, infrastructure bottlenecks, a drop in investments growth and weak markets for various export sectors, will not be easy. Malaysia has been climbing fast. Last year per capita income increased a further 11 per cent to MDollars 7,541 (Dollars 2,950). Malaysia's long term plan is to be a fully industrialised country by the year 2020. The government has set an average annual growth target for the next 27 years of 7 per cent. Achieving these targets is likely to become progressively tougher. The fundamentals of the economy are still sound. The main achievement of 1992 was on the balance of payments front. At the end of 1991 the finance ministry had predicted a 1992 merchandise trade deficit of MDollars 3.7bn. In the event the merchandise account recorded a surplus of MDollars 7.3bn last year, compared with a deficit of MDollars 461m in 1991. A sharp fall in imports rather than export growth was the main reason for the merchandise account improvement. The value of imports tripled in the years 1987 to 1991. In 1992 the value of imports increased by only 0.4 per cent. The deficit in the services account, mainly due to freight and insurance payments, narrowed slightly to MDollars 12bn last year, giving an overall current account deficit of MDollars 4.4bn, representing 3.1 per cent of GNP, compared with a deficit of MDollars 12.5bn or 10.1 per cent of GNP in 1991. Officials are now predicting a small current account surplus of MDollars 350m for this year, the first since 1988. The international reserves position also improved. Reserves stood at MDollars 47.2bn at the end of 1992, up from MDollars 31bn the previous year and topping the country's external debt of MDollars 41.4bn. In recent months the overriding concern of economic policy - and the factor which has been chiefly responsible for the moderation in growth rates - has been the fight against inflation. Traditionally Malaysia has had low inflation: when inflation was rising above 5 per cent at one stage last year the alarm bells started to ring. High interest rates were maintained through 1992. This lessened demand for domestic credit but caused a large inflow of funds from abroad. As a result Bank Negara was forced to mop up more than MDollars 15bn of excess liquidity from the domestic banking system. Restrictions were imposed on hire purchase and credit card use. Government spending in a number of areas was cut back. Investment projects in the private sector were curtailed. As a result there was a sharp drop in the growth of private sector spending - from 16.5 per cent in 1991 to 2.3 per cent in 1992. (Car sales in 1992 dropped by 15 per cent - compared with a growth in sales of 14 per cent the previous year.) The battle against inflation continues: Bank Negara says the overall inflation rate last year was 4.7 per cent compared with 4.4 per cent in 1991. 'The real issue for us is to build a strong foundation for our economy to make a leap towards the next phase of industrialisation,' says Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the minister of finance. 'Unless we are firm in our resolve to break the back of inflation, that foundation will be shaky and our future progress will be jeopardised.' There seems little room to dampen down domestic demand further without damaging overall growth prospects. Officials see little likelihood of bringing price rises down to under 4 per cent by the end of the year. Malaysia is vitally dependent on trade: two way merchandise trade is equal to nearly 60 per cent of GDP. For the first time in several years export earnings in 1992 failed to achieve double digit growth rates. Exports earnings for the year were MDollars 102.8bn, an increase of 8.8 per cent compared with growth of 18.6 per cent in 1991. The moderation in export growth was mainly due to the continuing problems being faced in Malaysia's main markets - Japan, the US and the EC. Malaysia's commodity export earnings also declined due to generally low world prices. Exporters were hit further by the appreciation of the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, against the major currencies. Official predictions of a better export performance this year seem to be right: in the first four months of the year exports were up 24 per cent as against 8 per cent in the previous corresponding period. Meanwhile imports rose by 9 per cent. One of the main reasons for Malaysia's economic growth over the last five years has been due to its success in attracting millions of dollars worth of investments - both from overseas, and more recently, from internal sources. According to government figures total investment approvals rose from MDollars 3.9bn in 1987 to MDollars 9bn in 1988, to MDollars 12.2 in 1989 and MDollars 28bn in 1990. In 1991 investments peaked at MDollars 30.8bn. Last year they dropped to MDollars 27.7bn. Of that figure MDollars 17.7bn was foreign sourced - an increase of 2 per cent over the foreign content in the 1991 figure  - while MDollars 10bn was domestic - representing a fall of more than 30 per cent from the previous year. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister of trade and industry, says Malaysia has already achieved more than 70 per cent of its investment target under the present five year plan (1991-95). But there is no doubting the official concern about the investment downturn. Other countries in the region, in particular China and Vietnam, are attracting investments away from Malaysia. In 1991 Taiwan was one of Malaysia's biggest investors, with investments of MDollars 3.6bn. Last year Taiwan invested less than half that amount. Foreign investment approvals in the first six months of 1992 were MDollars 7.5bn. This year the figure for the equivalent period was MDollars 1.6bn. Over the same period last year approved domestic investments were MDollars 4.1bn. This year the figure was MDollars 2.7bn. 'It is important for the government to come on more aggressively to promote domestic private investment in the absence of a strong inflow of direct foreign investment,' says the mainly privately funded Malaysian Institute of Economic Research. In a budget later this year the government might lower corporate tax from its present 34 per cent as an added incentive to investors. A key problem with attracting investments is Malaysia's contracting labour supply. The official unemployment rate is 4 per cent but in many parts of the country it is zero. Industrialists have become frustrated with a high rate of job hopping and upward pressures on wages. In some areas 70 per cent of workers on rubber and palm oil estates are foreigners - mainly from Indonesia or Bangladesh. The government is nervous about the implications of the presence of a large immigrant population - estimated at up to one million - and the possible upsetting of the country's delicate racial balance. No one is suggesting that Malaysia's economy is about to take a dive. But there are many who forecast economic turbulence ahead as the country runs into constraints on investments and labour - and braces itself for a more competitive regional environment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE ENERGY: "Nuclear </F> Safety: East Europe Persists in Reliance On Risky Nuclear Power  Plants]    [Text] As European Union concern grows over the safety of  Chernobyl, in the face of Ukrainian reluctance to close the  nuclear plant, and Western companies continue to balk at  upgrading other dangerous East European plants until civil  liability issues are resolved, the countries of the former  Eastern bloc are still resolutely embracing nuclear power.    Attempts by the West to convince them to shut their most  suspect nuclear installations are generally countered with  arguments that this is not possible until alternative sources of  energy are found. Ahead of the Council of EU Foreign Ministers  on May 16, which discussed nuclear assistance to the Ukraine,  Kiev declared it would need some ECU 6-8 billion to shut down  the Chernobyl plant -- more than double the estimate the  authorities gave a fortnight earlier. In Slovakia, by contrast,  President Michal Kovac declared on 13 May that there were  alternatives to a nuclear future for Central and Eastern Europe.  <H5>  Close Chernobyl Campaign </H5>   On 16 May, French President Francois Mitterrand added his  voice to those calling for the aid to halt Chernobyl and other  unsafe East European nuclear plants from the Group of Seven  major industrialised countries, when their leaders meet in  Naples for the Western Economic Summit in July. "These dangers  have to be countered, because tens of nuclear installations  could explode at any moment," he said. G-7 finance and strong  political will were needed to protect the whole of Europe "from  catastrophes whose consequences I dare not even imagine," Mr.  Mitterand said.    May 16 also saw the creation by Belgian scientific and  medical experts, including former International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) President Rene Constant, of a Committee for the  Closure of Chernobyl. The Committee insists it is "not  anti-nuclear." It wants to see the setting up of a European  Foundation which will coordinate scientific and technical  assistance for decontaminating the Chernobyl region. Eight  years after the Chernobyl disaster, underground water  contamination from 600 provisional nuclear waste storage sites,  the departure of Russian doctors and the fragility of the  Ukrainian health system are preventing victims of radiation from  receiving proper treatment.  <H5>  East European Nuclear Plans </H5>   Meanwhile, Bulgaria's National Electricity Company has  announced it is to invest a further ECU 200 million to modernise  the accident-prone Soviet-style Kozloduy nuclear plant. MEPs  have on various occasions voiced fears that the plant can never  be brought up to EU safety standards. In Slovakia, the  government is envisaging a prolongation of the life of two more  Soviet-style VVER 440s at Jaslovske Bohunice until the year 2005.    Next year, Romania expects to commission its first nuclear  reactor at Cernavoda, on the banks of the Danube and less than  1,000 km from Chernobyl. With EU and international pressure on  the Ukraine to close the latter for good and doubts about  Kozloduy persisting, the Romanian Government has made no secret  of its desire eventually to export its nuclear power to  neighbouring countries. The Cernavoda plant, began under the  Ceausescu regime in 1981, will cost some ECU 600 million and  supply 10 percent of Romania's electricity. Since 1991, an  Italian-Canadian consortium brought into the project has spent a  third of its time simply checking the work completed previously.  The IAEA is keeping a close eye on the proceedings.  <H5>  Austrian Anxieties </H5>   In the firing line of any future nuclear disaster,  prospective EU member Austria is, along with Germany,  spearheading calls for the definite closure of existing nuclear  plants in neighbouring Central and East European countries and a  halt to construction already underway there. Vienna will thus  take some comfort from the declaration on 13 May by Slovak  President Michal Kovac, who said his long-term aim was a Central  Europe without nuclear power plants.    "Nuclear energy is not the only alternative" for producing  electricity, Mr. Kovac said. The Slovak President's comments  came on the eve of a visit to Vienna. He confirmed that the  controversial Slovak plant at Bohunice, some 40 kms from the  Austrian border, "will be closed down in 2002." However,  contrary to Austrian wishes, the more modern Mochovce  installation currently under construction to the East of  Austria, will still be brought on stream, Mr. Kovac said.</p>

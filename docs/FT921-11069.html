			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Akzo to hold its dividend AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, is to hold its 1991 dividend at Fl 6.50 (Dollars 3.60) despite a substantial increase in provisions to cover reorganisation plans, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The company's 1991 accounts will include extraordinary charges of Fl 370m resulting from the costs of the reorganisation and unspecified environmental measures. These will be partly offset by extraordinary gains of Fl 200m from divestments and tax credits. 'After taxes, the 1991 extraordinary items total is expected to reduce income by about Fl 110m,' Akzo said.</p>

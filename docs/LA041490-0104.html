			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES DROP IN MONTH AS COLD WEATHER EASES  </P> <P> Wholesale prices fell 0.2% in March as energy and food costs descended from  cold-weather high levels, the Labor Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> The 2.4% decline in energy prices last month helped compensate for the huge  13.6% surge in this category in January spurred by shortages in home heating  oil. The 0.6% drop in food prices also reflected the onset of warmer weather.  </P> <P> The declines "are basically an expected offset to big increases earlier, and  the core rate without food and energy is basically unchanged over the past five  years," said David Wyss, an economic analyst at Data Resources Inc. of  Lexington, Mass.  </P> <P> Experts said the March levels show inflation continuing at a moderate rate as  the economy continues to grow and avoid recession.  </P> <P> Excluding food and energy, inflation for finished goods was 0.3% -- solidly  within the 3.5% to 4% annual rate that has prevailed for the past few years.  </P> <P> "It's a boring report, but if you're a businessman, a little boredom sometimes  is a blessing," said Wyss. "To live in interesting times is not, in the old  saying, a blessing. It's a curse."  </P> <P> The March dip in energy prices, combined with February's even bigger 5% drop,  still did not fully counterbalance January's leap, which was the greatest in 15  years.  </P> <P> "We'll get lower energy prices for a couple more months because crude oil  prices are still falling," said Donald Ratajczak, head of the economic  forecasting project at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "But we'll never  get all of the way back down the mountain we climbed in January because  underlying inflation is still going up. There's no sign it's accelerating --  but there's no sign it's going to decline toward zero, either."  </P> <P> Analysts saw a hint of good news in one particular increase -- a 2% spurt in  crude industrial materials.  </P> <P> Prices in this category had dropped 6.4% during the 12 months, reflecting  sluggish manufacturing activity. The March uptick "seems to be an indication  industrial activity is picking up, adding inflation at that level," Ratajczak  said. "We'll have to keep an eye on that."  </P> <P> Also supporting that impression was a 0.4% increase in finished industrial  equipment. "That suggests the economy is alive and well," said Allen Sinai,  chief economist of Boston Co. "The capital goods prices mean increased capital  investment has been happening, and capital spending plans for the future look  solid. So that's another solid sign of a growing economy, despite all the  anecdotal evidence you hear of softness."  </P> <P> Sinai noted that the continuation of moderate inflation at the wholesale level  does not mean that retail inflation will remain moderate. The consumer price  index, which measures those prices, includes services while the producer price  index considers the prices of wholesale goods only. Service industries have  experienced some of the most entrenched inflation.  </P> <P> Before seasonal adjustment, the producer price index fell by 0.4 point, or  0.3%, to 117 in March on a base of 100 calculated for wholesale prices in 1982.  That means a hypothetical market basket of goods that cost $100 eight years ago  would have cost $117 last month and $117.40 in February.  </P></p>

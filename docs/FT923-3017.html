			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Fewer firms do more audits THE AUDIT of quoted com-panies is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few accountancy firms, according to an academic study published yesterday. The top eight firms audited 79 per cent of the market last year, compared with 64 per cent in 1987, according to an analysis by Ms Vivien Beattie and Ms Stella Fearnley of the University of Southampton. The top four firms alone audited 59 per cent of quoted companies last year, compared with 43 per cent in 1987. The top 20 firms audited 90 per cent of the market last year. The study was based on 2,079 companies quoted on the Stock Exchange main market or unlisted securities market over the past four years. More than 100 firms have just one listed company as their sole audit client, and 39 firms - or 18 per cent of the total - have dropped out of the listed client audit market in the period. Just over 16 per cent of companies voluntarily changed their auditors during the period, most changing only once. Those who switched moved to a larger audit firm. The study shows that the rate of change of auditors slowed last year to 3.8 per cent of companies, compared with 5.2 per cent in 1990 and 6.1 per cent in 1988.</p>

			<p>Stand   on Nuclear Program, Kashmir Praised   <F P=102> 94AS0298D Peshawar MASHRIQ in Urdu 12 May 94 p 6 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0298D </F> <F P=104>  Peshawar MASHRIQ </F> <F P=105>  Urdu </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Principled Stand on Kashmir and </F> Nuclear Program"]    [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said that terrorism in  occupied Kashmir must be stopped in order to create an  atmosphere conducive to talks with India. In her interview given  to the German weekly FOCUS, she clarified once again the fact  that our nuclear program is for peaceful purpose and that  Pakistan was willing to discuss some kind of agreement on this  issue with India. However, it is not willing to accept this  responsibility unilaterally. The prime minister said that we  will not accept any conditions that are imposed on Pakistan  only. In response to a question about economy, she said that her  government was successful in reducing the trade deficit by $260  million, increasing foreign investment by $540 million, and  increasing foreign exchange reserves from $200 million to $1.2  billion. In response to another question, she said that the  countries in South Asia will have to show discernment in order  to establish lasting peace in the region. The first attention  must be given to the lingering problems faced by the Kashmiri  people. Pakistan, she said, was very serious about resolving the  Kashmir issue and wanted the Kashmiri people to have the right  to self-determination given to them by the UN resolutions so  that they can make decision about their future.    Countries in this region have to do their duty in order to  establish lasting peace in South Asia. Refusal to resolve the  Kashmir issue peacefully and the race to stockpile weapons have  forced South Asia into a war-like situation. The Indian  leadership is responsible for the present situation. During the  last three years, more than 20,000 Muslims have been killed in  occupied Kashmir and an equal number have been wounded. The  Indian troops sent to crush the freedom struggle in the Valley  have gang raped women, burned places of worship and personal  property, and have set new records for making people invalids by  torture. The United Nations, international human rights  organizations, Europeans nations, and other international  agencies have done nothing except making verbal statements about  this situation. The people of Kashmir are trying to keep this  struggle alive by giving their blood. Pakistan has never refused  to discuss the Kashmir issue and has played an important role in  all such efforts. Opposed to it, the Indian leadership cannot  free itself of obstinacy and its emotional stand about Kashmir  being its integral part. Pakistan still insists that India and  Pakistan should hold talks for a peaceful resolution of Kashmir.  However, it is important that India stop the atrocities it is  committing in occupied Kashmir immediately, lift its siege  outside places of worship, and set free the thousands of freedom  fighters now in its jails and special torture cells. Pakistan's  position on Kashmir and the nuclear program is clear to the  countries within the United Nations. It is important for  establishing peace in South Asia to seriously attend to the  burning questions there.    Referring to Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program, the prime  minister represented our national position to the German weekly  in her interview. This has been expressed in Pakistan for a long  time. Pakistan's nuclear program is purely for energy  production. India, on the contrary, has not only blasted an  atomic bomb in the seventies but its Tarapur nuclear plant has  attained the capability of making atomic bombs. India's  expertise in ballistic missiles is far ahead of Pakistan's.    In the present situation where India has the capability to  make atomic bombs, imposing restrictions on Pakistan over  nuclear program is blatant injustice. The major powers and  international organizations should review their approach.  Pakistan supports the idea of making South Asia a nuclear free  zone. It has not refused signing the NPT [Nonproliferation  Treaty] or any other direct agreement. However the question is:  Why should Pakistan alone do all this? Why do not the United  Nations and other international organizations convince India to  give up its nuclear program, sign the NPT, and have a direct  agreement? Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has represented  Pakistan's national stand on Kashmir and the nuclear program.  The question of moving from this position just does not arise.  If the United Nations is serious about establishing peace in  South Asia and making it a nuclear free zone, then it should put  pressure on India not only to stop atrocities on Kashmiris but  also to let them decide on their future and sign the NPT. The  whole situation will remain the same until India agrees to these  points.</p>

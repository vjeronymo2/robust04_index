			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Investors flounder as sterling floats: How far the pound might fall FOR MANY backbench Conservatives, the government's decision to float the pound on the foreign exchanges was the best thing that could have happened to Britain's economic policy. For corporate treasurers and currency investors, though, a free-floating pound has made life much more difficult. For the past two years, they have assumed that the pound could go no lower than DM2.7780, its lower limit against the D-Mark in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. But yesterday it reached a historic low of DM2.4260. While the currency fell sharply on the foreign exchanges, investors were at a loss to know when sterling would bottom out. On a trade-weighted basis, the pound is undervalued against the D-Mark, with a fair value being seen by some analyists at between DM2.50 and DM2.60. However, Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London, said: 'You can ignore such measures altogether. It is no guide to where the currency will go right now.' Instead, the pound is being undermined by uncertainty over the government's economic policy and the continuing political difficulties over its European policy. In the next few days, sterling's moves will be dictated by whether there is another cut in UK base rates. There is widespread speculation that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will announce another rate cut next week to boost the government's lagging fortunes at its annual party conference. A cut in rates, currently at 9 per cent, would give investors a lower return on the pound and push its value down further. But Mr Austin said that yesterday's 'disturbing' fall made another cut unlikely. Beyond the party conference, choosing a bottom for sterling is a more hazardous business. Mr David Shaw, bonds director at Legal and General Investments, has worked out several scenarios for sterling over the next few months. The most likely, he says, is that there will be a 'managed float' of the currency. That would involve a formal statement that the UK has left the ERM, with the government anchoring the currency to a new exchange rate regime or a mixture of monetary indicators. Sterling would, in his view, fall to DM2.35 or Dollars 1.50. The second most likely scenario, according to Mr Shaw, is that the government will issue a formal statement that the UK will re-enter the ERM when the time is right. That might accompany the cut in German short-term rates as Germany slides into recession. The pound would re-enter the ERM at a central parity of DM2.40 and at a value of Dollars 1.60 to the US dollar. The most bearish outlook for the currency, however, would be a continuation of uncertainty or a government policy of 'benign neglect' towards sterling, similar to the one that has predominated in the US this year. It would be accompanied by more cuts in interest rates in an attempt to 'go for growth'. A leading London-based investment manager who specialises in currency management said that a policy of benign neglect could push sterling down to DM2.20. Mr Shaw believes the currency could bottom out as low as DM2.00. At such levels, the pound would be clearly undervalued and a rebound would certainly ensue.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> NEW ORDINANCE AIMED AT CURBING PROSTITUTION  </P> <P> As part of a continuing effort to combat prostitution, Santa Ana police tonight  will begin enforcing a new city ordinance barring motorists from stopping along  Harbor Boulevard.  </P> <P> "No Stopping" signs have been posted on Harbor Boulevard from Westminster  Avenue on the city's north end to Warner Avenue in the south, an area that  police say has the heaviest prostitution traffic.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the City Council approved an ordinance prohibiting drivers  from stopping along Harbor Boulevard between 4 p.m. and 9 a.m.  </P> <P> Drivers who stop in the prohibited area will be given one oral warning, which  will be documented, before an arrest is made, police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas  said.  </P> <P> Thomas said police also plan to arrest anyone encouraging drivers to stop.  Those who do so create a public nuisance, Thomas said.  </P></p>

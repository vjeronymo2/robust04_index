			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: PacTel considers sale of 8 UK cable franchises PACIFIC Telesis, one of the regional telecommunications companies which resulted from the break-up of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, said yesterday it was considering selling its eight cable franchises in the UK. PacTel claimed to be entertaining the move so that it could 'focus solely on its wireless telecommunications business'. 'We still find the UK cable TV market attractive,' commented Mr Lee Cox, PacTel's chief executive, 'but we want to concentrate our efforts on winning more valuable cellular and paging licences abroad.' The company, based in Walnut Creek, California, is currently pursuing cellular licences in a range of countries - from Japan and Hong Kong to Greece and Spain in continental Europe. Its parent, Pacific Telesis Group is also studying proposals which could involve spinning off the Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell phone operations, but yesterday's announcement was said to be independent of this. PacTel suggested that it was flexible about how it restructured the UK cable franchises - with options under consideration ranging from an outright sale, to some form of joint venture deal. Officials said that preliminary talks with potential purchasers or partners had already taken place. PacTel built up its UK cable TV franchises in the late 1980s. Of the eight to be 'restructured', four are operational - in the Peterborough, Bolton, Derby and Norwich areas - with around 10,000 subscribers. The other licences are in Manchester, Doncaster and several smaller cities. In total, the company is licensed to serve about 1m homes. It recently sold its east London cable properties to BCE Telecom International, for an undisclosed amount.</p>

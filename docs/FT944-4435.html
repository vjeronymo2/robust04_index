			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Base rate basics The midwife of yesterday's rise in UK interest rates was a political crisis. But the increase was due anyway. The economy is growing at an unsustainable rate of over 4 per cent a year. Even if inflation is at a 27-year low, fears about inflationary pressures remain justified because the gap between output and capacity is narrowing so fast. A rate rise was needed. By unexpectedly announcing it yesterday, the government could shift the political blame to its rebellious backbenchers. For all the drama caused by a humiliating parliamentary defeat and the surprise rate rise, the markets ended the day surprisingly undamaged. Given the sudden increase in political risk, it remains unclear whether corporate earnings growth can underpin the equity market. Certainly, most of the improvements will have to come from corporate rationalisation and exports rather than consumer demand. The rate increase will eventually feed through to mortgages, undermining the housing market still further. That will affect already weak high street spending; Christmas and New Year are likely to be unseasonably bleak for retailers. Moreover, the UK markets' main focus in the coming weeks will be the US, not Westminster. US equity markets are doubly troubled. Yesterday's hints by Mr Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, that rates may have to rise again do little for sentiment. Meanwhile, the difficulties in Orange County and at Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund are raising fears that other big investors may be having troubles. Hopes of a year-end rally could be dashed.</p>

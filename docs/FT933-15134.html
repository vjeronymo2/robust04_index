			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Unionists may save Tories from Maastricht upset SENIOR Conservatives believe Northern Ireland's unionist MPs will help the government avoid an embarrassing upset when the Commons votes on Maastricht's social chapter later this month. Party strategists are increasingly confident that Mr John Major's recent remark that he was 'four-square' behind Ulster's union with the UK, and this week's row between British and Irish ministers over the province's future, have improved relations between the Tories and Unionist MPs. Although Conservative Maastricht rebels have yet to decide tactics, the votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs could be critical. The Maastricht bill returns to the House of Lords next week when Baroness (formerly Mrs Margaret) Thatcher is expected to launch another attack on the policies of her successor as prime minister. There is anxiety about the debates on the social chapter which have to be held by in the Lords and Commons before ratification, following a concession by the government earlier this year. In theory, the government could ratify the Maastricht treaty without the social chapter even if it lost the vote. But some Tory Euro-sceptics may still decide to vote for the social chapter in the hope of embarrasing the government and improving the chances of a legal challenge to ratification. Labour has drawn up an amendment for debate in the Commons deliberately designed to force Mr Major to choose between accepting the social chapter or not signing the Maastricht treaty. Unionist MPs have helped the government avert Commons defeats before, including on plans for pit closures.</p>

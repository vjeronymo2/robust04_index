The form takes approximately 6 hours to complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form N&hyph;23C&hyph;1 is a form on which closed-end investment companies report repurchases of their own securities. The form requires about one hour to fill out on each occasion, up to twelve times per year, on the part of approximately 4 companies that undertake such repurchase transactions each year. Total annual burden hours are estimate to be 23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 6e&hyph;2 grants investment companies offering scheduled premium and single premium variable life insurance contracts exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940. Only management accounts that register to sell contracts under Rule 6e&hyph;2 have a reporting burden, estimated to be approximately 111 annual hours per respondent, imposed under paragraph (b)(9) of the rule. Since 1988, there have been no filings under paragraph (b)(9) of rule 6e&hyph;2 by existing management accounts, and separate accounts now are being organized as trust accounts, which are not subject to the reporting requirements, rather than as management accounts. Without the rule, management companies that offer variable insurance contracts and their sponsoring life insurers would have to file individual exemptive applications in addition to a registration statement in order to obtain the relief needed to sell the contracts. This process would be burdensome on both the life insurer and the Commission's staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 17a&hyph;8 exempts certain mergers or consolidations involving investment companies from the restrictions on transactions between affiliates set forth in Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The rule annually requires approximately 1.5 hours of recordkeeping by each of approximately 17 companies estimated to be involved in such a merger or consolidation each year, for a total of 26 annual burden hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 17f&hyph;1 requires that a custodial contract and an accountant's certificate be filed with the Commission in connection with the placement or maintenance of the assets of a registered management investment company in the custody of a member of a national securities exchange. The rule requires each respondent to spend about 4 hours meeting reporting requirements annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Budget, (Paperwork Reduction Act No. 3235&hyph;0157, 3235&hyph;0230, 3235&hyph;0177, 3235&hyph;0235, and 3235&hyph;0222), room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

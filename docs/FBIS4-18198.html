			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed AZ: "Federal Counselor Cotti's Visit to </F> Athens -- No Official Guarantee on the Opening of Swiss-EU  Negotiations"]    [Excerpts] Athens, 30 Mar (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Flavio  Cotti did not get any official guarantee today about the opening  of bilateral negotiations between Switzerland and the European  Union (EU). During his one-day visit to the Greek capital, the  head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE)  explained to his hosts Switzerland's position regarding European  integration.    At a press conference, the head of the DFAE underlined the  "friendly" atmosphere in which the talks with his Greek  counterpart, Karolos Papoulias, took place. Mr. Cotti also met  with the Greek European Minister Theodoros Pangalos. Regional  issues were also raised, namely, the situation in former  Yugoslavia, Greek-Turkish relations, and the partition of Cyprus.    "Switzerland would be pleased if bilateral negotiations with  the EU began during the Greek presidency," which will come to an  end in June, according to Mr. Cotti. The head of the DFAE  stated that, if those negotiations began "quickly enough," this  would "create excellent psychological conditions in  Switzerland." The long-term "strategic goal" of Switzerland is  indeed a "full and complete" membership in the European Union,  the federal counselor added.  <H5>  No Official Guarantee </H5>   Questioned by ATS, Greek Minister Theodoros Pangalos  remained  reserved about the opening of bilateral negotiations between  Switzerland and the EU during Greece's EU Presidency.  Nevertheless, Mr. Pangalos said it was likely that those  negotiations would begin before the end of the year. [passage  omitted]    Mr. Papoulias for his part said that Mr. Cotti's visit, the  first by the head of the Swiss diplomatic corps since 1976,  testified to the "political will" of both countries to develop  and strengthen bilateral relations. He "thanked" Switzerland  for its contribution to the financing of the UN peacekeeping  forces in Cyprus.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Safety inspectors warn over rail services on strike days Safety on the railways on strike days was called into question yesterday with warnings from the Health and Safety Executive reminding operators of their responsibilities to the public as the network faced its 18th day of disruption. The warnings, from the executive's railway inspectorate, came as the Confederation of British Industry called for a law to compel unions to hold 'refresher' ballots of strikers in long-running disputes. Two written and several oral warnings have been issued to Railtrack, which runs the network's infrastructure, and other operators, it was disclosed. The warnings are the first indication of concern in the inspectorate about safety standards on strike days, when supervisory staff have been operating signal boxes. They are the first stage of a formal procedure that could lead to an order for closure of parts of the network. The executive's concern was made known as Railtrack was expected today to complete its inquiry into last week's derailment at Bickley in Kent. The inspectorate said it had looked into about 100 allegations of unsafe working practices since the strikes started. An official described the warnings as a 'shot across the bows' of operators. It found that 'the general level of safety' was being maintained on strike days. Railtrack denied that safety standards were being compromised. 'We would not have people in signal boxes if they were not 100 per cent competent to operate them safely,' it said. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, said last night the inspectorate's warnings confirmed his union's fears. 'This explodes the claim made by Railtrack that the system has operated safely on strike days,' he said. The RMT is seeking a meeting with the inspectorate this week to discuss the issue. Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers' union, said he had expressed his concern about the 'constant stress' his members were suffering during the dispute when he met Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, on Monday. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, who made the call for new laws, said it was reasonable to ask whether a 'yes' vote in a ballot should be interpreted as giving a union a right to call strikes indefinitely. 'I wonder whether all those signallers who voted 'yes' did so on the assumption they might still be in dispute three months later with no negotiation in sight,' he said. However, he rejected the suggestion that legislation should be introduced to outlaw strikes in essential services. He also rejected the imposition of binding arbitration, which he called a 'two-edged sword' that would deny management the right to manage. Railtrack lifts strike capacity, Page 7</p>

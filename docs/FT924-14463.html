			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank keeps analysts on their toes THERE are times when watching the German central bank 'makes the ancient art of Kremlinology look like child's play', according to Ms Alison Cottrell, of Midland Montagu, in her latest commentary on the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank's money market activities have been particularly perplexing in the last chaotic month, with the bank attempting to steer rates against a background of large inflows of cash in the wake of intervention in the currency markets. One unequivocal fact is that the Bundesbank has steered rates down by 0.8 per cent in the last month, to below 9 per cent - a reduction which is far more substantial than the 25 basis point fall in the headline Lombard rate announced in the middle of last month. As Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said after last week's council meeting in Schwerin, money market rates are a more important indicator of policy than the Lombard rate. At the same time, he announced that the bank would be introducing a two-week securities repurchase agreement (repo) tender, giving it more scope to fine-tune money market rates. Throughout September, the market picked up mixed signals as the central bank pursued a number of objectives all at once. Mr Richard Reid, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says that the monetary authorities were attempting to reduce tensions in the ERM, neutralise the effects of intervention on domestic money supply and keep up the battle against inflation - all at the same time. The Bundesbank reacted to the excess liquidity - DM92bn of funds flowed into Germany in September - with a variety of measures, indicating the Bundesbank's determination to sterilise the impact of intervention on money supply development. It issued three or two-day bills and currency swaps, and it cancelled two consecutive repo auctions, last week and the week before. The picture was confused on Wednesday and Friday last week, when the Bundesbank pumped funds back into the market under its so-called Paragraph 17 provisions. It was thus injecting liquidity within days of taking it out of the market - 'providing a heap of chickens' entrails for analysts,' says Ms Cottrell. Mr Schlesinger's comments on Friday cleared the air somewhat: he said that the aim was to keep rates down to below 9 per cent for the time being, and that he was happy with the orientation of monetary policy. The money market rate was where it should be: midway between the Lombard rate at 9.5 per cent and the Discount rate at 8.25 per cent. The important question is whether the fall in money market rates presages further, more substantial cuts in the internationally sensitive Lombard rate. This would be an indication that German interest rates were on the way down, after the grudging  1/4 point cut under political pressure last month. Analysts say that with interest rates as they are, the Lombard rate could be cut by 0.25 per cent. But Mr Thomas Mayer, of Goldman Sachs, says that it is extremely unlikely the Lombard rate will be lowered at all this year - unless there is another currency crisis. By leaving the large gap between call money and the Lombard rate, the Bundesbank is indicating that its next move could be to steer money rates up, just as well as down. As Mr Johann Gaddum, member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, indicated yesterday, the bank had no intention of relaxing its battle against inflation in Germany. It is unlikely to find excuses for a cut in interest rates in money supply growth for September. Bloated by intervention, growth is likely to be around 10 per cent, compared to a target of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.</p>

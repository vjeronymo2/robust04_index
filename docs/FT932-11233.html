			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Calculators come out after Man United League win WHILE FANS of Manchester United Football Club reached for their handkerchiefs to wipe away tears of joy at winning the Premier League championship, City commentators were reaching for their calculators. The title secures a place in the European Champions Cup and that means extra profits for Manchester United plc in 1993-94. Yesterday the shares closed at a new high of 463p, about 180p up on the start of the football season last August. Not that it is easy to settle on a new profits forecast. The tournament could add anything between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 5m or more, depending on the team's progress and TV income. Mr David Murray, chairman of Glasgow Rangers, says his club earned Pounds 4m net of costs from playing in the European Cup this season. Volatility of cup income joins the other great variable, spending on players, in making forecasting particularly difficult. This year analysts have pencilled in Pounds 5.3m pre-tax for United, assuming Pounds 2m net spending on players. Ironically, the Premier League win will slightly reduce expected 1992-93 profits. Although it brings Pounds 858,000 in prize money as part of the League's broadcasting deal with BSkyB, players' bonuses will take a chunk of that. The benefits of playing in the Champions Cup flow through in the next financial year. According to Mr Robin Launders, United's finance director, the potential profit score sheet totals about Pounds 4.3m and reads like this: Each of the first and second rounds could earn Pounds 500,000 profit. The mini-league stage guarantees six games and could bring in Pounds 900,000 profit on home gates (regarded as a conservative estimate) and an average of Pounds 1.3m from UEFA, the sport's governing body. If United wins through to a semi-final, he estimates that another Pounds 420,000 would come via the points system, plus about Pounds 700,000 from gate and television fees. The final - at a neutral venue - would add little extra because of large bills in terms of team bonuses and travel expenses. Apart from the large gap between top and bottom profit estimates, there is one other caveat. United's need to buy players may be increased by UEFA's restrictions on fielding 'foreign' players. Eight of United's regular first-team players are Welsh, Scottish, Irish, Danish, French or Russian.</p>

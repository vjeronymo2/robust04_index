			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vasil Bykov by G. Kovalskaya; place and date </F> not given: "Our Times Call for Shushkevich"]    [Text] Exclusive interview with a classical writer of  Belarusian literature dealing with the independence of Belarus,  chances of the People's Front and the resignation of Shushkevich.    There is no need to identify Vasil Bykov for the readers.  The  great Belarus author was known both in the former USSR as well  as throughout the world. Not everyone, however, knows something  else: many of the books by this author first saw the light of  day in the Russian language (even though Bykov thinks and writes  in Belarusian) simply because they could not be published in the  author's homeland. Even during Soviet times ideological dictates  and censorship that existed in Belarus were more rigid than in  other republics.    It is too early to speak of freedom of creativity there at  present as well. The trial of writer Svetlana Aleksiyevich, who  published a book titled "The Zinc Boys" about the Afghanistan  war, for instance, a trial which is of a distinctly political  character, is still under way in Minsk.    Despite that, Vasil Bykov, an artist who has been striving  for freedom all of his life, is not thinking of abandoning his  native land by contrast with many of his colleagues, who, by the  way, are not condemned by him but whose departure he regrets  deeply. What does the author like and dislike in the Belarus of  today? What are his political preferences? How does he visualize  the Belarusian path into the world?    Our observer Galina Kovalskaya spoke with Vasil Bykov.    [Kovalskaya] Why is the issue concerning national  independence of the republic of Belarus again one of the most  hotly disputed ones? It would appear that it is an issue  resolved a long time ago: first in September 1991, when the  Supreme Council of the republic proclaimed independence, then at  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, when three of the former Soviet republics  reiterated the disintegration of the USSR with their agreement.    [Bykov] State sovereignty is an unambiguous term that does  not lend itself to any kind of reinterpretation. Either it  exists or it does not. In my opinion state independence benefits  the people because, as indicated by historical experience, the  welfare of the people is directly associated with the existence  of their own state. Naturally, we are not speaking of any  isolation from the outside world, but merely about political and  national independence.    Independence came to Belarus somewhat unexpectedly. All of  its preceding history, it would appear, prodded us in the  opposite direction, toward full integration, first with the  Polish state, then with the Russian empire. When it became  necessary to ensure independence politically, economically, and  culturally it turned out that our society and its ruling class  were not prepared to do that.    The principal difficulty consisted of the fact that  communists dominated all of our power structures, at all levels.  I know that in some places in Transcaucasia and in Central Asia  communists attempted to somehow adapt to the national movement  or even to head it. In our case the communists unequivocally  favor the empire and continue to be the main anti-populist force.    Barely recovering from the August 1991 putsch and  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, the "party in power" initiated a  struggle, first for the total rehabilitation and restoration of  the power of the Communist Party, and then for the restoration  of the empire. It has now become particularly animated as the  imperial forces raise their voices in Russia.    [Kovalskaya] Are you against the entry of Belarus in the  ruble zone?    [Bykov] Our directorial corps is strongly in favor of that,  stating that it promises all kinds of economic advantages. In  reality our directors know how to work only under conditions of  a command and specifically an all-union economy because of which  for them a return to a unified economic system is undoubtedly  beneficial. I, however, believe that this would be another step  toward the liquidation of Belarus independence.    Among Russian economists there is also not a single one with  an opinion on that. It seems that Chernomyrdin, and possibly the  president of Russia, are prepared to incur some economic losses,  including an increase in the inflation rate, for the sake of  political goals--retention of Belarus within the Russian sphere  of influence.    [Kovalskaya] What political forces in Belarus do you feel  closest to? Who will you vote for in the elections?    [Bykov] We have a plethora of parties. In reality, however,  the entire political spectrum in our case is black-and-white or,  if you will, red-and-white. On one side there are the communist,  imperial, and anti-national forces, while on the other side  there are national forces. The Belarusian People's Front has  real influence among those who are defending the ideals of  national and state independence. Unfortunately it is represented  poorly in the leadership of the country--its faction in the  Supreme Council is very small, while in the executive power  branch it has no followers at all.    The other parties--the Christian-Democratic Party, the  Social-Democratic Party, and the Peasant Party are quite small  and not influential. Even though they too proclaim themselves as  proponents of Belarusian independence.    I am, of course, on the side of forces of independence. As  far as the elections are concerned, I must confess that I do not  believe not only in the possibility of early elections, but even  in the presumption that our Supreme Council will go along with  elections at the time stipulated by law. Our "party in power" is  intently watching changes taking place in Russia and is becoming  increasingly convinced that for it there is no need to hurry  with any changes since there is a chance that everything will go  back to the way it was. If the elections are held, however, I  will certainly vote for the People's Front.    [Kovalskaya] How about in the presidential election?    [Bykov] For Poznyak, if he will be on the ballot.    [Kovalskaya] But after all Poznyak is not fair and even  insulting in his anti-Russian utterances. Inasmuch as I was able  to notice, many in the People's Front leadership not only do not  share those views but are even embarrassed by them.    [Bykov] It was specifically Poznyak who created the People's  Front and prevented its split. Yes, many of his positions are  simply shocking. But at the same time it is hard to argue with  him: he has experience, both of historical and simply human  kind. He wrote his well-known article on Russian imperial  consciousness and imperial policy before the New Year. Only a  short period of time passed and it turned out to be downright  prophetic: some statements were made by Kozyrev regarding "the  sphere of vital Russian in the near abroad," and he asserted  that troops should not be withdrawn from there--all of which  disturbed both us and the West.    Aggressive nationalism in the republics is whipped up by  such  imperial reasoning and is sometimes engendered by it. That is  understood by many but most try not to talk about it. Poznyak,  however, is not such a person. Even before the disintegration of  the USSR, when the CPSU Central Committee managed everything, he  forcefully took some television air time with his comrades and  reaching all of Belarus stated that the Communist Party is a  criminal organization. He was not silent when all others were.  That is the kind of man he is.    Certainly he is a radical, but in contemporary life there is  no room for a centrist position: all politicians gravitate  either toward one, the communist, or the other, national, fringe.    [Kovalskaya] What about Shushkevich?    [Bykov] Shushkevich is a tragic figure. It was specifically  his attempts to be "a centrist" that played a bad joke on him  and led to political failure. He is an honest, clever, and an  intelligent individual, dedicated to democratic ideals, but  apparently, not for our times. Our times call for Poznyak.    [Kovalskaya] Why did the Belarusian People's Front never  become for Belarusia what Sajudis was for Lithuania, Rukh for  Ukraine, and Democratic Russia for Russia, failing to become a  mass-scale popular movement?    [Bykov] National self-consciousness is insufficiently  developed and political culture is lacking. Particularly in view  of the fact that as living standards deteriorate at present, the  myth that supposedly "under the communists things were better"  is gaining strength.    In my opinion another myth, which is gaining currency in  Russia as well, is that people are purportedly too politicized  and all they do is attend meetings. It would be better if things  were like they are in the developed countries where no one cares  about the government at all. All this is fabricated by the  authorities for the purpose of self-preservation. In actuality  the population in its absolute majority has no idea at all about  democratic values, it is not accepting the idea of democracy,  and does not comprehend the basics of a market society.    [Kovalskaya] What do you think is the solution?    [Bykov] It is quite evident: the economic system must be  changed. But that is impossible without a radical political  reform and especially without a consolidation of national  statehood. We have already fully partaken of the pleasures of a  totalitarian empire. In addition to that there is also the  European experience of national state building.    Even closer there is the experience of our neighbors. Yes,  nothing is so far working out in Ukraine--the power there,  however, remains in the hands of the same communists. While in  the Baltic states the reform is proceeding with difficulty but  successfully even though there are more objective difficulties  over there than there are in our case: there is also the lack of  local energy resources, and in general they are poorer with  regard to resources than we are. They also lack the advantages  of our geographical position. In addition to that there is the  nationality factor which, fortunately, will not appear in our  case unless someone makes a special effort to that end.    [Kovalskaya] That is not exactly what I mean--it is  understood where we should be moving. I asked how you would  prefer to get out of the current dead-end situation, taking into  account that you have your Belarusian and not a Lithuanian  population, and neither Yeltsin nor Gaidar are at the top, but  your own leadership.    [Bykov] With our leadership we will not be moving anywhere.  With it the only possibility is to turn back. Even if we do go  back we shall find not the communist past, but ruins.    What can be done, you ask? It is necessary to struggle, of  course, conduct political education. We can be saved only by a  popular movement.    Do you remember the late Alex Adamovich once stating that  Belarus is the Vendee of reconstruction? Recently he further  added that we are changing into a peculiar kind of a communist  Paraguay: all the communists unsuited to the new life are coming  to us from everywhere. In our country they are living not just  on their personal pension but are working very actively.    Democracy is inevitable. But the price it may be necessary  for Belarusia to pay for it could be very high. The fact that it  will be higher than in the Baltic states is without doubt. I do  not know if it will be higher than in Russia. I fear that Russia  is yet to pay its price and it is not known what it will amount  to.    [Kovalskaya] Whom do you favor most from among the Russian  politicians?    [Bykov] After all, we are selecting from what exists. Of  course, Gaidar's group, those linked with reform and democracy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian </F> Federation Presidential Staff, by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Chief Editor  Valeriy Kucher; date and place not given: "Strength in  Government Lies in the Ability to Find Compromise"]    [Text] [Kucher] Sergey Aleksandrovich, a broad exchange  of opinions about cadre reshuffles in the higher echelons of  power, which is entirely permissible in an open, civil society,  is sometimes turned into a secret source of information and even  a lever of influence on those processes. At various intervals,  but on the basis of one pattern, we find out about the possible  official prospects of certain individuals. The authorities  sometimes call these reports rumors or provocations, or use the  more refined word "leaks." Perhaps none of the current  high-ranking officials is bypassed, but there is no point in  talking about politicians who have retired. Are leaks of  information a necessary instrument for presidential power? What  is your attitude to this?    [Filatov] You have broached an important question. Because  the spread of rumors about cadre changes in the top sphere of  power is now virtually being turned into a system. I would even  say that leaks of information have become an instrument of  political power. I would stress: a weapon in political  infighting, but by no means an attribute of presidential power.    The desire of any government to know how society will react  to proposed actions by the authorities is understandable and  explicable. A lot of civilized methods for gathering  information at the stage of the formation of a plan or any steps  exist for this purpose. And we know of examples where certain  decisions were modified as a result of such a social  verification, bided their time, or else simply never appeared.  This is quite normal. It is another matter when nothing has  happened and yet there is a "leak" of information.... I think  that this method has unfortunately started being used  extensively recently, indeed with purely opportunistic aims.    [Kucher] Sometimes this bears fruit....    [Filatov] In that case I would talk about something else,  something more important. Any phenomenon must be tested, to see  whether it is to society's benefit or to its detriment. Any  action by the authorities intensifies people's faith in them or  else, conversely, destroys trust in them. I generally believe  that you should be extremely careful in dealing with preliminary  information. As for using it to selfish political ends, that is  all the more immoral. Because when a person is schooled in this  system of "idle" intercourse, in this lifeless pattern of work  with him, then the authorities increasingly lose moral substance  in his eyes. And that is terrible, because we could obtain a  situation whereby there will be no faith in official documents.  People will inclined to identify truth with rumor and not  accept what is really happening. That is why I have a very  negative attitude to immoral methods of checking people's  reactions.    But we sometimes call routine procedures by the wrong name.  For instance, a document which is intended for official use has  to be circulated. An ordinary aspect of work is thus sometimes  set up as an enforced leak of information. Immunity is  willy-nilly built up in respect of the actual term "leak." No  wonder that the sense of rejection is weakened in a real "leak"  which plays the role of political intrigue.    There is also another side to the question. Those about  whom the rumors are being spread must also be protected. This is  not just a question of the fact that people are very vulnerable  and handle rumors about themselves very badly. Besides, I see  the authorities' ability to protect a person against lies as a  display of their moral character. Although, of course, it is  equally dangerous for society to create an imaginary aura of  infallibility and sanctity around officials.    [Kucher] Does it not seem to you that similar outlines can  been seen in almost all subjects concerning recent cadre policy?  It works out that the change of cadres comes first, and then a  belated and vague explanation of the true reasons for it. So  only one conclusion tends to suggest itself willy-nilly: It  means that some kind of bureaucratic games are going on here,  which have nothing to do with state interests. And since that  is the case, it looks as though the authorities are losing touch  with the people....    [Filatov] The first thing that I would like to stress is  that cadre policy, generally speaking, is only just beginning to  take shape. The president has created a Cadre Policy Council.  It includes representatives of all the structures which have a  direct bearing on this matter. There are three commissions, two  of which are already working. One of them is headed by Justice  Minister Yu.Kh. Kalmykov. This commission puts forward  candidacies for judges, whom the president either appoints  himself or presents to the Federation Council. The second  commission examines the possible award of military ranks and  posts. It is led by presidential aide Yu. Baturin. There is  also a third commission, which has not started working yet: Its  duties include selecting candidates for top official posts in  various Russian missions abroad -- excluding ambassadors, since  they are appointed by the president as a result of consultations  with the Federal Assembly.    In this way, the first step has been taken toward moving the  problem of appointing cadres in the top echelon of power out of  the direct influence of bureaucratic structures. And I think  that, if the process of deregulating cadre appointments and  reshuffles proceeds along a normal path, then suspicions will be  removed.    I will say frankly that a colossal shortage of cadres is to  be perceived in the country, particularly for the leading  components of the administration. After all, you can see for  yourselves that the same people are revolving in the orbit of  power all the time. It looks as though we cannot manage without  any serious or profound training of cadres capable of operating  in the new market conditions. This problem is being widely  discussed in the Kremlin right now. If we have a good reserve  and a normal system for training cadres, particularly for the  top leadership personnel, then, no doubt, the basis for the  dramatic situations which we frequently come up against will  disappear.    [Kucher] How do you explain the rather frequent change of  characters in the official political arena? A shortage of  cadres?    [Filatov] Not only that. Society's socioeconomic morale and  the results of internecine struggle among the political forces  also affect the frequency of cadre changes. That is precisely  what makes the cadre structure in the state unstable. Actually,  I believe that this is a temporary phenomenon in the current  conditions, because it is sometimes possible to reach  compromises by means of cadre reshuffles. And a compromise in  politics makes it possible to ease tension in society and leads  to a stabilization in the situation.    How it is reached is another matter. Or, more precisely, how  it is greeted in certain political circles. Not everyone has  fully understood and accepted the presidential powers in terms  of cadre policy. His opportunities are determined by the  Constitution. But some people would like to see this as an  excessive strengthening of personal power. The president does  have, for example, the right to release or appoint a government  member on the premier's submission. But he also has the right  to appoint a person by his own decision to a leading post even  if he is not a government member. It is particularly pointless  to dramatize the situation when the president releases, moves,  or dismisses someone from service, sometimes for reasons known  only to himself.    Sometimes people lose sight of the fact that, when the  people  elected the president, they voted not just for the personality  of the politician but also the statesman, who has a program  which must be implemented. That is why the key posts in the  president's entourage must be occupied by people who have the  same political orientation as him. If someone in that team is  out of step with the chosen aim, makes mistakes, gets confused,  or betrays it -- this has also happened -- then naturally the  president parts company with him. It is another matter when a  person only finds out about a decision concerning his future  from a newspaper or radio report. But here the blame is to be  laid at the door of those charged with reporting on adopted  decisions before they are announced, and that includes me.    [Kucher] Does President Boris Yeltsin need obedient  officials to carry things out or active people with a clearly  defined commitment?    [Filatov] The president forms the cadre policy of the  Russian state, proceeding on the basis that this is a  qualitatively different state. So the top stratum of  administrators must be qualitatively different. Only  professionals can work in certain sections, and in certain  places professionalism must be supplemented by persons with a  clear-cut political orientation. Policy is determined by the  president, which means that those who help him to do this and  are directly in his team, are also political figures.    [Kucher] Are we to hope that there will no longer be a place  for favorites in the presidential team?... What principles lie  at the heart of the new line in cadre policy?    [Filatov] First of all, professionalism. Second, the  capability for long-term hard work, and, naturally, solidarity  with the president's line.    [Kucher] So what about independence of thought?    [Filatov] Yes, that too. Until a decision is adopted, you  can discuss and analyze. Apart from the Staff apparatus, the  president has various formations: the Presidential Council, the  Security Council, the Expert Analytical Council, this Council  for Cadre Policy, and the recently formed Council for Social  Policy. A number of commissions are in operation. The  president does not work alone but is surrounded by an  intellectual and professional elite. That is where arguments go  on, views collide, a concept of reform is elaborated. Believe  me, the people there are not all of the same opinion. But it is  only the president who adopts a decision, taking all opinions  and approaches into account.    [Kucher] Let us take the Sergey Shakhray case. I would like  to know how the new principles of cadre policy have operated  with respect to him.    [Filatov] I do not want to talk about that subject for  ethical reasons.    [Kucher] The qualities of the cadre corps surrounding the  president in many respects leave their mark on the mechanism for  elaborating presidential decisions. Are there any rules  according to which their elaboration proceeds?    [Filatov] The process of preparing a decision does not  proceed according to one technological diagram. A plan of  action is drawn up. The government proposes something, and  something else comes from the State-Legal Administration as well  as the president's assistants and the ministries and  departments. The concept of future documents must be discussed  by the interested parties, and sometimes proceeds directly from  Boris Nikolayevich. He is very active both at the moment when  the document comes into being and in the period when it is to be  signed.    [Kucher] The opinion exists in society that the president's  reaction to topical events in the country is sometimes belated  and sometimes not commensurate with their significance....    [Filatov] If there is such an opinion, than we must listen  to it. However, I believe that the president's reaction does  correspond to the degree of the event's importance. In the  final analysis it is he who decides how to do this -- in writing  or orally -- and when to react, who should speak -- the press  secretary, the foreign minister, the president himself, or a  particular state employee. So that strictly speaking from the  viewpoint of reacting to events which are generally significant  to the country I believe that everything is in order here.  Maybe the content of such information is not always detailed,  but that is another matter.    [Kucher] There is no presidential party in the country at  the moment, and at the same time we know of unsuccessful  attempts to create one. I remember the president's recent  statement at the democratic forum, to the effect that if such a  party were to be created, he would be the first to join it...  What is the state of affairs in this sphere at the moment?    [Filatov] I think that a party should be created. We are  living in an excessively dynamic situation, whereby various  movements and blocs are simply not managing to develop a normal  party structure and party activity, but elections have to be  held. Of course we need such a party.... This question is being  raised by many imminent politicians and public figures.    [Kucher] What kind of a party will it be?    [Filatov] Most likely it will correspond to the type of  state we are building. And reflect the style of its development  and its aim. It must be a social democratic party. In any  case, this is what determines the president's activity, it seems  to me. At least the years of his struggle against the communist  ideology draw a picture of a social democratic type of state.  That is precisely what is enshrined in the new Constitution --  a federative, democratic, rule-of-law, social state.    [Kucher] Can you see a place for yourself in the state  party?    [Filatov] I would not refuse to support such a party or be  in it.    [Kucher] Sergey Aleksandrovich, I ask everyone I talk to  this question, and I would like to know your opinion: What are  we building here?    [Filatov] It seems to me that we do not have to attach any  kind of ideological adjective to our state. Then everything  falls into place. Sometimes people say: There is no common  idea in the country, no ideology of reform. That is not true.    We want to our state to be democratic. Have we achieved  this? Not at the moment. But we have freely elected the  president and the Federal Assembly. Local self-government is  being created.    We are fighting for freedom of information and freedom of  the  press. And you cannot say that there has been no success in  this. The world recognizes the fact.    And take our courts. They have already started protecting  constitutional human rights, although of course we are still at  the beginning of the path and through force of momentum are  still doing a lot of things in an administrative way, responding  to people's letters and complaints.    We are in favor of laws' taking precedence over the will of  officials. Here too there is no end of work to be done. In a  normal rule-of-law state several thousand normative acts are in  operation, but here, as I see it, we do not even have one  thousand yet. At the moment a lot depends on the personality of  the administrator, his abilities and talent to predict and solve  problems. That is why the slogan "cadres determine everything"  exists at the moment.    Are the contours of the future Russian state taking shape?  Of course they are. The individual and his rights are of  paramount importance in the new Constitution. Can we fully  ensure these rights today? Not at the moment. But we are  getting increasingly close to being called a civilized state in  which the individual is the main figure, protected by all the  attributes of a democratic state. People should own property  and live peacefully amid wealth. That is how it should be. And  will be!    [Kucher] What, in your opinion, is the state obliged to do  today for society?    [Filatov] Preserve it, and prevent a reduction in the level  of consumption. The figures show the monstrous economic  position in which our state finds itself today. Nevertheless,  the consumption of food products is a main factor.    Admittedly, we are all demanding various things from the  state through force of momentum. We are still proceeding as if  on a knife edge, and we have to go down the path worthily, so as  not to fall into the abyss. It seems to me that, during this  period, all groups should give up persistently trying to obtain  various funds and preferential conditions for transient benefits.    [Kucher] They will not agree to that. Or they will pretend  to agree.    [Filatov] But then there will be no results. If you aim to  keep the fall in production at a level of 25 percent by the end  of the year, and inflation at no more than 10 percent, then this  can be achieved only by giving up lobbying activities. Accord  in society is, after all, not just a subject for discussion by  political scientists or journalists. Accord has an economic  foundation. Accord requires restrictions, of a financial nature  too.    [Kucher] Do you really believe in the idea of accord?    [Filatov] I believe in the idea of accord very strongly. I  think that our state will not be able to get out of the crisis  situation in which it finds itself without becoming aware of the  need for sociopolitical conciliation.    Stressing the importance of the Social Accord Treaty, the  president noted that we have not had such a thing in almost 80  years. For eight decades our country lived in a regime of civil  war, when part of society overtly or covertly destroyed the  rest. No other country, with the possible exception of fascist  Germany, has allowed such a scale of destruction of its own  citizens as we permitted to happen. Hence the conclusion that  we must give up Bolshevik methods of solving civil conflicts  once and for all. But what the aggressively minded opposition  is now trying to do constitutes Bolshevik tactics; and, whether  we like it or not, this will inevitably lead to violence. Yet  we have no right to fight. The treaty is the path to peace in  Russian society.    [Kucher] That formula is too general....    [Filatov] You see, there are a lot of laws missing in our  society, and that is why it is, so to speak, naked and  defenseless in the face of confrontation and violence. Until  society is saturated with legal norms, accord is needed as a  method of settling conflicts. As an intermediate link in peace.  It will be difficult for us to get out of the crisis. Critical  moments, notably connected with the refusal to support  loss-making enterprises, cannot be ruled out. And the problem  of unemployment arises here. Of course, you can shout that this  is a crime, that the people have been reduced to penury.  Certain speculative politicians who are pursuing power may play  on this. But the problems nevertheless need to be solved, and  they need to be solved economically, partly through constructive  dialogue, that is, on the basis of the peaceful manifestation of  the professional opinion of the majority. That is the substance  of the accord idea.</p>

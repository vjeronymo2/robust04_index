			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Approaches to the future from opposite poles  -The Issues, Energy ENTIRE government departments are seldom at risk during elections. But the Department of Energy's future depends on next week's poll. The Tories have threatened to wind the department up for good and all if they win, believing it has outlived its usefulness. Labour will keep the department because they think there is still much to be done on the energy front. This shows how far apart the main parties are on energy. The Tories are committed to creating a free market in power and fuel which will remove any need for a central bureaucracy. They have handed the gas and electricity industries over to Sid. If they survive to see through their planned early sell-off of British Coal, all that will be left in state ownership is the nuclear power industry, which is due for review in 1994. But the story is not as close to its end as the Tories suggest. Recently there has been growing reaction to the consequences of privatisation, in particular the near-monopolies in power generation and gas and the strong influence they have on energy prices. A future Tory government could face pressure to break these organisations up further. Allied to this is the question of whether the regulators are proving effective enough in keeping the utilities up to the mark. The Tories are promising to attack anti-competitive behaviour 'with vigour' and introduce new legislation to deal with cartels. Labour intends to take a more interventionist line. Much of its policy is based on the party's commitment to saving the coal industry which it sees playing a key role in a national energy policy. This would mean guaranteeing a price for coal supplies and banning coal imports, which would save jobs but might also entail higher electricity bills. Although Labour has given up any idea of renationalising the electricity industry it would 'restore public control' of National Grid in order to reassert government power over electricity supplies. But it is not clear quite what this means. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, seems to have backed off from a commitment to renationalise the grid. Labour would try to husband North Sea oil and gas reserves by measures to encourage more efficient recovery from undersea wells, and put a brake on the 'dash for gas' which is leading to the construction of a wave of possibly unnecessary gas-fired stations. One of the biggest areas of uncertainty is nuclear power. The Tories are being cautiously non-committal. Their manifesto stresses 'safe and economical nuclear power', with safeguards for the management of nuclear waste. Labour would complete the one nuclear station still under construction - Sizewell B in Suffolk - but would build no more and would allow the industry to wither away. The Liberal Democrats take the strongest line. They would stop Sizewell immediately and phase out all nuclear power by 2020. They also support proposals for an EC energy tax - something that neither the Tories nor Labour are keen on. If the Lib Dems got the energy portfolio in a coalition government they could have quite an impact. Whichever party wins, we shall be hearing much more about energy efficiency, both to save fuel and to spare the environment. The Tories will set up an independent energy savings trust to promote energy efficiency, and there may also be new building regulations to improve energy use. Labour goes one better: it will set up two new agencies, one for energy efficiency, one for renewable energy. But it will also require gas and electricity companies to play a leading role in promoting insulation and energy saving.</p>

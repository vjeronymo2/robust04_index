			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (19): Improved connections - Mobile telephones ease communications for the business community FEW innovations have eased the problems of business life in Nigeria's big cities faster than the mobile telephone has done for its small group of initial users. The cellular phone system, which Mobile Telecommunications Services began operating last September, is a striking example of the benefits of liberalising and deregulating the economy, allowing the injection of private sector capital and expertise into state corporations which are being put on a commercial footing. Despite a multibillion-dollar investment in telecommunications in the 1970s, the sector remained a byword for inefficiency with much of the money going on inappropriate systems in which kickbacks were common. The inadequacy of the conventional telephone service is one of the most obvious frustrations of living and working in Nigeria, even for those who have access to a telephone. Making an inter-city call could be more difficult than phoning abroad, while calls within Lagos often take hours to complete. When the US company Digital Telecom formed MTS in 1992 with state-owned Nitel, Nigeria had 350,000 telephones on an outdated and inefficient land-line system for a population of 88m, and there were no advanced mobile communications. Although there have been improvements in the land-line system in the past six months, notably Nitel's new digital phone lines, the development of cellular systems is significantly faster and cheaper. MTS, in which 55 per cent of the equity is owned by the Atlanta-based Digital Telecom and 45 per cent by Nitel, is developing a Dollars 65m infrastructure in cellular, paging, trunk radio and voice mail which will collectively serve 50,000 subscribers and already has more than 3,500 users in Nigeria's three main urban areas: Lagos to Ibadan, Kano to Abuja, and Port Harcourt. 'Around Dollars 55m of the initial investment was made by Nitel, building on their existing facilities,' says David Greenberg, managing director of MTS. 'The challenge for Digital Telecom will be to carry out and finance the expansion of the system to keep pace with demand.' With MTS attracting about 1,000 new subscribers a month, Mr Greenberg can foresee congestion. 'New users' connecting time tends to be high. But there is a learning curve and after a while their calls will be more brief or they will make more use of our other facilities, such as voice mail and paging which we hope eventually to extend to 300,000 users,' says Thomas Wright, technical director. 'We have about 3,000 phone subscribers in Lagos, where our three cell sites are already at full capacity on grade of service.' At present cost does not appear to be a constraint, although MTS sells the mobile phones at prices ranging from Dollars 1,500 to Dollars 2,500 and there is a one-off activation fee of Dollars 2,500 and a monthly charge of Dollars 60 a month before the user has made any calls. The company sees demand coming mainly from businesses and government officials. 'The phones MTS is marketing are state-of-the-art,' says Mr Greenberg. 'Some of the Motorola equipment we supply here, such as the Microtak 2, is considered a status symbol even in the US.' Mr Greenberg is confident that Digital Telecom have made the right choice in coming to Nigeria and choosing Nitel as a partner. 'Nitel have given us full support. When we asked for a dedicated line in Abuja we got it within one day. 'The company has 200 staff, 90 per cent locally employed. We are committed to training Nigerian staff to manage and maintain the whole operation.' In the long term, MTS hopes to extend radio communications to the rural areas where there are few or no landlines. Mr Greenberg believes the cellular systems will help to take the strain off the landlines.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 13 (MENA)--Iran has started setting up  a nuclear power plant in Bushehr Province south of Tehran with  the aid of Russian experts.    An informed Iranian source told reporters today that an  agreement was reached with the Russian authorities a few months  ago on the implementation of the first phase of the facility.    Construction of the project, which will take four years to  operate with full capacity, started in March, the source said.  As much as 30,000 tonnes of necessary materials were  transported from Germany to Iran, he said. The German  Government refused however to ferry another 7,000 tonnes, he  added.

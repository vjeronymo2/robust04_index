			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Paris steps up state aid campaign THE FRENCH government, under growing electoral pressure, yesterday stepped up its campaign to prevent what it sees as foreign countries' attempts to entice investment away from France. France is to ask the European Commission to investigate the UK aid given to Hoover to persuade the US company to relocate a vacuum cleaner plant to Scotland with the loss of 600 jobs in the Dijon region, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, confirmed yesterday. At the same time, he said that if Grundig, the German electronics company, closed its television plant at Creutzwald in north-east France and transferred production to Vienna, he would protest to the Austrian government. Grundig, which was considering possible closure at its headquarters in Fuerth yesterday, said the issue would be discussed again at another board meeting on February 12. Mr Beregevoy said that if Austria wanted to join the European Community 'it must respect certain rules of the game'. A spokeswoman for Mr Beregovoy accepted Brussels' denial that it had not given Hoover any direct EC aid. But she said the Scottish Office assistance to Hoover fell into the category of national aid 'which has to be authorised by the Commission' and that France wanted to ensure such authorisation had been duly given. 'It is not in the spirit of the Treaty of Rome to destroy jobs in one country to create them in another,' she said. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the agriculture minister who is also president of the Burgundy region where Hoover's Dijon plant has been located, complained that the US company had indulged in 'Apache tactics', scalping various European governments for their investment aid. Mr Richard Rankin, marketing director of Hoover Europe, denied this on French radio and said his company sought a meeting with the French authorities to explain their decision. Within two months, France's ruling Socialists face a general election in which a poll yesterday predicted they would win less than the Greens. Unemployment has risen sharply, with new figures due out today expected to top 3m.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Cabinet set to abandon radical council reforms The government appeared set yesterday to abandon plans for radical reform of English local government after it rejected proposals to abolish North Yorkshire and Somerset county councils. That climbdown, prompted by intense pressure from Conservative backbench MPs, is likely to be followed today by the withdrawal of proposals from the Local Government Commission to abolish a further six counties. The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, had recommended that North Yorkshire and Somerset should be replaced with all-purpose unitary councils combining the powers held by districts and counties. However, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who announced the decisions, told parliament that Avon and Humberside, both created in the last reorganisation of 1974, were to be abolished. It now seems clear that the local government review, begun in 1991, will be restricted mainly to undoing the work done in 1974. Last year, Mr Gummer had said he wanted the retention of the present system to be the 'exception', and expected the commission to recommend unitary councils even if in some cases that involved extra expense. But opposition to the proposals for Somerset and North Yorkshire proved fierce. In Somerset, all the county's Conservative MPs, including Mr Tom King, the former cabinet minister, had threatened to vote against the proposals in parliament. One of them, Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the paymaster-general, had threatened to resign as a minister over the issue. The cross-party Association of District Councils had dubbed the proposal to create a unitary North Riding of Yorkshire 'Shambleshire', while Mr Robert Banks, the Conservative MP for Harrogate, described the plans as 'a complete load of rubbish'. Sir John said yesterday that views of residents in the two counties 'were not clear cut', and that the proposals had been 'finely balanced'. While there was majority support for unitary councils in both counties, he said, 'there was no consensus for any particular solution'. He added: 'The commission's pioneering work in measuring public opinion and people's feelings of community has revealed in many other places substantial bodies of opinion wanting local government left as it is.' That would be considered in the final proposals made to Mr Gummer today, he said. Unpopular counties killed off, Page 10</p>

He stated that the provincial  conscription work has completed the first three phases of public  announcement and registration, education evaluations and  physical examinations and now we are entering the phase of  political investigations, induction and transportation. In order  to guarantee that the conscription assignment levied on our  province by the State Council and the Central Military  Commission is completed on time, safely and according to high  quality standards, in the coming days we must focus on both the  quality of the new conscripts and on honesty in conscription and  acceptance work. He stated that focusing on political quality is  of extreme importance and each level of the party committees,  the government, the military organs, public security and the  grass roots organs have the responsibility to carry out a  responsible political investigation of the newly selected  conscripts, and must resolve to not induct or to accept even one  new soldier not meeting the political criteria. In order to  guarantee the quality of the new inductees and the honesty of  the conscription and acceptance process, this aspect cannot be  slighted in the least. When the key moment of decision is  reached, supervision must be augmented; in conscription and  acceptance, both sides must accept supervision; the military  service organs must accept supervision by the masses. All  persons who participate in conscription and acceptance work must  be honest and self-disciplined, accept no personal favors, take  no bribes, make no promises, and create an environment of equal  competition for those being conscripted. Make a good impression  on the minds and hearts of the masses; by words and actions,  give the new recruits their first lesson in honest government.  Commander Zhang also specifically made the point of requesting  all levels of the military services and the discipline  inspection departments to handle the communications and  visitations of the masses conscientiously, but people or  situations which seem to take advantage of the conscription  process to thwart or transgress discipline should be  investigated thoroughly, and miscreants punished severely. At  the same time, conscientiously handle the ideological work  associated with the youths and the parents of the youths who  answered the call but were disqualified or eliminated because of  numerical restrictions; cherish and preserve their willingness  to voluntarily offer themselves for the cause of national  defense.</p>

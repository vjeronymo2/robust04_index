			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Maruti suffers from fall in exports MARUTI Udyog, a vehicle-making joint venture between the Indian government and Suzuki Motor of Japan, has reported a fall in pre-tax profits to Rs342m (Dollars 11m) for 1992, down from Rs350m the year before, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. The Indian government allowed the Japanese car maker to increase its stake to 50 per cent last June from 40 per cent. Mr R. C. Bhargava, managing director, said exports of the company's 800cc car fell to 14,595 vehicles from 22,921 last year, largely because of the war in the former Yugoslavia and the 40 per cent devaluation of the Italian lira. Foreign exchange earnings fell to Dollars 56.7m from Dollars 92.2m. Maruti Udyog plans to begin exporting to South America. Suzuki's export strategy ensures that the Indian company is the only source for its 800cc car, which is sold in Hungary, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Portugal. Demand in India for the Maruti car expanded, with the company selling 126,854 vehicles in 1992 against 122,438 the year before.</p>

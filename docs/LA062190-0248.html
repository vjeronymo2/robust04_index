			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MICHEL STARS AS SPAIN BEATS BELGIUM  </P> <P> Michel scored his fourth World Cup goal and set up another as Spain beat  Belgium today, 2-1, to finish at the top of Group E.  </P> <P> Belgian playmaker Enzo Scifo missed a penalty shot in the 60th minute that  would have evened the score and denied Spain first place.  </P> <P> Both teams had already qualified for the second round after their earlier  matches, but the victory gave Spain a measure of revenge for its loss to  Belgium in a penalty shoot-out in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup in  Mexico.  </P> <P> Michel, hat-trick hero of Spain's 3-1 victory over South Korea, became the  tournament's top scorer when he scored from the penalty spot in the 27th  minute.  </P> <P> Patrick Vervoort got Belgium even three minutes later, but defender Alberto  Gorriz made it 2-1 for Spain in the 39th minute, and that proved enough to seal  a Spanish victory.  </P> <P> Spain, which will meet Yugoslavia in the second round Tuesday in Verona,  finished at the top of the group with five points and Belgium second with four.  </P> <P> Scifo, who had been having an excellent game, ruined his day when he thumped  the penalty shot against the crossbar.  </P> <P> Michel made no such mistake with his penalty shot, which set Spain on the road  to success.  </P> <P> Michel drove his right-footed shot out of reach of goalkeeper Michel  Preud'homme, who guessed correctly and dived to the right but failed to get his  hand on the ball.  </P> <P> Three minutes later, Belgium evened the score after Scifo, mainspring of the  Belgian attack, was fouled in front of the penalty area.  </P> <P> Scifo ran over the ball at the free-kick and Vervoort crashed in a left-footed  shot that took a deflection off the defensive wall, leaving Spanish goalkeeper  Andoni Zubizarreta stranded.  </P> <P> Nine minutes later, Spain went back in front for good.  </P> <P> An excellent Spanish pattern involving striker Julio Salinas, Michel and  Francisco Villaroya was brought to an end near the corner-flag by a crunching  tackle on Michel by defender Pascal Plovie, who had come on as a substitute for  Marc Emmers just after the Belgian goal.  </P> <P> Michel lofted a free kick and Gorriz, up in the area on the right, met it with  a firm header which flew into the far corner of the net.  </P> <P> Belgium, a 2-0 winner over South Korea in their opening game, featured four  changes from the side which defeated Uruguay, 3-1, Sunday -- with goal-scorer  Vervoort among the quartet drafted into the starting lineup.  </P> <P> Belgian Coach Guy Thys was content with the outcome.  </P> <P> "I'm very satisfied," he said. "We were in command in the second half with five  new players. I don't think we have to be afraid of anybody. We came close to an  equalizer several times."  </P></p>

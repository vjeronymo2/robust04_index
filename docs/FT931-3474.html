			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Pop go the Sixties - William Packer both admires and questions the exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery The first thing to say of this large exhibition of British art in the 1960s, that David Mellor - he of Sussex University - has selected and documented so copiously, is that it is beautifully presented, fascinating and extremely enjoyable at every turn. The second, which follows inevitably upon anything whatsoever to do with 'the Sixties' - to those of us, that is, whose early career was coincidental with them - is that of course it is misconceived. The exhibition's faults are the creatures of its virtues, for Mellor is so taken with his material, in all its aspects, that he offers us neither a thorough documentary nor a straight-forward celebration of the art, shown on its own terms for its own sake. We are taken down the byways of the social history of the times, tramping along the road from Aldermaston, reading Private Eye and the International Times, gazing at Christine Keeler, mocking Harold Macmillan, or Harold Wilson as the case may be, listening to the Beatles and The Who, sitting in at Hornsey. And as we browse, so we find ourselves chewing on the art - tachisme, or 'action painting'; colour-field abstraction; Pop painting, hard-edge and optical; New Generation sculpture and incipient conceptualism. So again we are deflected back to the documentary, to the places and the circumstances, to the loose and shifting affiliations and interests of artists throughout the period. Back we go to the Royal College; the studios and bomb-sites of Notting Hill of the late 1950s; and to the wharfs and warehouses of Saint Katherine's Dock 10 years on. The photographs in particular are marvellous, by Roger Mayne, Roger Coleman, Roger Freeman, Lewis Morley and Don McCullin  -all those fresh, young, earnest, ambitious faces. I had expected such stuff to make me feel rather old. I can only say that I came away feeling not as old as all that. It is all wonderfully indulgent and enjoyable, but the doubts remain, even so. The problem with any such survey is that it can never be at once hermetic and inclusive, particular and comprehensive. And with the Sixties, saddled with that tendentious reputation and over-simple label, the problem becomes acute. What were 'the Sixties', and when, if ever, did they begin? For anyone of my generation, born in the late 1930s and early '40s, they began, if ever, long before, with Elvis and Brando, Osborne, Kerouac and Traditional Jazz, Suez and Hungary. By 1965 or so, with satire and Profumo, the minicar and Jean Shrimpton's legs, they were over. The Sixties of Wilson, Flower Power, Protest, Prague and Paris, Sergeant Pepper and Peace &amp; Love, were always another age, another world. In eliding the two periods, Mellor rather misses the point, and the opportunity, both in sociological and creative terms. Nor does his basic premise hold: that here is a period now so neglected as to be in dire need of critical rehabilitation. Where has he been all these years? Private View, the Russell, Robertson, Snowdon encapsulation of his early period was published in 1965, and to turn its glossy, stylish pages today is hardly to move back into a vanished world. Where are they now, Caro and Paolozzi, Freud and Auerbach, Jones and Blake, Caulfield and Hoyland, Riley and Hodgkin, King and Hockney? Well, still here, I suppose. The world has moved on, and while some artists have fallen into obscurity, following generations, of sculptors especially, have had their day in their turn. But, for all that, we are hardly addressing total eclipse. Mellor speaks of 'realigning parts of the hidden history of British art', and quite rightly draws attention again to the work of William Green, with his action painting; to Tony Messenger and his expressionist image of James Dean's crashed car; to Pauline Boty, who died young, with her definitive Marilyn, 'The only Blonde in the World'. But where are the kitchen-sink painters and where, in particular, is Bratby, with his paintings for the film of 'The Horse's Mouth', with Alec Guinness as Gulley Jimson? And if there are to be the compendium and collage-based paintings of Boty, Blake and Phillips, where are those of Anthony Donaldson? And if the St Martin's sculptors are well represented, why is there so little of Paolozzi, and why nothing at all of the Royal College sculptors of the time, Hall, Panting, Plackman and the rest? But we are all experts on the Sixties, and to carp too much is too easy. I wish that Mellor had confined himself to the earlier period, but, that said, I can only admit that he has most admirably caught the energy and sense of engagement that so characterised it. In those early, still comparatively innocent days, it was an energy directed above all upon the work itself and the doing of it. Hopes were that it would attract notice, that it would sell, that a name would be made thereby - but which young artist has not hoped as much? The important thing was that the work was done anyway, for its own sake, and today its essential integrity still shines out. Most of all it is apparent here in the 'Situation' abstraction, shown by the Arts Council in 1963 - the first flush of maturity in the work of such as Gillian Ayres, the Cohen brothers, Hoyland, Law, Irwin, Mundy, Plumb, Smith, Vaux and Young. There they all were, European in sensibility yet responding to what was coming out of New York, looking about them but remaining quite themselves. They were professional enough - the professional ethic would come later. Mellor is quite right in this respect, that here is an authentic British school we have consistently undersold. The Sixties: art scene in London; the Barbican Art Gallery, the Barbican Centre EC2, until June 13, supported by the Hulton Deutsch Collection; Apple UK; Atlantis European. David Mellor's excellent and substantial book on the exhibition - more than a mere catalogue - is published by Phaidon, Pounds 22</p>

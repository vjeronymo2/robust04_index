			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEVE WISNIEWSKI, TOP RAIDER ROOKIE, REPORTS, ENDING A ONE-DAY HOLDOUT  </P> <P> The top Raider rookie, Penn State guard Steve Wisniewski, agreed to terms  Friday and reported after a one-day holdout.  </P> <P> Wisniewski was the top pick in the second round. Of the players selected ahead  of him in the draft, only two have signed -- Troy Aikman with Dallas, and Andre  Rison with Indianapolis.  </P> <P> George Karras, who handled negotiations for the Raiders, did so from a hospital  bed, after undergoing foot surgery.  </P> <P> Wisniewski is thought to be in the running for the starting right guard spot.  </P> <P> Linebacker Emanuel King, a free agent from Cincinnati, hurt his right shoulder  in the morning drill Friday. X-rays were negative and it is thought to be a  bruise.  </P> <P> Otis Wilson, the free agent from Chicago who is coming off knee surgery, is  working out without pads. Said Raider Coach Mike Shanahan: "He's not 100% at  this time. We want to build his conditioning level up. When we think he's  ready, we'll put him in pads." MARK HEISLER  </P></p>

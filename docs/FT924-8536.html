			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Timing the key to taking VAW private - Up to 49 per cent of the German aluminium company may be sold VAW Aluminium of Germany is being prepared for the private sector. Its parent, VIAG, the large holding company which also has chemical and energy interests, was itself privatised in 1988. Mr Jochen Schirner, chairman of VAW's management board, says VIAG is preparing to sell up to 49 per cent of the aluminium company. However, although the determination to float VAW is strong, the timing is obscure. Not only will the move have to wait until the uncertainties surrounding the German economy are removed and stock markets show more signs of strength, it will also depend on the speed at which VAW reshapes itself. In the past, Mr Schirner points out, size was the only thing that differentiated between aluminium companies. They were integrated companies and 'everything and anything to do with aluminium was their business'. He insists, however, that 'the time for this approach has passed'. VAW's board aims to emphasise the group's distinctive character. 'We want to become an aluminium company with our own contours,' Mr Schirner says. The idea is to gain the greatest benefits from being based in one of the world's strongest industrial markets - Germany - and in central Europe. At the same time, 'we cannot tackle the whole aluminium business. We still have a number of operations that are not core businesses and we must decide whether to develop them into bigger units or to go into joint ventures or to place them outside VAW.' Most of the present core businesses are of a size which would enable them to stand alone and be competitive, Mr Schirner suggests. The smelter division has a turnover of DM1.3bn (Dollars 850m); the rolled products division, DM1.5bn; and the flexible packaging operations, DM0.8bn. The casting division also has a DM0.8bn turnover but, because of minority interests, VAW does not get 100 per cent. The extrusions division, with a DM0.5bn turnover, is subject to review, because the market might change dramatically. Car companies are interested in a new construction concept under which vehicles are based on an aluminium 'spaceframe' - a skeleton-like metal frame to which other components can be bonded. Aluminium spaceframes are likely to be made from extrusions but, as Mr Schirner points out, they will be very different from the extrusions currently supplied to the construction market. 'We are in permanent discussions with the big German motor companies,' Mr Schirner reveals. 'They want to see the whole picture from us: for example, will there be enough aluminium available if they switch; who will recycle the aluminium in cars, and so on.' He insists that there would be no aluminium shortage. While 'all-aluminium' cars would at first require more new metal to be produced, the industry would ensure that each individual alloy was carefully recycled. Eventually, about 90 per cent of the aluminium used in cars would be recycled. The trend to more aluminium in cars might also have an impact on VAW's rolled products division. But, Mr Schirner points out, 'it will be well beyond the year 2000 before this is big business for our industry.' VAW has been investing heavily in its core businesses. It is mid-way through a DM1bn expansion at Aluminium Norf in Germany, which it owns jointly with Alcan of Canada. By late 1994 this will boost the plant's capacity from 650,000 tonnes to 1.4m tonnes of sheet, aimed particularly at Europe's fast-growing aluminium beverage can market. Mr Schirner points out that while aluminium production is moving to those areas of the world which can provide low-cost energy, and preferably environmentally friendly, renewable hydro-electric power, the markets for rolled products are regional. So 'Europe is Norf's market'. In keeping with the aluminium production trend, VAW is technical manager and member of the five-strong consortium which has just brought the Dollars 1bn Alouette smelter on stream in Quebec. The company will have one-fifth of Alouette's output of 215,000 tonnes a year and this, together with the expansion at the Tomago smelter in Australia, in which it has a 12 per cent stake, will take VAW's own annual capacity to nearly 500,000 tonnes. Mr Schirner admits there are serious long-term questions about VAW's smelters in Germany, which some analysts suggest have the highest costs in the world. He says these smelters give the company an advantage, however. 'We get very defined qualities of metal from our smelters - each slab has a defined quality, it is not commodity aluminium. We make slabs very close to rolled products and make alloys from liquid metal. It is not just a cost question. It also enables us to react quickly to changing customer demands.' VAW's spending is expected to continue at a high level. It has a DM3.7bn programme prepared, but Mr Schirner says part of this depends on the board giving final approval to some divisional plans. VIAG recently injected DM150m of new capital into VAW to help finance projects just completed and to keep the balance sheet in good shape. Last year VAW benefited from Germany's temporary reunification boom. Mr Schirner says business is now more difficult but there is a 'good chance' that 1992 net profits will match last year's DM80m.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD COCAINE SEIZURE IN SYLMAR  </P> <P> Conrad's depiction of Al Capone, the "Prohibition racketeers," embracing Al  Capone, the "drug moguls," is disturbing ("All we do is supply a demand" -- Al  Capone, Oct. 4).  </P> <P> When the Volstead Act, prohibiting sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages  was repealed, Prohibition racketeers were out of that particular business.  </P> <P> The inescapable implication of Conrad's cartoon is the legalization of drugs.  Even in jest, the implication is unrealistic and offensive.  </P> <P> STANLEY O. EPSTEIN  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

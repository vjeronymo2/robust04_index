			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Management: Cultural differences break down in the boardroom  -Growing pressure for change in the way companies are run Germany employs an elaborate system of checks and balances. France has an almost Napoleonic concentration of power. And the British prefer a pragmatic, middling path. In the field of corporate governance - how companies are governed - as in so many other areas of political and economic life, there remain big cultural divisions between the world's leading industrial economies. However, the differences should narrow significantly over the coming decade, according to a new study* of corporate governance in the seven leading western industrial nations prepared by Oxford Analytica, the British consultancy. The single most important reason, it argues, is the increasing globalisation of business activity, which is 'profoundly changing the nature of corporate management and organisation throughout all industrial economies and which will exert a decisive influence on systems of corporate governance over the next 10 years'. International competition is becoming more intense and cross-border takeovers are on the rise. But above all, says the report, international investors are growing in number and clout, and companies that want to attract capital will have to ensure that their interests in stronger corporate governance are met. The study, sponsored by recruitment firm, Russell Reynolds, accountants Price Waterhouse, investment bank Goldman Sachs, and lawyers Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, is said to be the first of its kind. David Young, the managing director of Oxford Analytica, notes that pension fund money invested outside domestic markets is forecast to grow from Dollars 92bn (Pounds 53.4bn) in 1985 to Dollars 780bn in 1995. Market forces such as these, says the report, are likely to reinforce a trend, already occuring through European Community policy, for continental European corporate governance practices to move towards the framework common in Britain, the US and Canada. Institutional investors in the three English-speaking countries - and the US in particular - have been most active in trying to make managements more responsive to shareholders' interests, demanding more outside representation on boards of directors, a better flow of information to investors and greater executive accountability for company policies and strategy. That contrasts sharply with France and Italy, where boards have traditionally been supine in the face of executive power. And in Japan the board is, for all practical purposes, an extension of management with no independent powers, and shareholders are totally passive. However, the report argues that Germany 'is arguably the only one of the seven countries . . . in which the system of corporate governance does indeed result in effective oversight of management by the representatives of other stakeholders'. This is because of its two-tier board structure, which involves a supervisory board, representing shareholder and employee interests, which in turn appoints an executive board of managers. The report suggests that the German system could provide a useful model for companies in other countries which want to create new channels for corporate governance, alongside an existing boardroom structure. However, the German system is often criticised for the powerful role played on supervisory boards by the nation's banks, both as shareholders in their own right and as proxies able to vote shares deposited with them, which can create strong conflicts of interest. The survey suggests this power may be reduced somewhat over the decade, due to a desire among banks to cut their holdings, the growth of institutional shareholding and industry's reduced reliance on banks for capital. At the same time, German companies will face legal and regulatory changes to improve accounting standards, ban insider trading and dismantle restrictive voting structures. The cumulative effect will be to weaken the power of the boards and increase the influence of institutional investors. In France, where until now the president or directeur-general of a company has had almost unlimited authority, boards will become more active, due to international competition for capital, a move by French pension funds into equities, and increasing pressure from shareholders and regulatory authorities for greater transparency. The same trends are likely in Italy, though to a lesser extent, given the unusually large number of Italian companies owned by a single family. Even Japan is expected to move a tiny bit towards a western-style system of corporate governance, prodded by factors such as a fledgling movement to strengthen shareholder rights and a need to include foreign directors in decision-making. However, there is a danger of exaggerating the impact of all these forces of convergence. International institutional investors, who are supposed to be the main engine of change, are still pretty passive, even in the US, when dealing with companies beyond their borders. The report suggests they will demand greater access to information (which seems certain) and greater participation in decision-making (which is questionable in the medium-term) but are unlikely to engage in the kind of share-holder-versus-management voting battles which have become common in the US. The 1990s will thus be an era of 'noticeable changes in corporate governance, but not revolution'. * Board Directors and Corporate Governance.

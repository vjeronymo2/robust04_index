			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on Denmark ALTHOUGH pressures inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism have subsided in recent months, close attention will be paid to the Danish krone's moves inside the system this week, writes James Blitz. With only 10 days to go to Denmark's second referendum on European Monetary Union, some dealers will be jittery about the Danish currency. Few can forget that the rejection of the first referendum nearly a year ago was the overture to the autumn currency crisis. There appears to be a better chance of the treaty being ratified by the Danish people this time, although an opinion poll on Friday showed that the number of people voting No in the referendum had increased from 33 per cent to 39 per cent. The Danish krone therefore starts the week somewhat weaker in the ERM grid, with a divergence of 42 percentage points against its central Ecu rate. Several opinion polls are due to be released this week and they will be closely watched. One factor which may support the krone is the D-Mark's weakness against most European currencies, which has been a theme of recent trading. Barely a week goes by now without the Bundesbank easing some instrument of monetary policy, and there will be a close watch again on Wednesday's repo rate fixing. There were signs last week that the weakness in the German economy was starting to make itself felt in the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate. Despite a poorer than expected non-farm payroll figure for April, the dollar rose by nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the day. This week's US indicators may help investors decide what view to take of the US economic upturn. Retail sales figures for April are due out on Thursday. Friday sees the release of industrial production figures for the same month.</p>

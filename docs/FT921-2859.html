			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Japan The Nikkei's drop below 20,000 makes it all the harder to justify buying Japanese equities. The fresh scandal at Daiwa Securities and the weakness of the yen have reduced the scope for the authorities to implement effective rescue measures for the market. Perhaps that explains why some investors were clutching at straws in pointing out that, whereas the Nikkei fell 3 per cent yesterday, the broadly-based Topix index fell only 1.3 per cent. That went against the recent trend for the Topix. Equally, selling pressure by corporate investment 'tokkin' funds approaching their year-end was not strong enough to explain the slide in equities. At least the calm reaction in London and New York to the Nikkei's fall suggests that concern over the broader impact on world markets has been exaggerated. A few months ago the international community was worried about the impact on Japanese bank capital adequacy ratios. Now it appears resigned to the withdrawal of Japanese banks from the lending scene. The main anxiety is the domestic economy. Japanese institutions have been heavy buyers of US bonds which yield 2.6 per cent more than the home-grown variety. The resulting capital outflow has weakened the yen to a point which appears to rule out the sort of interest rate cut needed to stabilise the equity market. Only the bravest contrarians will want to buy shares.</p>

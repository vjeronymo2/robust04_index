			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Observer: You just have to whistle John Major's government presumably doesn't hope to win many hearts and minds at next weekend's Middle East economic conference in Casablanca. The three-day conference - hosted by Morocco's King Hassan - gathers senior representatives from nearly 1,000 companies and top politicians. It's all about working out major projects for Middle East development. Last week in London Israeli prime minister Yitzak Rabin let it be known he hoped for some heavy-hitting UK representation. So Britain is sending Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the Foreign Office. That hasn't exactly delighted senior Moroccan officials, who reckon Hogg lacks the sort of clout they hoped to see from the UK. They wanted foreign secretary Douglas Hurd or Major himself. They might have a point. After all, US secretary of state Warren Christopher, Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev, Rabin and his foreign minister Shimon Peres are all planning to go along. So too are Yassir Arafat, along with the assorted prime ministers of Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and - probably - German chancellor Helmut Kohl. Perhaps Hogg is being groomed for greater things. Maybe Major and Hurd are terribly busy. Of course, it's conceivable that Major has had enough of businessmen influencing politicians to last him a lifetime.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: Kentucky-Fried Vanessa - Cinema THE BALLAD OF THE SAD CAFE (15) Cannon Shaftesbury Ave EVERYBODY WINS (15) Odeon Mezzanine, Gate Notting Hill THE HARD WAY (15) Empire IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES (18) Metro, Screen on the Hill THE COMPANY OF STRANGERS (PG) Barbican PREDATOR 2 (18) Odeon West End The Ballad Of The Sad Cafe, directed by British actor-director Simon Callow from Carson McCullers' indelibly wry Southern novella, is a mongrel with mythic pretensions. It lopes towards us with gloom-laden eyes and righteous humourlessness, turning the original story's witty particularity of cadence into a portentous, generalised growl. In its mouth it carries something long, gawky and voluble. Surely it cannot be Vanessa Redgrave? It is: complete with Southern accent as 'Miss Amelia', McCullers' tough, broomstick-tall bar-owner who falls in love with a dwarf and is undone by a handsome rogue. The dwarf (Cork Hubbert) is her cousin Lyman, the rogue (Keith Carradine) is her estranged husband Marvin, and the setting - for what in the original is one of the greatest slices of Southern Gothic ever written - is a town so small it has almost curled up and erased itself from the map. Here our heroine opens her weird cafe, closes her heart to all but Lyman and finally unfurls her spirit and her fists to fight the ex-convict spouse who returns to haunt her. Producer Ismail Merchant (A Room With A View, Mr And Mrs Bridge) is the matchmaker who brought Callow to McCullers and must be responsible for the daunting shambles that results. Stuffed with fine actors, the movie never transcends its look of a filmed play, and one shot in sackcloth brown and penitential blues. (The credits acknowledge Edward Albee's ill-conceived stage adaptation as well as the McCullers novella.) The exterior scenes are lifelessly framed and lit. And the town never convinces as a living community: just a scattering of clapboard barns and a group of Depression-garbed extras who behave with all the animation of an opera chorus trying to stand still during an aria. If Redgrave had triumphed, the spotlight-on-the-star style might have been vindicated. She gives it everything she has, but this is one of those roles in which withholding is as important as giving. Her Kentucky-Fried accent, her frantic incandescence of feature ('Once more, Vanessa,' one imagines a director pleading, 'with less feeling') and her gawky, pugnacious figure: it comes over too often like Olive Oyl auditioning for the role of Blanche DuBois. Add an underpowered Carradine and an overpowered Rod Steiger (as Rev Willin) and the word 'unevenness' seems an understatement. McCullers wrote a story as subtle and paradoxical as an airplant: the extraordinary grew out of the ordinary, the sublime out the banal or brink-of-ridiculous. Callow, in taking a self-proclaimed high road towards the 'mythic', misses absolutely everything that made the original scenic, surprising and affecting. In America, where the cocktail was invented, we can be so startled by the incongruous ingredients poured into one vessel that we forget to say 'When', or even 'Why?'. Take an ageing American playwright, Arthur Miller; mix him with two youngish American stars, Debra Winger and Nick Nolte; and then stir in a middle-aged British director, Karel Reisz. Everybody Wins is well into its second act - we use the theatrical term advisedly - before the viewer asks, 'What on earth are all these talents doing together and do they know that the film is coming apart around them?' A miscarried murder trial lures lawyer Nick Nolte to a small New England town, hired by Debra Winger, a bad-time girl trying to go good. 'Would you like some vitamins or something?' she asks Nolte on inviting him over her threshold. He looks as if he would like something stronger and he soon gets it. Miss Winger proves a flirt, a tease, an emotional chameleon; and the murder case gradually exposes a major case of civic and political corruption. Before lights-up we find ourselves negotiating a crazed biker (Will Patton) who builds religious shrines, a drug-smuggling ring of town professionals and a Judge (Jack Warden) with his mind on lower things than justice. In early scenes Reisz directs this bizarre fable of American breakdown - something like The Crucible meets The Stepford Wives - with the basilisk acerbity he brought to The French Lieutenant's Woman. With Winger and Nolte acting out their psychosexual scorpion-dance there promises to be blood before bedtime, and Miller's dialogue swings between the ironically fulsome (She to him: 'If there's such a thing as hope in this world, you're it') and the whipcrack witty (He to her: 'You've been trying to go North, South and powder your nose at the same time.') But once the plot widens, so do the fissures in its credibility. We wonder how one small American town can contain so many offbeat exemplars of favourite Miller themes: religion, justice, sexual volatility. We hear the creak of Ibsenism in the corruption-prone pillars of this community. And even in the film's strongest ingredient - the push-me-pull-you liaison between Nolte and Winger - we discern echoes of the Miller-Monroe emotional prizefight and its definitive transcription in After The Fall. The Hard Way mirror-writes the movement of mood and style in Everybody Wins. It begins frantic and fractured, it becomes caustic and harmonious. As soon as Michael J Fox sloughs his blond wig and overplayed Malibu brattishness for New York street-guise - he plays a Hollywood film star who goes native with the NY police to research a gritty cop role - this action comedy directed by John Badham (WarGames, Stakeout) develops a sweet cantankerous buzz. Policeman James Woods is Fox's mentor and role model, a human wasp's-nest who flies out and stings himself at the smallest provocation. Since Fox's provocations are far from small, and include a tendency to mimic for memory every tic or aphorism his partner produces, Woods is soon reprising the jitterbug excitability he brought to Salvador and The Boost. (Exasperation has long been one of the cinema's great comic resources, vide Oliver Hardy or WC Fields.) The chemistry between Woods and Fox gives the film the stamina to survive some daft plotting and predictable stunt climaxes; plus a script (Daniel Pyne and Lem Dobbs) that is no better than it should be and may have been encouraged by the gimmick-hungry makers to be rather worse. Channel 4 television has just spent three weeks agonising about screen censorship in this isle. But who says we are in the depths of a repression? Nagisa Oshima's In The Realm Of The Senses, an erotic inferno made in 1976 by the Japanese director of The Ceremony and Death By Hanging, opens in London for the first time fully certificated. No sexual holds are barred, and several new-to-me holds exhibited, in this tale of a love affair with a gory consummation. (It is based on a true-life liebestod between two geisha-house lovers in 1936.) The lady ends up triumphantly clutching the gentleman's severed parts - he having died, pre-mutilation, in a way we would all wish to - and Oshima mills sardonic tragicomedy and surprising visual grace from a romance in which Wagner meets Sacher-Masoch. In The Company Of Strangers, a first film by Canadian director Cynthia Scott, a group of old ladies on a country outing struggle for meaning and survival when their coach breaks down far from civilisation. The concept is sweet - real-life wrinklies playing the lady castaways who abandon bus and find companionship in rural hardship - but the structure is too loose and the ethno-human recipe too schematic. A black woman, an American Indian, an Irish nun, an English cockney, a Canadian lesbian . . . We have heard of cross-sections, but this is ridiculous. Less ridiculous, though, than Predator 2. New York has a problem. A fuzzy special-effects monster, its ego inflated by the success of Predator 1, stalks the city trying to eat people. Cop Danny Glover tries to stop it. But he has no adequate support from director Stephen Hopkins, who provides mindless violence and off-the-peg Alien atmospherics.</p>

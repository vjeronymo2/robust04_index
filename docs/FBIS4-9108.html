			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 20 April carries in its  regular 45-minute newscast three reports on the situation in  Gorazde.    The first item is compiled by Mediha Colo, who summarizes  the  contents of several "radio bridges" established today with  Gorazde. In these reports, Gorazde Mayor Rijad Rascic and a  group of local doctors in the war hospital describe the  situation in the city. Colo says that "during the realization of  the radio bridge, the communications center in Gorazde managed  to establish a telephone line with the hospital, where doctors  joined in the conversation." One unidentified doctor says that  "just in front of the hospital, a smoke bomb landed, which did  not make a lot of noise on impact, and some white smoke came out  of it. Then there was something like a firecracker, which burst  through a concrete surface. There were people under [words  indistinct], the four of them were burnedt. One got away with  horrendous burns. He keeps talking about some kind of air  [words indistinct]." The doctor says "there are some missiles  that are parachuted in. They fire the missile from above the  city and it does not go over.... [pauses] It lands with a  parachute on the street. The explosions are tremendous. They  have even been firing Maljutka missiles at civilian targets, at  apartments, at people." Another doctor says that "they are  demolishing the hospital, there are people buried under the  ruins, the hospital is almost totally in ruins."    Mediha Colo says that "in the next radio bridge, Rijad  Rascic  gave us information about missiles with aerosol fillings, which  the chetniks have been firing today at Gorazde." Rascic says  that "these missiles are intended to destroy fortifications and  clear mine fields. They were used in the Vietnam War. They  create pressure in the place of impact and kill within a radius  of 80 meters and inflict serious injuries within a radius of 300  meters. We have some shrapnel from one of these missiles, and  there is this mark on it: (SAD-275) and something else, but I  do not have the part with the other mark in my hand here."    Enes Musovic then reports from Gorazde that "no one here  knows what to say to yet another blatant lie launched by the  fascist scum from Pale. The chetniks have neither halted the  attacks on Gorazde nor has it even occurred to them to have a  unilateral cease-fire. Just at a time when Belgrade Radio in its  own fashion lied to its servile listeners about an alleged  cease-fire by the chetniks and the invented constant  provocations from Gorazde, Gorazde came under cross fire from  all the Chetnik artillery from all their positions." He says  that "28 people were killed in just one hour today, 12 of them  children." He says that "the chetniks are intensifying their  attacks as the evening approaches. Attacks by strong infantry  forces of Karadzic's murderers on the defense lines in the city  center are supported by dozens of tanks from the direction of  Kopaci and Jabuka."    Gorazde Mayor Rijad Rascic reports that "the chetnik  criminal  Radovan Karadzic says that only the left bank of the Drina River  should be protected by the UN Protection Force. However, the  public should know that there is no left and right bank in  Gorazde. Gorazde is a city that cannot be divided, that will  not be allowed to be divided. The people on the right bank have  to know that they will not be betrayed; they should have  absolutely no doubts about that. Everything on the right bank  will be defended in the same way it is defended on the left  bank. Anyone who might think that one or the other bank is  safer is wrong. Both the left and the right bank are under a  very serious attack, but our defenders are successfully  organizing the defense with what they have, which is mostly  their bodies."</p>

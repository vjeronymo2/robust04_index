			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The expansion of  telecommunications in the Tibet Autonomous Region has exceeded  the development pace of the local economy over the past decade.    "This has paved the way for the rapid regional economic  development," said a regional official.    Nowadays, it is easy to find a telephone either on a street  or in a hotel. Mobile phones and radio pagers are commonly seen  in this capital of the region.    According to Xu Dingyuan, deputy director of the city  telecommunications bureau, the region has telephone exchanges  with a combined capacity of about 30,000 lines at present, up  from only 50 lines in the 1950s and 300 lines in the 1970s.    "The telephone capacity will surpass 40,000 lines next  year,"  he said.    At present, the telephone capacity in Lhasa tops 15,000  lines. That means every 10 people can have a telephone.    Located on the "roof of the world", Tibet plans to expand  its  satellite ground stations from the present 56 to 80 to further  link its remote areas with other parts of the country and the  rest of the world.    Xu attributed the rapid development of telecommunications in  the region to the support of the state, other provinces and  overseas.    He explained that the state has allocated 200 million yuan  to  Tibet in this field in the 1991-1995 period, and Lhasa's first  5,000-line program-controlled telephone exchange has been sent  by the Belgian Government as a gift.</p>

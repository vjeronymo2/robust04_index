			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Brussels warns German ban on UK beef would be 'illegal' The European Commission warned yesterday that Germany would be breaking European law if it banned imports of British beef because of fears of 'mad cow' disease. Commission officials said any move by Germany, which has threatened a ban because of its concern over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), would almost certainly be met by legal action from the Commission. This would probably mean an injunction in the European Court of Justice aimed at forcing the ban to be lifted. Health ministry officials in Bonn said yesterday that Germany intended to seek a special session of EU health ministers later this month to discuss a ban. Bonn has yet to state clearly that it is still prepared to impose restrictions unilaterally if it fails to persuade its EU partners to impose a Union-wide ban. Health ministry officials said last week Germany was prepared to act unilaterally. In Brussels the Commission said: 'There is only one body that can take a decision to restrict exports in Europe and that is the Community.' It added that the Commission had repeatedly told the Germans there was no scientific evidence to link British beef with another spongiform infection, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which affects humans. The warning came as German and British veterinary and health experts met in Brussels to try to resolve the dispute, inflamed by recent comments from Mr Horst Seehofer, German health minister, suggesting Germany would restrict beef imports if the UK did not introduce tighter measures. Government spokesmen in Bonn and London said there were differences in the interpretation of scientific evidence. Mr Hartmut Schlegel, at the German health ministry, said that this meant the Germans still wanted to press ahead with restrictions. Mr Rene Steichen, EU agricultural commissioner, has indicated to the German government that any restrictions would be illegal. The issue has provoked irritation in Brussels, not least because of its implications for the Commission's powers and the operation of the single European market. A European Commission official said yesterday that Mr Steichen's attitude was 'if the meat is safe enough for the UK consumer - and we are convinced that it is - then it is safe enough for the German consumer too'. Any ban on British beef, the official added, could have broader consequences for exports of beef, both from the UK and from the EU as a whole. German suggestions that the EU should take further EU-wide measures against BSE were unnecessary, the official insisted. EU standards included the slaughter and destruction of offal of infected cattle, and a ban on exports from any herd found carrying the disease.</p>

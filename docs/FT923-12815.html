			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: US banks signal recovery in sector SECOND-quarter results from four medium-sized US banks yesterday offered more evidence of an earnings recovery in the sector. Fleet Financial Group, the Providence, Rhode Island-based bank that last year acquired the failed Bank of New England (BNE), produced a sharp rise in net profits, from Dollars 28m to Dollars 71m. Fleet's earnings rise - 45 cents against 23 cents in terms of earning per share - was helped by gains on security sales, a lower level of non-performing assets, and substantial contributions from the Massachusetts branch operations of the former BNE. Mr Terrence Murray, chairman, said the results were encouraging, but he noted that bad debt provisions were increased by Dollars 40m during the quarter. This was due to lingering uncertainty about the strength of the economy in the north-east of the US. He said Fleet's conversion and absorption of the former BNE branch franchise would be completed by year-end. The group's total workforce has meanwhile been reduced. At the time of the acquisition last year, Fleet employed 18,000 people and BNE 11,000; the combined workforce is now 2,000 less. Fleet's total assets at the end of June were Dollars 45bn, compared with Dollars 32bn a year ago. Bank of New York, meanwhile, announced a 45 per cent jump in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 87m, or Dollars 1.05 per share. The profit rise was helped by stronger fee income, wider spreads and lower bad debt provisions. While second-quarter bad debt provisions were Dollars 106m against Dollars 127m a year ago, the level of total non-performing assets fell by 14 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Non-performing commercial property assets declined by 12 per cent. Two months ago, Bank of New York agreed to acquire the 65-branch New York retail banking operations of Barclays Bank of the UK, a move that will boost assets by Dollars 3.2bn. The Bank of New York's total assets at the end of last month were Dollars 41.3bn. Another profits rise was announced by Republic New York Corporation, the holding company of Mr Edmond Safra's Republic National Bank and Manhattan Savings Bank. Republic said its net income rose 13.3 per cent to Dollars 63.9m. Earnings per share were 9.1 per cent higher at Dollars 1.08. The Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation, a prominent mid-western bank with 1,725 offices and Dollars 40.6bn of assets, said its net profits were 21 per cent higher at Dollars 127.9m.</p>

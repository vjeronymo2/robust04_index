			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH WARMS TO THE TASK IN ROUT OF RIVAL TAFT, 10-1  </P> <P> In every athletic contest, there is the warm-up, the heat of the competition  and the cool-down. But in the case of the Chatsworth High baseball team, the  warm-up period lasted four innings during Thursday's game against West Valley  League rival Taft.  </P> <P> Chatsworth, mired in a 1-1 tie until the fifth, racked up eight hits and scored  nine runs in the last three innings to cool off the host Toreadors, 10-1, in a  game that gave the Chancellors (9-2 overall, 6-0 in league play) sole  possession of first place.  </P> <P> "They are explosive," Taft Coach Rich McKeon said. "They have at least, I'm  sure, four Division I players. There's a couple of guys that may even be  drafted."  </P> <P> Chatsworth exploded in the fifth, sending nine batters to the plate and scoring  four runs on three hits to take a 5-1 lead.  </P> <P> Kevin Chong walked to lead off the inning and with one out Rich Aude also  walked. A single by Eric Johnson loaded the bases and Derek Wallace followed  with a ground-rule double off the scoreboard in right field to score Chong and  Aude. Johnson scored and Wallace went to third on Vince Simili's sacrifice fly  to right and Chatsworth led, 4-1. Reed McMackin drove in Wallace with a  ground-ball single up the middle for the final run of the inning.  </P> <P> Chong and Aude again walked in the sixth and scored on Johnson's double down  the third-base line. Simili drove in Johnson with a double to increase the lead  to 8-1.  </P> <P> Chatsworth, ranked third in The Times Valley Poll, added two more runs in the  seventh to account for the final score.  </P> <P> The Toreadors (7-4, 4-2) scored their only run with two out in the first when  Glenn Nahmias tagged McMackin's three-and-two pitch over the right-field fence  for a home run and a 1-0 lead.  </P> <P> "After that first inning, I thought we were going to light them up all game,  but we didn't," McKeon said.  </P> <P> McMackin (4-0), a junior right-hander, gave up two hits in the first but  allowed only one the rest of the game and struck out five.  </P> <P> "Reed's come a long way," Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano said. "He's really a  bulldog type on the mound and he'll really challenge the hitters by keeping the  ball in the strike zone."  </P> <P> The Chancellors tied the score, 1-1, in the third when Jason Evans hit a  two-out triple to center and scored on a single by Aude.  </P></p>

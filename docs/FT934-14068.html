			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / People: Royal Insurance Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, is to take over from Sir John Cuckney as chairman of Royal Insurance. Sir John, who will retire in August 1994 after nine years as chairman, first teamed up with Gormly in the early 1980s when the two were chairman and chief executive respectively of John Brown, the construction company. Gormly, 55, a chartered accountant, is described by Royal insiders as a 'nuts and bolts industrialist with an in-depth knowledge of international trading operations'. His appointment reflects intentions to meld insurance expertise with broader industrial and managerial skills. Gormly will give up his post as chief executive of TH but will remain on the board as a non-executive director.</p>

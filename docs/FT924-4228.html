			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Bass Bass may rightly pride itself on its decision to tackle the government requirement to reduce its tied estate early and decisively. By selling pubs before prices were too depressed, it realised healthy profits for its shareholders. With a smaller estate, though, it has paid a heavy price in the form of a 25 per cent slide in pub retailing profits for 1991-92. The hangover, though less acute, will also continue in the current year. True, there were other factors behind the retailing decline; internal pricing arrangements mean the brewing side may have gained at the ex-pense of its retailing division. The company is also stepping up its spending on pub refurbishment, which had been neglected while the estate was being shrunk. That should bring returns eventually, though it will be 1994 before the normal maintenance cycle is back on track. The underlying message from yesterday's results is that recovery, both from the recession and the beer orders upheaval, will be slow in coming through. Yesterday's 3 per cent share price drop looks a reasonable response, especially given the company's determined caution on current trading as the Christmas season looms. But it would not do to get carried away. Holiday Inn will be helped by higher franchise rates and currency gains even though room rates have yet to respond to the tentative US recovery. Bass also looks particularly strong in brewing. With costs under control it is well-placed to push for higher market share.</p>

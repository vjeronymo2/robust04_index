			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC LOCATION SELECTED  </P> <P> An Oxnard location for a branch office of the Ventura County Mental Health  Department has been found, and the County Board of Supervisors is expected to  sign the lease Tuesday.  </P> <P> The site -- a vacant J.C. Penney store at 555 S. A St. -- will house 10 health  care specialists, who will take care of the medical and counseling needs of  about 75 clients.  </P> <P> The Oxnard team is part of the county's Small Community Outreach Treatment and  Support (SCOTS) program, funded by a $16-million state grant for development of  a prototype for mental health care systems in the state.  </P> <P> "We chose this site because it was close to the Oxnard Transportation Center,"  said Ray Holzer, who found the property for the county. "Most of the people who  use this system take a bus, and the transportation center is practically across  the street."  </P> <P> Once the lease is signed, $80,000 worth of renovations and construction will be  needed before the team can begin providing service. Holzer said it should be  ready to open by late August. KAREN McKEAN  </P></p>

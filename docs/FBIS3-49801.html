			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the session of the Presidency of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina held 14 January 1994 a proposed agreement was  discussed on establishing lasting and overall peace between the  Croatian and Bosniak-Muslim people in the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the foundations for future common life,  offered by the Croatian side at the talks in Bonn on 9 January.    The Presidency supported the initiative as well as all  efforts aimed at achieving a lasting peace, friendship and life  together of the Croatian and Bosniak-Muslim people. The  Presidency is also of the opinion that the life together of and  the friendship among all the three peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina  is of historic interest and that the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a multinational community, is interested  in cooperation with the neighboring countries.    As regards the relations between the Croatian and  Bosniak-Muslim people--they have historic foundations and are  based on territorial links, economic, cultural closeness, and  joint strategic interests, also bearing in mind the fact that  these two peoples and states are under threat from the same  aggressor. This is why the Presidency is determined to continue  with the efforts as soon as possible to halt the tragic conflict  between the Croats and Bosniak-Muslims, which is primarily a  consequence of the greater Serbian aggression and to find such  political and system solutions which would, instead of allowing  the conflict, stimulate friendship, cooperation and even  integration processes which would benefit our peoples and states.    Some parts of the [proposed] agreement set such objectives  and the Presidency supports them. Unfortunately, the agreement  as a whole, in its proposed form, cannot be accepted for several  principled reasons. First, an agreement cannot be signed by  peoples, but by internationally recognized subjects. In this  case the subjects of the international public law are the states  of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, as the internationally  recognized states and UN members. Since these two states have  recognized each other, signing the agreement on behalf of the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is not legally valid or possible,  nor is it politically acceptable. It implies derecognition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Republic of Croatia, with all negative  consequences stemming from it.    Second, the agreement's preamble does not mention the third  nation, that is the Serbian nation, without which there is no  overall and just solution and whose position must also be taken  into consideration.    Third, the preamble says that the parties to the agreement  will give personal guarantees for the implementation of the  agreement, which is legally invalid in a case of an  international agreement between two sovereign, internationally  recognized states. A shortcoming of the [proposed] agreement is  also that it does not state which international legal subject  will guarantee its implementation.    Four, the [proposed] agreement uses the terminological names  : the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim-Bosniak  republic, which define in advance the names and solutions which  are not in accordance with the terminology of the so-called  Geneva package -- for example: the republic with the majority  Croatian population.    Five, as regards a possible secession and the end of the  existence of the Union of the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina  the formulations differ significantly from those which were  agreed on and accepted in principle at the Geneva talks. The  constitutional agreement on the formation of a union of the  republics does not envisage the possibility of a union of two  republics. The proposed agreement does not respect the agreed  conditions nor the procedure in case of a possible secession  from or disintegration of the union, nor the consequences  envisaged in these situations. In such a situation it is  particularly important that the republic with the majority  Bosniak-Muslim people takes over the Neum municipality, the area  of Brcko, and the international-legal status and continuity of  the internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Six, the solutions which the agreement proposes for Mostar  and Neum are not in accordance with what was agreed onboard  Invincible, nor with the solutions which were agreed in  principle during the Geneva peace process.    Seven, many articles of the agreement contain legal  shortcomings, political inconsistence and terminological  imprecision, and some articles contradict some other ones--[for  example] the definition of the status of Mostar, Neum and the  free zones in the [Croatian Adriatic] ports of Ploce and Rijeka,  the imprecision in defining the envisaged borders between the  two future republics, and the leaving out of the third, Serbian  side, and the problem of the occupied territory etc.    For all these reasons, and with the objective of using  constructively the [Croatian] initiative to find solutions which  would bring about peace and friendly cooperation between the two  peoples and states the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina has  decided:    First, to relaunch the initiative to establish confederal  relations between the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Republic of Croatia, as two sovereign and internationally  recognized states. The presidency also reiterates its proposal  that in the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina controlled by the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO [Croat Defense Council] a  united constitutional and legal system be promptly established.  It would be based on the principles of full national equality  and parliamentary democracy. Local authorities would be based on  proportional representation, according to the population census  of 1991. Domination by the majority population would be  eliminated by the use of parity and consensus when deciding on  most important issues. Other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina would  be treated as occupied territories and solutions for them would  be sought within a peace process and a process of a democratic  transformation within the Serbian national corps.  Decentralization of the state authorities and the internal  regionalization of the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina would not  be resolved through the confederal agreement.    To implement this initiative the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina proposes that a joint interstate commission  be formed promptly to examine all elements of the future  confederation. Some foundations for it have already been  defined in article 15, part two of the agreement [proposed by  the Croats].    Until the entire confederal agreement between the two states  is finalized the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina expresses  willingness to examine all proposals related to the halting of  the war confrontations, establishing peace and promoting life  together both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of  Croatia, the reply of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency to the  agreement proposed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman says in  its conclusion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Paul Guilbert: </F> "Uzbekistan: Francois Mitterrand Meets Six Centuries of  History"]    [Excerpts] Tashkent -- [passage omitted] In coming here,  [French President] Mitterrand thinks it will be easier to  straddle almost six centuries of history because, in the  meantime, Uzbekistan itself had disappeared from the world  political map. "We had not had relations for a long time," he  said, "because Uzbekistan was not a sovereign country and the  Uzbek people could not express themselves as such." The  collapse of the USSR solved that. The French president's visit  almost has the character of a historical reparation when  Mitterrand states that it makes it possible "to update the very  ancient ties between our two countries." At least President  Mitterrand is the first Western head of state to visit Tashkent  and, at a time when Uzbekistan (a sovereign country for five  years and independent for three years) is urgently seeking an  identity, this is significant: It is a unique diplomatic  exercise which, according to protocol, merely returns the Uzbek  president's visit to Paris last October. [passage omitted]    But, on regaining its state, Uzbekistan has certainly not  become the home of human rights: Oppositionists are in exile or  in prison, and the press only prints the official truth.  Moreover, Islam Karimov, who traded his title as first  secretary of the Communist Party for that of president of the  Republic, displays no democratic aspirations. His favorite word  is stability.    This robust Uzbek strode toward Mitterrand, confident of his  power. About 10 French entrepreneurs, invited to launch the  economic conquest of Uzbekistan, left the president's Concorde.  Who knows? Mitterrand is dreaming of the metaphysical aim of  his visit: his meditation at the tomb of Tamerlan [14th century  amir] tomorrow evening in Samarkand.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World harvest estimate down another 18m tonnes The International Wheat Council has made another cut in its forecast of the 1993-94 world cereal harvest. The total for wheat and coarse grains, reduced a month ago from 1.39bn to 1.373bn tonnes, is cut by a further 18m tonnes in the agency's latest report, published yesterday, to 1.355bn tonnes, 68m tonnes below the 1992-93 total. The wheat estimate's 8m-tonne fall to 562m tonnes, attributed chiefly to lower projections for the European Union, Kazakhstan, Russia and the US, takes the figure back to last season's level. But the coarse grains estimate, reduced by 10m tonnes to 793m in yesterday's report, is 68m tonnes down from 1992-93. The IWC blames a 'huge drop' of 73m tonnes in reported US maize production for the sharply lower coarse grains estimate. This has been partly offset by better prospects in western Europe, the former Soviet Union, Turkey, Egypt and Australia. The weather problems that cut US wheat output have also affected the quality of the crop, and the IWC warns that competition for supplies of high-protein premium breadmaking wheat could become still more keen early in the new year.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 1 PAPER, 2 WORLDS;  </P> <P> L'ITALO-AMERICANO, THE VOICE OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE SOUTHLAND SINCE 1908  </P> <P> In San Francisco, New York, Chicago and elsewhere, Italian-Americans who live  in the comfortable anonymity of the suburbs can return to their roots in the  remnants of old Italian neighborhoods, where the language and culture have  withstood change.  </P> <P> Although Los Angeles has the fourth-largest Italian-American population in the  country, it has no such urban enclave serving as a symbolic cultural hub. But  Los Angeles does have L'Italo-Americano, a bilingual weekly newspaper published  in the San Fernando Valley and distributed statewide. It is the voice of the  Italian language and immigrant experience in California.  </P> <P> "The neighborhoods are gone, but something else has replaced them," said  Kenneth Scambray, a literature professor and writer at the University of La  Verne, and L'Italo-Americano's book critic. "The newspaper is an extremely  valuable instrument for maintaining communication between groups as they spread  out."  </P> <P> L'Italo-Americano (The Italian-American) was founded in 1908 and has been  published since 1971 at Villa Scalabrini, a Valley retirement home run by an  order of priests serving Italian immigrants worldwide, the Scalabrini Fathers.  The newspaper has grown from a two-page local paper published exclusively in  Italian and dominated by Cleto Baroni, a Florentine immigrant and editor for  almost 60 years.  </P> <P> In the last 15 years, the paper has added a section covering the San Francisco  Bay Area and an English-language section. Because of its dispersed and diverse  audience, L'Italo-Americano plays several roles simultaneously.  </P> <P> "You have a segment of our readers for whom our newspaper is the main, if not  the only, avenue of information," said Father Mario Trecco, editor since 1971.  "We are here to please a variety of different tastes. Some people may come to  it because of the recipes and find cultural news. Some may look at the cultural  and discover social events. . . ."  </P> <P> About 1.1 million people of Italian descent live in California, according to  government studies, nearly half of them in Southern California. But there are  only a few outposts in the Los Angeles area where Italian-Americans can make  pilgrimages to their roots.  </P> <P> The Casa Italiana cultural center and adjoining St. Peter's Church in Chinatown  are solitary vestiges of a former Little Italy nearby, on North Broadway. There  are scattered social clubs, stores and restaurants in San Pedro, Alhambra,  Arcadia, Eagle Rock.  </P> <P> In Southern California and elsewhere, language and urban geography are no  longer the pillars of ethnic identity. The fluid nature of society in  California speeded the process by which immigrants became assimilated,  dispersed and "upraised," the term used by historian Andrew Rolle in his book  about Italian immigration in the West.  </P> <P> "What we are looking at is simply the fact that Italian-Americans have gone on  to another level of the pluralism in American society," Scambray said.  </P> <P> Trecco and assistant editor Luigi Smaldino produce the newspaper for an  estimated 35,000 readers from basement offices in Villa Scalabrini. Up-to-the  minute news and soccer results come from the Italian news wire, ANSA.  Correspondents contribute from overseas and around the state.  </P> <P> L'Italo-Americano is "two papers in one," Trecco said. The Italian-language  section presents news from Italy and the world on the front pages, followed by  U.S. and California news focused on Italian people and events.  </P> <P> Columnists include Hollywood chronicler Argentina Brunetti and "Donna  Carlotta," a mysterious gossip columnist whose targets have included Zsa Zsa  Gabor and comedian Billy Crystal, the latter for a joke he made alluding to  organized crime while hosting the Oscar ceremonies. The statement was condemned  by Italian-American groups.  </P> <P> Donna Carlotta's identity remains top secret despite insistent inquiries by  readers such as Carlo Rambaldi, the Oscar-winning special effects craftsman,  Smaldino said.  </P> <P> The front section attracts immigrants who prefer to read and speak Italian,  even if they have been here for decades. Jenny De Santis, 88, is among older  women who follow weekly excerpts from a historical novel about Sicily.  </P> <P> "I enjoy reading Italian," she said in Italian during a telephone interview.  She said she has lived in this country 66 years. "I've learned to speak  American, but to write," she said, switching to English, "for-getabout."  </P> <P> Advertisers target readers for groceries, legal and medical services,  mortuaries, travel agencies. Trecco said the response shows that an enduring  consumer population prefers to do business in Italian.  </P> <P> "Sometimes advertising becomes for a lot of Italians a recommendation," Trecco  said. "If they are served badly they hold us responsible. We have to be  careful."  </P> <P> Similarly, in the years after the paper's acquisition and switch to nonprofit  status, which prohibits political involvement, readers called in asking for the  political endorsements they had followed during Baroni's time.  </P> <P> Other readers say they want to learn or keep in touch with the language.  Students in Italian classes, such as those of UCLA professor Althea  Caravacci-Reynolds, subscribe at a discount. "It is a good vehicle for  promoting the study of Italian," Caravacci-Reynolds said.  </P> <P> Mark Fabiani, Mayor Tom Bradley's chief of staff, counts himself among  subscribers who struggle through the paper in hopes of improving the Italian  they never quite learned.  </P> <P> "I can read a little bit," said Fabiani, 32. He is the grandson of southern  Italian immigrants and grew up in Pennsylvania. "I do my best every week."  </P> <P> Fabiani then turns to the English-language section, which makes up one-third of  the paper and is geared to younger readers and others looking for information  about community and culture.  </P> <P> Trecco writes an overview in English of Italian politics and prints excerpts of  books on travel and history. Topics range from the government crisis generated  by the kidnap-murder of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in the 1970s, to a local  Sicilian cultural festival, to a film project about the architect of the Watts  Towers, Simon Rodia.  </P> <P> Readership increased with the addition of English, Trecco said, although the  language division is the subject of contention.  </P> <P> One disgruntled former subscriber is Tom Ruatta. He gathers with other senior  citizens of northern Italian origins for bocce matches in the festive, spacious  clubhouse of the Garibaldina M.B. Society in Highland Park, where Italian and  English echo in unison.  </P> <P> Ruatta canceled his subscription because of the predominance of Italian pages.  He thinks the newspaper should bow to the inevitable, switch to English and  appeal to the bulk of the ethnic group.  </P> <P> "That's the reason I quit," he said. "How many of us read Italian? I don't have  time to sit there and try to read it."  </P> <P> Nearby, Secondo Actis demurred. The retired businessman and his wife divide  their time between their native Turin and "Il Vallone," as he calls the San  Fernando Valley. Actis said the paper will not be Italian if it loses the  language.  </P> <P> But he predicted that the language and groups like the Garibaldina, a mutual  benefit society-turned social club with 900 members, are doomed because young  people are not interested.  </P> <P> "We are too spread out," he said in Italian. "In 20, 25 years, when the people  in this place have died, these things will disappear."  </P> <P> This debate about the future of the Italian-American press and community has  taken place around the country.  </P> <P> In Chicago, for example, a city with a more numerous and visible  Italian-American community than Los Angeles, the Fra Noi monthly is thick and  thriving. But it has traditionally devoted only a few pages to Italian and many  pages in English to columns by local politicians.  </P> <P> On the opposite extreme, readers around New York still support an  Italian-language daily, America Oggi.  </P> <P> Caravacci-Reynolds and Scambray said the Los Angeles paper will endure in its  current form because the study of Italian is increasing, spurred by the efforts  of Italian-American organizations and interest on the part of Italians and  non-Italians.  </P> <P> "I think the underlying connection has to be made through the language,"  Scambray said. "We must continue to put pressure on people to read the  language."  </P> <P> Trecco said he sees his mission as fomenting love of the language, but not  necessarily as protecting its survival.  </P> <P> "I think it's destined to disappear as a living language used for everyday  communication in this country," he said. "However I see an increasing need in  the second and third generation of pursuing the study of the language for  cultural reasons."  </P></p>

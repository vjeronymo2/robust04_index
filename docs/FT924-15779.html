			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japanese banks meet capital ratios JAPAN'S leading banks heaved a collective sigh of relief yesterday as a combination of slower asset growth, a stronger yen and higher stock prices lifted them above an 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio at the close of the first half. The 8 per cent figure is a virtual obsession for the banks, which have come to regard the capital adequacy standards established by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) as an important test of their soundness and a serious matter of face. Sakura Bank, which had been at 7.56 per cent last September, apparently finished this September at around 8.2 per cent, due mostly to the surge in stock prices that accompanied recent emergency economic measures. Most other commercial banks are believed to have closed the half at above 8.5 per cent, while long-term credit banks, such as the Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, were close to or above 9 per cent. Official figures will be released in tandem with profit figures in coming weeks. Japanese banks are allowed to count some of their unrealised gains on stocks as capital, but the weakness of stock prices this year had prompted them to find other, sometimes cosmetic, means of improving their BIS ratios. They increased subordinated loans from Japanese insurance companies, which can also be counted as a form of capital, and they closely monitored the growth of their assets. Regional banks, some of which have strong capital-to-asset ratios, reported that commercial banks approached them wanting to sell loans. The regional Bank of Japan manager said it was sometimes unclear whether these loans had been permanently sold or whether they had merely been 'parked' with the regional banks with a view to retrieving them later, if stock prices improved. At the same time, Japanese banks have strictly limited foreign lending activities. Determination to improve BIS ratios comes in spite of the absence of sanctions for banks that fail to meet the requirements next March. It would be left to the Ministry of Finance to take action, and in these difficult times the ministry would be unlikely to punish a deficient bank. While the banks were happy yesterday that their ratios were above the embarrassment threshold, they are concerned that stock prices again appear to be drifting lower and that market turnover has been weak in recent days. Mr Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, said that if stock prices remain at 'these levels', with the Nikkei index at around 17,300, 'there will be no problem' next March. He said leading Japanese banks were were not denying their customers loans, as had been feared, but they were aware that the rapid growth of the 1980s cannot could not be repeated in a mature banking market. 'We had 15 per cent growth for three or four years in a row. We can't do that any more. For top banks, the figure will be 2 to 3 per cent from now on,' Mr Kurosawa said.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (29): The packaging of pleasure - Management FOR GOD, COUNTRY AND COCA-COLA by Mark Pendergrast Charles Scribner's/Maxwell Macmillan International Dollars 27.50, 556pp WHO WOULD have ever believed that a fizzy, sugary water could become the world's most ubiquitous consumer product and turn the company that makes it into a gold mine? That is the question that underlies Mark Pendergrast's book. His answer, like authors before him, is that Coca-Cola's leaders have been shrewder than most for seeing the power of innovative, often ground-breaking advertising to hype this soft drink to its exalted status of world brand. But what distinguishes Pendergrast's account is that it is painstakingly well-researched and, for the most part, cleverly written. The book has touched off some controversy because of Pendergrast's claim that he inadvertently found the original Coca-Cola formula, an invention of Georgia pharmacist John Pemberton in the 1880s. Given that the formula is one of the world's best-kept commercial secrets, Pendergrast's discovery of the formula in an old file in the company's own library seems an extraordinary coup. The company, naturally, suggests that the recipe he found is not genuine. The book is full of telling anecdotes about Coke's inventor and early leaders, Asa Candler and Robert Woodruff. It seems that Pemberton concocted the drink, with a small amount of cocaine and a greater dose of caffeine, largely as a remedy for his morphine habit. Candler, a miserly Atlanta entrepreneur, was the first to see the potential of what was then just a patent medicine that gave a lift to the consumer and relieved Candler's own headaches. By 1888, he acquired the rights to it, not entirely honestly, from the many parties to whom these were dispersed by Pemberton. He quickly transformed the medicine into a popular soft drink. But its popularity soon had a price. Public campaigns against products with cocaine forced Candler to take the kick out of the drink by 1903. Robert Woodruff, a crackerjack salesman and Coca-Cola's leader until the early 1980s, is the man who made it a worldwide phenomenon. In his greatest move, Woodruff manoeuvered to obtain Washington's blessing to manufacture Coke around the globe for American soldiers during the second world war, thus laying the groundwork for Coke's empire today. But the book is lamentably shorter on insightful details about Coca-Cola's current chairman, Roberto Goizueta, the Cuban-born chemical engineer who took over in 1981. He shares the same limitless vision for Coke as his predecessors; he once mused: 'Perhaps coming years will see a time when consumers will have Coca-Cola taps in their homes.' Goizueta was responsible for the biggest gaff in the company's history, the attempt in the mid-1980s to alter Coke's formula. Yet Goizueta emerged unscathed from the New Coke disaster, perhaps not least because he had enlivened the company's performance for its shareholders. The book is not all dinner party fodder and praise for Coke. It evenhandedly reveals the seamier episodes of the company's history, including its accommodation to Hitler, apartheid and Guatemalan death squads as well as its shoddy treatment of its migrant workers. It is worth reading for those who want a history, in Pendergrast's words, of the 'modern American attempt to package pleasure.'</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Toxic clean-up breakthrough THE UK Atomic Energy Authority claims that a new process it has patented can render toxic chemicals harmless. AEA Technology acknowledges that the high costs involved in the 'silver two' technique - developed at the Dounreay Nuclear Establishment in Scotland - may initially limit its market. It said: 'There is no doubt that there is potential but it's still in its demonstration stage and is very expensive. But we hope to be able to make it commercially viable.' The authority is unsure when the process might reach commercial production. It has secured patent cover in the UK, Europe and North America - an application is pending in Japan. The technique reduces a range of toxic chemicals to their basic elements - principally carbon dioxide and water - without high-temperature burning, until now the only means of destroying them. The AEA said the 'solvent destruction rig' could dispose of plastic explosives, nerve gases, other chemical and biological weapon compounds and toxic polychlorinated biphenyls - created in a wide range of industrial activities including hydraulic fluid manufacturing and solvent recovery. The electro-chemical process uses silver dissolved in nitro-acid, and also platinum, hence the high costs.</p>

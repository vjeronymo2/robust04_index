			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Court sources reported  today that Peruvian citizen Jorge Diaz Reategui, who was  detained a week ago in the Argentine city of Tucuman, has  admitted being a former member of the Shining Path [SL] Maoist  group.    In a joint operation on 9 June, Tucuman police and Argentine  Federal Police detained Diaz Reategui, 36, at a hotel in  Tucuman, 1,412 km northwest of Buenos Aires. He had been meeting  with 10 fellow countrymen, who managed to escape.    Tucuman Federal Judge Ricardo Maturana, who is hearing the  case, asked the Interpol office in Peru to deny or confirm Diaz  Reategui's testimony.    The sources noted: "Diaz Reategui coordinated his visit with  his followers. They probably crossed the border on forged  certificates of residence and visas from Paraguay to Argentina,  via Buenos Aires, from where they traveled to other provincial  capitals like Cordoba, Jujuy, Salta, and Tucuman."    The court sources added that the Peruvian Upper Huallaga  region, where the former Shining Path member was operating, "is  a region where the world's largest coca plantations exist, a  region where cocaine paste is processed and subsequently refined  for marketing by the Colombian `cartels.'"    The Argentine Federal Police Press Division added that the  Shining Path cell, of which Diaz Reategui was a member, "had  been tracked for about one year."    The Tucuman police are still tracking the other 10 people  who  accompanied Diaz Reategui on the day of his arrest and are  attempting to determine what the former Shining Path member and  his followers were doing in Tucuman and in other provinces.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (8): Fabulous wealth 'not essential' - Because Guernsey is a small place with not a lot of cultural amenities, many rentiers feel a need to leave the island from time to time / Profile: John Schute WITH a mane of grey hair and a neat, six-button blue blazer, Mr John Schute looks every inch the archetypal expatriate who could be found in any number of outposts around the world over which the Union Jack once flew. One of the first things he is at pains to point out, however, is that he is not an average rentier. 'I would say I am an atypical rentier. I attend all the debates in the States (parliament). I am very involved in local issues. Also, I am not rich.' After some thought, he adds: 'Actually, it is probably a bit misleading to say I am atypical because I do not think there is such a thing as a typical rentier on Guernsey. On Jersey, yes, there is an identifiable set. It is a bit flashier over there.' Mr Schute, 55, came to Guernsey by way of Jersey. A former Fleet Street news photographer and representative for the Magnum photographic agency, he left Fleet Street to join his British parents who were living in Portugal. There he became involved in property development. When his father died, he and his mother wanted to settle elsewhere. They moved to Jersey in 1968. After a year, they moved to Guernsey and bought a Georgian-style house where he still lives. He says: 'You do not have to be fabulously wealthy to live on Guernsey. My house was bought for Pounds 12,000.' He now estimates that it is worth Pounds 700,000-Pounds 800,000. It his main asset. He says he has a little bit of investment income. He still takes photographs for various publications and he is an accomplished painter of water colours. He sells paintings from time to time. His companion of 20 years, Jennifer, has a good job in management at one of the banks. 'A lot of people who you would class as rentiers are in a similar position to us; some assets but also a regular salary coming in', he says. He adds that there obviously are some very wealthy people on the island, but says: 'You would be hard put to say who they were if you did not know beforehand. There are few obvious trappings of wealth. You will not see many Rolls-Royce motor cars.' Mr Schute says there are a 'remarkable number' of clubs covering everything from yachting, to tennis to bridge. But he adds: 'There is not a central colonial-style club or watering hole where expatriates exclusively foregather. Everything is very integrated on the island.' One of Guernsey's continuing attractions, as far as he is concerned, is the high level of services. 'There are very good doctors, dentists and hospitals. Everything works here.' He has one small quibble about the settler life. Guernsey is a small place with not a lot of cultural amenities and he, like other rentiers, does feel a need to leave the island from time to time. He says: 'Jennifer misses London. We go there about every two months. You can be in London in two hours and it is not too expensive.'</p>

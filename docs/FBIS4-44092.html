			<p>BFN     [Text] President Mitterrand spoke from Corfu, where he is  attending the EU [European Union] summit, about the French  intervention in Rwanda. Journalists asked the president if  France had received enough backing from the international  community.    [Begin Mitterrand recording] Enough, yes. There is a major  difference between saying nothing and expressing support. When  we asked the question, they all told us that they supported the  French initiative. Now, you will ask me, are they supporting us  by dispatching soldiers? Some will answer a call for logistical  support, others are perhaps getting ready to supply troops,  others, it depends. This is not only specific to the Twelve,  proposals also came from Africa and from a few other countries.    First of all, the deployment of equipment and troops took  place in excellent conditions; it was very well organized. The  move into Rwandan territory often took place with the very warm  agreement of the people, if I can trust what you journalists are  writing as well as our own information. [end recording]</p>

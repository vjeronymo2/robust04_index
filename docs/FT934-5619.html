			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: A modest shift from caution to confidence - London The London stock market is moving into its first autumn Budget week in a mood which turned confident last week, on the surface at least. The FT-SE 100 Share Index regained the 3,100 mark as the market made a belated response to the unexpected cut in UK base rates, and to the better news on the domestic economy and inflation trends. Much of the improvement was rooted in the derivatives markets, where a very modest shift from caution to confidence was enough to propel the December contract sharply upwards. Traders believe the new money was coming mainly from overseas funds, for which the Footsie future is but one of a range of global investment opportunities. There may have been some contribution from the newly-established Lloyds investment funds. Traders believe that one overseas fund was putting about Pounds 250m into UK equities via derivatives last week. If the new Lloyds funds are indeed active in UK equities, then a further Pounds 800m or so could be in the offing. The question this morning will be whether the upturn in the futures continues. The December contract has established itself as a highly liquid and tradeable instrument for investors in a hurry, but this has a downside potential: money in can become money out very quickly. Technical pressures played a part in futures at the end of last week. UK funds, and marketmaking firms, had been inclined to take defensive stances ahead of the Budget. The appearance of buyers for the futures caught the locals, or independent traders, on the wrong foot, and their efforts to buy ahead of the trend merely drove prices yet higher. All hinges on whether the optimists continue to direct the equity market. With the Budget rate cut now pre-empted, the UK fund managers have braced themselves for an uncomfortable Budget, incorporating perhaps Pounds 3bn in tax rises. These domestic institutions did not show much sign of changing their minds last week. Now that there are fears that the Budget may bear down on consumers, fund managers were beginning to focus on protecting the paper profits achieved earlier in the year in these sectors. The run-up to the first of the unified Budget speeches has been characterised by an unwillingness by investors to take up speculative positions. The Budget could affect a wide range of investment possibilities for investors' liking: advance corporation tax, VAT, excise duties, mira, personal pension schemes. It's better to lie low, think the managers, and wait for base rates to be cut again after Mr Kenneth Clarke has returned to his lair. None of this has discouraged UK equity strategists from their relatively favourable year-end predictions on the market. This week could be make or break time for forecasts that the Footsie will close around 3,200 this year, let alone for those still adding 300 points on to that figure.</p>

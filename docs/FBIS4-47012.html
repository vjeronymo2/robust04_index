			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. Andreyeva, GUDOK correspondent in Tynda: </F> "BAM: Life as a Loan"]    [Text] Can one be a destitute billionaire? It turns out  that one can. Last year the Baykal-Amur railroad received about  40 billion rubles in profit and has not been able to pay even  half of its taxes because of... a lack of funds. Where has the  money gone?    In general, was there any? Part of the profit, strange as it  may seem, existed only on paper--in financial reports and  accounts. The fact is that the railroad was in debt. Instead of  settlements the senders of freight gave promises but put off  fulfilling them and by the middle of January they had owed R30.8  billion already, of which R25 billion was by the Yakutugol  Production Association alone. And there was almost no hope that  the debts would be recovered. In January, it is true, one  managed to get R12 billion from the coal-miners. But in March  the railroad people were forced to suspend the shipment of  export coal for 20 days in order to make Yakutugol cough up the  money. Then a meeting, God knows how many in succession there  have been, of the related enterprises took place and the leaders  of the association signed the usual pledge that the moment "they  unfreeze" a million dollars for them in Vneshekonombank they  will settle up with the railroad then and there. However they  have not kept the promise. And subsequently they have positively  announced that they will not pay last year's debts. They say,  let the railroad recover them from the Russian government, which  has not settled accounts with the coal-miners for deliveries of  fuel to the national economy.    What's to be done? To again stop the shipment of coal? But  no  one will get more money from this. What is to be done with the  improper clients who don't want to pay for shipments? The  simplest thing, of course, is to refuse to do business with  them. But where to get others? There are only two types of local  freight on the BAM--coal and timber. There's no choice, but one  also cannot accept the existing state of affairs. The railroad  people are not so rich as to grant credit to the coal industry  free of charge.    Attempts were made from the top to break the vicious circle  of non-payments. A critical situation had developed in the power  system of the Far East in December of last year. With a daily  requirement of 85,000 tons of coal, the electric power stations  were receiving almost two times less.    And money was found right away. Preferential loans were  issued, and the heads of administration were ordered to pay for  fuel and electric power first of all. Its consumers have begun  to pay the railroads for the shipment of coal. BAM has received  its share from Khabarovskenergo--R5 billion.    However, the cold weather has passed and, probably, it's no  use to count on new financial infusions before next winter.  Meanwhile Khabarovsk Kray alone has owed the coal-miners of  South Yakutia R16 billion (of which half is to BAM for  transportation).    Having realized that they won't get this money, the  coal-miners have applied for help to the government of the Sakha  Republic (Yakutia) and it has warned the administration of  Khabarovsk Kray that, in view of the non-payments, it is  discontinuing the shipment of coal beginning 1 June. But, you  see, if one doesn't stockpile fuel in the summer misfortune  awaits in the winter. It's no laughing matter to freeze enormous  Khabarovsk! The kray authorities are now in a panic. They have  appealed to the government of Russia for help, but if they do  help, will the next multi-billion injection be enough for the  long haul?    The meaning of the recommendations of the December collegium  of the Ministry of Railways boiled down to the well-known  formula: the rescuing of the drowning is the concern of the arms  of the drowning themselves. But how is one to be saved if the  impoverished related enterprises are dragged to the bottom?  Moreover, BAM is the easiest to "sink": it has another heavy  stone around its neck--social-cultural and everyday services.    So it has now developed that not the local authorities but  the railroad people have become the bosses on the more than  3,000 kilometer route. They support everything  themselves--housing, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, cultural  institutions. And such costly structures as boiler houses with  heating systems besides. Last year some R14 billion were spent  for the maintenance of housing and municipal services. Plus a  half billion for the maintenance of clubs. Add to this help to  departmental public health services and public education in the  form of price discounts for heat, water, and electric power. And  this also cost a good deal--on the order of R5 billion. In  short, more than 16 percent of the profit has gone for "the  administrative baggage train." Is this a lot or a little?  Suffice it to say that it is the monthly wage of the entire  railroad collective.    What is more, the railroad itself is unfinished. And,  despite  the pertinent edicts of the president and decrees of the  government, construction is being wretchedly financed. As of  today the government has owed R44 billion for work performed on  BAM's title list. Of which R10 billion is for last year. Like it  or not, the road has had to invest its own funds. About R2  billion has gone just for preparing the main boiler house of the  city of Tynda, where an additional boiler has been installed,  for the winter. If the money had not been given the installation  would have been disrupted and BAM's capital could have been left  without heat in 50 degrees of frost. Will the money spent be  recovered? Hardly.    There are even greater losses. Last year the road failed to  receive about R70 billion of the financing quota allotted to it  by the ministry. More than half of it was money which other  roads should have given. Consider it lost! And if there would  have been these billions BAM would have paid wages to its  workers on time and settled up for fuel and rolling stock  repair. Tens of cars today stand repaired at the plants--there's  nothing to redeem them with.    The Baykal-Amur can become completely bankrupt. This has not  happened as yet. Revenues from transport operations last year  have amounted to R225.6 billion, which is almost R20 billion  higher than the plan. Operating costs have been cut by R14.5  billion. A profit from subsidiary and auxiliary operations more  than five and a half times greater than planned has been  received. And almost a billion more has been earned from the  sale of goods and services.    However, as we already know, a part of these billions has  remained on paper. But then taxes have been charged to the full  extent: R23 billion to the territorial and local budgets.  However, the railroad has paid only 10 and 13 has remained due.  It would have been fair to divide revenues into real and "paper"  and to take the tax from the real revenues. But, probably, this  doesn't suit the authorities: it is easier to speak with the  debtors. Incidentally, the railroad will pay a penalty of  several billions for not paying taxes on time.    And apart from the main tax, so to speak, there are a great  many petty ones. For example, until recently the local  authorities have exacted a tax for the maintenance of the  housing fund. A nice thing for a smart operator: to exact a tax  for housing from the railroad people who maintain it themselves!  But one had to endure an entire "war" until they temporarily  removed this tax. Take again the transportation tax (1 percent  of the wage fund). Also a considerable amount of money, even  though it would have to be paid, the wrong way round, in  addition. Last year suburban transport operations yielded losses  of almost a half million. On many roads these losses are  partially cleared off from the local budget. Here the  authorities don't do that despite all the appeals of the  railroad's management. They say: you haul your own railroad  people--there are no other passengers here.    The railroad for some reason pays for everything:  maintenance  of municipal militia, civic improvements, for property and for  land. The one tax on highways alone has lightened its pocket  last year by R2 billion. That's just robbery!    BAM passes through the territories of two national  republics,  several krays and oblasts and everywhere they have their own  procedures. In one republic, for example, they tear off a  further family and municipal tax. Well, okay, if for this money  the local authorities would take on themselves at least part of  the responsibilities. No such thing. Practically the entire  survival of the enormous route is on the shoulders of the road  itself. In 1993 it incurred more than R2 billion in losses from  the operation of workers' supply departments at line stations.  One can close the stores and get rid of these expenditures but  then the employees of small stations will have nowhere even to  buy bread.    This problem doesn't trouble the municipalities and the  municipal councils much. Just as also the fate of the doctors  and teachers working in departmental hospitals and schools who  haven't received their wages for several months. They should be  financed from the federal budget. However, last year only 30  percent of the funds needed were allocated. The railroad has  again paid the debts of the state.    Is it up to carrying such enormous expenditures? True, it  coped up till now. However, now the situation has changed. The  volumes of transport operations have fallen. During the first  quarter the shipment of freight has come to 88.5 percent of last  year's level and freight turnover--89.9 percent. With such  indicators, of course, it's not worth waiting for last year's  revenues. And if one also further considers the chronic  inability to pay of the clients, whose debts are growing day by  day, then a "trap" threatens the road from which it can't get  out.    The management is doing everything possible. It has appealed  with letters and held talks with the heads of oblast  administrations and with the governments of the republics about  the reduction of local taxes and subsidization of the social  sphere in connection with the difficult financial situation in  which BAM finds itself today. You can't imagine the humiliating  situation: the railroad giant begs for help! And the results  don't give too much hope--the authorities also plead the lack of  funds.    Where is the money if the authorities don't have it? The  impression is that nowadays nobody pays anybody anything. During  the first quarter the railroad has an income from transport  operations of R211.5 bilion, but has received only R118.3  billion in "live" money all told. It has not been able to  collect a whole R35 billion from debtors and its own ministry  has undersupplied the rest. There they say: you demand the debts  from the clients better! But how to demand if they are bankrupts  almost. We have already begun to take their products on the  debt's account. Last year we took from the timber cutters and  sold more than a thousand cars of timber (70,000 cubic meters).  We exchanged it for fuel, materials, spare parts, and consumer  goods. We have received more than 30,000 tons of coal from the  coal-miners and shipped it for export.    Such a form of operation is being effectively utilized this  year as well. Contracts regarding coal and timber have been  concluded with foreign firms and the near abroad. But the fact  is that this posture will not save everyone. Barter will hardly  help one to carry out summer track work and prepare the  railroad's system for the winter. "Live" money is needed here  and there is none. The crumbs that fall from time to time go  entirely for wages. The road is living on credit; moreover, its  debts have already exceeded R40 billion. Can one really live  this way?    No, BAM won't be able to manage without state support,  without the help of the ministry. Two simple figures convince  one of this: the volume of transport operations and of freight  turnover here are half that on any neighboring mainline but the  production cost is three times higher. The railroad is expensive  but give it a normal workload and it will pay for itself.    The BAM people are not to blame for the fact that the  construction of the mainline has far outstripped the development  of the region. They are even trying to force it somehow. Thus,  the Baykal-Amur has become a stock-holder of the Amurtitan firm,  which has begun the development of a major deposit of ores. This  will yield a freight flow and good dividends for the capital  invested. Moreover, the railroad people are participating on  shares in the development of a coal deposit in South Yakutia  with the production and sale of 150,000 tonnes this year and  300,000 tonnes each starting next year. The work for the  "wheels" will be not bad.    There are also other enterprises of which the railroad is  the  co-founder, thereby creating clientele for itself. The prospects  here are great, for BAM's territory represents four Frances and  there are sufficient mineral resources here. But, unfortunately,  in the present situation of lack of money all these riches are  "dead capital": "there's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip."    State protectionism is needed, of course, as is accepted in  all civilized countries with respect to northern territories or  territories under development. The state should reduce or  altogether exempt a new construction railroad from the tax  burden for a time and provide preferential loans--to give the  giant an opportunity to survive and to stand on its own feet, in  order to assure itself "growth" in the future. And this  certainly needs to be taken into account in the new long-term  state program for the development of the eastern regions of  Russia which is now being developed in the government. Without  this any, even the most sensible, program will prove to be only  "a straw in the hands of a drowning man."</p>

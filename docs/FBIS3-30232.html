Andrzej Olechowski, minister of foreign affairs,  said at a news conference in Warsaw that from now on we would  have new rights.    [Olechowski] "Poland, not only because of its aspirations  but  also in the institutional sense, occupies a specific place in  Europe. It is now joining the countries which have decided to  achieve a historic task, rare on our continent, namely to get  integrated into one body. The form which this body should take  has, of course, been a subject of discussions. From now on, we  shall also be able to influence this discussion and we shall be  able to express our views on the future shape of the continent."    [Announcer] Now over to the minister of foreign economic  cooperation, Leslaw Podkanski.    [Podkanski] "The preliminary agreement which expires today  will be replaced by the Association Treaty, which gives us  guarantees for the continuity of principles and conditions of  trade between Poland and the [European] Community. The  fundamental objective is to create in the next few years a  free-trade zone for our state and the [European] Community  states. The treaty, however, does not give the final ruling on  the issue of agricultural products and fish."    [Announcer] When assessing the two-year transitional period,  from the moment of signing until the moment when the Association  Treaty comes into force, Minister Leslaw Podkanski said that at  present almost three quarters of our exports find their way onto  the EC market without any duties being levied. The minister  added that until now a quarter of goods imported to Poland from  the EC had been duty free. Minister Leslaw Podkanski:    [Podkanski] "As of 1 January 1995 we shall be able to export  all goods duty free, apart from textiles and metallurgical  products. When it comes to our concessions with regard to  allowing EC goods onto the Polish market, from 1 January 1995 to  1 January 1999 we shall have to carry out a proportional  reduction in the duties levied on all industrial goods, which  are still in force."    [Announcer] Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, the government  plenipotentiary for European integration:    [Saryusz-Wolski] "A whole package of agreements is coming  into force. They concern not only a free flow of goods but also  of services, capital and people, although people to a lesser  extent. The association institutions are starting to function as  well. This should put us in a better position to negotiate and  improve the treaty further."    [Announcer] Our full membership in the European Union will  complete the process of association. It is, however, not known  yet when this will happen, Minister Andrzej Olechowski pointed  out.    [Olechowski] "We have in this respect an unequivocal  declaration from Copenhagen which says that it is in the  interest of both sides that Poland should become a member of the  European Union. For this reason it is a duty of both Poland and  the European Union that Poland should become a member, and that  this should happen in our lifetime. A schedule of specific  steps will be needed for this purpose. We shall make efforts  for such a schedule to emerge."    [Announcer] The minister of foreign affairs, Andrzej  Olechowski, said that at the meeting of the Council of Ministers  tomorrow he would ask the council to authorize Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak to sign during his forthcoming visit to  Brussels, an agreement on Poland's membership in the Partnership  for Peace program.    [Olechowski] "The decision concerning the prime minister's  signing the document, which is an invitation to the Partnership  for Peace [program], will be taken by the Council of Ministers  tomorrow. If we look at the decisions made by the Council of  Ministers so far, such an authorization will certainly be  formulated. The Council of Ministers has already expressed its  support for the Partnership for Peace [initiative] and Poland's  willingness to take active part in this program."    [Announcer] Krystyna Koziol was the author of this report  from the press conference.</p>

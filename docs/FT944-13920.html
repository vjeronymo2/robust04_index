			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Ownership of pension surplus is questioned A comprehensive biennial review of UK accounting, published this week, questions whether pension-fund surpluses really belong to employers. The report, by Ernst and Young, the accountants, is based on detailed examination of the accounts of 500 leading companies. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which reviews in 1,600 pages company compliance with reporting standards, calls on the Accounting Standards Board to reform the present code on pension funds. The report says: 'It is not evident, as a matter of either law or economic reality, that employers can regard pension fund surpluses as their own unfettered property.' Mr Ron Paterson, a technical partner with Ernst and Young, and one of the authors, said: 'It is a difficult legal and moral question as to who owns the surplus on a pension fund.' At present a company is entitled to show the surplus on a pension fund as an asset on the balance sheet but the report insists that in practice the scheme members can generally exert a claim over the surpluses 'to some degree'. The report concludes that in the light of the Maxwell affair, and the review of the legal framework for pensions following the Goode Report, the code for accounting for pensions, known as SSAP 24, should be reviewed. The authors say: 'The ASB should reassess whether the standard really fits the legal and economic relationships which it is intended to portray.' The report contains criticisms of some of the ASB's other standards. Mr Paterson said: 'The board has grasped some nettles with vigour - but it is not always as efficient as it might be. However, the general standard of accounting is improving because of their efforts.' The report adds, however: 'We are afraid that the ASB may be outrunning the capacity of the accounting profession to absorb and apply these new and often difficult rules. 'Both the content of future standards and the pace of their development need to be less ambitious, or else a gulf might develop between theory and practice, particularly in relation to small companies.' The report criticises the ASB over - Financial Reporting Standard 7, on fair values following an acquisition. While acknowledging that this will reduce significant abuses it says the standard was produced in haste and 'a number of issues have been ducked'. The authors also attack FRS 5, on representing the substance of a business in the accounts rather than following the legal form, as 'daunting' and 'elaborate'. It says the standard may encourage lawyers and merchant banks to search for gaps in the standard to justify their accounts. Mr Allan Cooke, technical director at the ASB, said that a discussion paper on the future of SSAP 24 was due to appear in the first quarter of next year. He said that while there were valid concerns about abuses of SSAP 24 the essence of many pensions schemes was that the employer took the balance of the costs and there-fore had a claim on any surplus. He added that during the preparation of FRS 5 extensive consultation had taken place, including with the 'big six' accountancy firms, and that the consensus had been for the inclusion of complex 'application notes'.</p>

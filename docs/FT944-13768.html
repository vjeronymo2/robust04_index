			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: IAWS exceeds expectations IAWS, the Irish animal feed and fertiliser group, yesterday reported a 27 per cent improvement in annual profits. The pre-tax line rose from IPounds 10.1m to IPounds 12.8m (Pounds 12.6m) on turnover up 19 per cent to IPounds 479.5m. The figures, which exceeded most brokers' forecasts, reflected good performances by key operations in Ireland and contributions from recent UK acquisitions. The group, 64 per cent-owned by the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society co-operative, had turnover of IPounds 156m in Britain, which included the first full year contribution from Pertwee and Parson, two fertiliser businesses bought in 1992. There was also a half year contribution from Nordos, a fishmeal company purchased in February for IPounds 2m. The Irish operations, which include the manufacture of food ingredients, animal feed and fertiliser blending and distribution, all performed well, according to Mr David Martin, finance director. Cash flow from operating activities was IPounds 23.5m, allowing the group to reduce borrowings from IPounds 9.5m to IPounds 1.9m, bringing interest charges down from IPounds 5.9m to IPounds 4.56m. Gearing stands at 4 per cent. Both the Nordos purchase and a IPounds 3.2m acquisition in July of the Malting Company of Ireland were funded out of cash flow and further bolt-on acquisitions in Britain, funded in the same way, are being considered, Mr Martin added. IAWS is carrying out due diligence on United Fish Products in Scotland, for which it has bid IPounds 11.8m. Earnings per share were up 16 per cent to 8.7p; a proposed final dividend of 1.265p lifts the total by 15 per cent to 2.415p.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: A new regime for Fisons FT-SE Index: 2,516.3 (+26.2) The rise in Fisons' share price in response to the abrupt departure of Mr John Kerridge is thought-provoking. Mr Kerridge and the City had not seen eye to eye for years; most recently, he has borne responsibility for blunders in the US. But he is also the man who rescued Fisons and brought it to a pitch of operating efficiency over the past decade. He leaves the company searching for a chief executive and in the presumably temporary hands of a non-pharmaceuticals executive from Unilever. The sanguine view of the market can perhaps be justified on two counts. First, the great drawback about Fisons as an investment under Mr Kerridge was its lack of disclosure. The more open approach promised by his successor should be worth something on the price in itself. Second, Mr Kerridge was opposed to the idea of merger. Conceivably, that might change as well. But there is room for caution here. The notion of Fisons being the target of a hostile bid was always very doubtful. Even in the world of drug giants, a starting market capitalisation of Pounds 2.5bn is a formidable proposition, particularly since Pounds 2.1bn of that consists of goodwill. An agreed deal with - for example  - ICI might have its attractions; but mergers are by their nature harder to bring off. Then again, the shares are perhaps attractive even without a deal. They have recently taken their worst hammering since the dark days of the 1970s, for reasons which are public and quantifiable; and even Fisons' harshest critics never denied the underlying quality of the business.</p>

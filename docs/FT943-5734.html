			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): A purer way with seawater Few arid countries can justify the cost of using water purified through conventional desalination techniques for agriculture. Light Works, a London-based company sponsored by the EC, has addressed this problem by developing what it believes is a cost-effective system for producing crops and pure water in hot coastal regions. Its prototype greenhouse, which has been built on Tenerife, uses surplus heat to evaporate sea water, which is purified by being passed through a heat exchanger cooled by cold sea water. It yields sufficient surplus water to water the crops within the greenhouse and irrigate the immediate surrounding area. Light Works: UK, tel 071 249 3627; fax 071 254 0306</p>

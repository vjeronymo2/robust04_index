			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MUSEUM PIECE  </P> <P> Ishi, the last aboriginal Indian in North America, who became an  anthropological wonder when discovered in 1911, will be the subject of a  feature film and a PBS documentary -- both projects funded by the National  Endowment for the Humanities. Berkeley-based filmmaker Jed Riffe hopes to begin  his unusual double filming late this year, with writer-director Avery Crounse  adapting Theodora Kroeber's book, "Ishi, the Last Yahi."  </P> <P> A television movie, "Ishi, the Last of His Tribe," aired in 1979 on NBC, and  another Kroeber book, "Ishi in Two Worlds," has been previously announced as a  film project, but never made. Riffe tells us Crounse has done "extensive  original research" beyond existing material that will shed new light on Ishi's  remarkable life.  </P> <P> The middle-aged Ishi had lived undetected by whites until he was encountered  near Oroville, Calif., in 1911, the last survivor of his tribe. Until his death  from tuberculosis five years later, he lived in San Francisco's Museum of  Anthropology, where thousands lined up to see him as he devoted his last years  to passing on his tribe's history.  </P> <P> Despite his strange situation, Riffe says, "Ishi never lost his own sense of  self, his uniqueness. Even though he lived in a museum, he maintained his  spirit.  </P> <P> "His is a story of someone who lost everything, but never lost himself." John  M. Wilson  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION  </P> <P> To all the pro-choice feminists and their followers: Please stop hiding behind  those masks of concerned groups for the poor and needy women to legalize  abortion. Besides, babies don't kill their mothers on the abortion tables, it  is the mother and her supporters who kill the baby. We can't close our eyes and  ears to individual responsibility. This responsibility does not depend on  taxpayers' money but only on the active consciousness of each individual: women  and men alike.  </P> <P> The poor and needy women, as well as the aborted babies, are only scapegoats,  an excuse for our hardened hearts and very rational minds. If we truly want to  protect our individual rights, then let's stop depending on the government's  money and let's start doing something by our own free choice, like teaching our  children at home about love and respect for human life, for one another and,  especially, for our own bodies, minds and hearts. Only when we give that love  and respect to ourselves can we expect the same from the others.  </P> <P> May God help us all in this battle for innocent lives.  </P> <P> ZULEMA G. HOKANSON  </P> <P> Olivenhain  </P></p>

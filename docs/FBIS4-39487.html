			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, 30 May-5 Jun 94] </F>   [Text] During the 27 May through 1 June period 311.9  million cu. m. of Turkmen natural gas were piped to Ukraine  instead of the planned 384.5 million cu. m. amount.    According to Ukrgazprom's maintenance-dispatching service,  in  this way 1,207.6 million cu. m. of natural gas failed to be  piped to Ukraine, as of early June.    Meanwhile, Russia's natural gas exporter has kept piping  extra amounts of natural gas to Ukraine. Thus, within the 27  May-1 June period Russia exported 2,869.9 million cu. m. of  natural gas, almost 42 million cu. m. of which were in excess of  the agreed amount. All-in-all, 541.5 million cu. m. of extra  natural gas amounts were piped to Ukraine, as of early June 1994.    According to Yevgeni Sukhin, first deputy chairperson of the  Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas, Russia's stable  supplies allowed Ukrgazprom to store about 17 b. cu. m. of  natural gas in underground facilities by late May, some portion  of which stock will belong to Ukraine. As Yevgeni Sukhin  maintains, if Russia and Turkmenistan continue their supplies at  present rates, Ukraine will be able to catch up with its gas  storaging schedule, currently keeping at an over forthnight's  time-lag, which is about 25 per cent lower versus 1993's  respective amount, though it will be a hard job.    Ukraine's domestic gas consumption has been much lower, than  normally with late May's averaged daily consumption rate of 195  million cu. m. versus April's 240 million cu. m. According to  Mr. Sukhin, April's gas consumption cost Ukraine $7 million a  day with 1,000 cu. m. of natural gas priced at $50, even  considering Ukraine's domestic extraction of 50 million cu. m.  of the above amount. Gas transit piping charges cost Ukraine  additional $50 million.    January's daily consumption of natural gas was as high as  320  million cu. m. During the 27 May-1 June period of 1994,  Ukrainian domestic consumers utilized 979 million cu. m. of  natural gas versus the planned 1,319.5 million cu. m. figure.  According to Ukrgazprom, 2,150.1 million cu. m. of natural gas  was saved to be piped to reserve stocks, due to suspended gas  supplies to debtor- enterprises.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Jose Paulo Tupynamba] </F>   [Excerpts] Belem -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim  yesterday requested that rich countries supply greater resources  with which to fight narcotics trafficking. He made this request  at a news conference held after delivering his closing speech at  the 24th OAS General Assembly in this, the capital city of Para  State. Amorim noted that because funding for drug enforcement  operations is very limited in Brazil, it is very important for  our country to receive financial cooperation from countries  where drugs are consumed.    Amorim said: Drug-producing countries are receiving  resources to implement alternative crops. Yet countries that  are being used as drug routes have not received the same kind of  support. [passage omitted]    Amorim also emphasized the significance of the  Ibero-American  summit scheduled to open next week in Colombia, and especially  the presence there of the heads of government of Spain and  Portugal, which are member countries of the European Union and  leading counterparts in our trade talks with Europe.    Amorim said: The path to follow appears to be one marked by  greater trade liberalization between the European Union and  Latin American subregional groups, the Common Market of the  South included.

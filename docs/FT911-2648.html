			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Letter: Car tax, the industrial damage and the illogicality (1): Sir, Your feature on the problems facing the British motor industry arising from government economic policies (April 24) mentions the negative effect of the special car tax on the industry. The Transport and General Workers' Union - the largest trade union in the UK car industry - is launching a campaign to persuade the government to scrap this tax, which is jeopardising thousands of motor manufacturing jobs. The car tax is levied in addition to VAT on all new passenger cars at a rate of 10 per cent of the wholesale price. This adds about 8.3 per cent to the recommended retail price. Together with VAT, the effective rate of tax on new cars is therefore 27.5 per cent in the UK, compared to 22 per cent in France and just 14 per cent in Germany. Abolition of the tax would help the industry at a time when help is most needed, with the recession hitting demand and hence employment. The revenue lost to the government through the abolition of the tax would, I believe, be largely made up through additional VAT receipts and petrol tax consequent on more new car sales. Of course, the TGWU's interest is in the first place in protecting the jobs of the thousands of our members in the industry, which the recession is currently putting at risk. We recognise that this can only be done by helping the industry on to a better competitive footing. The simplest single step the government could take in order to do its bit would be to scrap this unjustified and burdensome tax. Bill Morris, deputy general secretary, Transport and General Workers Union, Transport House, Smith Square, SW1</p>

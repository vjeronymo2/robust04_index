			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Business rate fuels inflation Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, August 6) has missed a fundamental point in his discussion. Probably, of more concern to most retailers is the issue of the Uniform Business Rate (UBR) which will contribute more to inflationary pressures in the short term than the upwards- only rent review. The tax has been particularly onerous to retailers who have suffered most due to the distortions created by an overdue revaluation which occurred in 1988. As a result, tenants are having to pay rates calculated on rental values close to the peak of the market. When the tax was introduced in 1990, in order to soften the blow, the increase in rates was restricted to a rise of 20 per cent per annum. Therefore, many occupiers are having to suffer an annual increase in their fixed costs due to the phasing-in of the tax. In addition, every business occupier in the country - not only retailers - will suffer an annual increase in their rates bill geared to the rise in the rate in the pound multiplier which is indexed. There is no respite until 1995 when the next revaluation is instituted based on 1993 rents. However, all this will do is iron out additional regional distortions created by the property crash. The rate in the pound will still be indexed to the RPI and set annually. At least those stuck with upward only rent reviews reviled in 1988 will be guaranteed that their next review in 1993 will not increase due to the collapse of the market. They will not have to consider a rental increase until at least 1998. In real terms rents will have fallen and many occupiers will be facing lease expiries allowing them to enter into more adaptable leases. Therefore, I put it to you, which is more inflationary?

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by CTK and "(gag)": "We Did Not Deliver Tanks to </F> Pakistan"]    [Text] Prague/Stockholm--The $0.5 billion that, according  to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI),  the Czech Republic was supposed to have made in arms exports  last year corresponds to the 1986 boom in Czechoslovak arms  exports. Never before--or since--had we achieved such a large  turnover.    The Czech Trade and Industry Ministry says that the value of  the realized contracts in arms exports in 1993 amounted to $167  million. Stanislav Fritzl, an employee in its licensing  administration, told us that the general analyses conducted by  the Stockholm institute are renowned; however, there are  inconsistencies between its figures and the figures of the  countries that export arms. The same institute stated recently  that we exported tanks to Pakistan, although only an informative  meeting on the possibility of supplying them had been held. The  contract fell through in the end. "If, in their analysis of  Czech arms exports, the Swedes applied the same method,  incorporating deliveries that were not made or even the  tentative contacts made by manufacturers, I am not surprised at  the difference between their and our figures," said Fritzl.  According to him, the Czech Trade and Industry Ministry will ask  the Stockholm institute to reveal how it reached the sum of $0.5  billion. The Czech Republic is an important exporter of small  arms (Czech Arms Plants Uhersky Brod) and jet training aircraft  (Aero Vodochody), while the Vlasim-based Sellier and Bellot or  Tatra Koprivnice, whose once ambitious military production is  being phased out, however, are among the companies with good  prospects.    Stanislav Fritzl told us that the Czech Republic is no  longer  viewed by the West as an armed-to-the-teeth opponent;  nevertheless, it is viewed as a competent rival in the  production of quality arms. Fritzl described as speculation the  theory put forward by LIDOVE NOVINY that the Stockholm  institute's report, which ranks us as the sixth-largest arms  exporter, could be aimed at casting doubt on the Czech  Republic's credibility. Nevertheless, he did admit that very  tough competition, whose methods are not always clean, is taking  place among the competing arms plants. The case involving the  six impounded Aero Vodochody guns, in which both Aero and the  Cechofracht forwarding company made minor mistakes, probably  does not fall into this category. However, the Austrians could  use these minor mistakes to seek a legal solution to the  multimillion [currency not specified] shipment for Thailand.    Cechofracht and Aero agreed yesterday to end the mutual  accusations over who is responsible for the seizure of the guns.  The forwarding company has claimed that the guns were declared  only as spare parts for L-59 aircraft. On the other hand,  Aero's director has told LIDOVE NOVINY that, without the gun  carriage, the guns are just a piece of iron comparable to a  spare part.</p>

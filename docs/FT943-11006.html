			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / People: Year 2000 gets its chief Nicholas Hinton, 52, director-general of the charity Save The Children since 1985, has been appointed chief executive of The Millennium Commission, a commission created by parliament to help fund capital projects across the UK to celebrate the year 2000. The commission will be financed by 20 per cent of the net proceeds of the national lottery, which could amount to more than Pounds 100m annually. The headhunters who sought out Hinton declared interested candidates should possess 'presence, authority and ingenuity' and have 'experience of public affairs', along with 'energy and drive'. Hinton clearly fits the bill on several fronts. He has long experience in working for a variety of charities, including the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and membership of the council of VSO. Hinton has also, in his time, spoken out against what he has perceived to be the bureaucratic handicaps of organisations like the United Nations. More recently he described as 'authoritarian' a government report on the role of charities in Britain. He dismissed the report's proposal for changes as 'privatisation by another name'. Hinton once harboured political ambitions, having stood for the Social Democratic-Liberal Alliance, contesting a parliamentary seat in Somerset in 1983. Another of Hinton's loves is music. He was a music scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.</p>

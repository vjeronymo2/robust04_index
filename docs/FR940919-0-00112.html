			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The basic approach involves the following steps (which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elaborated upon in the RIA background document, which has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in the docket for today's rule). (1) The Agency employed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste concentration data from the TC Survey to represent waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations. (2) EPA calculated the mean concentration of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent at each facility, weighted across the volume of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TC wastes managed at that facility. (3) EPA calculated the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would be posed by consumption of leachate, for both cancer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and non-cancer effects, at each facility. (4) EPA developed a set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dilution/attenuation factors (DAF) to represent the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fate and transport processes in a homogeneous ground-water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. For each facility, the Agency divided the risk posed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consumption of leachate by the DAF (expressed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability distribution) to yield the risk posed by predicted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations in water from hypothetical exposure wells. (5) EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then summed the predicted risks across all facilities to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an estimate of the distribution of individual risk at facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managing untreated TC wastes. In addition, the Agency simulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the post-regulatory scenario, and summed the predicted risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> across facilities, and developed the incremental risk reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to today's rule. (6) EPA subsequently developed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate of the potential incremental population risk using 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population estimates around each site. The Agency used standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions for body weight (70 kg) and water intake (2 liters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per day) for 9 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> v. Human Health Risk Reduction_Air Pathway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Constituents contained in TC waste, soil, and debris may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitted to air through volatilization and dust entrainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reducing the concentrations of TC constituents through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards set in today's rule reduces the potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air emissions, and the risks posed by those air emissions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of the air pathway risk analysis was to characterize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline (pre-LDR) risk and the reduction in baseline risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from regulatory requirements in today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency's basic approach for the air pathway risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis involves the following steps (which are elaborated upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the RIA background document, which has been placed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> docket for today's rule). (1) EPA used bulk waste concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data from the TC Survey to represent waste concentrations. (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency calculated the mean concentration of each constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at each facility, weighted across the volume of all TC wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managed at that facility. (3) EPA calculated the unit area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managing TC wastes. (4) EPA estimated emissions due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatilization and dust entrainment for each constituent at each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. (5) The Agency evaluated the atmospheric transport for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each constituent. EPA then estimated exposure concentrations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several downwind points corresponding to potential exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations. The Agency employed standard high-end assumptions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> body weight (70 kg) and 70-year lifetime. (6) The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated individual cancer risk and non-cancer risk across the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, using the modeled exposure assumptions. (7) EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated population risk for exposed populations. (8) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency then simulated the risk under the regulatory requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in today's rule, and determined the incremental risk reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Results Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> a. Volume Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Agency has estimated the volumes affected by today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. A total of 295,000 tons per year of organic TC wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D018&hyph;D043) are affected by today's rule; this volume includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 167,000 tons per year of nonwastewaters, 94,000 tons per year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous soil, and 34,000 tons per year of hazardous debris.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The volume estimates used in the capacity analysis differ, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above, from those estimates employed in the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. See the regulatory analysis background document for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more detailed discussion of these differences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there are 30 tons per year of Chlorotoluene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes affected by today's rule. The Agency also estimates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9,760 tons per year of K069 waste will be affected as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazardous waste recycling exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> b. Cost Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Exhibit XVI&hyph;1 summarizes the results of the cost analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for today's final rule. In total, today's final rule would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an incremental annual cost of between $194 and $219 million. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower bound cost estimate represents the effects of waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimization compliance cost savings. In addition, there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential cost savings associated with the UTS standards and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste recycling exemption of $2.1 million per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG 'HIT SQUAD' REPORTS SPUR ISRAELI PROBE  </P> <P> Police opened an inquiry Sunday into Israelis suspected of training death  squads for Colombian drug barons, and a retired army officer named in the  scandal said the probe could implicate other officers and a legislator.  </P> <P> Yehoshua Caspi, head of the police investigations unit, said investigators  would examine "all aspects of Israelis suspected of selling military services  and know-how without Defense Ministry permission to unofficial groups in  Colombia."  </P> <P> He said the Defense Ministry had requested the investigation.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel Television that the allegations  contained a "certain amount of exaggeration" and that the government had no  part in the scandal.  </P> <P> Retired Lt. Col. Yair Klein, who has been named by Israeli media as a mercenary  who worked in Colombia, said on Israel Radio that he called Caspi on Sunday and  asked to meet with the investigation team.  </P> <P> Klein said he is prepared to name a member of Parliament involved in the  scandal.  </P> <P> He refused to give any details about the legislator other than to say he is a  former army officer.  </P> <P> Reports from Colombia said four Israelis, along with American, British and  South African mercenaries, were involved in training assassins for drug  smugglers in Colombia.  </P> <P> Shamir, in his first comments on the mercenary scandal, said on Israel  Television: "It is not pleasant to hear that there are Israelis dealing in ugly  things, but there are Israelis in all different parts of the world involved in  all sorts of things.  </P> <P> "The state of Israel cannot be responsible for them," he said.  </P> <P> However, Edy Kaufman, an Israeli expert on Latin America, said Israel turns a  blind eye to such training programs and to illegal arms sales because the trade  is lucrative and gives jobs to former high-ranking military officers.  </P> <P> Klein, who returned to Israel from Miami on Friday, denied reports in the  Israeli media that he was a mercenary who trained death squads for drug  traffickers. But he said that last year he helped train banana growers and  ranchers in Colombia's countryside to fight guerrillas. He said he was paid  $40,000 for two monthlong weapons training courses he conducted with three  other retired Israeli officers and said all of his dealings in Colombia "were  according to the law."  </P></p>

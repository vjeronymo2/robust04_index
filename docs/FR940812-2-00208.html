			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Applicants represent that purchases and sales between Series will be consistent with the policy of each Series, as only securities that otherwise would be bought and sold on the open market pursuant to the policy of each Series will be involved in the proposed transactions. Applicants further believe that the current practice of buying and selling on the open market leads to unnecessary brokerage fees and is therefore contrary to the general purposes of the Act. In order to minimize the possibility of overreaching, applicants have agreed to comply with the conditions discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

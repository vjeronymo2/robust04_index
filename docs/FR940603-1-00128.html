The Bidder certifies that it does not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder certifies further that it will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity Clause in this Contract. As used in this certification, the term ``segregated facilities'' means any waiting room, work areas, restrooms and washrooms, restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. The Bidder agrees that (except where it has obtained identical certifications from proposed subcontractors for specific time periods) it will obtain identical certifications from proposed subcontractors prior to the award of subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Clause, and that it will retain such certifications in its files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7. Franchises. The Bidder shall be under no obligation to obtain or assist in obtaining: Any franchises, authorizations, permits or approvals required to be obtained by the Owner from Federal, State, County, Municipal or other authorities; or any agreements between the Owner and third parties with respect to any matters incident to the construction and operation of the Project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8. Nonassignment of Contract.

The Bidder shall not assign the Contract effected by an acceptance of this Proposal or any interest in any funds that may be due or become due hereunder or enter into any contract with any person, firm or corporation for the performance of the Bidder's obligations hereunder or any part thereof, without the approval in writing of the Owner and of the Surety and Sureties, if any, on any bond furnished by the Bidder for the faithful performance of the Bidder's obligations hereunder. If the Bidder, with the consent of the Owner and any Surety or Sureties on the Contractor's Bond or Bonds, shall enter into a subcontract with any subcontractor for the performance of any part of this Contract, the Bidder shall be as fully responsible to the Owner and the Government for the acts and omissions of such subcontractor and of persons employed by such subcontractor as the Bidder would be for its own acts and omissions and those of persons directly employed by it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9.

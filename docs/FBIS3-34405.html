The airport was closed to air traffic last Tuesday when  disturbances swept the city and then worsened later, developing  into armed confrontations between security forces and armed  elements opposed to the government.    Eyewitnesses arriving from the city yesterday have said that  the situation there is still tense and that security forces  continue to search houses and buildings there.    It has been reported that security forces have arrested  scores of people and moved some of them to Tehran. A committee  comprised of three mullah arrived in Zahedan yesterday. It is  sent by the "Supreme Guide" 'Ali Khamene'i to hold negotiations  with Sunni leaders in the city in connection with the people's  complaints. It is worth noting that the Sunni represent over 80  percent of the city's population. The authorities believe that  maybe this reality was one of the factors behind the uprising  against the Shiite mullahs' regime in Tehran.    However, Sunni leaders in the city have urged the city's  inhabitants to remain calm, refuting the reports that the  disturbances are linked to religious questions. Nevertheless,  they have not yet announced their agreement to talk to the  mullahs sent by Khamene'i from Tehran.    Eyewitnesses say that organized groups of young men spread  in  the main street in the city last Tuesday and began to overturn  government vehicles and set government building ablaze, burning  portraits of Khomeyni and other mullahs of the regime. A crowd  of the city's residents chanted when the young men began to burn  the Khomeyni flag which replaced the historic Iranian flag in  1979.    It has not yet been determined who was first to open fire,  hence turning the peaceful demonstrations into violent  incidents. However, individuals from the Baluchi tribes, which  form much of the population in Zahedan, are usually armed to the  teeth.    Local police, who are limited in number, did not make any  attempt to control demonstrators. At any rate, the regular  police are the object of the mullah regime's suspicion, as their  political allegiance is suspect.    The demonstrators, who were angered by the opening of fire  on  them, tried to seize the local government's premises, but were  forced to retreat after the guards opened fire on them. Two  people were killed in the incident. An hour later the first  Revolutionary Guard battalion arrived to scene aboard a  helicopter from the nearby town of Khash. An armed  confrontation erupted immediately between members of this  battalion and unknown gunmen who tried to seize the radio  station. Two members of the Guards were killed in the clash.    The "Revolutionary Guards" succeeded in evacuating  government  officials and a number of mullahs who had sought shelter in the  governor's residence in the city. Further violent actions  occurred in the afternoon of the same day when a group of  Shiites were brought to the area by government trucks from the  nearby Bazman area to -- so it seemed -- intimidate the  demonstrators. But the Bazman group, led by two government  mullahs, had to retreat after a brief confrontation with the  Sunni demonstrators.    Eyewitnesses say that at least 50 people were wounded, and  that 23 of them are still receiving treatment in local hospitals.</p>

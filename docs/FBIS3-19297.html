			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels--Speaking during the international  conference on the Kurdish problem in Brussels, Kani Yilmaz,  Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] representative in Europe,  criticized the West's approach to the Kurdish problem in a  threatening tone. Yilmaz attacked European countries' stance on  the problem in southeast Turkey and accused them of maintaining  double standards "particularly on issues relating to human  rights." He said: "The approach maintained by several  countries against the PKK, including their move to ban the PKK  after ridiculously accusing it of being a `terrorist  organization' indicates that they support the tyrannical country  that maintains an unjust approach and that is responsible for  bloodshed. We know of the sources that provide arms and  economic support to Turkey in the unjust war against the Kurds.  That is unacceptable. I want to stress that the effort to solve  the problem in the absence of our party [not further specified]  will be an interference in our people's will. That will not be  allowed. We won't remain inactive in the direction of the  governments and international organizations that maintain that  approach while claiming that they want to take initiatives or  steps toward solving the Kurdish problem. Several friendly  countries know our position in that regard." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Ocalan Sends Message to the Conference </H5>   PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan conveyed a message to the  conference in Brussels. It listed his views as follows:    1. We will remain open to every proposal for a solution. We  will also remain open to initiatives by foreign countries and  organizations to solve the problem.    2. I want to point out that we do not want to divide Turkey  and that the propaganda against us conflicts with our approach.    3. I want to point out that we will agree to be a side to  any democratic dialogue that the Turkish Government may want to  establish, a dialogue in which we can outline the legitimate  demands of our people and achieve a result. We have neither  rejected nor opposed any concrete proposal for a solution since  the problem began. Within that framework, we are prepared to  discuss all the alternatives, including the establishment of a  federation.    4. We won't try to avoid and we won't try to impose our  views if an initiative is taken for a cease-fire agreement and  talks to solve the problem under international supervision.    5. Most importantly, I want to stress that we guarantee we  will agree to the decisions the conference may adopt for a  solution. I also want to stress that we will end the armed  struggle if the ground is prepared for a political solution and  free political activity.</p>

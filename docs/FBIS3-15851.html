			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "Which Color Government, </F> Except the Red One, Will Save Lithuania?"]    [Excerpts] On Wednesday [23 February] evening before  "Panorama" [television newscast] aired, representatives of four  political forces spent 45 minutes discussing a truly global  problem: Can the government headed by A. Slezevicius be trusted?  As it had been reported before, such a topic for a televised  discussion was proposed by the Democratic Party. Five of the  six participants in the program are Seimas [parliament] deputies  -- G. Pavirzis and A. Kuncinas (the Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party [LDDP] ), V. Andriukaitis (the Social Democratic Party),  S. Peceliunas, and J. Tartilas (the Democratic Party). Thus, it  is natural that the debate reminded everyone of the "sweet" oral  clashes between the majority and the opposition in the  legislature, and echoed the recent Seimas discussion on the  country's internal situation. [passage omitted] The only person  not "elected" by the nation was A. Ambrazevicius, representative  of the Movement for National Progress.    Opening the discussion, S. Peceliunas raised two questions:  Would the change of government provide anything today, and would  the new officials really conduct a policy that is not harmful to  the state? Has the time come to replace those who appointed  this government?    Providing examples from the recent activities of the Foreign  Ministry and the Ministry of Transportation (uncontrolled  military transit, the problem of the Adutiskis railway station  [dispute with Belarus], attitudes toward the Polish-Lithuanian  treaty), the democrats' representative drew the following  conclusion: "I think that we should not discharge the  government en masse now." It might be sufficient to replace  four ministers by citing specific charges of acting against the  state. In S. Peceliunas' opinion, however, there is another  problem: The ruling party itself is incapable of managing the  country. "Therefore, it is getting upset and angry with itself  and others." The fact that the entire LDDP list found itself in  the Seimas after the elections is responsible for this  situation. Many representatives of the majority do not even  know now what they have to do. Would not they be worth  replacing? A referendum on the people's confidence in the  government could answer this question.    A. Kuncinas, who had told journalists back on Wednesday  morning that the topic of discussion was formulated incorrectly,  reminded everyone that the manner of changing the government is  indicated in the Constitution and the Seimas Statute.  Therefore, there was no need to discuss such an issue in  public. It would be also improper for the LDDP to express no  confidence in its own government. The LDDP may criticize and  reprimand it, which is being accomplished, and search for  solutions.    V. Andriukaitis repeatedly listed the promises and  commitments given by the sixth cabinet of ministers which it  failed to fulfill, and reminded the government of its political  responsibility. At the same time, he stressed that the  government crisis in Lithuania is deep and that it has continued  for several years. There is hardly such a political force today  which could resolve all our problems by itself. In V.  Andriukaitis' opinion, it would be useful to draft a doctrine of  interpellation that would help determine whether a broad  political coalition was possible, attract specialists, freeze  all claims for two years, and design a serious program which  would be approved by all forces after reaching a consensus.    According to V. Andriukaitis, an interpellation to the  government does not mean its overthrow. It could manifest  itself through parliamentary criticism, debates, and proposals,  which would be a serious step toward progress.    According to G. Pavirzis, even though the government is  reprimanded greatly, it is imposing. The Seimas deputy reminded  everyone that after the elections, the LDDP called on all  political forces to form a coalition government, but the latter  refused. [passage omitted] It is easy to criticize programs.  However, the times when five-year plans were fulfilled in three  years are already over. We should not interfere with the  government's work, the more so since the LDDP does not shun  responsibility.    "Lithuania will hardly ever be in such a unique situation as  today," said A. Ambrazevicius. The LDDP has the parliamentary  majority, the Presidency, the government, and the prime  minister, who is also the party chairman. Thus, its  responsibility is unequivocal. However, the LDDP often behaves  as though it did not have this majority. This is bad, because  these four years in office are the party's chance. LDDP's  political future will depend on its ability to use this chance.  The opposition should not obstruct the ruling majority, demand  early elections, and so on. Unfortunately, it resorts to the  principle "the worse for the state, the better for the  opposition" more often today. [passage omitted]    J. Tartilas shared A. Ambrazevicius' opinion on the  government's dependence. "The spectrum is really monochromatic  -- the president, the Seimas, and the government." However, two  years have passed since the "red color began to administer  Lithuania," and what has been accomplished? J. Tartilas said  that he saw a much deeper meaning in this issue than just a  government collapse. This might be the desire to avoid  responsibility and oust the government with the opposition's  hands. One could explain later that the opposition is to blame  for everything. Thus, J. Tartilas suggested that the LDDP  government be allowed to work for its full four-year term.  However, if we were to replace it, we should change the entire  "spectrum."    Replying to some people's doubts, S. Peceliunas explained:  "We do not seek power. We are talking about Lithuania's  situation and perspective. We see that the current manner of  governing reduces this perspective, while the majority would not  listen to our proposals." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange  reserves soared 2.83 billion dollars in April to hit a record  for the second month in a row, the Finance Ministry said Monday  [2 May].    The new record of 104.56 billion dollars in the month-end  balance endorsed the continued active intervention by the Bank  of Japan to stem the yen's rise against the U.S. dollar.    The April rise also represented the sixth consecutive  month-to- month increase, the ministry said.    The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies,  gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights.    A ministry official, as usual, declined to comment on  details  and reasons for the change in the foreign reserves while  briefing reporters.    Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign  reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan and  dealers said the central bank continued to buy billions of  dollars in April to stop the yen's rise.    The ministry official said the dollar started the month at  102.72 yen and ended at 102.38 yen in Tokyo dealings, ranging  from 102.30 posted April 28 to 105.85 yen marked April 8.    He said the range of 3.55 yen was small compared with that  in  the past three months this year but noted that the dollar-yen  rate fluctuated more in overseas markets.    The dealers said the central bank was also seen buying  dollars overseas in the reporting month.    Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign  reserves  for the sixth month in a row, amassing 98.4 billion dollars as  of February, the most recent comparable figures with other  nations, except Taiwan for January reserves, the official said.    Taiwan came in second with reserves of 84.8 billion dollars,  followed by Germany with 83.5 billion dollars. The United  States posted 77.5 billion dollars and Spain 42.4 billion  dollars.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Official Representative of the Republic </F> of Moldova President"]    [Text] With the beginning of the election campaign, some  political formations that call themselves organizations of a  "democratic orientation" are offering their point of view on the  sociopolitical situation in the republic, which is quite natural  and acceptable, providing that the truth is being told, and not  a lie, and that arguments are presented, and not suppositions,  or rumors. Since recently, after the transformation by  opposition organizations of protest rallies against the  sentencing of the so-called "Ilascu group" by unconstitutional  Tiraspol judicial organs into an antipresidential campaign,  during which accusations of betrayal and duplicity were made  against the president, and since these accusations, which have  been rejected by the head of state as absurd and unfounded, have  not stopped, the official representative of the republic  president is authorized to declare the following:    1. The president of the Republic of Moldova refutes the  claim  that "he did not make public the conflict in the eastern  rayons," as was told to BASA Press Agency by one of the members  of the Intelligentsia Congress, for the simple reason that it  was he who invited the CSCE mission to acquaint itself with the  situation and the real assistance to eliminate disagreements in  the eastern rayons. In this regard, the decision of the  ministers of foreign affairs of the country members of the CSCE  in Rome was published, through which the mission will continue  its activity in this direction. Moreover, Mircea Snegur has  repeatedly come out for a revival of the quadrilateral mechanism  for resolving problems of the eastern rayons--a question that  was also discussed during meetings with Leonid Kravchuk.    2. Also inappropriate is the statement of the weekly  LITERATURA SHI ARTA special correspondent that Mircea Snegur,  "the one who chooses and leads," is to blame for the "economic  catastrophe." We all know under what conditions the ministers  were proposed and elected by parliament, and how many  commitments, including behind the scenes, certain parliamentary  factions assumed for themselves for the appointment of several  ministers. It was this kind of a state of affairs that  determined the president's decision to support the initiative on  the dissolution of parliament and the election to a new  parliament of one party or a coalition capable of running the  country.    3. With respect to the bloody conflict on the Dniester and  the real culprits in its unleashing, in the near future the  president of the republic intends to come out with a statement  in reply to the irresponsible accusations of those who are  transforming patriotism into a profession.    4. Dumitru Postovan, the procurator of the republic, denied  in the press the claim that the president of the Republic of  Moldova is involved "in dirty deals" with a SEABECO affiliate.  According to statements like "the procuracy...establishes, but  it does not have the courage to go farther, so as not to alarm  'Daddy'" ("Memory Exercise" ["Ekzerchitsiy de memoriye"], Ion  Katsaveyka. LITERATURA SHI ARTA, 23 December 1993). The  Procuracy should speak out. It should be noted that it was at  the initiative of the president that a report was published on  infractions committed by some leading persons, about whom an  investigation has been started and whose results will also be  published in the press.    Resolutely determined to conduct reforms, President Mircea  Snegur encourages and promotes with all means a dialogue of the  workers of ministries with representatives of the IMF and the  World Bank. He is attending to the development of a program for  the social protection of the masses, understanding that certain  forces are interested in arousing tensions, in this way pursuing  specific aims. The head of state is confident that the  organizations participating in the current election campaign  will dot their "i's" and that the people will make their choice.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: HARRODS BIDS SALON 'SO LONG'  </P> <P> Fur was literally flying out of Harrods in London last Saturday . The luxury  department store almost gave coats away and closed its 100-year-old fur salon.  Animal rights activists claimed a victory, but a Harrods spokesperson denied  the firm had bowed to outside pressure. The store will continue to offer a  number of fur-related services, including a cold-storage facility that houses  7,000 furs during the summer. Despite the heat closer to home, Dennis Rosoff,  owner of Rosoff Furs in Beverly Hills, didn't duck our questions: "It's really  up for grabs if the industry will survive. But I think we will. I think it's a  hypocritical situation, when you realize that every Thanksgiving 150 million  turkeys are slaughtered in the United States. Instead of asking me how I feel  about Harrods, how about asking me how I feel about Aspen having an  overwhelming vote in favor of fur? It was wonderful."  </P> <P> CAMERA READY: Anne Bancroft tried out two new looks during a photo session for  Lear's magazine. "Straight and sultry" or "curly and fun" is how hair stylist  Allen Edwards describes the variations of her shoulder-grazing classic cut. One  thing Edwards did not change is the lock of golden blond hair that Bancroft, a  brunette, had dyed to match the wig she donned for her role in a recent play,  "The Mystery of the Rose Bouquet."  </P> <P> THE MONOGRAM GAME: DKNY -- Donna Karan's mega-successful lower-priced  sportswear collection -- is the recipient of the greatest form of flattery --  imitation. In January, Barami Enterprises came out with a line called BKNY. A  Karan employee discovered a BKNY skirt in a New York discount store with a logo  featuring "the same lettering style on the label," according to Patti Cohen,  vice president of advertising and public relations for Donna Karan. A trademark  infringement was filed by DKNY and later withdrawn in lieu of an agreement  between DKNY and BKNY, according to Baram Hakakian, president of Barami  Enterprises and Cohen. Now, JNY, a collection by Jones New York, is hanging in  department stores across the country. And the label looks a lot like Karan's.  Jones New York declined to comment on the similarity. Cohen says DKNY attorneys  are "very much aware of the situation, but right now, nothing has been done."  </P></p>

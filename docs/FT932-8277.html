			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: DM weaker as Danes vote BOTH the D-Mark and the Swiss franc continued to weaken in European trading yesterday as dealers took the view that there would be a strong Yes vote in Denmark's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, writes James Blitz. The first exit polls following the referendum indicated last night that there had been a comfortable victory for the Yes camp, although final confirmation of the result was being awaited. Nevertheless, the exit polls were clearly in line with the market's expectations and suggested that tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism were about to ease. As on previous days, the expectation that the treaty would be ratified led to unwinding of positions in both the D-Mark and the Swiss franc, both of which have been viewed as safe haven currencies in the event of a No vote. The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than a pfennig to peak at DM1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a seven-week high. It closed in London at DM1.6240, and later ended New York trading at DM1.6246. Again, a factor pushing the dollar up against the German currency was speculation that the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee would lean towards tightening monetary policy following last week's higher than expected figures for US inflation. The results of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today, will not be known for some weeks. In Europe, expectations of a Yes vote led dealers to go long of several currencies outside the D-Mark bloc and to short the Swiss franc, which closed at SFr0.910 to the D-Mark from a previous SFr0.909. The Italian lira was the best performer on the Continent, ending at L909.2 per D-Mark from a previous L914.9. The lira's rise partly reflected strong buying of Italian bonds, with the five-year BTP future moving up more than 40 basis points on the day. Sterling also enjoyed a strong performance, again driven by the same factors. It finished at DM2.4875, a full pfennig higher on the day. The clearest sign that the market was expecting a Yes vote was, of course, the Danish krone's performance. Denmark's currency peaked at DKr3.8250 to the D-Mark, and then weakened on profit-taking to end at around DKr3.8425. Its divergence indicator against its Ecu central rate fell to around minus 37 basis points at the close of London trading, some 3 basis points higher than at Monday's close. An important question facing the market today is whether the D-Mark's performance has been sufficiently bad in recent days to make the Bundesbank think twice about cutting the discount rate at its council meeting today. A 25 basis-point easing in the discount rate has been anticipated, but several Bundesbank officials have recently expressed concern about the dangers of imported inflation.</p>

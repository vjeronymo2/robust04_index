Another Thaw in Russia?";  date and place not given: "Evening Conversation with Viktor  Anpilov"]    [Text] On the very day that the decree on the amnesty was  being adopted, the freedom-loving State Duma deputies from  Russia's Choice began shouting: "Now Anpilov is getting out of  Lefortovo and will call his thugs out onto the streets!" The  same prediction was made by alarmed television commentators.  "The freed criminals will cause unrest in Moscow" they said,  trying to intimidate the viewers by showing the former convicts  leaving prison.    Well, in that case how can you avoid asking the now freed  Viktor Anpilov about the unrest that he is planning in Moscow?  Here is his reply on his first evening at home.    [Anpilov] There will be no unrest. I have always strictly  observed the laws.    [Nikiforova] Viktor Ivanovich, does that mean you do not  regard yourself as guilty?    [Anpilov] It does not matter what I think. During the five  months that I spent in prison they did not present a single  piece of evidence against me even though from the very outset I  wanted a judicial investigation and had even prepared my speech  for the trial. But to call someone a criminal before the trial  is not allowed even under the new Constitution. As I was  leaving prison I said: If life had improved over these past  five months that would have been the weightiest evidence of my  guilt, but it has deteriorated considerably and people are  protesting. Of course there must be an objective investigation  into the causes and all the circumstances of the events of  September and October.    [Nikiforova] Nevertheless, could you say a few words about  your immediate plans....    [Anpilov] I intend to travel and meet with labor  collectives. I shall go to Tula, Vorkuta, Chelyabinsk, and  Yekaterinburg -- I want to tell people the whole truth about  what happened in May and September-October last year. In the  conditions which have been created, the labor collectives must  become owners of their own enterprises -- they alone have the  right to dispose of everything built by them, they alone have  the right to dispose of their output and set the wages of the  administration. This will be the dictatorship of the  proletariat.    [Nikiforova] So does that mean back to work for you? There  must have been much to think about and reassess, surely?    [Anpilov] I wrote a book in prison -- I called it "The  Lefortovo Dialogues. A Prison Synopsis of Hegel's Lectures." I  wrote it in the form of the transcript of a conversation between  a Prisoner and the great thinkers, from Socrates and Plato to  Lenin. They are conversations about the state and the rule of  law. The dialogue with Lenin was about how the greatest  revolution was lost and why.    [Nikiforova] And in conclusion....    [Anpilov] My thanks to the PRAVDA collective for their  solidarity and support. Let us stand up together for the  position of the struggling proletariat!</p>

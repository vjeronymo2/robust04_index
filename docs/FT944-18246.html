			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (14): Optimists have upper hand  -Spain: a subsidy scheme has helped push up sales Optimists about the Spanish car industry will point to this year's surging sales figures, while pessimists will underline the traumas undergone by Seat, the VW subsidiary and Spain's biggest producer, and by Santana, the now all-but-bankrupt small company owned by Suzuki. But few in the domestic industry doubt that the optimists have the day. In the first eight months of this year car registrations in Spain rose 20.5 per cent on the January-August 1993 market total, well ahead of the European Union average, to 555,000 units. The forecast is that the final 1994 registration figure will be about 900,000, comfortably up on last year though short of the historic high of 1.1m cars registered in 1989 at the height of Spain's growth period. A key element in this rush for registrations has been a government programme that, imitating a French initiative, pays owners of a 10-year-old car Pta100,000 (Dollars 781) for trading in the vehicle for scrap to buy a new one. Few government subsidy initiatives have met with such a ready response from the public. The so-called Renove programme was brought in for a six-month period which expires this month and manufacturers, who say that it has accounted for some 70 per cent of the sales that have been made while it has been in operation, are seeking to have the programme renewed for another six months. The Renove incentive showed that attractive pricing can work wonders in what is potentially a very large domestic market. Unsurprisingly, manufacturers are lobbying the government to strike out a 13 per cent car tax on new purchases which, when combined with the Value Added Tax that is levied on vehicle acquisitions, places a 28 per cent tax burden on buyers. Vehicle exports have also done well and stood at 73 per cent of total production in the first half of this year, a ratio which is at least five points up on what in recent years has been considered normal for Spain's largest export-driven industrial sector. Two factors have spurred sales outside Spain: the competitive peseta after three devaluations of the national currency in 1992-93; and the increased attraction, during times of recession, of the small and cheap cars in which Spain specialises. New markets outside the EU for Spanish cars - in eastern Europe, North Africa and Latin America - are estimated to represent not much more than 5 per cent of the export total, though statistics may mislead since Spanish-built Renault-5s, for example, which are nominally exported to France, are likely to be re-exported. The likelihood is that the emerging markets will sustain the momentum of Spanish car exports when the EU recovery dampens the demand for small cars. Nevertheless, most headlines about the domestic car industry have concentrated on Seat and Suzuki. Both firms are in trouble but neither is representative of the sector as a whole, says Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros, president of Anfac, the Spanish car manufacturers' federation. Seat went through a traumatic period at the end of last year when its VW parent announced the closure of its 30-year-old plant by the port of Barcelona. However, this development had long been awaited, particularly as VW had invested strongly in a new Seat facility outside Barcelona which will probably be the last big car plant to be built in western Europe. The new Seat plant at Martorell, north-west of Barcelona, says a great deal more about VW's commitment to car production in Spain than does the messy and emotionally-fraught closure of the historic, but obsolete, plant in Barcelona's Zona Franca port area. Suzuki was dragged into labour disputes early this year when it announced that it would withdraw from the small Santana production centre that builds Vitara four-wheel drive vehicles. After a series of under-subscribed capital increases the Japanese giant, which had entered Santana as a junior partner to provide technical support, unwittingly found itself to be the virtual sole shareholder of a company that it had no intention of owning. The chief problems at Santana, which formerly manufactured Land Rovers and was controlled by the UK's Rover group, are that it lacks a strong product and is strapped for cash. This is not a situation that on either count bears resemblance to any other vehicle producer in Spain. At present, the small Santana plant, based in the otherwise agricultural town of Linares in the south and far from Spain's main industrial centres, is fitfully building Vitaras and hoping that a Korean group will step in to take up Suzuki's burden. The Japanese producer has already served notice that it intends to pull out of Spain at the end of this year. The other domestic car builders - Ford, General Motors, Renault, Citroen and Nissan - are talking about the start of a new growth cycle. Anfac says that, barring Suzuki, no foreign automobile group in Spain is even discussing relocation elsewhere.</p>

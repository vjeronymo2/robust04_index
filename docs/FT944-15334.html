			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Questions raised on joint ventures A Tesco superstore, being built on the edge of Aberdare in the south Wales valleys, has called into question the way in which the Welsh Development Agency has run joint ventures. Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, has been commissioned by the WDA's new management and the National Audit Office to investigate the circumstances behind the development, the result of a joint venture by the agency, Cynon Valley borough council and Mid Glamorgan county council. The inquiry report, due to be published in the next few weeks, is expected to make serious criticisms of the way in which the WDA used its powers to recommend changes in the management of joint ventures. The development was intended to be an important part of the regeneration of Aberdare. When the Tesco store opens in March it will employ 250 people in an area of high unemployment. Among the issues is why the WDA paid Pounds 440,000 in 1992 for a site which had been bought by a South Glamorgan company, Offerdemo, only hours previously for Pounds 160,000. The process by which the Tesco bid was successful also raised protests. The Co-operative Retail Society, which was a bidder, threatened to sue. Last week it said: 'We are unable to comment for legal reasons.' The Grant Thornton report is expected to say that there was no personal involvement in the deal by Mr David Malpas, managing director of Tesco and a member of the WDA board, and Dr Gwyn Jones, then WDA chairman and subsequently a Tesco director. The WDA has kept the Commons public accounts committee informed. It has set up a group to ensure greater transparency and consultation in joint ventures and more involvement by the private sector.</p>

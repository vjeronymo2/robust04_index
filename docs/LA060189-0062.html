			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KFMB MAKES WINNING PITCH FOR THE PADRES  </P> <P> With a multi-million-dollar package that sets new standards for the local radio  industry, KFMB-AM (760) has won a 10-month competition to retain the rights to  broadcast Padre games, the club announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Although Padre officials refused to comment, KFMB is believed to have paid far  more than the $2 million it originally bid to air the games for the next five  years. The deal also includes extensive agreements for KFMB's involvement with  promotional events, advertising within the stadium and on television and a  variety of community activities.  </P> <P> Such a contract is unprecedented in San Diego, considering that the station  will receive no direct income from games. The Padres sell all the advertising  for the games and keep all the proceeds.  </P> <P> "It takes us to a new relationship beyond a straight broadcasting agreement,"  Padre President Dick Freeman said.  </P> <P> Both XTRA-AM (690) and KKLQ (FM 106) are believed to have offered more up-front  money for the radio rights than KFMB. But KFMB was the incumbent in the bidding  competition, with an 11-year track record of broadcasting Padres games.  </P> <P> "There is no question the continuity with KFMB was an important factor," said  Jim Winters, Padre director of broadcasting.  </P> <P> KFMB's biggest competitor most likely was XTRA, which switched to a news-talk  format last year. John Lynch, president of Noble Broadcasting, wanted to use  the Padres to make XTRA -- which broadcasts Charger games -- the dominant  sports station in town.  </P> <P> XTRA's bid was worth $4 million more than KFMB's, Lynch said. His station also  was offering its strong, 50,000-watt signal.  </P> <P> KFMB only has a 5,000-watt signal but already has approval to boost its evening  signal to 50,000. KFMB's ratings also are far superior to the fledgling XTRA,  and it boasts some of the top personalities in local media, including Ted  Leitner and the morning team of Hudson and Bauer.  </P> <P> KFMB's ability to promote the team year-round and stage proven successful  promotional events, such as last Sunday's postgame Beach Boys concert, were  major elements of the station's presentation, KFMB General Manager Paul Palmer  said.  </P> <P> "We're spending a lot of dollars with the Padres in addition to the cash,"  Palmer said.  </P> <P> XTRA was in the running, Lynch said, until a meeting last Wednesday attended by  representatives of all three stations, the Padre board of directors and team  owner Joan Kroc. She made it clear, Lynch said, that KFMB was her choice.  </P> <P> Freeman said the decision was strictly his own. Kroc didn't return phone calls  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I can't do anything to overcome 11 years of a relationship and that (Kroc)  doesn't need to make more money," said Lynch, who said his station's offer of  "soft" factors, such as advertising and promotions, was worth more than $20  million. "I'm disappointed, I thought it would be a strictly business decision.  I feel I've wasted three months on something that was fait accompli."  </P> <P> Lynch has said all along that if the bids were equal, KFMB deserved to get the  contract.  </P> <P> "KFMB and Paul have done a terrific job of building the station and the  Padres," said Lynch, who worked under Palmer at KFMB for several years before  moving to XTRA in 1977.  </P> <P> Unlike XTRA, Q106 is one of the top-rated stations in the market. But its Top  40 music format and lack of any sports history probably hurt its chances.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed, but I feel like we were given a fair opportunity to make our  pitch," Q106 General Manager Bob Bolinger said.  </P> <P> KFMB's new deal with the Padres begins next season.  </P> <P> Several factors extended the bidding process, including the uncertainty in the  Padres' front office following the sudden departure of President Chub Feeney  last fall. There also wasa clause in KFMB's current contract giving the station  exclusive negotiating rights until March 31.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GUILTY VERDICT IS ASSURED WHEN AN AUTO STANDS TRIAL FOR POLLUTING THE  ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> As part of an "alternative transportation day" at the Oakland offices of the  Bay Area Rapid Transit system, an automobile was put on trial for contributing  to the world's environmental ills.  </P> <P> More than 200 cheering onlookers, including BART employees, attended the mock  trial. After the car was found "guilty" of polluting and clogging up the  freeways, bystanders took turns carrying out the sentence by smashing the  vehicle with sledgehammers.  </P> <P> "We urge you to strike a symbolic blow for cleaner air," said "Judge" Gregory  Proops, who like many of the other trial participants, is a professional  comedian. "But don't try this at home."  </P></p>

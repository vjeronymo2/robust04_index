			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Angerstein and Masthead join Lloyd's investment trust queue TWO MORE Lloyd's invest-ment trusts have issued pathfinder prospectuses following last week's vote to admit corporate capital to the London insurance market. Angerstein Underwriting Trust is aiming to raise up to Pounds 75m through an issue of ordinary shares, with warrants attached, on a 1-for-5 basis. It said it had received indications from Stace Barr, its adviser, that it would be allocated more than Pounds 100m of underwriting capacity on syndicates in 1994. NatWest Markets is sponsor to the issue. As with other Lloyd's trusts, Angerstein will run an investment portfolio as well as participating in insurance underwriting. Angerstein's investments will try to match the FT-SE 100 Index. The prospectus does not reveal an indicative gross dividend yield on the shares. The pathfinder for Masthead Insurance Underwriting does not reveal the maximum number of shares that the company plans to offer. However, it does show the expected initial net asset value per share (96.5p, compared with an issue price of 100p) and the indicative annual gross dividend yield (4.6 per cent). Masthead's offer is sponsored by Hambros and the group will be advised by Murray Lawrence Members Agency, the fourth largest members' agent at Lloyds. The investment portfolio will be managed by Hambros Bank and will, at first, mainly comprise of sterling fixed interest instruments with an average gross yield of 6.5 per cent.</p>

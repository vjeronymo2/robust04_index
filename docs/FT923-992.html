			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Japan, Russia move to improve relations JAPAN and Russia have agreed to take the first steps towards repairing their bilateral relations, badly damaged by President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt cancellation of his planned visit to Tokyo this month. Mr Michio Watanabe, Japanese foreign minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, agreed in New York that their deputies should resume discussions as swiftly as possible over the future of four Russian-held islands off the northern tip of Japan, so as to pave the way for Mr Yeltsin to reschedule the trip. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister, said Mr Yeltsin might visit Tokyo at the end of this year or early next. The two foreign ministers agreed to sanction the talks on the islands, known in Japan as the northern territories, during discussions at the UN. The islands, known in Russia as the Kuriles, were taken by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. Japan insists it will not offer Russia bilateral economic aid until the dispute on the islands' sovereignty is settled. Russians blamed Japanese intransigence over the islands for Mr Yeltsin's decision to cancel his visit. Japanese officials argue that this was an excuse to disguise the domestic political pressures which they believe forced him to remain in Moscow. Mr Watanabe assured Mr Kozyrev that a conference on western aid to Russia, due to be held in Tokyo in late October, would not be jeopardised by the dispute. Mr Watanabe insisted Japan did not feel isolated in its approach to aid to Russia.</p>

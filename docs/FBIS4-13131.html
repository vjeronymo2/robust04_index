			<p>BFN     [Text] In its meeting held today under Senate President  Ahmad al-Lawzi, the Senate issued a statement expressing support  for His Majesty King Husayn's statements to the local and  foreign media.    The Senate's statement said his majesty has reiterated the  constants of the firm Jordanian policy toward the Palestine  question and the issues and problems resulting from it.    The Senate expressed full support for the Jordanian  position,  which was expressed by his majesty when he clearly explained  Jordan's sincere intentions toward a just peace that realizes  the national ambitions of the Palestinian people on their soil  and liberates the occupied Arab territories in harmony with  international legitimacy and human rights.    The Senate emphasized that Jordan has always stood against  terrorism and has paid a dear price with the blood of its sons  while firmly confronting terrorism. Jordan has always been  eager to reject violence in politics. This position is  manifested in Jordan's long history of working for the cause of  just peace.    The Senate also stressed that Jordan strongly rejects any  charges that it is soft on, or encourages terrorism. It  considers that these false charges are made to justify the  aggressive pressure being placed on the country, including the  unjust siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, in a bid to force it to  change its pan-Arab constructive position on just and lasting  peace.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Burma has agreed in principle to the construction  of a bridge over the Moei River linking Tak province with  Mywaddy, and has accepted Thailand's offer of financial support  for construction expenses, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said  yesterday. Prasong said his Burmese counterpart, U Ohn Gyaw, has  endorsed Thailand's initiative for the construction of the  bridge to link Tak's Mae Sot district with Mywaddy. The Cabinet  last week agreed to the Foreign Ministry proposal that Thailand  take responsibility for funding construction of the bridge,  because Burma is not prepared to do so. However, it asked the  ministry to make sure Burma wants the bridge.    "U Ohn Gyaw informed me during my official visit to Rangoon  for a Joint Commission meeting that Burma wants the bridge,"  Prasong said. The bridge is expected to boost border trade and  tourism in the area.    Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem  yesterday informed Burmese Ambassador to Thailand U Phone Myint  of the Cabinet resolution last week to fund construction of the  bridge.    Thailand initially considered other options related to the  project, including a proposal that Tak province's private sector  construct a temporary bridge at the same location. Tak's private  sector wants the temporary bridge immediately, while waiting for  a decision on the main bridge by the two governments.</p>

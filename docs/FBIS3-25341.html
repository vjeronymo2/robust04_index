Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday after meeting  Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas, Mr Mandela said  he was convinced the democratic process had the full support of  the majority of SADF members.    He was not worried about certain elements who wanted to  cling  to outdated policies as they would not affect the support the  SADF was already giving to the negotiation process.</p>

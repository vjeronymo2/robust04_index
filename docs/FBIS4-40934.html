			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "By All Possible Means?"] </F>   [Text] The Russian Federation Government Council for  Industry and Enterprise is prepared to participate most  actively, by all possible means, and in every possible way in  curbing the orgy of crime. A statement by the Council says that  "the country has entered a phase of political terror of  unprecedented dimensions. A State Duma deputy, a banker, and an  entrepreneur have been among the victims. The people involved  in the revival of Russia are dying."    People's constitutional right to safety must finally become  a  state, rather than just a private problem, the document notes.  Defective legislation, which more often than not protects the  criminal rather than the citizen, the impotence of the  law-enforcement organs, and official inaction are merely giving  the criminal world a free hand. Society is entitled to demand  that the state power structures place an insuperable barrier in  the way of the criminals rampaging in the country and placing  basic democratic values in peril.    "Terrorist actions are carefully thought out and organized  and have a very specific aim: To give criminal elements a clear  run at the levers of political power," a statement by the  Association of Russian Banks says.    The document notes that the association is prepared to give  every assistance to the law-enforcement organs and other state  structures in the fight against crime.    The Russian Party of Free Labor, in turn, believes that the  edict on protecting the population against bandits "contains no  visible means of making law-abiding property-owners safe from  bandit attacks. But militia officers have been given a free  hand in the area of constitutional guarantees of the protection  of citizens' private lives -- an area they have been interested  in for a long time." The Russian Party of Free Labor urged "the  president and the State Duma to instruct independent experts to  finalize proposals on combating organized crime, keeping them  reasonable and, at the same time, bringing them into line with  the Constitution."</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons to hold debate on Maxwell LABOUR will next week use its first opportunity of this parliament to choose the subject for debate to call a full-scale Commons debate on the plight of the Maxwell pensioners. The move came as the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners yesterday wrote to to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, requesting him to explain why he had refused to intervene. The group will also be writing to the main banks in support of appeals from the Maxwell pensioners themselves. Mr Frank Field and Mr Richard Page, the group's co-chairmen, said that the real focus of the discussion was the urgency of the pensioners' plight. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, will open the debate on Tuesday, which is expected to concentrate on the need for compensation for the pensioners. Depending on how the motion is drafted, even Tory MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners might find it difficult to vote against it. Last night's meeting of the Maxwell group of MPs agreed to appeal to its 100-plus members to press ministers at Commons questions today about when the government expects to publish the report by the Securities and Investments Board into the oversight by the Investment Managers' Regulatory Organisation (Imro) of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the fund management company owned by Robert Maxwell which managed the assets of his company pension funds. The SIB is said to be concerned that parts of the report may be deemed libellous and is said to have been told by its solicitors that it may not be exempt from libel actions. MPs agreed that to try to avoid this problem, they would press the government to publish the report as a House of Commons paper, so that the specific approval of the Commons would then be needed before it could be used in any legal action. The House of Lords is to debate the position of the Maxwell pensioners today, but the junior minister replying is unlikely to be able to pre-empt the announcement from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, about a review of pension law and regulation.</p>

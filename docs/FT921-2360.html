			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Maude's fate - Ballot Box Spare a thought for Francis Maude, the Treasury minister. For a start, he is defending a majority of less than 3,000 over Labour in his Warwickshire North constituency, but the Tory manifesto contains what could well be another blow. Frequently tipped as one of the MPs most likely to go to the Cabinet if the Tories win, Maude  - as Citizen's Charter minister  - must be favourite for the new non-departmental Cabinet post promised in the manifesto for the Citizen's Charter and Civil Service reform. Whitehall does not usually make it easy for a small central unit to impose its will on large departments, and the post may well be a thankless one: nothing like being chief secretary at the Treasury or running a spending department.</p>

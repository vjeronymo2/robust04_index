What is your opinion about these measures?    [Karadzic] I fully understand the Greek Government and its  sensitivity toward the name and symbols of Macedonia. I think  that Skopje should return to Yugoslavia to prevent the  dissolution of this country because Albanians would like to take  the whole of Macedonia or to take the eastern part of Macedonia.  Then there would be another Balkan war. Greece is right to be  very cautious about what is happening in the neighborhood of  Greece. We do hope that we will be always neighbors and maybe  some time even be a confederation.    [Correspondent] Really?    [Karadzic] I would like to see this.    [Correspondent] Is there any message for the Greek people?    [Karadzic] Yes, thanks to the whole Greek nation, two  governments, two oppositions, to the church for what they have  done for the Serb people. We will never forget this. I do  think that a good foundation for the Balkans is for Greece and  Serbia to have good relations and I see now Bulgaria is also  sympathizing with the Serbs and this is a good contact for peace.    [Correspondent] And one last question, Mr. President.  Actually, the ultimatum expires in some hours. What will  actually happen if there is a bombardment? How are you going to  react? Your troops against the blue helmets?    [Karadzic] If we are attacked by anyone, no matter who it  may  be, we will defend ourselves. It is the legitimate right of the  people to defend themselves.    [Correspondent] Thank you.</p>

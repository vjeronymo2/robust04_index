			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Risk and Reward: Ignorance and other failures of the regulators BACK in January, when Mr Gerald Corrigan, head of the Federal Reserve, warned of the unseen risks lurking in the derivatives markets, it seemed a bomb had been put under the banking industry. With external scrutiny focused on the markets, surely it would be only a matter of time before all the weapons in the international regulatory armoury were wheeled out. Fiercer capital adequacy standards, strict oversight of market operations and assorted other intrusions would surely follow. Nearly a year on, things look rather different. True, a batch of reports is still awaited, including those from the US General Accounting Office and G30, the banking industry's international think-tank. These may toe the Corrigan line. So far, though, it is the regulators themselves who have come out worse from the scrutiny of these new financial markets. It is now commonplace to witness bank regulators all but admitting to ignorance of how derivatives markets work. They cloak their ignorance with pious remarks about the need to understand the markets better, and for improved communication, but the message is not lost on anyone. When did the banking industry last get so far ahead of its regulators? The damage to bank balance sheets caused by the results of leveraged finance in the US, or the bank-financed bubble in property prices in several major economies, could hardly be blamed on a lack of understanding. Negligence maybe, but not ignorance. There are plenty of other failures which help to explain regulators' nervousness about derivatives. One is the division of responsibility, which has left the impression that no one is in a position to assess the full risks accruing in the financial system. The US is the best example. The Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission all have an interest in the subject. The division between the CFTC and the SEC is reaffirmed in the Re-authorisation Bill which is due to be confirmed before the present administration stands down. The SEC meanwhile, feels at a loss because the firms it regulates are busy setting up unregulated subsidiaries for derivatives business. In fairness, the politicians are as much to blame for this state of affairs as the regulators. The fragmentation is echoed elsewhere. The European Community, for instance, has a raft of directives which have a bearing on the market. Mr Alex Merriman, an EC official, says there are plans to amalgamate some of these rules into simpler, unified directives - but no plans as yet to examine the gaps between the directives or to bring forward new regulations specifically aimed at the new markets. The regulators are also woefully short of data on what is happening in many over-the-counter markets. How can you predict the knock-on effect of a crisis in one financial market when you do not know the scale of trading or its relationship with other markets? No wonder regulators have been making a song and dance about the derivatives industry this year. It may well be that some senior bankers do not understand the new risks they are exposed to - but the supervisors are no better off. It was, therefore, unusual to hear a director of the Bank of England expressing an unfashionable view last week. Mr Pen Kent - admittedly not responsible for banking supervision himself - expressed only mild caution about the new risks banks are running. 'We should not be complacent, but nor should we necessarily become alarmist either,' he told a conference in London. There would be 'huge risks in the cash markets which we would all face if we had no hedging mechanism to spread them and share them,' he said. Not that he does not share some of the concerns of other observers. Some banks are writing 30-year options, he says: how can they price such instruments to reflect the true risks they are running? But the regulators have a long way to go before they can take the derivatives specialists to task.</p>

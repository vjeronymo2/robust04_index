			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Good start to Chicago's DM/Y contract THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange's first non-dollar denominated cross rate contract, on DM/Y futures and futures-options, lifted off smoothly on Wednesday and gathered pace yester-day. On the first day of trading, the yen-settled DM/Y contract reached a volume of 212 futures and 655 options on futures. By mid-morning yesterday in Chicago, the contract's trading volume was ticking over at 198 futures and 500 options. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said at the inauguration of the new non-dollar cross rates contract: 'We've realised that the dollar is no longer the centre of the universe.' Last year, the CME's effort to raise interest in a series of dollar denominated cross rate products failed. But the new DM/Y cross rate appears to have a more positive reception. It provides, for example, some arbitrage opportunities with the cash market D-Mark/yen options offered at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The CME has also gathered a group of powerful trading houses to act as market makers under its market incentive programme, which aims to increase liquidity in fledgling contracts.</p>

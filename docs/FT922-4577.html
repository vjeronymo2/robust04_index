			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Restrictions on Australia TV licence bids DOMESTIC television networks, telecommunications carriers and newspaper groups will be excluded from the bidding for Australia's first subscription television licence, the federal Labor government said yesterday. The announcement reversed earlier indications that the three commercial television networks and the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) would play a leading role in establishing subscription television. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the restrictions would apply to the licence to operate the first four satellite channels, which are expected to become available in 1994. However, Mr Keating said the restrictions would not apply to separate licences for the fifth and sixth channels, which are expected to start transmitting a year later. Mr Keating said foreign investment would be restricted to a total of 35 per cent in each licence, with a ceiling of 20 per cent on individual shareholdings. The announcement ends a lengthy Labor wrangle over the extent to which participation by the commercial television networks would increase the concentration of media ownership. It means that Mr Kerry Packer's Channel Nine television network, which was considered most likely to invest in subscription television, will be excluded from the first round of licences. The decision also excludes the Channel Seven and Channel Ten commercial networks, the News Corporation and Fairfax newspaper groups, the ABC and the government-owned Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. However, there will be open competition, with no restrictions on ownership, for the fifth and sixth channels, raising the possibility that Packer could gain sole control of one channel. The government had earlier indicated that the commercial networks would be allowed to hold up to 45 per cent of the equity in the first four channels, which would have had a monopoly of subscription television until 1999. Mr Keating said the regulations would lead to a significant reduction in media concentration by facilitating the entry into satellite television of new operators such as cinema proprietors, radio stations and programme makers. He said the rules would also allow the operators of the fifth and sixth channels to introduce advanced inter-active technology, which would have been excluded until 2000 under the earlier proposals. However, critics said the government would have to change the rules to allow greater foreign investment in the first four channels if insufficient Australian investors emerged.</p>

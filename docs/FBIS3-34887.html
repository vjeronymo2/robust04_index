Meanwhile, a prominent  Iranian opposition leader has revealed that "new forces and a  popular movement in the country are prepared to surge forward to  end the repressive dictatorship and replace it with a democratic  regime capable of saving Iran from catastrophe."    Tens of thousands of people poured onto Tehran's streets in  the direction of the great Freedom Square carrying placards  proclaiming "No Settlement With Enemies of Revolution," and  shouting such slogans as "Death to America" and "Death to  Israel." [passage omitted]    In an exclusive interview with AL-HAYAH from Tehran, Daryush  Foruhar (65 years old), leader of the Nation of Iran Party (the  oldest secular organization in the country), painted a gloomy  picture of the economic, political, and social situation. He  urged the clergy ruling Iran to "to vacate the place quietly and  let a democratic popular regime take over power and rescue the  country from the abyss it has been in since those who were  hungry for power wrested that power, isolated the country, and  cast it into the darkest reigns."    Foruhar accused the regime of deviating "from the  revolution's noble objectives" of turning Iran into a strong,  prosperous, and developing country taking its special place in  the world. He said that the dictatorial rulers "who have  savagely crushed the people's rights to happiness, civil  liberties, democracy for the parties and the press, and freedom  of publication and expression, have isolated themselves from the  people. History will show that a repressive regime rejected by  the people cannot survive."    Contrary to the claim by Hashemi-Rafsanjani and other  Iranian  leaders that Iran has made "unparalleled progress in all  fields," Foruhar described the situation as "catastrophic." He  spoke of "massive unemployment, shortages in almost everything  including such fields as health, medicine, and education,  corruption, bureacracy, high prices, and an increasing gap  between the poor and the new rich, while the authorities turn a  deaf ear to the people's grievances." He underscored the "social  disturbances and the destruction of industry and agriculture."  [passage omitted]    Foruhar refused to comment on the alleged assassination  attempt [on Hashemi-Rafsanjani], but he warned against "the  dangerous game" played by the regime in pitting the Sunnis  against the Shiites, as was recently the case in Zahedan, which  witnessed bloody clashes at the beginning of this month between  the town's population (mostly Sunnis) and the security forces.

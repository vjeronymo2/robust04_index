			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Maryukha report: "Petr Velikiy Should Join the </F> Russian Fleet in Time for Its 300th Anniversary"]    [Text] On the eve of its 300th anniversary the Russian  Navy has been beset by economic adversity like a "wolf pack" (a  tactic employed by German submariners during World War II --  author's note). Large surface ships with powerful arms enabling  them to perform a broad range of tasks have ended up the most  vulnerable and, as is the case in any war, the most tempting  "targets," albeit only financial.    At one time there were not even the funds to finish  construction of the last in a series of four ships -- the  nuclear-powered missile cruiser Petr Velikiy. The hull of the  fifth ship in this class was cut to "ribbons" shortly before the  scheduled commissioning of the Petr Velikiy. Thus, the ship  bearing the name of the founder of the regular Russian Navy has  turned out to be the last cruiser that the Navy hopes to receive  in the coming years.    Instead of taking to the seas back in 1991 the Petr Velikiy  was "frozen" in the waters of the Neva until last spring. Then  in April 1993 First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin  personally took charge of the allocation of funds for the  cruiser's completion. Certain representatives of Russia's  business class also displayed commercial patriotic sentiments.  Thus, the leadership of "Inkombank" expressed the desire to  donate 10 million rubles to the ship's construction -- free of  charge -- reviving the traditions of Russian patronage and  sponsorship of science and the state's defense programs. Just  over a year later, last May, the State Duma Committee for  Defense took charge of the Petr Velikiy's completion. At  working level -- according to the Russian Defense Ministry Press  and Information Directorate -- the work is being monitored, in  light of the extremely limited military budget, by the Defense  Ministry leadership, the Navy command, Viktor Glukhikh, chairman  of the Russian Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry,  and other officials who have been aboard the ship.    What is the significance of the ship, completion of whose  construction the Russian Defense Ministry describes as the  priority in shipbuilding in recent years? Conceived in the late  sixties, the nuclear-powered missile cruiser first took concrete  shape in 1980. Since then the state maritime interests of first  the Soviet Union and then Russia have gained a major defensive  tool -- with unlimited range, autonomy, and highly powerful  armaments. But Russian construction schedule overruns are  unknown to foreign navies, and the United States now regards its  Navy as the only one to hold sway in the oceans of the world.  The Petr Velikiy is necessary today in order to talk to them on  an equal footing and in order to ensure that Russia's  shipbuilding industry does not break up once and for all.    For three years now KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has been keeping a  careful eye on the fate of the cruiser, on which the "Baltiyskiy  Zavod" Joint-Stock Company, under the direction of chief  construction worker Gennadiy Starshinov, is completing the  installation of equipment and arms. Regrettably, we did not in  the past succeed in inducing our rich fellow citizens to provide  material assistance in the completion of the Varyag, although  the poor were willing to give their last cent to produce the  Navy's last aircraft carrier. But international relations  intervened then and the Varyag ended up outside Russia. The  Petr Velikiy is within Russia's borders and the schedule for the  completion of the work on it has stabilized, although the pace  of the work is slower than what is desirable. Nevertheless, the  cruiser can be expected to start mooring trials and a shakedown  cruise this year and it should certainly be commissioned in time  for the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy. However, it  would still be in order for entrepreneurs to help with its  completion. This tradition -- patronage of new ships -- is  worthy of revival, just as a powerful ocean-going Russian Navy  is worthy of revival.</p>

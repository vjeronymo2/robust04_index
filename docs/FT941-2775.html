			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (5): High tolls over the sea to Skye - Tom Lynch looks at government efforts to increase the private sector in the economy The bridge reaching out from the mainland to Skye is the most visible symbol of the government's determination to push forward the frontiers of the private sector in Scotland. Those frontiers will not be cheap: the bridge will have the highest tolls in Britain. Supporters of the project say that people pay for the less convenient ferries in any case, and that the bridge will be toll-free when the contractors pay off the cost of building it - some time in the next 20 years. Opponents say the bridge should be part of the roads system. They point to the low tolls on other bridges and lament the government's abandonment of its 1979 policy that the islands should not be disadvantaged by high transport costs. The bridge is being built by a joint venture between Miller Construction, a privately owned Edinburgh company, and Dykerhoff Widman. The consortium will operate the bridge and collect tolls. The scheme symbolises the government's determination to pursue its policies in a country where it is increasingly acclimatised to being a political minority. For example, only one tiny (80 pupils) school has voted to opt out of local authority control - and a strenuous political campaign, including intervention by the Sunday Times newspaper, failed to get the government a result at Paisley grammar school last year. In England and Wales, contracting out of local authority services had a high profile through the 1980s. Right-wing councils such as Wandsworth in London enthusiastically privatised service provision. In Scotland, there were no Wandsworths to blaze trails in the Labour-dominated local government scene, but compulsory tendering has brought a steady rise in contracting out. As in England and Wales, the electricity industry was sold. ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro Electric are regarded as the flagships of Scottish privatisation, realising Pounds 3.5bn, but water and sewerage were not. They were too firmly locked into the local authority structure (and the ultimate commercial sanction, disconnecting a household, is unlawful in Scotland). Almost all the factory portfolio of the Scottish Development Agency, now re-formed as Scottish Enterprise, was sold in 1990, and Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year in assets in the five new towns are being sold in preparation for their winding-up by 1996. The next move in privatisation is likely to be Scotrail, one of the first seven British Rail franchises to be offered. The government hopes that this will be run by the private sector by early 1995. The Scottish rail network is nearly self-contained: 95 per cent of services run entirely within Scotland. It is this which has impelled potential bidders to lobby for the franchise holder to have control of the track, as well as for the services. This vertical integration is strongly opposed by Railtrack, which is to take over ownership of BR's track and signalling, but there have been indications that the government may be sympathetic. In the Scottish Office - subjected to market testing, like the rest of the civil service - a steady Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year of work is being contracted out. The department has few large blocks of work to hive off: most management units employ fewer than 50. Scottish Enterprise and its equivalent, Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), and other quangoes such as the Scottish Tourist Board are required to contract out services where possible. HIE has even contracted out its investment appraisal. Steps are being taken to change the law to allow prison privatisation, legalised in England and Wales in 1990. State-owned bus operations have been sold and privatisation of council-owned fleets is well under way, but privatisation of Caledonian MacBrayne, the islands ferry operator, was rejected. KPMG is reviewing Scottish Office subsidies for all shipping services and is expected to report, within the next two months, on the scope for private sector involvement. The forestry industry (important in Scotland, overseen by the Scottish Office) is also under review. Outright privatisation is thought to have been rejected by the ministerial working group. It is expected to report later this year in favour of increased private sector participation. The local government reform bill, currently before parliament, provides for three new state corporations to run all water and sewerage from 1996. Lack of private sector expertise in the area means that English and French companies are prominent in offering the sought-for private investment; councils are discussing, with private sector consortia, about a dozen 'build, own and operate' schemes for sewerage provision valued at Pounds 1bn. However, there are hopes that Scottish utilities may take an interest. This new stress on private participation in the public sector, spearheaded by the government's private finance initiative, is allowing the pace of privatisation in its broadest sense to accelerate in Scotland. The increase in tempo poses a challenge for Scotland's private sector. Because contracting out has been slow to get off the mark, Scottish companies are less likely than their southern colleagues to have the bidding expertise. Current uncertainty over transfer of undertaking rules - the EU directive which protects the rights of workers whose jobs are contracted out - is having a particular effect on smaller companies thinking of bidding for some of the packages of work on offer. Mr Peter Fleming-Wilson, former chairman of the Cleaning and Support Services Association, says it is difficult for contractors to decide whether it is sensible to bid, when even taking counsel's opinion on whether the rules apply is expensive. He believes a pattern is beginning to emerge, although contractors still have to do their homework. Neither does he feel that all councils are as helpful to contractors as they might be. True, the Scottish Office has seldom found grounds for intervening in tendering exercises, and no direct labour organisations have been closed down, as has happened in England. Tendering will be slowed during local government reorganisation.</p>

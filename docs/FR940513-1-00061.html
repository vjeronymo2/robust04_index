Section 169A called for EPA to, among other things, issue regulations to assure reasonable progress toward meeting the National goal, section 169A(a)(4), including requiring each State with a mandatory Class I Federal area to revise its State implementation plan (SIP) to contain such emission limits, schedules of compliance and other measures as may be necessary to make reasonable progress toward meeting the National goal.

The regulations provided for the remedying of visibility impairment that is reasonably attributable to a single existing stationary facility or small group of existing stationary facilities. These regualtions required that the SIPs provide for periodic review and revisions, as appropriate, of the long-term strategy not less frequent than every three years, that the review process include consultation with the appropriate FLMs and that the State report to the public and EPA a specified assessment of its progress toward the National goal. See 40 CFR 51.306(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544) and November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45132), EPA disapproved SIPs of states that failed to comply with the requirements of, among others, the provisions of 40 CFR 51.302 (visibility general plan requirements), 51.305 (visibility monitoring), and 51.306 (visibility Long-Term Strategy). EPA also incorporated corresponding Federal plans and regulations into the SIPs of these states pursuant to section 110(c)(1) of the Act. The Governor of Colorado submitted a SIP revision for visibility protection on December 21, 1987, which met the criteria of 40 CFR 51.302, 51.305, and 51.306 and consisted of five major sections: existing impairment, new source review, consultation with Federal land managers, monitoring strategy, and the long-term strategy. EPA approved this SIP revision in an August 12, 1988  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document (53 FR 30428), and these revisions replaced the Federal plans and regulations in the Colorado Visibility SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Revisions Submitted November 18, 1992 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At its public hearing on August 20, 1992, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC) adopted revisions to the Long-Term Strategy of the Class I Visibility SIP and revisions concerning the Long-Term Strategy in Commission Regulation No. 3. These revisions require the Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) to review the Long-Term Strategy and report on visibility progress at regular intervals. In a letter dated November 18, 1992, the Governor of Colorado submitted these revisions to EPA. These revisions were made to bring the plan into compliance with Federal regulation and to fulfill the Federal and Colorado requirements to review and, if necessary, revise the Long-Term Strategy at least every three years. This submittal updates the State's Visibility Long-Term Strategy and makes it consistent with Federal requirements. Pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act, EPA found the submittal to be complete and so notified the Governor in a letter dated January 15, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation No. 3 previously required a Long-Term Strategy review/revision report from the APCD to the AQCC every three years following the effective date of the regulation (November 1987). The August 1992 Long-Term Strategy report was the first to be completed by APCD and, therefore, was behind schedule in arriving at the AQCC (i.e., it should have been prepared by 1990). The purpose of the regulatory change was to clarify, in light of the delay in submitting the initial report, when subsequent Long-Term Strategy review and revision report cycles would occur. Without this regulatory change, the next Long-Term Strategy review would have been due September 1993_approximately a year from the adoption of the August 1992 report. To adjust the reporting schedule, the regulation was revised. The revision indicates that the Long-Term Strategy report will be made available by September 1 at least every third year following the submittal of the previous report. If the proposed approval of this revision is finalized by EPA, the submittal of the next report by September 1, 1995 will be a federally-enforceable obligation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation No. 3 was also revised to clear up a discrepancy with EPA requirements regarding the scope of review of the Long-Term Strategy. Among the items indicated for review in the previous version of the regulation was the ``progress achieved in developing the components of the Long-Term Strategy.'' The State revised the language to indicate that the Long-Term Strategy must be reviewed, among other things, to determine ``[t]he need for BART [Best Available Retrofit Technology] to remedy existing impairment in an integral vista declared since plan approval.'' This change brings the State's program into conformance with EPA regulations. See 40 CFR 51.306(c)(7). Declaration of an integral vista allows for protection of visibility resources outside a mandatory Class I area affecting views from within the area. See 40 CFR 51.301(n). The State has not identified any integral vistas at this time, but may do so in the future at its discretion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, this SIP revision consists of replacing the original Long-Term Strategy with the revised Long-Term Strategy adopted by the State in August, 1992. The SIP revisions address when the Long-Term Strategy review is to be completed, factors to be assessed in periodic Long-Term Strategy reviews, and components of the Long-Term Strategy plan (e.g., existing impairment, prevention of future impairment, smoke management practices, Federal land manager consultation and communication, and annual visibility data reports). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a February 18, 1993 letter from Doug Skie, EPA, to Paul Frohardt, APCD, EPA requested additional information to determine the approvability of the SIP revisions. From a technical standpoint, EPA found the Long-Term Strategy review and report complete and fully approvable. However, the revision to the timing of the reporting schedule raised some concerns. According to Federal regulation (40 CFR 51.306), ``[t]he plan must provide for periodic review and revision, as appropriate, of the long- term strategy not less frequent than every three years.'' Colorado's reviews should have occurred in 1990, 1993, 1996, and so forth. The August 20, 1992 review and report were nearly two years late. Rather than conducting another review in 1993, the revision changed the schedule to provide for review at least every third year following the submittal of the previous report. Therefore, since the first report was prepared in 1992, the reviews would occur in 1992, 1995, 1998, and so forth. In effect, only two reviews/reports would be submitted to EPA through 1996, when three reports should have been provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the State committed in a March 5, 1993 letter to Doug Skie, EPA, to prepare and submit a brief informal status report on the Long-Term Strategy by November, 1993. In this way, the State will have provided three reports through the 1996 timeframe (1992, 1993, 1995). The State fulfilled its commitment by submitting to EPA an informal Long-Term Strategy status report dated December 1, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State believes that the Long-Term Strategy revisions to the Visibility SIP will provide for continued Class I visibility protection in Colorado, as well as bring the SIP into conformance with Federal requirements for Long- Term Strategy review. This action was requested by the State of Colorado.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also proposing, under section 110(k)(6) of the Clean Air Act, to correct the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a) (``Visibility protection''). This provision incorrectly states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When EPA initially approved the general elements of Colorado's visibility protection program on August 12, 1988 (53 FR 30428), the State's visibility new source review (NSR) regulations had not yet been approved. Therefore, the program disapproval of 40 CFR 52.344(a), quoted above, which had been adopted on July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544), was retained. Colorado's visibility NSR regulations were approved on December 1, 1988 as to industrial source categories for which EPA had approved Colorado's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and nonattainment NSR permit requirements (53 FR 48537). For other sources, for which Colorado did not have approved PSD and nonattainment NSR regulations, EPA disapproved the State's visibility NSR regulations and continued to implement Federal regulations in 40 CFR 52.26 and 52.28, as incorporated into the Colorado SIP. This exception to approval is noted in 40 CFR 52.344(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of approval of the visibility NSR regulations, the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a), relating to over-all program disapproval, should have been revised to indicate that Colorado's visibility protection program was approved, with the exception of visibility NSR as it applied to certain industrial source categories. With this notice, EPA proposes to correct section 52.344(a) to accurately reflect the status of program approval in Colorado. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Implications of This Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has reviewed the adequacy of Colorado's Long-term strategy review and revisions relative to its date of adoption in 1992. EPA is proposing to approve Colorado's revision to the Long-Term Strategy of the Class I Visibility Protection SIP, as submitted by the Governor with a letter dated November 18, 1992. EPA is also proposing to approve revisions to Colorado AQCC Regulation No. 3 to bring it into conformance with Federal requirements for the Long-Term Strategy and to revise the reporting schedule. EPA proposes to determine that these revisions are consistent with applicable Federal requirements for Long-Term Strategy review under the Clean Air Act's visibility protection program for mandatory Class I Federal Areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also proposing to correct its error in failing to accurately reflect Colorado's Visibility SIP approval status in a previous action on the State's Visibility protection provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Request for Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will consider any comments received by June 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Executive Order (EO) 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Regulatory Flexibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur oxides, Volatile organic compounds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 3, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jack W.

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / More spending cuts on way, Irish warned MR Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, warned yesterday that further cuts in government expenditure were likely to be implemented this year to keep borrowing projections on target. Speaking to the Dail (parliament) in its last session before the summer recess, he said: 'While the recent half-yearly Exchequer returns show a somewhat better picture than in mid-1991, it is clear that adherence to this year's budgetary parameters will require some corrective action. Accordingly I have initiated a review of all areas of public expenditure to see where expenditure can be pared back. I intend to ensure that there is no significant slippage from our budgetary targets this year.' The government is aiming at a ceiling on the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement of IPounds 600m (Pounds 552m), or 2.5 per cent of gross national product for 1992. Mr Ahern said the cost of pay awards in the public sector 'continues to be an area of concern.' He said future wage negotiations would emphasise improved efficiency 'to offset any increases in pay' and 'more weight is to be given to 'ability to pay' and budgetary considerations.' Deferred pay awards are expected to bring government finances under increased pressure in 1993 and 1994.</p>

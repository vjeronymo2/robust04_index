			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE, YES; BUT IS IT YET HUMAN LIFE?;  </P> <P> ABORTION: THIS IS NO ISSUE FOR LEGISLATORS WHO UNDERCUT THE WELL-BEING OF WOMEN  AND CHILDREN ALREADY ALIVE.  </P> <P> AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS ON ABORTION  </P> <P> * William Sloane Coffin and Thomas J. Gumbleton are both active in disarmament  and social justice organizations and are friends. But they disagree, as do  their respective organizations, on the right to abortion. In these public  letters they discuss their views. Coffin, a United Church of Christ clergyman,  is president of Sane/Freeze Campaign for Global Security, based in Washington.  Gumbleton, a Roman Catholic bishop in Detroit, is president of Pax Christi  U.S.A., the National Catholic Peace Movement, based in Erie, Pa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dear Tom,  </P> <P> Our two organizations have long collaborated closely even as you and I have  personally. Our members see eye-to-eye on the urgent need for disarmament,  greater economic justice and a life style more considerate of the environment.  However, on abortion they disagree.  </P> <P> I worry about this threat to our warm relations. It is a continuing one, for  abortion will be hotly debated in legislative and electoral battles across the  land for some time to come.  </P> <P> So, not as a peace organization president but as friend to friend I'm writing  in the hope that you and I might find language in common to help people think  more clearly, and that we might even reach agreement on the government's proper  role in this matter.  </P> <P> Regarding abortion, the crucial question for many religious people is, "At what  point, if at any, can unborn life be called human?" Complicating the answer is  the fact that science can't provide it. Science can tell us when a heart starts  beating, as it can when a brain has stopped functioning. But science cannot  tell us when it is morally right to cease all artificial supports for a dying  person, because science is not in a position to declare, "This is no longer a  human being." It is the business of science to provide the facts of natural  life, not the values of human life. In other words, when human life ends and  when human life begins are moral judgments, not medical ones. So far, I think  we are in agreement.  </P> <P> It goes without saying that a fertilized egg in a woman's uterus is human in  origin and human in destiny. But is that enough to warrant calling a fertilized  egg -- as did a recent Missouri law -- a human being with "all the rights,  privileges and immunities available to persons, citizens, and residents of this  state?" Doesn't the traditional Roman Catholic developmental view of life make  as much sense as the recent one that seeks to erase all distinctions between  potential life and actual life? And, in fact, don't we all act as if there were  a difference between potential and actual life. When a fetus aborts  spontaneously, we grieve for the parents, hardly at all for the life no one has  seen. We don't have funerals for unborn children. No one urges the same  punishment for a mother who aborts a fetus as for one who murders her child.  And no one, to my knowledge, has applied for Social Security nine months before  his or her 62nd birthday!  </P> <P> In the absence of agreement on when human life begins, we have to agree to  disagree -- but hopefully with more clarity than is usual, and in a less  judgmental fashion, so that disagreements don't shade off into distrust.  </P> <P> I also hope that there might be greater consensus among us when we consider the  advisability of criminalizing abortion. To call a crime something a great many  people don't even consider a sin is, to say the least, problematic. As a canon  lawyer, you know that one of the criteria for a good law is its enforceability;  that is why precisely, after they proved unenforceable, that the Prohibition  laws of the 1920s were finally repealed in 1934.  </P> <P> Today a large number of Roman Catholics feel, as do many of the rest of us,  that no one has a ghost of a chance of enforcing anti-abortion laws. Many have  reluctantly reached Gov. Mario Cuomo's conclusion, that abortion should be  removed from the field of legislation. To pass laws that would significantly  lower only the number of legal abortions but not the number of abortions  themselves -- such an action might be emotionally satisfying but hardly morally  so. These thoughtful religious people are, in effect, anti-abortion and  pro-choice.  </P> <P> While longing for unity on this position, I recognize that all will not be of  one mind regarding the inadvisability of criminalizing abortion. If what  separates us is only a judgment call, I have no fears for our future unity on  the issues that unite us. And you know my admiration for the way all members of  Pax Christi embrace the "seamless garment" doctrine, which seeks to affirm and  protect life both within the womb and without. The Reagan Administration  discredited the pro-life movement by first preaching the sanctity of even  unwanted pregnancies, and then attacking nutrition programs for pregnant  mothers, Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps. Ironically,  today, those states most inclined to criminalize abortion are those with the  worst records for public health care, education and civil-rights enforcement.  </P> <P> Finally, I'm confident that I speak for both of us when I say that the chief  enemy to life, inside or outside the womb, continues to be the arms race,  which, despite the winding down of the Cold War, continues almost unabated.  Because of the resources it saps, millions have died who could have lived, and  the 50,000 nuclear warheads in the arsenals of the superpowers, have, of  course, the capacity to abort the entire human race.  </P> <P> As always, God bless you, dear Tom. I'd love to hear from you.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Government Decision, Party Resolution, Public </F> Opinion; What Really Counts Is National Survival"]    [Text] In our capacity as the people of a country with a  democratic government, we have no doubt that national survival  depends on the fact that the minority must accept opinions of  the majority, that the rules are made by the voice of the  majority, no matter the government, political party, or any  interest group. Yet, this must go in accordance with the trend  of the society and reflect the desire of the majority -- a true  majority, and not a majority by some who claim to represent the  people since that would be a distortion of the democratic  principle.    We disagree with the prime minister's stand concerning the  current situation. He said that government decisions must be  used as guidance whereas resolutions of political parties can be  taken into account as composite. We, on the other hand, think  that, in the present situation, the government decision, which  mainly reflects the thinking of the Democrat Party, rather  serves to "block" than "solve" the current crisis. It is  different in nature from the motion proposed by the Phalang Tham  Party that a committee be set up to compile and rewrite a draft  constitution, or the proposal made by the New Aspiration Party  that Article 211 of the Constitution be amended to pave the way  for the appointment of a constitution drafting council.    The Democrat Party has been trying to block all passages  leading to a solution to the problem. It pressured the Phalang  Tham Party to have the party withdraw its motion, claiming  political etiquette as a pretext. It also tried to confuse the  public about the New Aspiration Party's proposal to amend  Article 211 of the Constitution saying the move was illegal and  that the party should have proposed such an amendment to the  Special House Committee Scrutinizing the Draft Constitution.    By talking about political etiquette and appealing for  proper  steps to be followed to solve the problem, the Democrat Party  made us realize that it has lost sight of the real problem; the  nation has already been divided into two lines of thinking with  a tendency towards violence at any time. This is not the right  time to interpret the Constitution by the letters of the words  -- what is legal or illegal. At this moment, we must join  together in order to find a solution to avoid confrontation.    We support the move taken by the Organization for Political  Reforms that undesirable violence must be avoided at all costs.  We support the organization's appeal to the speaker of the House  of Representatives to table the Phalang Tham Party's motion on  agenda for deliberations at the earliest, either on Wednesday or  Thursday. We call on the parliamentarians to approve the motion  in order to pave the way for the drafting of a constitution of  the people. This may seem difficult to materialize, but the  process will enable the people to see more clearly the true  color of political parties prior to another general election.    No matter what the option -- the Phalang Tham Party's motion  or the proposal by the New Aspiration Party, it is quite clear  now that the government will not be able to control the majority  in the parliament. In the name of the people of a country under  a democratic government, we would like to ask the government to  return the "power" to the people so that they can make a  decision by themselves in keeping with the trend of society.  That would be the most correct way to solve this national  crisis at the time we are experiencing the absence of  "leadership."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] On 27 June in Havana, Bolivian Ambassador Juan  Franklin Anaya Vasquez said that Cuba and Bolivia are currently  engaged in strengthening political and economic relations. Anaya  told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and Bolivia have nearly completed  an air navigation agreement. The accord, once signed, will allow  for Cubana de Aviacion and (Lloyd) Aero Boliviano planes to fly  between La Paz and Havana. Anaya emphasized the importance of  this accord, based on increased tourism to Cuba, not only from  Bolivia, but also from other nations of the region's southern  cone.    Anaya added in his statement to PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and  Bolivia are analyzing increased trade in several areas. La Paz  is studying the possibilities of a visit with Cuban authorities  in Havana by Bolivian businessmen, enabling them to identify  possibilities for investment. Anaya noted that politically,  Bolivia condemns the inhumane U.S. blockade against Cuba just as  it condemns other measures that oppress the people. Anaya  pointed out that in the area of culture, the work done by Cuban  teachers in all fields has been positive, with emphasis on  ballet specialists and various artistic groups.</p>

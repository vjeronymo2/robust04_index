Welcoming the guest, the president said that it is important  for Poland and Hungary to speak up on issues that are important  for Europe because "others can do something for us and without  us [as received]."    In Walesa's opinion, both countries should maintain working  contacts "in the context" of the situation in Europe, "which  determines our security and prosperity." Walesa said that the  Partnership for Peace proposal can be a considerable partnership  if "we decide about its shape ourselves." He added that the  gifts are nice but do not always "suit our appetite."    Minister Jeszenszky stated that decisions made in Brussels  and Prague "would not have been as significant without the work  of Poland and the Polish president." He added that it is  important to keep U.S. and West European politicians to their  word and ensure that they fulfill their promises. "We have  reasons to hope, but we also have reasons to be concerned,"  Jeszenszky said.</p>

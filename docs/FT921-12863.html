			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Platinum prices hit Rustenburg LOWER platinum prices contributed to a 19 per cent fall in Rustenburg Platinum's pre-tax profits to R498.8m (Dollars 179.4m) for the six months to December. Sales at the world's largest platinum producer, which is part of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, fell 15 per cent to R1.5bn as values of platinum and rhodium, a by-product of mining platinum, slid by 12 per cent and 17 per cent respectively over the reporting period. Despite a reduction in costs, profits on metal sales still dropped by 15.2 per cent to R558.5m. After taking account of renewals and replacements charges, and tax, lease and tax normalisation, distributable profits fell 17.7 per cent to R219.7m. This was slightly better than market expectations of a 20 to 25 per cent decline in earnings. It is a measure of the difficulties the platinum industry is experiencing that Rustenburg, which has a strong balance sheet, saw fit to cut its interim dividend to 87.5 cents a share from 125 cents. Earnings per share dropped to 175.3 cents from 213.1 cents, so dividend cover was lifted from 1.7 to 2. The company notes that metal prices, particularly rhodium, are currently below those achieved in the first half of the year, and if they don't improve results for the second half will be weaker. Lebowa Platinum, a smaller platinum producer also in the JCI group, made an after-tax loss of R9.4m compared with a R1.2m profit in the previous period. This was largely a function of the high costs in relation to revenue because of the mine's sustained drive to increase tonnage milled to 70,000 tonnes per month. Tonnage milled did increase by 52.3 per cent to approach 60,000 tonnes per month, but revenues were only up by 12.3 per cent because of lower metal prices and lower than planned head grades Because of the cash-flow strain the mine is experiencing, the company has decided to expand output from 70,000 to 100,000 tonnes per month. This will be achieved through mining outcrop ore using open-cast methods rather than through underground production.</p>

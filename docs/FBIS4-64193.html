			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The `Molav' Vision--State Government </F> Modernization: Not Much Is Left of Gerhard Schroeder's Leftist  Profile"]    [Text] After having won the election, Social Democrat  Gerhard Schroeder stepped up to the podium of the land  parliament and announced great goals: the ecological  restructuring of industry, strengthening of the  extraparliamentary environmental movement, more social  justice--in short: reforms for "almost all political sectors."    That was in 1990. Schroeder, now 50, had just succeeded  Christian Democrat Ernst Albrecht as minister-president. Four  years later, a little more than a month after his reelection  (44.3 percent), the Social Democrat's pronouncements sound a lot  more muted.    The former visionary, who can now govern without the Green  partner, now only tries to secure what has been achieved. His  most exciting goal for the chronically debt-ridden land is  "Molav." This government in-house shorthand stands for  "modernization of the land administration."    For over a year, the Interior Ministry has been collecting  proposals on how to clean up the civil service  apparatus--whether the chambers of agriculture could do with  less personnel, or if road construction offices could be closed  down. The first success: Last week, the cabinet eliminated the  superfluous position of land mandatary for the disciplinary  system.    The Green's top woman, Andrea Hoops, says spitefully that  Lower Saxony's policies in the future will be "a good deal more  provincial" than in the days when the Greens still cogoverned in  Hannover.    Schroeder's reform zeal is being checked by the tight  situation in the land parliament. Although the SPD [Social  Democratic Party] has an absolute one-vote majority in the  parliament, it is awfully close. Controversial plans from the  red-green times, such as introduction of a local transport levy,  are simply being dropped. In such ideologically burdened  projects, Schroeder cannot be sure of all his followers.    True, left Social Democrats such as representative Heinrich  Aller, 46, and Wolfgang Juettner, 46, head of the Hannover SPD  bezirk, admonish that the new government must not leave "ecology  to the old coalition partner" (Aller).    But the head of government no longer seeks his salvation in  nature: Just now, of all people he praised the "amigos" of the  Bavarian CSU [Christian Social Union] for their industrial  policy.    The comrades swallowed it without a murmur. Not even  Environmental Minister Monika Griefahn dared any criticism.    For that, she--the most popular SPD figure in Lower Saxony  after Schroeder--is allowed to stay in office. Agriculture  Minister Karl-Heinz Funke also can keep his post. Although he  failed in his fight with the Brussels EU [European Union]  headquarters over swine fever, he gained great popularity with  Lower Saxony's farmers for his pithy sayings.    Schroeder's simple personnel policy maxim: Whoever is  popular--and knuckles under--is allowed to stay on.    So the new cabinet will be largely identical to the old one.  Only in the succession to the Green Women's Affairs Minister,  Waltraud Schoppe, Schroeder had to give in to the party's will.  Originally, the chief of government simply wanted to abolish the  Women's Ministry. But the few SPD women in parliament managed to  have deputy land chairman Christina Buehrmann become Schoppe's  successor. The new cabinet member is too much of a feminist for  Schroeder.    The Ministry for Federal and European Affairs, up to now  headed by Green Juergen Trittin, will definitely be dissolved.  Although this impresses the citizens, the savings effect for  Molav is small.    Asylum-seekers, resettlers, and civil war refugees, for whom  leftist Trittin had been responsible, are now under the charge  of conservative Interior Minister Gerhard Glogowski--that, too,  is a signal.    Schroeder himself will administer the most important part of  the Trittin ministry so that those in Bonn will not forget him:  representation of Lower Saxony in the Bundesrat.    The comrade has announced that, from now on, he will  "massively intervene" in federal affairs--hard times for his  rival and party friend, Rudolf Scharping.    Only a few days after his reelection, Schroeder showed  Scharping what he has in mind: He stated in Bonn that there is  not going to be any generally observed speed limit on the pace  set by SPD. Three days later, at the official presentation of  the SPD election platform, Scharping was allowed to confirm what  the man from Lower Saxony had already announced previously.</p>

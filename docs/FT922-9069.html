			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: When can I gross up? SINCE 1981-82 I have included income from Guaranteed Income Bonds in my tax return, and they have always been dealt with as 'Chargeable Events': ie they have not been 'grossed up' for purposes of calculating higher rate tax. I have before me a cutting from Weekend FT of June 23 1990 in which John Edwards wrote that, unlike building society interest, guaranteed income bonds were not grossed up for calculating the higher rate. In my assessment from the Norwich Tax Office for 1989-90, they grossed up this income, but on appeal they amended it without question. For 1990-91 however, they grossed this income up again and on appeal they are refusing to amend it, saying it must be grossed up. What is the true position? Your appeal may be being dealt with by a junior inspector who has not been adequately trained. Point out to him (or her) that there are no grossing-up provisions in sections 541(1) and 547(1)(a) &amp; (5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. If by chance you have any more trouble on this point, write to the District Inspector (whose name will be at the top of the letter from the junior inspector), asking him or her to transfer your file to one of his or her assistants who is more familiar with the relevant sections of the Taxes Act. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 12 (AFP) -- Yemen looks set to  emerge from its civil war with a badly-damaged infrastructure, a  shattered army and the spectre of political uncertainty scaring  away potential investors for some time to come.    Already one of the world's poorest countries, Yemen can ill  afford the added strain on its struggling economy of a  full-scale war between rival north and south leaders.    Airports, harbours, a key oil refinery, roads and water and  power plants are reported to have sustained heavy damage in the  five-week- old civil war put at billions of dollars by a  southern leader.    The appointed foreign minister of the breakaway southern  state of the Yemen Democratic Republic 'Abdallah al-Asnaj told  AFP Yemen would be counting on regional and international aid to  fund reconstruction.    "The war will have serious consequences on the economy.  Losses are very large and surpass all estimates. They are in  billions of dollars because the infrastructure and public  utilities have been badly damaged," al-Asnaj told AFP during a  visit to Abu Dhabi.    But any outside aid could prove to be at the expense of  development promised when the former conservative North Yemen  and the Marxist South were merged in May 1990.    "We hope Arab and international funds will extend aid to  help  us in rebuilding after the war.    "We will also use our own resources. But this will be at the  expense of development and the aid will only aggravate our debt  problems. In a nutshell, the economic situation will be  horrible," he said.    Even before the war broke out on May 5, Yemen's economy was  reeling under heavy debt, inflation, negative growth,  unemployment and deficits in its budget and balance of payments.    The country's debt is estimated at seven to nine billion  dollars and its budget deficit was projected at around 800  million dollars in 1993, nearly 83 percent of the revenues.    Inflation was as high as 35 percent in 1992, putting further  pressure on the national currency the riyal.    Its current account suffered a 342 million dollars deficit  in  1992 while exports remained far below imports, standing at 27  million dollars and 119 million dollars a month respectively in  the first half of 1993.    Despite a steady increase in oil output peaking at its  current 335,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with 200,000  (bpd) in 1993, Yemen's Gross Domestic Product recorded negative  growths of 2.5 and 3.9 percent in 1992 and 1991. No official  figures on the economy were published in 1993.    "Yemen's economy had just started to stand on its feet with  more oil exports and economic reforms. But after such damage to  its vital facilities, it appears to be back to the scratch," a  Western diplomat said.    The diplomat added that whatever the outcome of the power  struggle between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his southern  rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid "the political atmosphere will remain  poisoned for a long time (...) this will naturally affect the  flow of aid and investment."    Al-Asnaj said: "We will not be able to stand on our feet  alone. We need help from our brothers. The task of  reconstruction is not easy and economic difficulties could  exacerbate social problems."    The country's economic problems were further worsened during  the Gulf crisis when Saudi Arabia expelled more than 700,000  Yemenis in retaliation for Sanaa's perceived sympathy with the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.    Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states were the main aid  donors to Yemen before they froze assistance following the  invasion.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Miners at odds with view of TUC: Unions attack report THE report was cautiously welcomed by the Trades Union Congress and heartily denounced by all the miners' unions, indicating that the labour movement's unified approach to the campaign against pit closures may come under strain. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, the biggest mining union, said the report was 'unacceptable' and failed to deal with the central issues. Mr Neil Greatrex, leader of the smaller Union of Democratic Mineworkers which is not affiliated to the TUC, also said he was 'bitterly disappointed'. He added: 'Obviously there are parts of the report we like, such as the fact that all pits should go through the review procedure, but we believe that all 31 pits (initially marked for closure) should be saved.' It was unfair to penalise pits where the UDM was the main union. Those pits had less room for productivity improvements now because of greater flexibility in the past few years. The NUM will be backed in its opposition by the RMT, the main rail union. The RMT has just been told that a further 2,000 rail jobs are to go before March in addition to the 5,000 announced in November. The TUC, and large unions such as the TGWU and GMB general unions, gave their qualified support to the report. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said: 'The select committee are to be congratulated on providing a helpful report which opens the way forward'. BACM, the pit managers' union, also welcomed the report. The Coalfield Communities Campaign, which involves community groups and local authorities in the affected areas and opposes the closures described as 'excellent' the suggestion that the nuclear levy should be paid into a fund rather than to Nuclear Electric. Mr Ian Powe, director of said the Gas Consumers Council, said: 'A subsidy is good news for miners and gas consumers alike. A bigger market for coal will slow down the depletion of precious UK gas reserves. British Gas said: 'The report is extremely detailed and constructive and will add greatly to the debate. We must however await the government recommendations before responding in detail.'</p>

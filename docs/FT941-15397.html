			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Ex-Communist is elected speaker Mr Ivan Rybkin, a true believer who remained in the Communist Party well after it became fashionable to leave, was yesterday elected speaker of Russia's lower chamber of parliament, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. A party apparatchik who joined the Agrarian Party just before last month's elections, Mr Rybkin was the agreed candidate of pro-Communists and ultra-nationalists who dominate the newly-elected State Duma. Despite a solid boycott by Russia's Choice and other pro-reformist parties, his victory was a consequence of the unity of the more numerous conservatives. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, head of the small Party of Russian Unity and Accord, said Mr Rybkin was a capable organiser but his independence was limited by the fact he owed his election to the support of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party. Russian troops in Latvia and Estonia have been told to return fire and shoot to kill if there are any attempts to seize their military installations, a Russian military statement said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. The north-western command of Russian forces issued the order following temporary detention of two Russian generals by Latvian civil defence units and the blockading of military installations in Latvia on January 10.</p>

He added that he is confident that Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria will not run for the post.    The Costa Rican foreign minister said he has been virtually  elected OAS secretary general because he has the confirmed  support of 23 countries: He needs 18 votes to be elected.    [Begin Niehaus recording] If elections are held without  pressure -- in Costa Rica we call it arm twisting -- we will  obviously win. [end recording]    Referring to the possible confirmation of Colombian  President  Cesar Gaviria's candidacy to the post, he clearly suggested that  Gaviria give up the possibility of officially announcing his  candidacy.    [Begin Niehaus recording] Twenty-two or 23 countries are  convinced this is fair. I am sure other countries will join  them. Above all, I am sure -- and I say it with great respect --  that President Gaviria will take these aspects into  consideration and abstain from officially announcing his  candidacy.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by D. Bisenic: "Let Milosevic Assume Responsibility </F> for Yugoslavia"]    [Text] A discussion on how the federal state is functioning  should be held immediately, at an extraordinary session of the  Federal Assembly. This has been suggested by Zoran Djindjic,  president of the Democratic Party, explaining for BORBA the  initiative according to which the top posts in that state ought  to be held by the "most important people," while the state ought  to become a federation in the real sense of the word.    "At this session, the government, which is only a `feather  among whirlwinds,' should be voted out. It is necessary,  without shrinking from it, to raise the question of the post of  FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] President [Zoran] Lilic and  establish what his role is, since he is only a political mask,"  Djindjic said.    According to Djindjic, this discussion should be held in the  Federal Assembly among the parliamentary parties. They should  establish whether there is a consensus on this and what the  contentions issue are. "We already have two years of  experience. This debate should be followed by federal elections  at which the citizens would vote for a concept that the parties  that win the majority of votes must put into practice. The  citizens are now being deceived because they voted for a federal  state, but, in essence, only got an illusory federal state," the  leader of the Democratic Party said.    It is high time, Djindjic said, that the Socialist Party of  Serbia explain its views on Yugoslavia, because the comedy of  the federal state may be funny, but the consequences are tragic.  Judged according to their importance, [President] Lilic, [Prime  Minister Radoje] Kontic, Bozovic [chairman of the Chamber of  Citizens], and Radulovic [chairman of the Chamber of Republics],  as the four top officials of the state, cannot even be  considered second-rate politicians. We demand that the ruling  parties and these people say whether they really want a federal  state, or whether they need it only as a front for the  republican states. If they want the former, then they should  find different persons for these posts. If they want the  latter, then this is too expensive for the people. The crisis  in the federal parliament is the right opportunity to find an  answer to these issues. We as a party hold the view that the  top posts in the top organs in a modern federal state should be  held by the most influential politicians of Serbia and  Montenegro. I do not see any reason why [Serbian President  Slobodan] Milosevic should not assume responsibility for  Yugoslavia, why [Montenegrin President Momir] Bulatovic should  not be prime minister, why Djukanovic [Montenegrin prime  minister and defense minister] should not be finance minister,  why Marovic should not be chairman of the Chamber of Republics,  and so forth.    Neither Bozovic, nor Sainovic, nor the other spent officials  that were put on this sidetrack called the federal state have  any influence on internal or foreign policy. Those who are  indeed in charge of the policies should be in the posts from  which they can do it legally, Djindjic said. Djindjic also said  that one should discard the confederal elements and create a  clear decisionmaking pyramid. These top posts should be filled  with respectable politicians.    The Democratic Party proposed this initiative to other  parties at the recent interparties meetings.    If the ruling parties reply negatively to this initiative,  Djindjic said that this would be a kind of answer that is only  prolonging this deception, torturing people, and discrediting  the very idea of the state.</p>

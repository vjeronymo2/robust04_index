			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 ROOF BLAZES BLAMED ON HOME FIREPLACES  </P> <P> Three Christmas Day fires -- including one started by burning gift boxes and  wrapping -- caused substantial damage to two homes and minor damage to another,  Orange County fire officials said.  </P> <P> The blazes, in Placentia, Yorba Linda and Villa Park, all started on the roofs  of the houses, said Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan Young. In one of  the fires, a homeowner was unaware that his roof was on fire until a neighbor  pounded on his door to warn him.  </P> <P> Young said the homeowner, identified as Richard McMillan, 43, of Potomac  Avenue, Placentia, was "up with his kids, who were playing with their toys, and  smelled smoke" shortly after 9 a.m., but was unable to determine the source.  </P> <P> "About 10 minutes later, (a neighbor) came over and pounded on the door, saying  that the roof was on fire," Young said.  </P> <P> The fire, caused by burning embers from the fireplace, was brought under  control in 30 minutes and caused $140,000 in damage, he said.  </P> <P> In the Yorba Linda fire, a couple was in their Casa Loma Avenue home when they  smelled smoke and discovered that their roof was engulfed by flames. They  called 911 at 11:40 a.m. to report the fire at their converted farmhouse, Young  said.  </P> <P> Young said investigators determined that cracks in the chimney's mortar allowed  heat to escape into the attic and set combustible materials ablaze. Fire damage  was set at $80,000.  </P> <P> In the third blaze, investigators determined that burning wrapping paper was  the cause of a Villa Park fire on Dorothy Circle.  </P> <P> Young said the homeowner was in his home with eight other people when his  fireplace "went out of control."  </P> <P> "He was burning some Christmas wrappings and boxes, which we specifically (tell  residents) 'don't do,' " Young said. "Sections of boxes and paper blew right up  through the chimney and landed on the roof, which caught fire."  </P> <P> King and his other guests battled the blaze with garden hoses and kept damage  to a minimum.  </P></p>

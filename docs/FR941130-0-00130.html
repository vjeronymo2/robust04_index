			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ANPRM asked whether the rule should contain only the advertising and sale restrictions of sections 380.18a and 399.87 of the current Super Bowl rule, or whether it should also contain the ``money back guarantee'' of sections 380.32 and 380.33 and/or the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures of section 380.31(c). Except for NTA, all commenters that expressed a position on this question felt that some form of regulation along these lines was appropriate. NTA stated that the majority of its members that responded to a poll on this matter felt that regulation of special-event tours should not be a responsibility of the government, but the association said that in the event a rule is adopted it favors the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures of section 380.31(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASTA and the Wisconsin Attorney General also expressed support for the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures. They favored the ``money back guarantee'' as well, as did the RG Travel Companies, the National Air Carrier Association (NACA, an organization of charter airlines), the NHL, NCAA, FBA, and Pasadena Tournament of Roses. The Tournament of Roses stated that this guarantee should apply ``at any time prior to departure'' if it is clear tickets will not be forthcoming. FBA commented ``the greater the remedy available, the less likely that tour packagers will create the problem by promoting packages that may not be legitimate.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NACA said that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and acts of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that forced postponement of the World Series. Similarly, the NHL stated that if the event is canceled or substantially altered after the tour begins, consumers should be entitled only to a refund of the face value of the event ticket, but that if such cancellation or alteration takes place before departure, the operator should be required to inform the consumers, who would have the right to cancel (presumably with a full refund).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressman Andrews was also in favor of the ``money back guarantee,'' as well as a requirement for tour operators to disclose whether event tickets are guaranteed or tentative. However, he stated that any rule that would totally prohibit marketing of a special-event tour until the tour operator has event tickets in hand would not be practical. Tickets for many such events are not available until less than two weeks before the event, he pointed out, but other arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. NTA, the NCAA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the current restrictions against marketing Super Bowl tours until the operator has game tickets in hand or under contract should be included in the new rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In discussing the ``money-back guarantee,'' the ANPRM asked if the rule should contain procedures to protect the operator from having to refund the entire tour price if a participant doesn't receive promised admission to something like a welcoming cocktail party. Of those who commented on the issue, NTA, the NHL, ASTA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that operators should not be required to refund the entire tour price over failure to provide something like a promised welcoming cocktail party. NACA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should require the value of undelivered ancillary events to be refunded, but should not require a refund of the entire tour price. FBA and the Wisconsin Attorney General both pointed out that certain events on a special event tour (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose Bowl tour) are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized while other events on the same tour (e.g., a side trip to Disneyland) are not. These two commenters suggest that integral events be protected by the ``money back guarantee'' of the total tour price, but not other events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

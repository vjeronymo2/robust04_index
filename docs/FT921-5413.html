			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (4): Legislative barriers eased - Reforms in the financial system examined THE FINANCIAL system will take one of its final strides towards liberalisation next January 1, when European Community banks become free to operate in Portugal without special authorisation. In preparation for the opening up of the sector, central-bank authorities have been steadily exposing banks to stronger competition and a freer operating environment. The first big move in this direction was made in late 1990, when the Bank of Portugal adopted new statutes that substantially increased its autonomy. In particular, the relationship between the Bank and the treasury was clarified. The central bank was prohibited from lending directly to the government, ending the common practice of monetarising the budget deficit. In January 1991, credit ceilings were abolished. These effectively created huge pools of liquidity, for which the only outlet was to lend to the government at below-market rates. 'These two measures were particularly important, because they cut off the direct pipeline that linked the banking system to public debt,' says Antonio Mexia, a director with financial services and investment company Espirito Santo Sociedade de Investimentos (ESSI). A provision for the central bank to make loans to the government, up to a maximum of 10 per cent of budget expenditure, remains, in the shape of an interest-free current account. But the government has drafted legislation to abolish the account this year, separating government and central-bank finances. As a result of recent reforms, the central bank has grown more independent, sharing responsibility for monetary and exchange-rate policy with the government, rather than simply implementing government decisions as previously. The Bank no longer needs government authorisation for interventions in money or foreign-exchange markets. This new-found independence clearly emerges from the public statement of Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Bank of Portugal, and other officials, which today can be seriously at odds with government thinking. 'Our greater outspokenness is a natural consequence of our increased responsibility for monetary policy,' says Mr Antonio Borges, deputy governor of the Bank. 'We are very much aware that whatever we say now carries a much greater weight in terms of inflation expectations. We have to maintain a strong credibility, and that requires our being as objective as possible in our assessment of the economic situation, independently of the political debate.' A further substantial reform towards the modernisation of the Portuguese financial system and its harmonisation with EC regulations is due to be enacted this year, following the publication of a policy document based on studies of the working of the system. The legislation clarifies the role of the Bank of Portugal, limiting its intervention to the area of prudential supervision but giving it more power to act. 'Previously, we were in the difficult position of monitoring situations, and in some cases seeing banks come close to bankruptcy, without our being able to intervene,' says Mr Borges. 'Under the new legislation we will have the power to act immediately, if necessary going to the extremes of replacing a bank's management or liquidating the company.' Implementation of the policy document this year will also change the way banks are run. Beyond the central bank's power of prudential supervision, banks will be free to operate in a more liberalised environment. The new legislation establishes the principle of universal banking, formally abolishing the traditional divide between commercial and investment banking. Some analysts believe the advent of universal banking could tempt some managements to try to be everything at the same time. 'The danger is some banks may think they can do anything, anywhere without any segmentation,' says Joao Rendeiro, managing director of fund managers Gestifundo. 'The critical elements will be an understanding of the various levels of the market and the need to produce a flexible response to different types of customer. The need for segmentation will be more important.' The new legislation will greatly reduce restrictions on the activities banks can undertake. But a separation will be maintained between banking and other financial activities such as factoring and leasing. Banks will not be able to run such operations directly, but they will be permitted to create subsidiaries, of which they can own 100 per cent, to do so. 'Essentially, these operations can be carried out by the same entity and the same management, as long as there is a total separation of accounting so that we can conduct our prudential supervision in a more transparent way,' says Mr Borges. The central bank will also introduce a deposit insurance scheme in line with EC recommendations, requiring much less intervention from the Bank of Portugal to guarantee deposits, should a bank run into trouble. But the influx of foreign banks is not expected to be overwhelming. In any case, they are expected to focus on wholesale and business banking.</p>

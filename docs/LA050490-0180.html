			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S.-SOVIET 'SWAN LAKE' IS HUGE HIT  </P> <P> Before Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policy thawed Soviet relationswith the  West, the idea of Americans and Russians working and dancing together in the  world's most beloved ballet would have been a fantasy.  </P> <P> The dream came true Thursday as the curtain rose on a stunning and lavish  collaborative version of "Swan Lake," staged by the Boston Ballet with help  from Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet and Leningrad's Kirov Ballet.  </P> <P> Each of the 18 performances, winding up May 20, will pair an American and a  Soviet dancer in the lead roles, which have seven different casting  combinations.  </P> <P> The spotlight Thursday was on Nina Ananiashvili, stunning young prima ballerina  from the Bolshoi, in the white swan-black swan dual lead role, and Boston's  international star Fernando Bujones as the swan queen's princely lover,  Siegfried.  </P> <P> The audience rose up with a 10-minute cheering ovation after the stunning world  premiere of this version.  </P> <P> During a rehearsal earlier in the week, Ananiashvili said the Soviet-American  collaborative aspect of the production was very exciting for her.  </P> <P> "Never has an American company shown such respect to this ballet," she said in  a conversation translated by her husband, Gregory Vashadze.  </P> <P> Ananiashvili said she relishes her new-found freedom to dance anywhere in the  world.  </P> <P> "Such freedom is essential to our profession," she said.  </P> <P> It cost $640,000 to stage the production, which will tour the Soviet Union in  the spring of 1992 under sponsorship of Sheraton Hotels.  </P></p>

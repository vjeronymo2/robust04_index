			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Pension law panel issues questionnaire THE INDEPENDENT body appointed by the government to review occupational pension law yesterday issued a wide-ranging questionnaire aimed at determining whether current law adequately protects the reasonable expectations of pension-scheme members. Professor Roy Goode, professor of English law at Oxford University and chairman of the pension law review committee, said it was seeking answers to 81 detailed questions by December 15. The committee must publish its findings by May 1993. It was announced on June 8 by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, after hearings by a parliamentary select committee into the disappearance of more than Pounds 400m from occupational pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. The committee's remit is to review the regulatory framework for pension schemes and to recommend legislative changes if necessary. Yesterday the National Association of Pension Funds, the trade association for the pensions industry, said it welcomed the questionnaire and its members would make their expertise available to the committee. Prof Goode said, however, that the committee, which includes representatives of the pension and fund management industry as well as consumers, is concerned that the views and expectations of ordinary pension members should be adequately reflected in its report. To that end it is preparing a survey of scheme members through a written questionnaire, to be followed up with interviews in depth with individual scheme members. Prof Goode said at a press conference yesterday: 'We particularly want to understand what scheme participants understand about their pension rights.' He said the group's primary task would be to answer the basic question about scheme members' legal entitlement to pension benefits. 'All other questions about pension fund protection flow from that,' he said. The question about ownership of scheme assets generally and surpluses in particular are considered to be the most controversial in the pensions industry. Prof Goode said the group might recommend legislation although it would be up to the government to decide whether to table a bill before parliament. Among the questions the committee is seeking answers to is whether there are scheme rules, powers or discretions (including the power to amend or close a scheme) that the law should control. It is also asking whether pension rights should be enshrined in employment contracts, whether trust law should be abandoned and whether methods of calculation of pensions should be standardised.</p>

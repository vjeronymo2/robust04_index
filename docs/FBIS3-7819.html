			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Frane Plancic: "One NATO -- Two Bosses"] </F>   [Text] It might seem absurd at first sight that the NATO  ultimatum for Bosnia can be carried out only if V. Churkin  replaces M. Woerner as the secretary general of this military  alliance. In fact, Churkin should already be recognized in his  acquired status of NATO secretary general. If he were secretary  general, everything would go smoothly, as in these days! There  would be no quarrels. Even the large intelligence scandal which  broke out when a Russian agent was found in the CIA leadership  would be resolved in a quiet and civilized way.    If Churkin were NATO secretary general, it is certain that  he  would be able to reach the same attitude of all NATO members  toward the aggression against civilians and UN Protection Force  members as is the case with the present secretary general. He  would also withdraw in the same realistic way as Woerner did  when the time came for firing on the aggressor in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. And in Croatia? Since nobody mentioned  Croatia in the ultimatum, Croatia can only be a topic for an  academic discussion.    Let me summarize: Nobody would notice any external  manifestation of absurdity in Churkin's leading NATO. It is  possible that somebody notices certain internal manifestations  of it at the moment when every member of the alliance expresses  its aims openly. France and Britain have stopped NATO actions  hundreds of times so far, so that Russia, the main post-Cold War  ally --as this is expressed in Washington -- should be given  this possibility, too.  <H5>  Simulating the Ultimatum </H5>   This time the Russian counterultimatum was respected; NATO  gave up announced air strikes in the name of the strategy of  political negotiations. The efforts for peace allegedly rose  after the military threat had been expressed to both Bosnian  Serbs and Belgrade.    So, let us see how Serbs are coping with these negotiations.    They are threatening with both weapons and words. Everybody  who hoped that something else would happen is a "first-class"  political dilettante.    Belgrade, which should have been shaken by the NATO threats,  is still self-confidently stating that it will not approve of  opening of the Tuzla Airport, neither for peace nor for war  purposes. NATO has issued an ultimatum that the airport must be  opened on 7 March. We shall see how NATO will respond to the  latest refusal from Belgrade, but we can already be sure that  NATO's reaction will be of the Churkin type.    The Churkin-type reaction has already been seen in a more  dangerous incident than the possible one with the Tuzla Airport  -- when Chetniks occupied the Sava Bridge between Stara Gradiska  and Bosanska Gradiska. The local UN Protection Force (allegedly  protected by the NATO ultimatum) were humiliated and expelled  from their positions, their houses for monitoring were  destroyed.... Approximately 20 Serbian tanks and armored  vehicles (withdrawn from Sarajevo?) came so close that they can  cross the Croatian border at any time (that is to say the  occupied territory, but still a part of Croatia according to  what NATO, the UN, and all others say). At the request of the  UN Protection Force NATO aircraft are now flying over this  territory and simulating the ultimatum. They are simulating it  in the real sense of the word since Croatia is not mentioned in  the text of the ultimatum, so that it cannot be included in its  Churkin- type implementation.    An act of simulation was also made the day before yesterday  in response to a Serbian artillery attack on Swedish UN  Protection Force members near Vares.    NATO aircraft arrived in the area in which five Swedish  soldiers were wounded and concluded that it could not be  established who fired. Since they had a clear conscience they  returned home, leaving the possibility open that either Serbs or  Muslims could have fired -- or perhaps the Swedish soldiers  themselves -- just as it was imputed to Muslims that they shot  at the people in the Sarajevo market.    If NATO aircraft were flying over Maslenica, Kasic, Paljuv,  or Peruca in these days, they would not be able to see who is  shooting there either. They would return home peacefully,  leaving the possibility open that the Croatian Army was shooting  at its own positions. As if it were not known that it was the  Croatian president himself who ordered the attack on the  presidential palace in Zagreb during the war in Croatia!  <H5>  Serbs Are Going On With Incidents </H5>   Churkin, as the acting NATO secretary general, could be  confronted with unpleasant situations, though -- like the one  when a Serbian officer was caught by cameras in an action which  violated the ultimatum (if there is something like that at all).  The incident happened two days ago [22 February] in front of  CBS cameras at the place where Serbian artillery weapons were  being collected under the supervision of the British UN  Protection Force. A Serbian officer came there with a truck,  took one of the collected guns (a mountain gun, of the B-1  type), attached it to the truck, and drove away in front of UN  monitors. He was stopped by British UN Protection Force  soldiers at the exit, though (they are professionals, and, apart  from that, cameras were there). General Rose, the UN Protection  Force commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, was called, and he  ordered his soldiers to return the gun to the marked area. A  British officer said that there were still five or six Serbian  guns on the surrounding hills. Nobody attacked them from the  air, and we do not know anything about them.    Such incidents and serious attacks by Serbian artillery are  going on in the area between Bihac and Tuzla, from Maslenica to  Gradiska. This means that the whole territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and parts of Croatia are affected. What can  be concluded from this?    It is quite obvious that the NATO ultimatum has not taken  effect. That is why there are no political negotiations which  should have followed from it. Churkin's engagement and  enumeration of Serbian incidents are the only two things which  have been noticed so far. Churkin and the Serbs are both led by  the idea to undermine a NATO intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It could be easily predicted that this idea would be carried  out in this way. It is being openly carried out in the occupied  Croatian territories and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Encouraged by  the success of the Russian counter-ultimatum, Serbs are going on  with incidents in all occupied territories (which are too large  for a concentrated NATO action) using small weapons (a too cheap  goal for setting the whole NATO machinery in motion) and  selecting those targets which are not directly mentioned in the  ultimatum (so that NATO does not have the "legal" basis for an  action)....    Their aim is evident -- to preserve as much occupied  territories as possible though unsanctioned military actions.  They have enough time and military power to do this. Apart  from that, they have the political blessing from Russia which  claims that it will not allow any further ultimatums for Bosnia.</p>

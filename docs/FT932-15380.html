			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Tactics reviewed in blackboard battle: A look at plans to proceed with tests despite boycott threats SIR RON Dearing, chairman designate of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, yesterday moved to the centre of the political row over testing in schools by urging teachers not to boycott the tests. He has to conduct the review of the curriculum that was announced last week by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, as a concession to opposition which had already been voiced by several teachers' unions. Sir Ron's argument, which the government endorsed, was that he would not be able to produce improvements in the tests without evidence from this year. He said: 'One of the jobs I have been given is to look at the manageability of the whole thing. I need some tests this summer to show me how the thing is working.' This is part of a more emollient approach the government has adopted to persuade parents and more moderate teachers that a boycott would be counter-productive. The Department for Education said yesterday a boycott would 'hinder the review, which teachers presumably want', and that Mr Patten had started the review 'as a result of meeting with teachers'. The department said concessions had already been made by the decision not to make the results of this year's tests public, and to initiate the review. These concessions appear to have won over Mr Patten's strongest critics among Tory MPs. The department also says that tests for seven-year-olds, greeted with criticism by teachers when they were introduced, were now working successfully. Mr Patten's hope is that these arguments can win over parents and the more moderate teachers. This would then allow teachers who went through with boycotting to be portrayed as unprofessional or politically motivated. Reaction to Sir Ron's appeal from teachers and parents has so far been patchy, however. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the traditionally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which is balloting its members on a boycott of the tests, met Sir Ron last night - the first teachers' union representative to do so. He called on the assessment authority to demonstrate its independence by reviewing the curriculum in its entirety. He said: 'John Patten's announcement of a review in the national curriculum is welcome because everyone accepts that it has become excessively complex. Where Mr Patten's got it wrong is that he's announced a review of the component elements of the curriculum, rather than a review of the totality of it.' Mr Smith wants to see the curriculum slimmed down drastically. But he also wants to avoid a protracted political argument. He said: 'If we get a sort of stand-off like we had in the mid-1980s with Mr Patten slinging mud at the teachers and teachers slinging mud at Mr Patten, that's a cul-de-sac.' Other union leaders held out less hope of compromise. Mr Nigel De Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, described Sir Ron's argument as 'incredibly weak'. He said proceeding with the tests this year was unnecessary because 'there are mountains of data available showing they are imposing this crippling burden on teachers and distracting from teachers' ability to teach properly in the classroom. We need a simple suspension of the whole system.' Mr De Gruchy took issue with the department's claims that tests for seven-year-olds, which the NASUWT also intends to boycott, had been successful, saying primary school teachers still found 'huge workload problems' and continued to question the tests' educational value. Parents' associations also seem unimpressed by Sir Ron's arguments. Ms Margaret Morrissey, of the National Confederation of Parent Teachers' Associations, said: 'Parents do not see why their children should go through with these tests just so Sir Ron Dearing should have some background.' Mr Patten's attempts to court parents appear to have been damaged by his widely publicised description of the NCPTA as 'Neanderthal', and by his sudden cancellation of a meeting he had planned to hold with it last week.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology: Knowledge is power - Knova is an analytical tool that aspires to making the intangibles tangible For most companies, improving business performance means reorganising to cut costs and jobs, followed by further investment in computers and communications technology. Few have considered the impact of intangibles such as knowledge on performance. Knowledge is a resource that is difficult to assess and manage. But now researchers at Cambridge University, working with British Petroleum, have developed a method for analysing the factors influencing knowledge. It allows an appropriate investment plan to be developed and, ultimately, the investment to be related to performance. BP initiated the work after making substantial organisational changes in the late 1980s. It wanted to improve the way people worked in a flatter, more team-oriented structure; but it also recognised that the usual information-based approach was too narrow and that 'soft' factors  - such as knowledge - must be taken into account. 'Common sense tells you that knowledge will influence the way people work, but we wanted to know how it affected them,' explains Paul Wilhelmij, BP International's team leader in decision support, who with his colleague, Jack Betteridge, provided a business focus for the work with Cambridge University. The partnership produced an analysis technique called Knova (Knowledge value-added). This provides 'a holistic business view to identify the less obvious cost drivers,' says Tony Holden, head of the university's decision support group, which collaborated in developing the method. Knova resulted in a computer model that takes into account the relationships  -in a team or organisation - between knowledge, people, performance, investment, culture and benefits. People factors include staff turnover and motivation, while culture factors include leadership, openness, informal and formal communications, the working environment, geographic distribution and personal reward. According to Holden, traditional management models have difficulty linking these 'soft' issues with 'hard' quantitative factors, such as costs and investment. Nor can they easily analyse the benefits of investing in the knowledge resource. In addition, Knova can provide both a static and a dynamic view of the factors that influence knowledge. By assigning order-of-magnitude values to the influencing factors and using system dynamic modelling software, a computer model can be produced. This model can then be used to track the factors over a period of time and perform 'what-if' analyses to compare different investment options. Knowledge investments cover, for example, new procedures, computer systems, communications, external consultancy and training. Holden points out that the computer model is only quasi-quantitative because of the subjective nature of such factors as culture, but insists: 'Knova facilitates a much richer representation, that can be linked to pictures, text and numbers, than the traditional paper-based representation of influencing factors.' Companies do realise that knowledge is important, says Holden. It is expertise, know-how, information and data that employees use to make decisions. In the recent restructuring, some companies have tried to use knowledge more effectively by introducing team-working and giving people more responsibility. But freedom to apply and share knowledge will not necessarily improve performance. Nor will an increase in the training budget. Knowledge must be developed and managed to produce beneficial results, argues Holden. The development of Knova began at the end of the 1980s and its practical relevance was tested in the early 1990s on projects within the exploration arm of BP. One application, that looked at human factors in team-working, involved an awareness campaign to overcome a common problem in oil exploration - when a drilling pipe gets stuck. At BP Exploration, the cost of this problem had risen sharply in the late 1980s, from around Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.5m) a year to nearly Dollars 40m in 1988. BP Exploration knew that poor communications was a leading factor in the problem. It developed a training programme to encourage open communication, knowledge-sharing and problem-solving among its drilling teams. It trained 800 people, 70 per cent of whom were from outside contractors. In two years, BP Exploration cut its drilling costs to Dollars 13m, but in 1991 costs began to rise again at two sites. This was put down to changes in personnel and a push for higher performance. Applying Knova to the problem (albeit after the fact) showed that Knova would have predicted the cost trends and would have highlighted staff turnover as a potential factor. Having validated the technique, both BP and the Cambridge group are applying it to other problems. BP is using it to look at operational decision-making on its process plants. 'We are trying to create the right kind of environment for people who are working together in teams on our plants,' says Wilhelmij. This would improve decision-making and could affect plant safety. At Cambridge University, the decision support group is currently using Knova to identify the influences on performance in service departments of large organisations, such as the UK's National Health Service hospitals. But the group's main target industries are manufacturing, in particular oil and petrochemicals, and financial services. These sectors have gone through big changes, and want to maximise performance and minimise risks. One way to do this, argues Holden, is by ensuring that people make quality decisions - decision-making being a knowledge-based activity. 'To get quality decisions, you may not need more sophisticated computer systems but a better organisational environment in which managers can make them,' says Holden. 'Investing in computer technology has become a knee-jerk reaction and although computers have a place companies must broaden their perspective. Companies must also consider the intangibles and our work is to make the intangibles tangible.'</p>

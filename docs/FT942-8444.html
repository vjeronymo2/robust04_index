			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Refreshing spontaneity at breakfast Sir, I agree with Christopher Dunkley that 'watching television at breakfast is depraved' (Arts: 'Mixed up breakfast menus', May 18). However, I think he missed something when reviewing The Big Breakfast. The Big Breakfast is refreshingly real, energetic, spontaneous and the presenters genuine and fallible. The BBC's Business Breakfast is appropriately professional and technically slick. However, GMTV, in its phoney living room setting, seems to me to fall down a hole in the middle. I suspect that GMTV is aimed at a social group that agrees watching television at breakfast is depraved, so guess what - they don't watch it.

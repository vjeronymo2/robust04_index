			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even at controlled loading racks (ones equipped with vapor collection and processing systems), fugitive emissions from leaking truck transport tanks or railcars may occur through the dome covers, pressure-vacuum relief valves or vents, and several other potential sources. The dome or hatch cover designed to seal each cargo compartment during transport and during loading and unloading operations can develop leaks over time. Valves, which include the pressure-vacuum (P&hyph;V) vent under the dome plate assembly and the vent valve connected to the overturn rail on tank trucks, can leak if they become dirty or worn. Improperly installed or damaged hose couplings can also be sources of vapor emissions. The transport tank shell, if damaged, also can produce vapor emissions from cracks or failures in welds. This latter type of leak occurs less frequently than those at the dome cover and vents, but may be a large emission source for some transport tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Storage tank and equipment component (pumps and valves) leak emissions at bulk gasoline terminals are identical in the manner of their occurrence to those described earlier for pipeline breakout stations. However, HAP emission reductions are not the same due to differences in turnover rates and storage tank sizes as well as differences in the numbers of estimated equipment components in the process line piping between the two facility types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Selection of the Basis for the Proposed Standards for New and Existing Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the present time, a majority of sources within the gasoline distribution network are being controlled under State regulations and Federal new source performance standards (approximately one-third of the storage tanks at pipeline breakout stations; one-half of the storage tanks, nearly 70 percent of loading racks, and most of the tank trucks and railcars that load at bulk gasoline terminals). However, since the States are required to adopt regulations consistent with CTG recommendations only in areas not attaining the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone, many States have regulations that cover only those areas. Today's proposed standards will require more stringent emission control levels for major source facilities located in areas designated as ozone nonattainment, and will extend the same controls to major source facilities located in attainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Determination of Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine which pipeline breakout stations or bulk gasoline terminals are to be regulated (i.e., which ones are classified as major sources), owners and operators of these facilities either may provide documentation to the Administrator that the facility is not a major source as defined in section 112(a) by means of completion of an emissions audit or may employ one of the equations discussed later in this section that have been developed for estimating facility emissions. However, regardless of the applicability criteria equation that is chosen, bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations that are located within the contiguous area and under common control with a petroleum refinery are considered major sources if that petroleum refinery is a major source. This is because refinery process equipment in combination with bulk terminal and pipeline breakout station equipment is likely to emit more than the threshold levels for major source determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initially, the Agency considered a throughput cutoff determination for distinguishing major source from area source facilities in each subcategory. However, for pipeline breakout stations, HAP emissions are a function of the number of individual emission sources (storage tanks, pumps, and valves), while emissions from bulk gasoline terminals occur from these sources as well as from sources which depend upon gasoline throughput (loading racks and tank truck or railcar leakage).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since major source determinations are not based solely on throughput at each facility type, another approach was investigated for distinguishing between major and area sources. Equations were developed to estimate total HAP emissions from both bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations. The equation approach allows a potential subject facility to input the type of equipment present at the facility and calculate emissions accordingly. These equations were developed to include all potential equipment; however, if a particular portion of the equation does not apply (e.g., no fixed-roof tanks), then that portion of the equation will equal zero and fall out of the calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At first, several equations were developed to attempt to cover many different equipment combinations, different HAP contents in gasoline emissions, and the two major source criteria, 10 tons of a single HAP or 25 tons of combination of HAPs. One equation was developed for each subcategory that would handle normal gasoline (estimated HAP content of 4.8 percent), a second set of equations was developed for each facility handling reformulated or oxygenated fuels (estimated HAP emission content of 16 percent) and a third set of equations was developed for each facility handling the single-HAP (estimated to be gasoline vapor with MTBE with a HAP content of 12 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

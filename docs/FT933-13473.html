			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Monday Interview: Dreams that circle the globe: Bob Allen, the chairman of AT&amp;T, speaks to Andrew Adonis As the scourge of Europe's state telecommunications monopolies, Bob Allen comes as a bit of a shock. The chairman of American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecoms giant banging at Europe's door, is mild-mannered to the point of diffidence, disarmingly quick to admit past mistakes and present ignorance. However, fresh from an interview with the European Commission's Jacques Delors - 'President Delors', he calls him - there was nothing coy about Mr Allen's presence in Brussels, and his subsequent trip to Berlin last week. 'Europe is an important place for us. We have a lot of investment here . . . If the protective barriers come down, the opportunities will be great.' Since taking the helm at AT&amp;T in 1988, 'going global' has been one of Mr Allen's chief ambitions. Whatever its impact on competition overseas, the strategy is transforming AT&amp;T. Ten years ago, the company had only 60 employees outside the US; now it has 30,000. For Mr Allen, who spent the formative years of his career working his way up Indiana's Bell company, the challenge is as much personal as corporate. The biggest barrier to European telecommunications competition looks set to fall by 1998, when basic voice telephony will be opened up in most EC states. But AT&amp;T is not waiting five years to make its pitch. As an equipment supplier, it is already competing strongly in the liberalised equipment market. It has an application pending to become a public operator in the UK. And its ambitious 'Worldsource' venture, which aims to provide an integrated global telecommunications platform for multinationals, is scouring Europe for suitable local partners for its launch on the continent next year. The backdrop to AT&amp;T's global ambitions is bitter competition in its long-dis-tance market at home. But, insists Mr Allen: 'We are not driven solely by competition in our home market to go elsewhere . . . What causes us to look outside the US and to globalise our business is the huge investments required, particularly in information technology, to stay on the leading edge. If we can't spread those investments over a larger base, then there just isn't enough growth capacity in the US (to do so). 'The fundamental heart of our strategy resides in our global network.' In Europe 'we would tend towards the partner route', rather than towards taking equity stakes in existing operators'. Although in public Europe's leading operators criticise 'unfair' US competition, there is no shortage of private enthusiasm to become one of AT&amp;T's Worldsource partners. The fear is about direct competition with AT&amp;T at home - many allege that AT&amp;T's capacity to shift costs between its divisions will allow it to pick off the most lucrative parts of their business one by one. Mr Allen's response? 'It is impossible to cross-subsidise one business to another when all of your markets are competitive - well, it's not impossible . . . but you may lose your life in doing so. The competitive discipline in all our businesses makes it impossible.' He points to AT&amp;T's 25 business units: 'If you think any of them are willing to subsidise another business or part of it, then you don't know how motivated they are to be successful. I defy anybody to come in and get into our innermost books and find cross-subsidy.' Might AT&amp;T agree to formal accounting separation between its divisions, on a similar basis to that proposed for BT by Oftel, the UK's telecommunications regulator? 'We do that today, though we don't report it publicly in all quarters.' Mr Allen has little time for his regulator back home, the Federal Communications Commission. 'I find it hard to believe that, with four major competitors to AT&amp;T in the US, we need much regulation.' The FCC could, he says, 'virtually fall away' if its staff 'weren't so interested in protecting their own jobs'. Mr Allen is adamant that in Europe regulation is needed to break the market open. At what level of competition should the regulator wither away? 'You need to look at more than gross market share (gained by competitors); you need to look at market segments' - but he will not offer figures for either. That Europe needs AT&amp;T, Mr Allen has no doubt. 'As a general rule, the development of telecommunications (in Europe) is trailing the US . . . and therein lies one of the challenges for the unification of the European Community. Europe needs a telecommunications infrastructure that is uniform and modern . . . and it probably will not have such while it has protected industries.' What of the strategic importance of national telecommunications networks? 'It's essentially an arrogant approach for a government official to say: 'I know better how to manage the telecoms system and to protect its strategic value' than to let the marketplace dictate improvement in this strategic asset.' He applies that to Vice-President Al Gore's dreams of a fibre-optic communications 'super highway' across the US. 'Not for a moment do I want them (the Clinton administration) to . . . do anything other than stand outside and display a vision and support for improvement of the network.' With its imminent purchase of a stake in McCaw, the US cellular company, speculation is rife as to AT&amp;T's intentions to enter local telecommunications in the US, from which it was barred at the break-up of the Bell structure in 1984. Mr Allen claims the notion is based on a 'misconception' of the role of cellular communications. Rather, he cannot understand why US local operators  -the so-called 'RBOCs' - are so anxious to compete in AT&amp;T's long-distance market: '99 per cent of our access payments last year went to the RBOCs; 25 per cent of their revenues, and in some cases all of their profits came from us . . . One wonders why they want to destroy such a good business and get into the other 60 per cent of the market . . . stimulating competition (in their market) and see their margins and profits disappear.' However, with new technology and the development of multi-media - the convergence of computing, telecoms and the entertainment industry - the enforced division of the US market between operators is looking anachronistic. Mr Allen, who barely uses the word 'telephone' these days, is positioning AT&amp;T as the linchpin of new alliances to bring new products to market. 'It is our intent to make the network adaptable and usable to all forms of media. 'It is entirely conceivable we could offer 'data warehouses' for a variety of companies offering multi-media services,' he says. 'We would do the billing, servicing the account, for, say, MGN, Library of Congress, and so on. That's not necessarily our vision,' he adds hastily: 'we have our own debates about whether we should merely be a distributor or whether we should own the content; we don't know anything about making movies, but we do know something about delivering them.' Multi-media, however, is tomorrow's world: in the shorter term, AT&amp;T sees China as perhaps its biggest growth prospect. Like all equipment suppliers and operators, Mr Allen is daunted by the Olympian scale of the Chinese market. Earlier this year AT&amp;T signed a memorandum of understanding which it hopes will lead to orders and joint ventures. 'There are sure going to be bumps on the road; but we are going to try and see it through. 'One of the dreams here,' he says of AT&amp;T's Chinese exploits, 'is that we have an opportunity to bring new levels of information-sharing that few other countries have. It's not something I talk about much,' he adds, 'because shareholders want returns, customers want to be served, but when you step away from the daily grind . . . it does give you a sense of purpose with a higher ideal than returns.' So AT&amp;T is the west's Trojan horse in China. It remains to be seen whether Europe is as receptive to Mr Allen's offerings.

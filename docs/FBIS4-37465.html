			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The parents of the three MIA's from the  al-Sultan Ya'qub battle in Lebanon in 1982 claim that their sons  are alive and held by Lebanese elements in the Lebanese  al-Biqa'. They say they are basing their claim on new  information they received from eyewitnesses. [passage omitted]    Following the al-Sultan Ya'qub battle, a U.S. television  team  photographed a Syrian tank carrying what seemed to be three  Israeli soldiers. Today the parents disclose that both they and  the Israeli Government possess information that their sons are  safe and sound. [passage omitted]    Security elements reemphasized today that the Israeli  Government does not spare any effort to obtain new information  about IDF [Israel Defense Forces] MIA.</p>

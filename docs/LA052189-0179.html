			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOFT TOUCH MAKES COHEN HARD TO BEAT ON THE COURT  </P> <P> Tony Cohen thinks he might pursue an advertising career once his tennis career  at Cal Lutheran ends.  </P> <P> To that end, along with completing the class work required of a marketing  major, Cohen employs subliminal techniques of the soft sell in his tennis game.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have trouble playing me because of my style," Cohen says. "I  don't hit the ball as hard as most players at the college level.  </P> <P> "It gets into an opponent's head. Once he thinks, 'I can't believe this guy is  beating me,' that's when I know I'm going to be OK."  </P> <P> Lately, Cohen has been a pretty good advertisement for the Cal Lutheran tennis  program, which is enjoying another successful campaign.  </P> <P> Last week, at Christ College in Irvine, Cal Lutheran won its third consecutive  NAIA District 3 tournament team championship. Cohen defeated teammate Matt  Simpson to win the singles championship and also teamed with Simpson to win the  doubles title.  </P> <P> On Monday, Cohen and the Kingsmen will begin play in the NAIA championships at  Rockhill Country Club in Kansas City, Mo., where they will try to improve on  last season's 17th-place finish.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran, which finished the regular season 14-13, is ranked 20th among the  35 teams that are expected to take part. Defending-national champion Lander  College of Greenwood, S.C., Texas College of Tyler and the University of West  Florida are among the favorites.  </P> <P> "All year we've been beleaguered by injury after injury after injury," said  John Siemens, who is in his ninth year as coach of the Kingsmen. "How we do  back there depends on our draw and how well bodies hold up."  </P> <P> Cohen, in fact, is the only Cal Lutheran player who is not nursing an injury.  </P> <P> Paavo Salmi, the team's No. 1 player for most of the season, has two bad  ankles, Simpson has been bothered by elbow and thigh problems, Mike Gennette  has a strained Achilles' tendon, Brian Turner's wrist, ankles and shoulder are  tender and George Kovacs has a knee injury.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran's hopes, therefore, would appear to be riding on Cohen, who was  26-8 during the regular season and is the only ranked player (64th) on the  team.  </P> <P> "Tony doesn't give away points. He's a counterpuncher more than anything else,"  Siemens said. "He cuts you and slices you and you bleed to death, and you don't  even know you're bleeding because he does it so softly."  </P> <P> Cohen, 21, lost only five matches in three years at El Camino Real High before  enrolling at Cal State Northridge upon graduation in 1986.  </P> <P> But he never got the chance to compete at Northridge. He redshirted his  freshman year, after which the school announced that it was dropping its men's  tennis program.  </P> <P> "A couple friends said they were thinking of transferring to a school called  Cal Lutheran," recalled Cohen, who grew up in Woodland Hills. "I had never even  heard of Cal Lutheran."  </P> <P> Cohen transferred to Pierce College for the 1988 spring semester and went  undefeated in the regular season before losing in the Western State Conference  tournament quarterfinals.  </P> <P> He transferred to Cal Lutheran in February, and, despite missing the first  three weeks of the tennis season because of a transcript delay, has become the  team's top contender for individual national honors.  </P> <P> Chris Groff had the best finish ever by a Cal Lutheran men's tennis player when  he reached the quarterfinals of the national championships in 1987.  </P></p>

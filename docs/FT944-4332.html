			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL sunk by OFT Submarine maker VSEL went into a crash-dive following the decision by the Office of Fair Trading to refer the takeover bids from both GEC and British Aerospace to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission. The early afternoon announcement stunned the stock market, which quickly marked VSEL down 200 to 1335p, against a high for the year of 1548p. BAe retreated 4 to 433p and GEC hardened 2 1/2 to 275 1/2 p. The OFT ruling led to widespread head scratching among analysts. Just about the only sensible conclusion was that the VSEL takeover situation is now firmly on hold until March 15 when the MMC is due to make its deliberations known. There was very little trading in the shares of the three protagonists, with GEC and BAe notching up 3m turnover apiece and 1.2m VSEL shares changing hands. A big 12m volume in the BAe units mostly took place during the morning. Most dealers were agreed that a potential bid of some description for VSEL was still in the wings, and that the submarine group's shares could well prove oversold. GEC's interim statement - due today - was eagerly awaited.</p>

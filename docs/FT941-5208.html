			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Technology: Apple launches second Newton Apple Computer, which missed the target with its first Newton hand-held 'personal digital assistant', is taking a second shot. Last week the company launched a cheaper version that corrects some of the shortcomings of the original product. The Newton MessagePad 10 is a pocket-sized electronic pad on which users can jot messages, diary entries, contact notes and the like, using a special stylus. Like the original, however, this product fails to live up to the expectations created by Apple. Apple have made only incremental improvements. The new model is narrower and longer than the original, and has a cover to protect the screen. It also has more memory, for data storage, and longer battery life. The US price has dropped to Dollars 599 (Pounds 410) from Dollars 699. Most significantly, Apple has attempted to overcome Newton's notoriously unreliable handwriting recognition capabilities. Because users of the original Newton complained that they could not simply jot down notes without having to correct misunderstandings, the new Newton includes 'deferred handwriting recognition'. The user can scribble away and then later go back to make corrections. The new Newton can, when requested, attempt to recognise letters rather than matching handwritten words with those in its dictionary. This is particularly useful for names, acronyms, technical terms and abbreviations. Still to come, however, are wireless communications facilities for the Newton. Apple is working with Ardis and Ram Mobile, two US providers of wireless data communications services. The third Newton, due in September, will be a tablet-sized (approximately 14 in by 8 in) device with a screen twice as big as the pocket versions.</p>

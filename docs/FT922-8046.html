			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Citicorp points to new money for Brazil restructuring MR JOHN REED, chairman of Citicorp, has said Brazil's commercial bank creditors would put up Dollars 500m-Dollars 1bn in new loans for a debt restructuring deal, implying that Citicorp itself has decided to contribute a significant sum in new money, writes Stephen Fidler in Braslia. Bankers close to the transaction say Mr Reed's statement suggests Citicorp could be willing to put up Dollars 500m for the deal, now under negotiation by leading creditor banks and Brazilian officials in New York. The chairman's comments, to journalists in Braslia late on Wednesday, suggested that only 'mathematics' stood in the way of an agreement. However, his statements may prove controversial among banks that are less enthusiastic about a debt accord with Brazil. The chairman of Citicorp, the largest foreign bank lender to Brazil, said he believed Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn would be needed for enhancements under the accord. Enhancements provide finance for guarantees of concessional bonds used in debt-reduction deals such as that being negotiated by Brazil. Some bankers say this suggests Citicorp has conceded the need for enhancements to be phased in over time - an approach controversial with some leading bank leaders. Mr Reed and his vice-chairman, Mr William Rhodes, were in Braslia to meet President Fernando Collor and Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister. Both sides now accept an agreement in principle is likely before the end of June - perhaps significantly sooner.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV EXPLAINS COMPUTERIZED VOTE 3 TIMES FOR DEPUTIES  </P> <P> In a Parliament that was once low-tech and rubber-stamp, a computerized voting  system got off to a bumpy start today.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had to explain the system three times before the  2,106 attending members of the Congress of People's Deputies got it right.  </P> <P> The deputies were to insert their identity cards into hand-held vote-counters,  press a button to register their names, then press another button indicating  "yes," "no" or "abstain" before handing the machine to the next person.  </P> <P> Gorbachev first asked the deputies to simply register their names. The result  was 333 for, 11 against and 6 abstentions. The remaining 1,756 apparently  pushed no button at all.  </P> <P> Gorbachev explained the system again, and the second time, 1,985 names were  recorded.  </P> <P> "Maybe some people still have to learn, but we are on the right track," he  said.  </P></p>

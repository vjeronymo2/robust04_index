The purpose of the meeting was to relaunch discussions with the  various partners so as to rebuild the social, political, and  economic fabric which has been torn up following the  assassinations perpetrated in Burundi. The participants  discussed the main issues on which no compromise was reached  during previous meetings, notably a formal framework for  consultation, the drawing up of an open schedule, and the  profile of the future president of the Republic. All the  participants agreed on one important point. They decided on a  political truce and called on the Burundi people to stop the  demonstrations, destruction, harassment, and intimidation.    Apart from this meeting, Chairman Sylvestre Ntibantunganya  of  the Front for Democracy in Burundi, Chairman Joseph Nzeyimana of  the Rally for Democracy and Economic and Social Development  [RADDES], and the president of the Unity and National Progress  Party [Uprona] made statements calling on their activists to act  responsibly during these difficult times.    First, here is the statement by Sylvestre Ntibantunganya:    [Ntibantunganya] "I would like to tell Burundians who are  listening to us either on radio or television that the current  times in our country are difficult and that in order to surmount  them, there is a need for positive contributions from everyone.  We need peace, we need security. We need the establishment of  trust between the various components of the Burundian nation, a  nation which, if we are not careful, could go as far as breaking  up. I therefore launch an urgent appeal to everyone to make a  commitment to countering the danger. This country belongs to  all of us in our diversities, ethnic, political, social or  others. We therefore have to manage it, to live in it together  without excluding anyone. We must manage it in security and  ensure security for all. [passage omitted]    "Henceforth, destruction, killing, and harassment of others  must no longer be accepted. Burundi has had enough. Burundians  have had enough and instead wish for the rapid restoration of  peace. We have responded to this call by deciding, at the level  of political parties, on a truce, a truce implying that the  demonstrations, the destruction, the harassment, the  intimidation, and all sorts of misfortunes, must be stopped  rapidly.    "We desire, at least at the level of our party, that the  government will take all the adequate measures so that from  tonight this can be achieved. We hope that all the partners  understand that anyone who acts against the jointly expressed  will will not be considered as being against such or such a  political party or against such and such an ethnic group but  against the Burundi people, who are vividly expressing their  thirst for peace and security and their thirst to see trust  reestablished among their components today.    "Therefore, men and women, the young and old who are  listening to us, come behind us, help us to reestablish the  peace which is yours, you Burundi people, the peace which is  yours, you youth, women, housekeepers but also educators of the  youth, the peace which, if we are not careful, we could lose  control of. Lets keep all this world for peace and in peace.  That is the meaning of the political truce that we have  decided. Thank you."    The second statement is by Uprona parliamentary group  chairman Jean-Baptiste Manwangari:    [Manwangari]" [passage omitted] There is a real will on the  part of all political parties and associations present here and  on the part of government to build on something solid in order  to restore peace to our country. We all insisted that the  common interest will henceforth guide all party and government  activities. We believe that our people have gone through so much  suffering that they should not be deprived again of the peace  which they so badly need. We therefore call on all forces to  come together in the movement searching for peace. We call on  activists to promote peace, so that trouble ceases, both in  Bujumbura and in the countryside. We believe that everyone will  have a place in seeking solutions, and we are convinced that  although discussions have not yet ended, if everyone continues  on the same path, we will reach a consensus on solutions so that  no one feels left out in the restoration of peace. [passage  omitted]"    Last, let us listen to the statement by RADDES Chairman  Joseph Nzeyimana:    [Nzeyimana] "I wish to tell those who are listening to me on  radio and television that the political parties and the various  associations met today to discuss important issues which could  help restore peace to this country. [passage omitted]    "We call on citizens of this country--foreigners, those we  have welcomed, those who came to invest, to keep the peace--to  help us to succeed in the search for peace. We call on the  youth and other forces to keep the peace and to await solutions  and not to break windows, destroy people's huts, destroy houses,  and especially not to kill. We ask you to wait for a while.  Maybe you will get the solution you are seeking. Then we shall  build a new Burundi with a new political framework, since we are  moving towards a new social pact where nothing similar to what  happened before can happen again; a pact that will ensure that  no one kills his neighbor, that Hutus are not killed, that  Tutsis are not killed, that Twas are not killed, that soldiers  are not disturbed and that they do not kill others or get  killed. Then, Burundi will be different, and we shall remake  the image of this country in the eyes of foreign countries,  since the outside world has started seeing us in a bad light.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu urged Japan Friday to clarify itself on  its justice minister's remarks and take "appropriate" action.    In a hastily arranged meeting with Japanese Ambassador to  Seoul Goto Toshio, Han said it's nothing short of "throwing cold  water on efforts by both countries to improve South Korea-Japan  relations for an incumbent cabinet minister to make such remarks  while the Japanese Government is championing political reform  and contribution to the international community.    Just-named Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano said  during an interview this week that his country was not an  aggressor in the World War II but a liberator of Asian colonies  from European imperialism.    He said the mass killing in the rape of Nanjing was "a  hoax."    "Nagano's remarks greatly shocked the South Korean  Government  and the people," Han told the ambassador, "such distorted  historical perspective is very regrettable."    Demanding action on the incident, the foreign minister  emphasized that Tokyo "would have to take appropriate measures"  for the comments.    Goto said he understands Han's reaction as concern shown by  the South Korean Government and will report to his home  government.    "But I believe the comments should not end up throwing cold  water on improving bilateral relations," he said.</p>

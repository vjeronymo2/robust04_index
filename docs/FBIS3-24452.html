On 20 November 1958, the USSR Council of Ministers, "with  the  aim of eliminating excesses in the material support provided  Soviet citizens working in the apparatuses of international  organizations," began collecting from them two-thirds of their  currency wages and all of their pension accruals on a compulsory  basis. Instead of dollars, our fellow countrymen began receiving  Soviet rubles. It is quite curious that pensioners could  officially choose between receiving the allowance from the  United Nations Pension Fund in currency or transferring their  accumulated savings to the USSR Social Security Fund and  receiving rubles. But in fact, as the victims themselves assert,  they did not have any choice whatsoever and had to subordinate  themselves to the dictate of the government under threat of  sanctions. It should also be taken into account that whereas  prior to the end of the 1980's, "international" pensioners were  entirely able to exist on a 160-ruble individual pension of USSR  value, and possibly did not grumble too much for that reason,  today most of them receive not 100, 200, or even more dollars,  but no more than 80,000 rubles. Their situation is truly  problematic.    Thus, we have to say that for 30 and some odd years, our own  state scraped together a decent amount of capital on hundreds,  if not thousands, of "hard-currency" pensioners. According to  the Russian Pension Fund, these funds did not go to the budget  account of USSR State Social Insurance, allocated for pension  security. For want of a currency account there, the funds simply  went to the state budget.    The discriminatory decree remained in force until 1 January  1991, when the USSR Council of Ministers decided to repeal it.  Serving as the impetus for this, apparently, was a letter of  Perez de Cuellar, Secretary General of the United Nations,  addressed to countries that have confiscated funds from their  citizens working within the United Nations system. The message  emphasized that "this practice does not conform to the United  Nations Charter, contradicts personnel regulations, and is  damaging to basic principles of international civil service."  Since January 1991, not one former Soviet--or today  Russian--international civil servant retiring on pension has  chosen a ruble pension over a hard-currency one.    However, extending at last to Russian employees of  international organizations the opportunity to themselves  dispose of their earned hard currency, the state "forgot" to  restore the rights of those who "voluntarily" exchanged their  currency pension for a ruble one over the course of the past 30  years.    To the numerous applications by members of the Association  to  Russian and international authorities requesting reinstatement  in the United Nations Pension Fund and the return of unlawfully  confiscated money, the majority of such organizations responded  with silence.    The scandalous story continued following the appeal of  Vladislav Tikhomirov, former United Nations employee, to the  Constitutional Court. On 1 July 1993, examining the case of Mr.  Tikhomirov, the court also acknowledged the right of the  Association of Former International Employees to stand up for  the interests of their members. The court established that the 1  December 1958 decree violated the UN Charter, the Universal  Declaration on Human Rights, the Convention on UN Privileges and  Immunities, and so on. Indeed, it was recommended that the  government reinstate the plaintiffs in the UN Pension Fund.  Following this, upon request of the Russian Federation Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, the process was postponed two months. A  representative of the ministry promised to resolve the problem  on the governmental level over this time frame. However, the  Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Social Security took up a  rigid stance--there was no money. In the meantime, the Russian  Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs admitted that pensions  were confiscated from former Soviet employees of the UN in  violation of the Charter of this worldwide organization and  other international agreements concluded under its aegis. As a  result, a double standard was put into effect: 158 former  employees receive pensions from the UN Pension Fund, and 87  individuals are denied this right.    Not too long ago, the Constitutional Court received a  response from Mr. Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the Russian  Federation Government, stating that the government intends to  examine this issue.    In the meantime, the UN Pension Fund is attempting somehow  to  resolve this problem as it conducts negotiations with the  Russian representation of the United Nations in New York.  Without instructions from Moscow, however, the latter is not  competent to decide this question, and the matter will most  likely again come to a standstill. It should also be noted that  the search for palliative measures on the national level will  not resolve this problem and will not halt the stream of  complaints to the United Nations and the courts. UN provisions  with respect to securing pensions for its employees have been  ratified by the General Assembly of this organization. These  provisions are unique. They do not coincide, and indeed cannot  coincide, with the national pension plans formulated in  isolation and effective in 160 member states of the United  Nations.</p>

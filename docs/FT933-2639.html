			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Photo-Me rises 7% but shares tumble 50p SHARES OF Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator, fell sharply yesterday as the group reported pre-tax profits for the year just 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 17.59m, against Pounds 16.41m. While sterling's devaluation contributed Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits, the gains were absorbed by high depreciation costs, which reached Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 11m). The shares closed down 50p at 343p. Operating profits before depreciation rose to Pounds 31.78m (Pounds 27.42m), while turnover grew to Pounds 134m (Pounds 114.8m). Mr David Miller, managing director, said that the rise in depreciation costs reflected the cost of installing instant printing machines for letterheads and labels, as well as upgrading 600 photo-booths with equipment that provided prints in three minutes instead of five. The group had also written down to zero assets on an older business in Europe, taking a one-off charge of Pounds 1m, and incurred start-up losses in Eastern and Central Europe. Mr Miller said the company was disappointed by the lack of growth in its key markets, but it had 'taken our bad news on the chin.' The group would continue to concentrate on its core photographic and imaging businesses, including 'Fun' studios, which allow customers to be photographed in front of famous backdrops or with celebrities. It had signed agreements to sell 'significant quantities' of equipment to new territories. The group continues to expect potential growth from its data identification systems division, which provides photos for identity cards. It blamed 'governmental financing' for slow growth in the past two years. Earnings per share eased to 17.58p (17.9p). A final dividend of 3.2p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 4.6p (4.4p).</p>

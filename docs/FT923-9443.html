			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes easier after another lethargic session THE Nikkei average closed marginally lower after another slow session, as continuing lethargy weighed on investor sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 16.86 at 15,692.59. The index fell to the day's low of 15,600.76 in the morning on selling by dealers, but gradually improved on index-linked buying to reach 15,957.45 in the afternoon. Late afternoon profit-taking then depressed share prices and pushed the Nikkei back into negative territory. Volume totalled a thin 150m shares, but exceeded Monday's 121m, a 10-year low. Declines led rises by 669 to 254, with 140 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 7.27 to 1,200.17, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.19 to 962.38. Traders are becoming concerned that new public offerings will inflict further damage on an already sliding market. Initial public offerings resumed in May after a six-month suspension. Yamazaki Construction, which made its debut on the over-the-counter market this week, has been trading at 10 per cent below its initial offering price. In spite of the market weakness, some 200 companies have completed listing preparations and are waiting for final approval. The Transport Ministry has also indicated its determination to float shares in JR East, a part of the former state-run Japan National Railways, by the end of this fiscal year. Mr Keiwa Okuda, transport minister, said yesterday that JR East will file an application for listing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the end of this month. The Transport Ministry will negotiate with the Finance Ministry for a listing by early October. Dealers continued to take profits on speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk Products, the day's most active issue, fell Y31 to Y804 and Okamoto Industries lost Y25 to Y995. Nippon Housing Loan, which is facing large problem loans, slipped Y10 to Y157. Reports of the company's involvement in stock price manipulation, and alleged tax evasion discouraged investors. High-technology issues rose on buying by dealers. NEC moved ahead Y15 to Y765 and Hitachi Y10 to Y730. Bank shares lost ground. Industrial Bank of Japan weakened Y40 to Y1,710 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,260. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 92.97 to 17,533.89 in volume of 6.8m shares. Small-lot selling by dealers depressed Ono Pharmaceutical, which receded Y150 to Y5,450, and Omron, down Y60 at Y1,070. Roundup PACIFIC Basin markets concentrated on local issues yesterday. HONG KONG retreated on rumours of a rights issue by Hutchison Whampoa and a covered warrant issue by HSBC Holdings. The Hang Seng index relinquished 50.95 to 5,859.78 in turnover of HKDollars 2.05bn. HSBC declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53 and Hutchison Whampoa surrendered 50 cents to HKDollars 15.80. SINGAPORE improved as investors sought blue chip stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 10.77 to 1,455.75 and rises outpaced falls by 113 to 85. SIA foreign shares advanced 30 cents to SDollars 17.40. SEOUL fell on unsubstantiated rumours that Mr Kim Woo-choong, chairman of Daewoo Group, was planning to set up his own political party. The index closed 7.15 off at 501.48 in Won127.7bn turnover. TAIWAN advanced in thin trading. The weighted index gained 16.1 to 4,088.18 in turnover of TDollars 16.5bn. Plastics and electronics led the gains, with Acer rising 20 cents to TDollars 19. MANILA rose on bargain hunting. The weighted index put on 12.16 to 1,491.98 in turnover of 106m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index edged up 0.72 to 602.11, but declines led rises by 137 to 97. Telekom Malaysia firmed 10 cents to MDollars 14. AUSTRALIA lost ground in dull trading. The All Ordinaries index shed 4.8 to 1,612.5. News that Woolworths was to be floated by its parent, Adsteam, later this year helped other retailers move ahead. Adsteam gained 3 cents to 28 cents, while David Jones rose 8 cents to 37 cents. NEW ZEALAND saw a strong rally in the second-line issues. The NZSE-40 index appreciated 6.15 to 1,561.33 in turnover of NZDollars 21.92m. BANGKOK lost early gains in the afternoon session, leaving the SET index a net 2.74 down at 754.48. Turnover came to Bt9.14bn. Declines outscored advances by 130 to 96. There was active trading in finance and property shares, with Bangkok Land down Bt4 to Bt138. BOMBAY drifted lower in thin trading as heavy rain kept traders away. The BSE index finished 36.16, or 1.3 per cent, off at 2,686.49.</p>

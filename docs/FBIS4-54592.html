			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 29 (CTK) -- Parliament today approved  an amended law on political parties and movements which allows  citizens over 18 years of age to become members of only one  political party or movement.    Under the amendment political groupings are forbidden to run  businesses. The dominant role in funding political parties and  movements will be played by the state which will allocate 162  million crowns (about $5.4 million) annually from its budget  providing the Senate is not filled. If it is filled, state  subsidies will be 40 million crowns (about $1.3 million) lower.  In addition to this, parties and movements can acquire money  through membership fees, from the lease of movable property and  real estate, from loans, credits and gifts.    Reports on the financial management of political parties and  movements, submitted to parliament and the Supreme Inspection  Office annually by April 1, will include a list of gifts, their  amounts and donors. If the value of a gift or the sum of the  gifts' values from one donor exceeds 100,000 Czech crowns (about  $3,333) a year then parties and movements must include basic  personal data on the donor.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 2 (AFP) -- The Indian Army began the  countdown Thursday for the first "user trial" of the home-built  Prithvi surface-to-surface missile, whose possible deployment  has aroused US concern, reports said here.    Prithvi, or Earth, which has a range of 250 kilometres (156  miles), would be tested during the next 48 hours, the Press  Trust of India (PTI) quoted unnamed defence sources here as  saying.    A spokesman for the defence ministry here confirmed that  preparations had begun for the trial, which was postponed from  May 15 until Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's return from a  visit to the United States.    "The test will be carried out provided all systems are found  to be working well and there are no last-minute snags," the  spokesman said.    Top army experts and defence scientists have reached the  test  site at Chandipur-on-Sea in the eastern coastal state of Orissa,  PTI said.    The missile has been successfully tested several times by  the  Department of Defence Production, but it would be the first  "user-trial" ahead of its possible mass-production for  deployment in the army.    US Ambassador-Designate Frank Wisner has urged New Delhi to  reconsider deploying the missile.    Washington has voiced fears that India's missile programme  might lead to another arms race between India and arch rival  Pakistan, with whom it has fought three wars since 1947.</p>

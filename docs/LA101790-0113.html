			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO EXHUMES 'DON QUICHOTTE';  </P> <P> MASSENET: FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FEODOR CHALIAPIN, SAMUEL RAMEY TURNS  SUBLIME MADNESS INTO A LYRIC TRIUMPH.  </P> <P> Cervantes sings again.  </P> <P> This time, however, the impossible dream bears no Broadway glitz. Don Quichotte  -- a.k.a. Quixote -- is tilting at distinctly operatic windmills in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Jules Massenet's sugar-coated portrait of the eccentric man of la Mancha has  not fared particularly well in the opera house. Although "Don Quichotte" served  as a grateful vehicle for Feodor Chaliapin at the Monte Carlo premiere back in  1910, the opera has been revived only sporadically in the interim.  </P> <P> Basically, its survival in the repertory has depended on the whim of popular  bassos who want to be profondo in quest of romantic grotesquerie. Vanni Marcoux  actually eclipsed Chaliapin in the composer's favor as the protagonist. In  recent years, both Ruggero Raimondi and Nicolai Ghiaurov have triumphed in the  challenge. San Diego ventured "Don Quichotte" on behalf of the unforgettable  Norman Treigle in 1969, only to introduce a very young Michael Devlin in the  role when Treigle fell ill.  </P> <P> Now it is Samuel Ramey's turn. At the War Memorial Opera House on Sunday, the  American basso didn't attempt much of a character study. He pasted some  appropriate gray whiskers on his youthful face and donned a whispy wig.  Otherwise, he remained the handsome matinee idol to whom we have become  accustomed.  </P> <P> On the surface, his Don might just as well have been named Giovanni. One  expected him to proudly bare his hairy chest at any moment.  </P> <P> Ramey let us forget about the aging knight of the doleful countenance. He  conveyed little of the sublime madness that should illuminate the hero's  quixotic manners and quirky stances. He did convey essential dignity, however,  and he sang very nicely.  </P> <P> Sang very nicely? That is a ridiculous understatement.  </P> <P> Ramey sang beautifully. He sang magnificently.  </P> <P> He sang with firm, warm, rolling, even tone. He sang with ease that flagged at  neither range extreme, with extraordinary lyrical suavity and reasonable  dramatic point.  </P> <P> When the spirit moved him, he even sang softly. Muted dynamics have never been  a Ramey specialty. But here, in moments of ecstatic reflection, he floated  pianissimo tones that created their own aura of mystical pathos. It was a happy  revelation.  </P> <P> Any vocal performance of such quality would justify the exhumation of a work as  flawed as "Don Quichotte." Compounding good operatic fortune, San Francisco  managed to complement Ramey with two eminently worthy colleagues and a  remarkably sympathetic conductor.  </P> <P> Michel Trempont as the doggedly devoted Sancho Panca provided an ideal  counterforce -- dramatically earthy and musically elegant. He steadfastly  avoided comic caricature and, despite rather slender baritonal resources,  tugged the assembled heart-strings heftily in the climactic scena beginning  "Ca, vous commetez tous un acte epouvantable."  </P> <P> Last seen here as Waltraute, Katherine Ciesinski portrayed Dulcinee, the  mezzo-soprano vamp with a heart of gold and an abiding love of pearls. She sang  with vibrant insinuation and acted with alluring abandon that nearly validated  the inherent cliches.  </P> <P> In the well-staffed pit, Julius Rudel made Massenet's perfumed banalities sound  sensuous, urgent, even noble. This American conductor from Austria really knows  his way around the fragile French repertory.  </P> <P> It would be nice to report that San Francisco provided an appropriately  compelling theatrical framework. Unfortunately, the physical production turned  out to be a thing of shreds and patches.  </P> <P> The innocuous, painterly canvases were borrowed from Chicago. Pierluigi  Samaritani, the designer, demanded that his name be removed from the credits,  however, when numerous modifications distorted his original scenic vision. One  cannot blame him.  </P> <P> The all-purpose costumes, also attributed to no one, came from the warehouse of  the Opera de Marseilles, as did a monstrous, nightmarish puppet that rose in  the sky near the windmill -- breaching the quasi-realistic style of the  production in the process.  </P> <P> Another import from Marseilles was the stage director, Charles Roubaud. He  functioned primarily as a traffic cop.  </P> <P> Victoria Morgan's incidental dances looked like frantic exercises for some  ballet troupe gone a-slumming. The chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, made nice  noises and struck friendly poses.  </P> <P> The stage pictures certainly were stilted. At least they were pretty.  </P> <P> And so -- for all its sentimental vapidity -- was the music.  </P></p>

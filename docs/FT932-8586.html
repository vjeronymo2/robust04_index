			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nintendo ponders the threat to its market dominance - An uncertain future for Japan's third-largest profits earner THE sparsely-furnished head office of Nintendo in the traditional capital city of Kyoto belies the success of Japan's third-largest profit earner. There is nothing about the drab walls that line the corridors or the nondescript furniture that sits in otherwise bare meeting rooms that gives even a hint of the wealth the Japanese video games manufacturer has generated. This austerity seems characteristic of Nintendo's approach to business. While the company is likely to have surpassed Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer, in terms of profits, it operates with just 892 staff in Japan, compared with about 150,000 at Matsushita. Nintendo is also sparing in its product range. While its main competitor Sega is busy launching a new advanced games machine, Nintendo has chosen to stay with its latest generation machine, which it believes has more potential for generating profits. It has a strategy of keeping costs and risks to a minimum by subcontracting all manufacturing apart from some assembly work and testing. This lean, mean strategy has yielded enviable results. NRI, the research arm of Nomura Securities, forecasts Nintendo will report non-consolidated pre-tax profits of Y167bn (Dollars 1.5bn), up 7 per cent from Y156bn in 1991, when it announces its results this month. The figure beats the Y102bn forecast for the year by Matsushita. Profit per employee comes to roughly Y187m. And although Nintendo expects capital expenditure for the year to be about Y10bn, it also has a cash pile of Y289bn or 58 per cent of total assets. It has built up a formidable presence in its home market, where it controls about 95 per cent of the market by its own estimates, and overseas. For a company that used to derive most of its income from selling playing cards, that is a remarkable achievement. While a low-cost structure helps, a better clue to Nintendo's prosperity may lie in the formula for success it used in generating profits from playing cards for nearly 100 years since it was founded by the great-grandfather of Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's president, in 1889. What Nintendo learnt in the card business was that entertainment value, or software, is what differentiates one set of playing cards from another. For example, by introducing cards with Disney characters on them, Nintendo was able to create high demand among Japanese children. It has taken a similar approach to its electronic games business. Nintendo relies for the bulk of its revenues on just three money-spinning machines: the Nintendo Entertainment System, the portable Game Boy and the 16-bit Super NES, and their software. The reason why the company has done so well is because its software is so much more entertaining than that of other video games manufacturers, says Mr Tokio Sotani, managing director. Nintendo's obsessive concern with software quality has led it to keep tight control over the production of the software cartridges even though it has more than 100 outside software producers writing games for it in addition to its in-house software staff of 150. Mr Sotani is confident that as long as there are attractive games to play the popularity of video games will not wane. However, the future, may not be so certain for Nintendo. Recently it has had to combat a wave of bad publicity when it was discovered that excessive use of video games machines could trigger fits among people with a certain type of epilepsy. More worrying is the growing success of Sega, its arch rival. Overseas, Sega has won about 40 per cent of the market in both the US and Europe. Sega beat Nintendo to the market with a games machine using CD-ROM discs which can store far more information than conventional cartridges. Sega has taken the lead in bringing games software directly into the home by tying up with Time Warner and TCI, two of the largest US cable television companies, to provide Sega video games on cable television. Other competitors, including large consumer electronics companies such as Matsushita, are piling into the video games market with product launches expected this year. 'Competition is getting a bit tougher. But I haven't seen anything from Nintendo that shows that they have done something to adapt to the new environment,' says Mr Jeff Camp, industry analyst at Jardine Fleming. Nintendo has yet to reveal plans for introducing CD-ROM games machines or how it would act on its stated intention to use satellite broadcasting to bring games into homes. Nintendo's response to suggestions that it has been slow to adapt to a changing market is outright contempt for competitors who rush to bring new products to the market that neither consumers, nor they themselves, may be ready for. 'We will not bring out CD-ROM until software producers are sufficiently satisfied that they have come up with software that is truly different,' says Mr Sotani. However, even Nintendo accepts that it faces a challenge. 'I believe 1994 will be a turning point,' says Mr Hiroshi Imanishi, general manager of the general affairs department. Although outwardly confident of the company's ability to maintain its market dominance in Japan, Nintendo managers are aware that the tide could turn in the years ahead. The nature of the video games market, according to Mr Yoshiyuki Kinoshita, industry analyst at NRI, is that changes in market share come when there is a shift to the next generation technology. Such a shift to multi-media technology has begun with the use of CD-ROM. Depending on which company is able to make the most of the new technology, even Nintendo's total dominance in Japan could be challenged.</p>

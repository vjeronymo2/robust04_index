			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce shows Pounds 20m loss as sales decline ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars, the luxury car subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering group, suffered a trading loss of more than Pounds 20m in 1992, against more than Pounds 30m in 1991. Retail sales of the group's Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars plunged by 20 per cent worldwide to 1,378 (1,713). Sales have dropped by 58.7 per cent in the last two years, from 3,333 in 1990. The luxury cars operation has been drastically restructured with a cut in the workforce from 5,500 at end-1990 to less than 2,500 at end-1992. Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers chief executive, said that the Rolls-Royce break-even level had been reduced to about 1,300 cars a year from double this level in 1990. After incurring trading losses of about Pounds 54m and exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 49.6m in the past two years, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was expected to break even in 1993 with forecast sales of about 1,350 cars, he said. Car production fell last year to only 1,258, from 1,620 in 1991 and 3,274 in 1990. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars' financial performance has deteriorated rapidly after achieving an operating profit of Pounds 32m in 1990, when wholesale car deliveries exceeded 3,200. Sir Colin said that the luxury cars subsidiary was now 'well-placed to benefit strongly from any sustained increase in demand from current depressed levels' in the wake of the two-year rationalisation programme. 'Even a modest upturn in key markets will help restore profitability. Last year Rolls-Royce and Bentley sales fell by 63 per cent in Japan to 91 (248), while in the UK they fell by 23 per cent to 380 and in continental Europe by 26 per cent to 294. Sales in North America rose by 1 per cent to 412. Sir Colin said that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was still working a four-day week with no output on Fridays. Production could be raised to about 2,000 cars a year without any increase in the present workforce. He added that the group was still ruling out the development of a new model range in the medium-term but would continue with 'evolutionary engineering' of the present range. The priority was to return Rolls-Royce to profitability, but in the longer-term Vickers would again look for a partner to share the development costs of a new model range.</p>

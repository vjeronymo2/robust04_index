			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk referred to the  initiative by President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev  concerning the formation of a Eurasian Union of the CIS  countries as premature. Speaking before journalists in Kiev,  Kravchuk said that this idea needs to be studied in-depth.  However, he added, this should be done not by the CIS heads of  state but by way of referendums. He underlined that he was  against the dissolution of the Commonwealth of Independent  States which, in his opinion, has not yet exhausted itself.  Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian  Parliament, earlier supported the initiative by the Kazakhstani  president on setting up a union of CIS countries on a new basis.  President of Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Askar Akayev also approved  of this idea. The official press of the other Central Asian  republic -- Uzbekistan -- gives it a negative assessment.</p>

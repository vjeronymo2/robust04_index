			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Playmates profit turns turtle as sales dwindle DWINDLING sales of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles resulted in Hong Kong toy company Playmates International announcing a 27.5 per cent drop in 1991 earnings to HKDollars 881.6m (USDollars 114.5m) from HKDollars 1.22bn in 1990. But it remained the most profitable toy company in the world. The Mutant Turtles were the best-selling toy in the US last year, in their fifth year on the market, while Playmates' new 'WaterBabies Doll' became the number one baby doll in the US. The company blamed an overall fall in sales on the 'difficult overall retail climate'. Playmates had announced an 8 per cent increase in profit at the interim stage, but the anticipated surge in Christmas sales failed to materialise. The company said it took 'a decision not to ship heavily during the fourth quarter, leaving retailers sold through and ready to reorder at the start of 1992'. Operating profit was sharply lower, falling 31 per cent to HKDollars 1.17bn, but the net profit figure was rescued by a sharp reduction in overseas tax. Analysts expressed concern that sales of the mutant plastic action figures had peaked and Playmates had failed to come up with a 'hot' replacement. The much-vaunted 'Toxic Crusaders' was a big disappointment, with the grotesque figures withdrawn within a year of their launch. The company has retained a war chest of more than HKDollars 1.5bn to seek 'opportunities in mergers, acquisitions as well as diversifications', but it has had difficulty locating suitable targets. Playmates recommended a final dividend of 25 cents and a special cash dividend of 40 cents, making a total payout of 83 cents a share, compared with 65.5 cents in 1990 - adjusted for a bonus issue. Mr Chan Tai Ho, chairman, described the outlook for 1992 as 'excellent', with strong sales expected for product lines including a number of new lines based on television shows and films, including 'The Addams Family'.</p>

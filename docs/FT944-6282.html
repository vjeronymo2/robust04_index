			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Borrowing to fall sharply despite real spending rise - PSBR outlook The Budget announced a much more rapid reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement than its predecessor, from Pounds 34.4bn this year to only Pounds 5bn in three years. Lower than expected inflation explains the bulk of the improvement in the public sector finances. Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget predicted a PSBR of Pounds 38bn in 1994-5, falling to Pounds 12bn by 1997-8. The chancellor promised that lower inflation would not be allowed simply to translate into a higher volume of spending in the years ahead. But low inflation does appear to have made it difficult for the government to maintain the 1.3 per cent real reduction in government spending in 1994-5 aimed for 12 months ago. Although falling in nominal terms, the public spending total will actually rise by 1.4 per cent in real terms in 1994-5. The Treasury is predicting much of this year's real spending increase will be clawed back in 1995-6, when spending is projected to fall by 0.8 per cent in real terms. This will be followed by real increases of 1/2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, in 1996-7 and 1997-8. Achieving these targets would imply that spending would rise at less than 3 per cent a year in nominal terms over the next three years, or by 0.25 per cent per annum in real terms. Most economists had expected Mr Clarke to announce a rapid medium-term reduction in the PSBR than he predicted a year ago. Yet the prediction of a budget surplus will raise speculation that tax rates will be lowered in the next few years. The cumulative effect of the reduced cash spending totals announced yesterday is that overall spending in 1997-98 will be Pounds 9bn lower than predicted a year ago, at Pounds 272bn. The Treasury's lower forecasts for future inflation will eventually mean that tax receipts will be lower than previously forecast. By 1998, general government receipts are expected to be Pounds 8.5bn below the level predicted last year. The overall effect of lower inflation, however, is positive, because of the scope for lower cash spending totals. This year's fall in unemployment also contributed, by reducing the cost of social security. The faster reduction in the level of the PSBR means that the Treasury now expects net public sector debt as a percentage of GDP to peak at 42.75 per cent in 1996, falling to 36.75 per cent by the end of the century. The Treasury pointed out that the new forecasts implied the UK would meet the EU's excessive deficit procedure by 1996-97. The general government deficit is then expected to be 2.25 per cent, below the 3 per cent of GDP laid down in the Maastricht treaty. ( The new medium-term spending plans show general government expenditure (GGE), excluding privatisation proceeds, declining over time as a share of GDP.</p>

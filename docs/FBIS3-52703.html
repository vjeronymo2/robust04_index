			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, deputy head of </F> the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, in Jerusalem by  Fayiz al-Miliji in Cairo, on the "Dialogue From Afar" program;  date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Miliji] What are the factors that prompted the  Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume negotiations?    ['Urayqat] Actually, what halted the negotiations was  Rabin's  government. The Palestinian side was willing to continue the  talks, despite the deep differences, but the Israeli Government  decided to stop them last week. Now they have decided to resume  negotiations, and we hope that the aim of these negotiations  will not be merely for the sake of negotiating. In other words,  we hope that the resumption of talks will not be an aim in  itself.    [Al-Miliji] The Palestinian and Israeli sides must have  agreed on common points on which the talks can begin.    ['Urayqat] The differences are not linked to specific  details  of the crossings issue or other topics. Instead, the issue is  related to the concepts involved. Israel's concept, as was  apparent when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was in Cairo  and met President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], is that Rabin is  trying to reorganize the occupation through the Declaration of  Principles, even though the accord stipulates the implementation  of Resolution 242, which means ending the occupation. This is  where the problem is. As we noticed, the Declaration of  Principles stipulates Israeli-Palestinian coordination of the  crossings. It mentions the Jericho area, not Jericho City, and  stipulates a withdrawal. But, as we notice, the Israeli  Government is trying to say that they should have full control  over the crossings and roads and so forth. Such issues delayed  the negotiations from the start and led to the failure to  implement the accord on the scheduled date, 13 December.    We hope that the Israeli Government is now ready to enter  negotiations on ways to implement the withdrawal. [words  indistinct] the accord to succeed are two elements. The first  is that the accord combines both the transitional and final  phases with regard to the withdrawal from the Jericho area and  the Gaza Strip and redeployment in other areas. The second is  that President Abu- 'Ammar has declared that he is committed to  the accord's provisions. Therefore, we hope the Israeli  Government will adhere to the letter and spirit of accord so  that we may be able to implement its provisions on the ground.    [Al-Miliji] Have the two sides agreed only on the resumption  of the talks, or have they agreed on a groundwork from which  negotiations can be launched?    ['Urayqat] I believe it is premature to say that an  agreement  has been reached before the start of the talks. The return to  the negotiating table is a positive measure--because we need to  implement the accord on the ground--but it is too early to say  whether there has been an agreement prior to the talks. I would  rule out such an agreement.    [Al-Miliji] No doubt efforts have been exerted by parties  other than the Palestinians and Israelis to resume the  Palestinian autonomy talks. Will you talk about these parties?    ['Urayqat] Actually, there were no other parties. In our  recent meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, we  asked for their assistance. He said they would not intervene.    The only party that threw its weight behind the resumption  of  the talks is Egypt. As we noticed, Egyptian diplomacy did  everything it could to resume these talks. When he visited  Jordan, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa--contrary to Rabin's talk  about an earlier agreement in Cairo--said there was no  agreement, there were proposals.    I believe that the resumption of talks next week shows the  success of Egyptian diplomacy in this regard.    [Al-Miliji] The Israeli side claimed that a memorandum of  understanding was reached between the Palestinian and Israeli  sides at the recent talks in Cairo. Does this mean that there  should be a third party at any Palestinian-Israeli negotiations?    ['Urayqat] I believe that the presence of a third party is  very important and fundamental at this stage. As we noticed,  the Israeli side claimed there was an agreement, but 'Amr Musa's  denial of this agreement decided the issue before the world.  Rabin thought the world would believe him and not the  Palestinian side, but Musa put an end to the issue.    There are sponsors of this process--the first being the  United States and the second being Russia. Russia is  preoccupied with many of its own problems, and the U.S. side is  not intervening at all. The only side now intervening as a third  party is Egypt. As Palestinians, we believe that Egypt is our  partner in the peace process, not an intermediary. Egypt's  efforts enabled these negotiations to continue, despite numerous  Israeli obstacles.    [Al-Miliji] With the talks on the implementation of  self-rule  due to resume Monday [10 January], what is the Palestinian side  looking for?    ['Urayqat] We are looking for a [word indistinct] and  genuine  implementation of the accord. The accord literally stipulates a  withdrawal from the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip. Withdrawal  means withdrawal. Regarding other areas, the accord stipulates  the Israeli forces' withdrawal from populated areas and a  redeployment of the forces. As for the Gaza Strip and the  Jericho area, the accord stipulated a withdrawal. The  Palestinian side is looking forward to the sincere beginning of  the Israeli withdrawal in accordance with the Declaration of  Principles.</p>

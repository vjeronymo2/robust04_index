			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in </F> Tarhunah on 1 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Brothers, in another outburst of  anger against the challenges of the forces of colonialism and  hegemony to the Arab Libyan people and the Arab nation, and in  another festival of defiance, the masses of Tarhunah today took  to the streets to welcome the brother leader of the revolution  and to fuse together in him. They strongly shouted that the  voice of this free and sovereign people over its land is  stronger than the embargo and the voice of the crusader war  drums.    Amid the masses, the brother leader of the revolution  delivered this speech:    Brothers, when the drums of confrontation beat, Tarhunah,  which history knows very well, will not hesitate to stand in the  front line to face challenge with challenge.    Brothers, at the moment in which the camp of enemies is  trying to impose defeat on the Arab nation and trying to  humiliate this great nation before the world, at this moment the  masses of struggling Tarhunah come out to declare to the world  that in this place humiliation cannot pass. From this place we  challenge insolence and arrogance. From this place we declare  the will of defiance; declare the will of confrontation; and  declare our readiness to face up to the enemies unintimidated by  their fleets, their forces, or their might. The will of the  peoples is stronger than the armies of enemies and the  aggressors. [passage omitted]    Tarhunah became the center of the resistance to Italy and  the  base of the counteroffensive against Italian colonialism.    Tarhunah became the strategic target for the colonialist  operation in the Italian fascist ugly era. They moved their  armies from Gharyan, from al-Aziziyah, and from Tajura in order  to attack Tarhunah from all directions. [passage omitted]    After these villains took over the other resistance centers  their aim and concern was to subjugate Tarhunah and bring it  under control. [passage omitted] Today, brothers, history is  repeating itself: the United States is raising the crusade  banner, and the western Christian forces are allying themselves  with it in a modern neo-crusade aimed at mosques, at burning the  Koran once again, and at taking over Mecca and Medina, which are  now considered as taken over de facto. Most regrettably, the  decision of the Christian states, made at what is called the  Security Council, has been implemented against holy Mecca. The  strugglers, the Libyan revolutionaries, have been prevented from  performing the pilgrimage because the decision of the Christian  states -- America, Britain, and France -- has been carried out  against Mecca. We are playing a part in another historic epic  poem, and God wants to prescribe for us honor, glory, and  martyrdom as He did for our fathers and ancestors.    We will be lucky brothers if we enter more modern battles  against America, Britain, and France. Our dead will be in  heaven and their dead in hell. We will gain glory and leave an  honorable history for our children and grandchildren just as our  fathers and ancestors left this shining history. [passage  omitted]    Tomorrow and after tomorrow, brothers, history will curse  America, Britain, France, and the Western Christian bloc and  will glorify us. History will record sacrifice and glory for us  and shame and disgrace for the states of arrogance.    Brothers, we are resurrecting our history anew because these  hours are the hours of taking along provisions from the history  of our fathers and forefathers who were not living in luxury or  greedy.    Brothers, we are reviving our history, because these hours  are hours where we get inspiration from the history of our  fathers and ancestors who were not prodigal, rich, or greedy.  [passage omitted]    The weapons of confrontation are industrialization, farming,  knowledge, defiance, and austerity. These are the weapons with  which we confront the enemy. We should have a full awareness of  the new international politics meant to bring about a  neo-colonial domination of Christian Europe over the  Arab-Islamic world. They want to destroy mosques once again,  they want to burn the Koran, Koran books once again, they want  us to live as their subjects once again. Never! These evil  objectives will never be realized; they will never be able to  achieve what they want. Here are the aware masses, the free  masses, the [word indistinct] masses that can instill life in  the dead and lift the morale of the humiliated Arab nation.    We send our backing and support to the fighters of the  Lebanese people who launch daring attacks and are unafraid of  the threats of America, Britain, France, and Europe. So that  despicable Zionism will understand, they launch daring attacks  on the north of Palestine and we say to them that these attacks  open the door for the great conquest, the liberation of the land  from the south to the south [as heard]. These attacks must not  stop, must not stop in southern Lebanon as far as the south of  occupied Palestine.    O brothers, we will not be satisfied that the soil of Egypt  and Jordan should be isolated from each other with the enemy  dividing them, the enemy who is occupying Umm al-Rashrash which  the Israelis called Elat. This is Egyptian land 100 percent.  [passage omitted]    The Israeli occupation of Umm al-Rashrash prevented even  pilgrims from going to Mecca in cars, on camels, or on foot.  When pilgrims go from Egypt to Saudi Arabia, how will they get  through? From which place will they get through? They cannot  get through, O brothers, by land, because the land between  Jordan and Egypt is occupied. Egyptian Umm al-Rashrash is  occupied. It is a disgrace, O brothers, that Umm al-Rashrash  should be occupied. It is a disgrace that the Arab homeland  should be divided on land between Jordan and Egypt. The battle  will be for the liberation of Umm al- Rashrash. The  revolutionaries of Egypt, of Jordan, or the Arab Peninsula are  faced with the task of the liberation of Umm al- Rashrash so  that the Egyptian land may find itself in contact with the  Jordanian land through Ummm al-Rashrash. This is the coming  battle. The first battle toward which the Islamic world must  move is the liberation of Umm al-Rashrash. Egyptian Umm  al-Rashrash is an extremely important strategic area. It has  divided the Arab homeland, broken the spine of the Arab nation,  prevented the pilgrims of the Arab Maghreb from going to Mecca.  You cannot pass from Egypt to Jordan because Umm al-Rashrash is  occupied, brothers. This is not Palestine, not occupied  Palestine. Egyptian Umm al- Rashrash is occupied.    When they ask Syria to recognize Israel in return for a  withdrawal from the Golan, it is a great encroachment, a great  humiliation, brothers. Syria has the right to recover the Golan  Heights in acordance with the UN charter, without any condition.  The Israelis must withdraw from the Golan without any condition  or negotiations. The Golan is an occupied Syrian land. The UN  charter says that land must not be taken by force. Why,  brothers, are they trampling the UN charter underfoot? They are  trampling international law underfoot and asking Syria to  recognize Israel so as to humiliate it, to belittle it, to  tarnish its history of struggle, and to humiliate the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party at pan-Arab and international levels.  They want to humiliate the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party. They  want to inflict humiliation on the history of the 'Umayyids  [dynasty of caliphs who had Damascus as capital] and the history  of Khalid Ibn-al-Walid [Arab army commander who conquered Syria  and the Levant]. [passage omitted]    Brothers, they want Libya to rcognize Israel so as to solve  the problem of Lockerbie with her. To hell and 1,000 times to  hell if that is the condition. Never and never, this condition  will never be realized. Libya will fight until doomsday. Libya  knows through her historic awareness and her rich history that  the road to her security in the future, to which she is forging  ahead, is fraught with sweat, blood, and sacrifices. However,  it is the only road and there is no alternative to it to reach  an honorable and free tomorrow.    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] O brothers, they lie and  cheat, they say that Libya brought down the Pan Am plane and  that this is the problem. So there they are behind the scenes  saying ...[changes thought]... this is not the problem. The  problem is that Libya is called upon to recognize Israel. Look  at this injustice. They want us to recognize that white is  black and that black is white. Why should we be forced into  recognition? Death is easier than recognition, easier than  recognition by injustice, by falsification. We do not recognize  falsification. Palestine ...[changes thought]... the  Palestinian people, Palestine is an occupied Arab territory.  [passage omitted]    We support the Jews so that they live in their homelands and  are respected, so that persecution is lifted on them, including  the Jews from the Arab world. They must return to their  countries and Palestine must be left to the Palestinians. We  challenge them to return the Palestinian people to Palestine. We  challenge them to carry out free elections with the Palestinian  people's presence and under the supervision of the so-called  United Nations, as is the case now in South Africa. We  challenge them to show they want peace. We are the ones who  call for this solution and we are the ones who want and love  peace. When we are forced to fight, we will fight with  fierceness and madness because we will be forced to fight,  whereas they are cowards who look for fighting for prosperity  and when the time of confrontation comes, they will run away  like dogs just like Italy ran away from this place, this sacred  place.

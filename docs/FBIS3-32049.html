When the count was finished in the 5,897 polling stations in  330 municipalities, the TSE confirmed high abstentionism which  reached 84.13 percent in the referendum on 30 [number as  received] constitutional reforms. There were 370,044 "yes"  votes; 70,761 "no" votes; 97,107 annulled ballots; and 7,982  blank ballots. Of the ballots that were to be handed out to 3.4  million Guatemalans eligible to vote, 2,890,533 were not used.    The results confirmed the predictions of political analysts  about the people's indifference to the referendum, which favored  the "yes" vote.    The TSE indicated that Sunday's abstentionism was the  highest  ever in any general election or referendum in this country,  whose history is marked by dictatorial regimes and traditional  electoral apathy.</p>

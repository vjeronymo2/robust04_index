			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Japanese season still clouded by domestic issues - Sony/Matsushita/Honda Earnings announcements by Japanese companies gather full steam this week, with brokers, trading houses, construction companies and particularly leading consumer electronics companies reporting their annual results. Although many brokers, due to unveil results on Wednesday, reduced their profit forecasts in March, most are likely show recovery. They have seen a rise in income linked to the south-east Asian markets and to profits from bond trading, but the gains have not been large enough to cover lower-than-expected stock market volumes. In consumer electronics, Sony will release figures on Thursday. A 30 per cent fall is expected in parent company pre-tax profits, due to depressed domestic demand, while pre-tax earnings are forecast to rise 8 per cent thanks to recovery in the US. Matsushita Electric Industrial, due on Friday, expects a 4 per cent fall in parent company pre-tax earnings and a 7 per cent decline at the pre-tax level. Most consumer electronics companies have made substantial efforts to cut costs, but the beneficial effects have been offset by currency losses following the yen's appreciation. With orders falling for nearly two years, construction companies, reporting on Thursday, are expected to show weak figures. Nomura Research Institute estimates that the sector's pre-tax profits fell by about 17 per cent in the year to March. NRI forecasts a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the trading houses, hit by a decline in imports caused by the economic slump. Many companies are still suffering from securities investment losses made during the late 1980s. Honda, the carmaker, has pencilled in a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits because of the decline in domestic demand.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Securicor up despite flat tone at Cellnet Securicor, the security and communications group, yesterday announced a 33 per cent increase in annual profits despite a flat performance by Cellnet, its 40 per cent-owned mobile phone network. Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 rose from a restated Pounds 47.3m to Pounds 63m. On continuing operations, however, the improvement was more modest with profits ahead 15 per cent at Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 55.2m). Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said the group had reduced its reliance on Cellnet, which has fuelled the results in recent years, while the group's other divisions had improved sharply. Profits from continuing managed business operations - security, parcels, communications, insurance and business services - rose 85 per cent to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 9.3m). Yet Cellnet, in which BT has a 60 per cent holding, still accounted for more than 70 per cent of total profits with a pre-tax contribution of Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 45.9m). Mr Bob Warner, Cellnet's managing director, said the network had been held back only by the launch costs of its Lifetime service and substantial marketing expenses. Group turnover increased 9.2 per cent from Pounds 583.8m to Pounds 637.3m, while Security Services - the 50.75 per cent-owned subsidiary where most of the group's operating companies are held - reported turnover of Pounds 616.4m (Pounds 562.9m). Profits at the subsidiary increased by 41 per cent from a restated Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 43.3m. Among Securicor's managed businesses, the security division showed the sharpest improvement as the benefits of a two year rationalisation programme pushed pre-tax profits up to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 5.6m). Although the parcels division was hit by overcapacity, it gained market share from rival companies and reported profits of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 4.6m). The communications division, excluding Cellnet, continued to lose money. But an increase in the number of subscribers for Securicor Cellular Services, the retailing company, helped cut losses to Pounds 4.5m, compared with Pounds 6.6m last time. In spite of the improvement, Mr Wiggs warned that further rationalisation would be necessary to improve margins. Restated group earnings per share rose from 20p to 30.2p, while earnings at Security Services increased to 26.6p (14.9p). A final group dividend of 2.229p is proposed to make a total of 2.961p, an increase of 13 per cent. A similar increase is proposed at Security Services, a final of 4.151p making a total of 5.684p. COMMENT Although Securicor has enjoyed improved contributions from its managed businesses, Cellnet is expected to reassert its dominance this year. Indeed, speculation that BT may consider a bid for Securicor's stake has enhanced the price of its A shares, up 6p to 916p yesterday. Buoyant Christmas sales and about 400,000 new subscribers has further boosted Cellnet's performance, and its contribution to Securicor could grow by at least Pounds 10m. That expectation has pushed forecast profits up to Pounds 78m on a multiple of 24.5, which makes the shares an attractive if expensive option.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Skinheads Commemorate Fascist </F> Heyday"]    [Text] Right-wing demonstrators commemorating the 55th  anniversary of the Nazi division of Czechoslovakia exposed their  weaknesses even as they tried to show their strength during the  March 19-20 weekend.    While word of coming "skinhead" demonstrations and other  fascist and nationalist activities caused fear in minority  communities, the weekend's events showed discord among rightist  factions and a lack of support from the general public.    The separation of Czechoslovakia was precipitated by the  March 15, 1939, invasion of the Czech lands by the German army  and Slovakia's declaration of independence a day earlier.    Memories of conflict and mistrust were evoked by the  meetings  of rightist political parties in the big Czech and Slovak  cities, while ethnic tension in smaller towns was aggravated by  processions of skinheads and calls for the rehabilitation of  Slovakia's pro-German wartime leader.    The various groups often clashed in their proclaimed  interests, however much they may seem to have in common. Police  were quick to state that skinhead activists represented no more  than a marginal problem.    Miroslav Sladek, leader of the Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC), made speeches  at rallies in Prague and Brno, condemning as "apologist"  President Vaclav Havel's statements on the deportation of  Sudeten Germans after World War II and calling for "the highest  possible penalty" for any politicians "opening the door to the  Germans."    "Whenever the Germans have wanted to expand into Europe,  they  have always turned to Czechoslovakia first," pronounced Sladek  form his podium at the Jan Hus statue on Prague's Old Town  Square. "We should learn a lesson from Jan Hus, who struggled  for the purity of the Czech nation and was murdered by Germans,  and not from Saint Vaclav, who, like his modern namesakes [Havel  and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus] in today's government, opened  the way for German intervention."    Preaching to a crowd of predominantly older men, Sladek  accused the Klaus government of breaking up the Czechoslovak  federation and weakening it before an expansionist Teutonic  neighbor. "The Germans did the same thing in Yugoslavia: They  encouraged rival factions to fight, and then in the ruins they  bought up the Adriatic coast for a few pfennigs."    The demonstrations were interrupted by outbreaks of  violence.  In Brno, anarchists clashed with the republican crowd March 14.  The Prague demonstration speakers were heckled by skinheads who  criticized Sladek for inconsistency in his beliefs.    About 400 skinheads attended a "White Rock" concert March 19  in the Karlin district of Prague. The event was organized by  skinheads in honor of two of their number whom they claim were  killed by Romanies.    The Czech press reported that Romany children in some areas  of the city were staying away from school as groups of the  notoriously anti-Gypsy skinheads arrived.    Two days before the event, an arson attack at the restaurant  hosting the concert scorched part of the interior. Firefighters  said it could have burned the whole building. Skinheads,  undaunted, flocked from all over the country to hear bands such  as Hatred 88, Attack and Flag.    In Preroy, northern Moravia, skinheads also marched through  the town chanting anti-Romany slogans. The Patriotic Front  association organized the demonstration to remind citizens of  the case of 17-year-old Libor Buzik, who allegedly was attacked  by two Romanies last November and who still has not recovered  fully from his injuries.    Further demonstrations by skinheads are anticipated on the  anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday in April. Police said  they expect a skinhead celebration of some kind in the eastern  Bohemian town of Hradec Kralove to mark the date.    Meanwhile, in Bratislava, Slovak opinions were divided and  emotions ran high as past political passions merged with present  ones.    Competing demonstrators called for both the rehabilitation  and vilification of Jozef Tiso, the Roman Catholic priest who  was president of the "puppet government" during the war. Singing  the Slovak national anthem, a crowd of about 500 gathered near  Tiso's grave in the Martinsky cemetery, while the deacon of  Banov, western Slovakia, said it was time for the younger  generation to hear the truth about Tiso and what he represented  for the Slovak nation.    In the central Slovak town of Zilina, Slovak Peoples Party  Chairman Ludovit Adamov described the Tiso years as "a Slovak  miracle" and defended Tiso's inclination toward Nazi Germany as  a "lesser evil" among the options then available.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov INTERFAX-based report in the "Legislation" </F> column: "Yet Another Profession Will Appear in Russia.  Lobbyists Will Be Registered by the Ministry of Justice"]    [Text] It is quite likely that this fall domestic  legislation will be supplemented by an enactment regulating  lobbying activity in Russia. At least, on the decision of the  State Duma Council, the bill "On Regulating Lobbying Activity of  Federal Bodies of State Power" has been sent to parliament  committees for finalization.    Under the draft, lobbying is understood as activity by  "corporate entities or individuals with respect to federal  bodies of state power aimed at influencing the latter in  exercising their powers as stipulated by the Constitution and  laws of the Russian Federation." It defines, among others, the  following forms and methods of lobbying: presentation of draft  laws, edicts, orders, and other enactments to federal bodies of  state power drafted by a lobbying person or group of persons, as  well as expert assessment of these documents.    The bill specifies that "parliament deputies, elected  officials of the Russian Federation or its components, as well  as bodies and officials from the executive or judicial branches  may not act" as lobbyists. True, parliamentarians, ministers,  judges, and others of that ilk may try themselves in the  lobbying domain but not until at least a year after they have  left their posts.    Each person acting as a lobbyist must register with the  Russian Federation Justice Ministry. The lobbyist is obligated  to send an official report in writing about his activity to the  same body no later than 20 days after the end of each calendar  half-year. Income received by the lobbyist is taxed according  to the laws currently in force.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Efficient - but wrong Sir, Mr David Henderson and Mr David Sawers (Letters, October 12) make the usual mistake of confusing efficiency with effectiveness. The efficient allocation of resources by UK corporations has led to no indigenous UK car industry, motorcycle industry or computer industry, a semiconductor industry on its last legs and a declining industrial base. The UK's European competitors make this error less often, one of the reasons they are better off and the UK is now the poor man of Europe. The application of rationalism to every investment decision (efficiency above all]) has given rise to the above. It is unlikely that UK helicopter component manufacturers are any worse or better in terms of 'efficiency' than their competitors. Thus, the arguments concerning a 'waste of resources' are fallacious. Second, generally speaking, items with added value that comes from thought (helicopters) command a higher price in the market for a given unit of effort than those that need muscle (coal). Thus, the production of high-tech products should lead to a wealthier population. I think the Singaporeans have conclusively proved this. Efficiency has its place, but don't forget that it is entirely possible efficiently to do the wrong thing. This is usually avoided by applying common sense.

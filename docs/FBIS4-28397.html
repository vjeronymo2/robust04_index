			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vietnam Economy" feature] </F>   [Text] Friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and the  Republic of Korea has developed quickly through official  bilateral relations which was established in December 1992. The  two countries have signed an agreement on investment  encouragement, a trade agreement, an agreement on aviation, and  set up an intergovernmental commission on economic, scientific,  technical, and trade cooperation.    Economic ties have particularly developed rapidly. South  Korea is granting official development aid of $50 million to  Vietnam. Part of this sum is to be spent on the construction of  a water plant in Thien Tan, Dong Nai Province, in service of  daily life and industry in Bien Hoa industrial center. The rest  will be spent on the construction of Highway No. 18 from  Haiphong to Cai Lan Port in Quang Ninh Province. South Korea  has granted an additional $10 million to help Vietnam carry out  some more projects.    In 1993, two-way trade turnover between Vietnam and South  Korea was $800 million, an increase of 60 percent compared with  1992. It is estimated this year that the figure will increase  by $1 billion. At present, South Korea has started two  investment projects in Vietnam with a total investment capital  of more than $500 million. South Korea ranks fifth among foreign  investors in Vietnam. Major projects include oil and gas  exploration and exploitation, and the construction of the Sai  Dong Export Processing Zone in Hanoi. Many of these projects  are well implemented, and others have great prospect for success.    Bilateral cooperation in science, technology, culture,  sports, and health have also made good progress. In 1993, South  Korea granted dozens of short-term scholarships, and helped  train thousands of people in different sectors in Vietnam. In  1994, under a labor agreement between the two countries, South  Korea will receive 2,400 Vietnamese people as guest workers in  South Korea for a third country. [sentence as heard]    During the South Korean foreign minister's visit to Vietnam  in early May, the two countries signed an agreement on avoidance  of double taxation. This was a significant event marking the  development of bilateral relations, strengthening of economic  and trade ties between Vietnam and South Korea, and meeting the  interest of peace, stability, and cooperation in the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lastenia Murillo Munoz] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that he  has no responsibility for a possible rupture of the alliance  between the Arnulfist Party and the Molirena [Nationalist  Republican Liberal Movement] in light of the 1994 elections,  because "I respect what was agreed upon in the Santa Maria  Agreement."    Endara noted that he should not be questioned on whether or  not the alliance will be broken because that issue concerns the  political parties who are conducting the negotiations. Some  media have reported that the government alliance between the  Arnulfist Party and the Molirena was broken once they failed to  reach an agreement regarding who was going to head the  presidential ticket.    Molirena wants to head the official presidential ticket, but  the Arnulfist Party believes that Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, the  widow of former president Arnulfo Arias Madrid, should have this  position.    According to Endara, he took off his "politician's hat" on 8  November when he promised not to interfere in the electoral  campaign, and "since then the only hat he wears is that of  president of Panama."    Meanwhile, Education Minister Marco Alarcon said that the  possible rupture of the government alliance "is a situation that  was perceived from the beginning given Molirena's  intransigence." Alarcon believes that "it is disgraceful" for a  country that the most powerful -- financially speaking -- groups  try to impose candidacies, and the people must react against  this intention.    Alarcon added that "for moral reasons" Molirena should  resign  from the government in light of the fact that "they have the  power and the money" and it is untrue that "the people will  allow them to choose our next president."</p>

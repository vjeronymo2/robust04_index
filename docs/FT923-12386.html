			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Magic moments Mr Neil Kinnock will always regret that he did not make a bigger splash. But his long march from the mining valleys of south Wales to the leather and mahogany of the leader of the Opposition's suite in Westminster - which he hands over today - has had its memorable moments, Ivo Dawnay writes. Elected in 1983 on the so-called dream ticket with Mr Roy Hattersley, his photocall with Glenys, his wife, on Brighton beach ended in a celebrated dunking. Some called him a 'Welsh windbag'. But his husky oratory was as much a hallmark of his nine-year leadership as his celebrated attack in 1986 on the 'grotesque chaos' generated by the Militant-influenced Liverpool City Council. His speech, punctuated by jabbing his finger in the air and rocking on his heels, was compared with former leader Hugh Gaitskell's 'fight, fight and fight again' speech on nuclear disarmament. Most in the party will thank him for his courage in purging the extremist fringe. His inimitable personality - sometimes hugely ebullient, sometimes close to depressive - was as crucial a component of his leadership as his long crusade to bring Labour back to electability with policy reviews and party reforms. Wary of press attacks and the griping of his colleagues, Mr Kinnock's office became known as the 'bunker', protected by a doggedly loyal private staff. It was that, perhaps, that helped contribute to the decision to go ahead with the 1992 Sheffield rally - widely criticised as 'triumphalist' and deemed, with hindsight, as ill-advised even by party headquarters. But in the end, his prime ministerial ambitions were larger than life could deliver.</p>

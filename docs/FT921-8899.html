			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: County spending set to rise 7.8% - Local authority budgets SPENDING by county councils looks set to rise by almost 8 per cent in 1992-93, close to twice the projected inflation rate, and contributing more to poll tax bills likely to be well above the government's target figure of Pounds 257. According to a survey in today's Local Government Chronicle the average increase in spending in English counties - with figures in from 35 of the 39 counties - is about 7.8 per cent. This is in spite of the fact that the proposed budgets are generally in line with the government's standard spending assessments (SSAs). Under government rules to limit local spending, that means their precepts are tied to being no more than 6.5 per cent above last year's, roughly the figure settled on by 18 of the authorities. In almost all cases the figures reflect budget plans that have yet to be ratified by the full council. The figures fuelled Labour's claims that headline poll tax bills were likely to be closer to Pounds 300 than the government's target. As district councils take final decisions on the levels of bills over the next few weeks the issue will become more sensitive in pre-election campaigning. According to the local authority associations actual local authority spending this year is likely to come out at about Pounds 39.9bn. This means the government's figure for planned spending of Pounds 41.8bn next year represents an increase of only about 4.8 per cent. Some county budgets may rise further, however, as a result of the 7.8 per cent teachers' pay award announced by the government earlier this week. Teachers' pay is the largest single component of county budgets, and most counties budgeted for an increase of only 5 per cent to 6 per cent. Nonetheless, Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, insisted yesterday: 'Any competent and well-run authority can afford not only to pay for the teachers' pay rise but increased expenditure on education.' Speaking on BBC radio he added: 'I don't think there will be any redundancies on any significant scale, certainly none caused by the pay rise.' Labour points out that the overshoot on county spending does not take account of any addition to poll tax bills as a result of the non-payment surcharge, which will be assessed only when the districts set their budgets. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, said: 'Since counties account for most of the community charge bill in the shire areas, I see no reason to doubt that community charges will be quite close to government target.' He added that the recent review of non-payment by Cipfa, the public sector accountancy body, showed that nearly half the councils surveyed would not have to levy a non-payment surcharge. The Department of the Environment said that the projected spending levels from the counties would add only about Pounds 5 to each poll tax bill in shire areas. But Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said that these figures confirmed 'the total fairytale of the government's Pounds 257 target poll tax'. He added: 'Most of these councils are making cuts in essential services yet still bills are bound to increase. For the poll tax payer this will truly be the worst of both worlds, with reduced services and a new wave of poll tax hardship. Blame should and will rest firmly at the government's door.' Widespread cuts in services seem likely. All but four counties - Essex, Hampshire, North Yorkshire and West Sussex, all Tory-controlled - are likely to spend at or very close to their capping level. Among the four counties not included in the survey it is expected that Warwickshire is likely to set a budget well above the cap on spending.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ENGLISH AND WELSH COUNTY PRECEPTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Increase    Increase                               Precept (Poundsm)   in precept   over SSA Counties                       92-93    91-92         %         92-93%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- England Avon                          588.62   552.70        +6.5        +4.2 Berkshire                     488.53   447.96        +7.9         0.0 Buckinghamshire               418.53   385.96        +6.5         0.0 Cambridgeshire                402.10   373.21        +7.7         0.0 Cheshire                      619.80   582.00        +6.5        +4.9 Cleveland                     431.84   405.46        +6.5        +2.4 Cornwall                      297.01   276.30        +7.5         0.0 Cumbria                       321.09   306.05        +4.9        +4.9 Derbyshire                    586.51   557.04        +5.3        +5.0 Devon                         613.86   573.38        +7.1         0.0 Dorset                        369.77   335.80       +10.1         0.0 Durham                        381.54   358.25        +6.5        -0.7 East Sussex                   417.83   283.20        +9.0         0.0 Essex                         939.03   854.06        +9.9        -3.8 Hampshire                     914.00   846.79        +7.9        -4.2 Hereford &amp; Worcs              397.04   364.89        +8.9         0.0 Hertfordshire                 613.78   658.25        +9.9        -0.7 Isle of Wight                  81.83    76.84        +6.5        +0.1 Kent                          955.00   842.80       +13.3        -2.4 Lancashire                    960.90   902.26        +6.5        +2.6 Leicestershire                579.01   539.74        +7.3         0.0 Lincolnshire                  370.76   335.00       +10.7         0.0 Norfolk                       446.00   417.95        +6.7         0.0 North Yorkshire               408.53   378.16        +8.0        -2.5 Northamptonshire              374.23   347.92        +7.6         0.0 Northumberland                186.88   177.82        +6.4        +5.0 Nottinghamshire               666.37   625.70        +6.5        +2.1 Oxfordshire                   333.83   313.46        +6.5        +3.1 Shropshire                    258.16   242.40        +6.5        +0.5 Somerset                      290.21   272.50        +6.5        +2.5 Staffordshire                 625.38   586.59        +6.6         0.0 Suffolk                       374.99   352.10        +6.5        +0.5 Surrey                        575.80   533.84        +7.9         0.0 West Sussex                   386.20   354.62        +8.9        -6.8 Wiltshire                     339.47   312.23        +8.7        -0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Wales Clwyd                         286.60   269.09        +6.5        +2.9 Dyfed                         256.30   284.76        +9.2        +2.0 Gwynedd                       168.56   157.83        +5.8         0.0 Mid Glamorgan                 389.52   352.88       +10.4        +2.2 Powys                          93.03    87.67        +6.1         0.0 South Glamorgan               273.08   253.32        +7.8         0.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Budgets subject to ratification by full councils.

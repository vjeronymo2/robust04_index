			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has decided to extend government subsidies to provide  more money to funds set up by leather industry organizations to  help stabilize the domestic industry. The move has been made in  response to an agreement Japan made with the United States and  European nations at GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks  (Uruguay Round), which was concluded late last year. In the  trade talks, these nations demanded Japan lower its tariffs on  leather and leather shoes. MITI plans to request a total 4.8  billion yen allocation from the fiscal year 1994 budget.    Concerning tariffs on leather and leather shoes, Japan  currently imposes a preliminary tariff of 15-27 percent on  import volumes under a certain limit and a secondary tariff of  60 percent on those above this limit. This high tariff rate is  designed to protect the domestic leather industry. However,  Japan agreed with other GATT member nations at the Uruguay Round  talks to reduce preliminary and secondary tariff rates on such  products by 20 and 50 percent, respectively. Consequently, it  is expected that imports will now increase and domestic  businesses will face hard times.    As a step to help stabilize domestic businesses, the Japan  Federation of Leather Industries and Japan Tanners' Association  have separately set up funds. Firms belonging to the two  organizations have used profits made through utilization of the  funds to finance research and development of new technologies.  So far, MITI has extended a total of over 7 billion yen to the  two funds since the tariff quota system was introduced.</p>

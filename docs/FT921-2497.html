			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Gateway buoys Somerfield side Gateway, the grocery chain which forms the bulk of the Isosceles investment company, is to convert 13 more stores to its up-market Somerfield trading format by the end of April. This will bring the total number of Somerfield stores to 27 with a trading area of 210,000 sq ft. Gateway is also converting three superstores to its Food Giant format selling a wide range of heavily-discounted lines. This brings the total number of Food Giants to 18. Isosceles, which this week revealed it was planning to float Wellworth, its Northern Ireland food retailing subsidiary, has been developing its new format stores in an attempt to address what it sees as a segmenting food market. Somerfield stores, typically trading from high street sites in market towns, are targeted at convenience shoppers. Food Giant is squarely aimed at the discount market.</p>

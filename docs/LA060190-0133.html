			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. JUDGE DISMISSES SUIT OVER SHILEY HEART VALVES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has dismissed a consumer group's lawsuit  seeking to force Irvine-based Shiley Inc. to notify persons who have received  Shiley heart valves about potential defects.  </P> <P> Judge Ronald M. Sohigian on Wednesday accepted the company's argument that  Congress has given the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authority that  supersedes the state's in the area of medical devices.  </P> <P> Jim Capretz, attorney for the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a  Washington-based organization founded by Ralph Nader, said the group will  appeal the decision in the state courts. Capretz contends that a state court  can make a decision about how Shiley heart valve recipients should be notified  because the FDA has not taken any action in this area.  </P> <P> Capretz also said Public Citizen will petition the FDA to require warnings to  be sent directly to more than 85,000 people who received implants of certain  Convexo-Concave heart valves made by Shiley, which is a subsidiary of Pfizer  Inc. The valves have not been used since 1986.  </P> <P> Since the first of two Shiley valves that are the center of controversy went on  the market in 1979, the company has reported a total of 389 failures resulting  in 272 deaths.  </P></p>

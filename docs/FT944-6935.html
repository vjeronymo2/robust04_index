			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Victorian who designed himself - A new biography of William Morris, artist and socialist extraordinaire WILLIAM MORRIS: A LIFE FOR OUR TIME by Fiona MacCarthy Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 25, 780 pages No Victorian, eminent or otherwise, was more critical of his own age than William Morris, who was born three years before Victoria came to the throne and died five years before her. 'Apart from the desire to produce beautiful things,' he wrote in a memorable passage in 1894, 'the leading passion of my life has been and is hatred of modern civilization.' Yet for all his discontent and for all his protest, he belongs unmistakably to the 19th century - even when he compares it unfavourably with the 13th, or strides into the future. He proves that the Victorians were their own best critics - both when they examined Victorian achievements and when they probed Victorian values. In his energy, which faltered only at the last, and in his amazingly wide range of achievement Morris was characteristically Victorian. The manifold things that he made belong to that century also. The first biography of him, by JW Mackail, appeared before the century and the reign was over. Since then there have been many other biographies and many detailed and scholarly studies of Morris's contributions to the making of embroidery, tapestry, stained glass, wallpaper textile dyeing, printing and weaving, illumination, calligraphy and book production. And there has been a devoted, sometimes uncritical, interest, frequently on the part of two separate groups of admirers, in his political views and actions, and in his conceptions of design. Morris himself, unlike them, saw his life as one piece. It was to a fellow socialist that he wrote in 1883, the year when he declared his new political commitment, that almost all the designs used in his business 'I design myself. I have had to learn the theory and to some extent the practice of weaving, dyeing and textile printing: all of which I must admit has given me and is still giving me a great deal of enjoyment'. In the same spirit he approached the theory and practice of socialism. Those of his admirers who failed to take his socialism seriously did not understand him. Fiona MacCarthy does. Her biography is a work of synthesis, drawing on a wide range of sources, and it concentrates on presenting Morris as a whole man rather than on cataloguing a formidable list of his activities. Mackail tried to do the same, but MacCarthy chooses to examine aspects of Morris's personality that Mackail, writing near to his death, could or would not do. At the same time, her book is an original interpretation in that it draws on the author's own experience and interests, very different from those of Mackail and another outstanding biographer, EP Thompson. Her chapter headings reflect this. They are the names of places, not a sequence of events: Walthamstow, Marlborough, Oxford and, of course, Red Lion Square and Red House, Kelmscott Manor and Kelmscott House, and two countries, Iceland and Norway, the former a country, both on the map and of the mind, which influenced him profoundly. Given Morris's own sense of place, Fiona MacCarthy's mode of arrangement is entirely appropriate. And the different places she lists do not so much figure in a chronological sequence as in an intricate pattern of desire and of memory. When Morris came to write News from Nowhere in 1890 the different strands in the pattern were woven together, and significantly there is as much in it about the place as there is about time. Happily Fiona MacCarthy does not offer us a label for Morris to set alongside other biographers' Marxist Morris, Freudian Morris, Jungian Morris, the entrepreneurial Morris or the Morris 'who has now been appropriated by the Greens'. She does rely on her intuitions, however, as well as research, and as a result deals particularly sensitively with Morris's relationships with Janey and Rossetti, and their own relationships with each other. A sense of place necessarily involves a sense of relationships, and what Morris made of 'fellowship', which he believed was at the very heart of socialism, was derived not from books or pamphlets but from private relationships. The priest from a neighbouring parish who officiated at Morris's funeral service at Kelmscott had been with him both at Marlborough and at Exeter College, Oxford. He did not refer to Morris's work for the socialist cause, much of it humdrum and hard, but chose as his text a passage from Corinthians, 'unknown, and yet well-known'. In the 20th century Morris, remains 'eminent' (he would have hated the adjective), both unknown and well-known, topical, not canonical. In his own century he was a pilgrim of hope, putting his trust, a 19th-century trust, in 'how he might live', in society not as it was but in what it might be. He conceived of fear and hope as the great moving forces in history, and in the style of Corinthians believed that the greater of these was hope. In his poems 'Pilgrims of Hope', printed in instalments in 1885, he wrote of 'the day that yet shall be'. This was the same series in which 'The Message of the March Wind' was written. Morris felt that he was no longer 'the riddle singer of an empty day'. He was an activist proclaiming a message that he believed would change history just as much as it had changed himself.</p>

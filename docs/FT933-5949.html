			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Canadians sign aeroengine deal in Russia PRATT &amp; WHITNEY Canada, a subsidiary of the US enginemaker, announced yesterday a deal with Klimov, the Russian company, to make aircraft power plants. Mr GilIes Ouimet, the Canadian company's executive vice-president, said the two companies had agreed to create a joint venture which would produce its first engine by the end of 1994. The plan was to be able to build 100 engines a year, he said. Having been one of the first western companies to clinch a deal that has already yielded fruit, by providing engines for a jointly-produced plane with Ilyushin, Pratt &amp; Whitney yesterday presented a first ever joint venture to manufacture engines for helicopters and smaller aircraft. The establishment of a joint venture with the Klimov design bureau in St Petersburg and Pratt's Canadian offshoot highlights the demand for superior engines to match superior Soviet aircraft frames. For Russia, the web of contracts and resulting deals is providing an encouraging, if sometimes irritating, model of what co-operation with the west can bring. Mr Alexander Sarkisov, general constructor of the state-owned Klimov, which has designed 90 per cent of the engines on Russian helicopters, was unmoved by suggestions he was betraying the Russian engine industry. 'We will devote as much capacity as the market can take for making engines with Pratt &amp; Whitney,' he said, displaying the emerging capitalist toughness of many Russian managers. He also stressed, however, that the engines would be sold and serviced for roubles, not hard currency, at prices which would make them attractive for Russian manufacturers and foreign ventures. Executives from up to 200 foreign companies have converged on Moscow this week for Russia's second annual aerospace show. All have come to be seen, and to be heard, organising often lavish news conferences, even if they have nothing new to say. As for the French aircraft-maker Aerospatiale, at a news conference in a Moscow luxury hotel, the chairman Mr Louis Gallois had little concrete progress to report since a visit earlier this year when he signed a series of protocols of intent with almost every major Russian aerospace company. He revealed only that Aerospatiale had concluded 'contracts' on hypersonic research with two Moscow institutes but could not give any details. He said Aerospatiale was also keen to help Russia develop its potential for titanium exports for the western aerospace industry. He promised that Aerospatiale, which was 'patiently building' a foundation for future co-operation, would by the end of the year set up a jointly-owned company with Russia's Mil enterprise to build the Mi-38 helicopter, a 13-tonne machine designed for heavy loads and public works. If Pratt &amp; Whitney's joint venture produced concrete results, he added, the Franco-Russian partners might consider buying engines from it. As Russia makes strides to a market economy, its aviation industry is seen as one of the country's most promising sectors for foreign buyers, sellers and investors. The westerners are attracted by Russia's technical prowess, cheap labour and the publicity to be generated by announcing deals with Russian companies, even if they subsequently fall through. Having been beaten to the announcement of a similar deal between the Mikoyan Design Bureau and Thomson, France's Dassault Electronique will this week try to present an agreement with Mikoyan to upgrade old MiG-21s as the first such deal to be up and running. It has its eye on a Dollars 300m contract to provide new electronics systems for India's fleet of 100 such aircraft.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Management: Nationality should still count In this age of affaires sans frontieres, a company's nationality of ownership no longer matters. For a manufacturer, what counts is where it carries out its research, development and production. So long as it does not concentrate these activities in its home base, but disperses them across several countries, it can be at least as good an owner of enterprises in those countries as a local parent. It will often prove a better one, since it brings extra scale, skills and synergy. That, in essence, has been the welcoming reaction of most enlightened politicians, economists and journalists to BMW's bold snatching of Rover from under the nose of the latter's Japanese parent-in-all-but-name, Honda. Their reaction is more right than wrong, but nevertheless simplistic. So was last week's declaration by Michael Heseltine, the UK's trade and industry secretary, that 'ownership is unimportant'. The reality is that, in many cases, nationality of ownership still matters considerably - but not always in the way people think. It should not matter, and eventually may cease to, but not for decades. It is true that manufacturers of all nationalities have erected production plants all over Europe, America and Asia. But, contrary to the fashionable wisdom promulgated by influential academics such as Robert Reich - now US labour secretary - it is still the exception rather than the rule for higher value-adding activities, especially design, development and engineering, to be equally dispersed across borders. For various reasons, most German enterprises are especially loath to do this. The truly 'transnational' company - what Reich calls a 'global web' - with high added value activities situated almost regardless of its headquarters nation - is the ideal corporate animal of the future from several points of view, but it is still a rare breed. At present, except in companies such as ABB, Unilever, Hewlett-Packard, and a few chemicals giants, most units outside the home country direct their activities only at local or at best regional markets - they do not serve the world. This privilege is generally left to units at home, be that in Japan, the US or Europe. As for the establishment of research units around the world, this brings multinationals much publicity, but is usually less significant than it looks. With a few exceptions, most Japanese 'R&amp;D' laboratories in the US and Europe are off-line labs serving the home base - where the real added value is done. Nissan's European technical centre is an exception, doing design and development work which is integrated closely with the company's UK and Spanish plants. Nor is senior managerial decision-making usually as dispersed as the location of a company's physical facilities might suggest. This is true not just of most Japanese multinationals, but also of many European ones, as Jim Hamill of Strathclyde University suggested in the FT on Monday. In relatively few multinationals has the headquarters of even a single business division yet been transferred, or otherwise established, outside the home country. Yet this is a test of true 'transnationality'. In a few cases such moves have been reversed, and power clawed back home again. The net result is that, in most companies - including the majority of German ones - the home country still benefits from an overwhelming 'headquarters effect': an unusually high concentration of technical skills and senior decision-takers. This is true even of a long-standing 'good international corporate citizen' such as IBM. In these circumstances the question of nationality may still weigh heavily for the managers - and, in an ideal world unlike Rover's, the shareholders - of a company confronting a takeover from abroad. When Rowntree, the UK chocolate maker, was faced with contested bids in 1988, both happened to be Swiss. It chose the right one: from Nestle, which has treated it with respect, whereas it would almost certainly have been swamped by its alternative Swiss suitor, Suchard, which now has an American parent, Philip Morris. In Rover's case, matters are complicated by the fact that BMW's home base is closer at hand than Honda's; this will reduce Rover's degree of future independence. As Ford has found, a company incurs a high cost, but not necessarily a commensurate benefit in market or organisational terms, if it operates closely-linked design and development activities in countries as near as Germany and Britain. There will be considerable pressures over time within BMW-Rover to rationalise activity on to one site or other, as there have been at Ford. So, despite the reassurances that BMW has given, and the lower cost of doing design and engineering in Britain, a gradual seepage of highly skilled work to Germany is likely. The situation is made more sensitive by the fact that BMW's nationality is more Bavarian than German - a far from fine distinction. Hardly anyone seems to have made the - for Britain, ominous - connection with the current controversy about where Audi, the Bavarian-based luxury offshoot of Volkswagen, should locate a new plant. Last weekend the Bavarian prime minister's office said it would do everything in its power to have the car built in the state, rather than elsewhere in Germany or in Belgium. For Rover, the best defence against external pressures of that kind, as well as internal ones within BMW, would be to persuade Honda to remain its minority parent. As companies such as the UK's Crosfield Electronics have found, it can do wonders for one's independence if one has two parents rather than one - especially if they have different nationalities.</p>

Under the current system, a per-share capital increase  resulting from a company's purchases of its own shares for  write-offs is regarded as a taxable dividend.    The business community and securities companies have been  calling for abolition of the tax to make it easier for companies  to buy their own shares.    The officials said the system will be abolished under a  fiscal 1994 tax reform program and in connection with the  scheduled year-end lifting of restrictions on companies buying  their own shares.</p>

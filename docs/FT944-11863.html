			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Italian inflation turns downward Italy's annual inflation rate dropped by 0.1 per cent to 3.8 per cent in October after two months of small increases. This year, growing business confidence has led to autumn price rises being brought forward from October to September. As a result, it was expected that inflation would fall in October, but the reduction is less than predicted. The Bank of Italy's quarterly bulletin, published this week, estimated 1994 inflation at 'around 4 per cent' against the official objective of 3.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent in 1995. Orders for west German manufactured goods recovered strongly in September, rising 4.8 per cent on the month and more than 9 per cent on the level a year earlier. The figures, which the economics ministry said were likely to be revised upwards by up to one percentage point, showed a 12 per cent rise in foreign demand and a 1 per cent increase in domestic orders. Seasonally adjusted Danish unemployment fell sharply from 12.2 of the labour force in September to 11.7 per cent in October. The decline by 12,500 to 328,400 jobless is the biggest monthly fall so far recorded. Unemployment was 12.5 per cent in September last year.</p>

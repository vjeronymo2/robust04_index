			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel of Militia Vladimir Rushaylo, head </F> of the Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime, by  Aleksandr Danilkin; place and date not given: "We Are a Bone in  the Mafia's Throat"]    [Text] It was thought until recently that there was no  organized crime in our country. Judging by court statistics,  there was also no gangsterism. But when special subunits in the  fight against organized crime were finally established, "an  unexpected discovery" followed: being without them is like being  without hands. And the most drastic type of modern crimes is  their stock in trade: rackets, hostages, and gangster showdowns.  War every day. Novices have assumed leading roles.    The Moscow Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime  (RUOP) was established two years ago, and from its very first  days it has been headed by Colonel of Militia Vladimir Rushaylo.    [Danilkin] Vladimir Borisovich, recently employees of your  directorate had a housewarming, when you had to exchange the  legendary address of 38 Petrovka for 6 Shabolovka...    [Rushaylo] Yes, we moved to a separate house, but it is not  necessary to search for any secret reasons or undercurrents, or  for distrust toward the rest of the militia service. It simply  became too crowded for us at 38 Petrovka, inasmuch as the number  of our employees had increased, and rather significantly. We  were forced to take this step. Incidentally, thanks to the  concern of the Government of Moscow and the mayor.    [Danilkin] If it is not a secret, by how much did the  Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employee staff  increase?    [Rushaylo] During the last year--fourfold. Judging from the  situation, this is not the maximum. Many call our subunit elite.  I do not regard this as superiority over other services, but as  the level of demands that are made on us.    [Danilkin] So, two years have gone by. In your opinion, has  the new subunit justified the hopes that were associated with  its creation?    [Rushaylo] It would be improper to give an evaluation of  one's own work, but I think that it is possible to claim that we  have succeeded in occupying a noticeable niche in the law  enforcement area. Organized crime is a phenomenon that is purely  social, intruding into all spheres and trying to get ahead of  the law enforcement system, mastering increasingly newer types  of crimes. Owing to this, certain dead zones are being  organized, which our militia branch services were not succeeding  in looking into, as narrow departmental barriers interfered. But  we use simultaneously the principle of criminal search (from the  criminal offense to the person) and the principle of the subunit  in the fight against economic crime (from the person to the  crime), with the latter dominating. We are able to take in those  dead zones, which have begun to turn into volcanoes.    For example, a crime has been happening here recently which  we previously only heard about, or knew very little about. For  example, extortion: As recently as 1986 there were four cases in  all of Moscow. But in the past year alone we have registered 333  cases, and, consider this, this type of crime is one of those  that are especially latent. Or kidnapping people to obtain a  ransom, as we say, seizing hostages: two cases were registered  in 1990, and last year here there were 77 citizens' appeals for  a similar reason, and 62 criminal cases were instituted.  Finally, in January of this year 30 citizens filed complaints  with us regarding seizure of hostages. Our employees worked on  each case, freeing the people.    [Danilkin] But how many criminal cases on seizure of  hostages  were instituted? For example, in January?    [Rushaylo] Unfortunately, only six. Inasmuch as the article  of the Criminal Code "Seizure of Hostages"--the jurisdiction of  the Procuracy--allows for ambiguity in the classification of the  crime, which leads to casuistic legal games. We are trying to  conduct a practical dialogue with the Procuracy, but for the  present we are able to bring only a third of the cases to a  juridical result.    [Danilkin] Organized crime is feeding on the particular  weakness in the sphere of the economy...    [Rushaylo] In connection with the fact that the state sector  has almost disappeared completely, numerous associations with  limited responsibility have appeared, but, as we say, with  unlimited opportunities. In this situation criminal groups,  especially of an ethnic orientation, have set themselves up  quite successfully. They are organizing associations that would  seem to be engaged in commercial activity. But they are in fact  laundering criminal money. Frequently, the very trade kiosks  that congest the city are used as a cover for criminal activity.    [Danilkin] Are our mafiosi laundering money, taking the  experience of their Western colleagues into account?    [Rushaylo] The traditional spheres of organized criminal  activity in the West are the gambling business, prostitution,  and drugs. In our country, organized crime has chosen other  types of trade; for example, extortion is rather widespread. A  so-called protection tax is imposed on businessmen. The  criminals approach a commercial structure: "Do you have a  `roof'? What are you standing under?"--this is nothing other  than extortion, and it brings in colossal incomes. Some prefer  not to make a fuss, and make the payoffs. Anyone who appealed to  us received professional assistance..    [Danilkin] It is said that almost all entrepreneurs are  covered with this same "roof?"    [Rushaylo] It is impossible to give a precise figure. But it  is impossible to say that absolutely everyone is paying tribute.  More than a dozen people come to us every day with complaints.  And many of them say that the extortionists had approached them  for the first time. It is advantageous for the criminals to  spread rumors that everyone is paying up. Then it is easier for  them to tell people: "If everyone else is paying--why are you  not paying up?" A psychological working-over goes on.    [Danilkin] Thus, it turns out that you have to work in  various directions. But how in your opinion did Moscow organized  crime spot your unit? How dangerous an opponent are you?    [Rushaylo] First of all, it is necessary to make a  reservation--at the present time there is no single organized  crime structure in Moscow. There are a number of organized crime  groups: regional, ethnic, interregional, and transnational.  Internecine wars rage continuously between them for spheres of  influence. So, for these groups the regional directorates for  fighting organized crime frequently become a bone in the throat.  Our opponents' arsenal includes threats, intimidation, attempts  to influence our relatives--we feel all of this personally,  since we have occasion to affect someone's criminal interests  all the time.    [Danilkin] And how do you react to such threats?    [Rushaylo] In an appropriate way. We guard our people, and  we  are in a position to protect them. However, credit must also be  given to the opposing side; they have begun to approach "raids"  on the Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime in a  creative way.    [Danilkin] What do you mean?    [Rushaylo] I have in mind an organized campaign to discredit  the subunits in the fight against organized crime. A whole  series of articles have appeared in the press recently which,  trying to "scoop" us, "expose" our employees and our operations.  No, we are not suffering from megalomania and infallibility, we  have ordinary people working for us who make mistakes and  miscalculations. But from the articles I have in mind, the  telltale signs were too strong. We later conducted our own small  investigation and we have an idea how much these articles cost  somebody.    [Danilkin] Are you not too categorical in your conclusions?    [Rushaylo] Not at all. In all the articles there is one  thought on the surface: Regional Directorate for Fighting  Organized Crime members fire at whatever comes to mind, they are  creating tyranny, and guiltless citizens are suffering.    [Danilkin] But what is really the case?    [Rushaylo] For this it is necessary to return to reported  cases. For example, the incident at the Koptevo bathhouses in  November of last year. Here is the sense of the information  released in the newspapers: Regional Directorate for Fighting  Organized Crime employees opened fire for no reason on a  suspicious group of men in a residential rayon, as a result of  which one of them died under obscure circumstances, and two  militia men were wounded. It is totally incomprehensible, on the  other hand, it is a pity about the member of the Koptevo group  who was a victim. But this is the way the official investigation  interprets the events. An operational group was surveilling  Zhiguli's, one of whose passengers had a weapon. The militia  employees stopped the car at the Koptevo bathhouses and asked  for documents. In response to this, a passenger in the Zhiguli  snatched a screwdriver and struck an employee in the face.  Almost simultaneously shots were fired in the direction of the  militia employees from three cars standing nearby, and  afterwards a dozen men armed with baseball bats, knives, and  guns went after the militiamen. Only then did they employ their  official weapons. As you see, there is a substantial difference  in the description of the events.    [Danilkin] What other articles are you talking about?    [Rushaylo] The events of 25 January at the Izmailovo hotel  complex are described in this same vein: operatives opened a  barrage of fire on a Cherokee jeep because, as it seemed to  them, people from an Izmailovo group were sitting in the  vehicle. The jeep jumped into the oncoming lane and collided  with an oncoming vehicle, whose passengers perished in the  crash. There was not a word about the fact that before this, the  jeep, coming out of a chase, rammed into a militia Zhiguli (one  of the employees incurred concussion of the brain), that sitting  in the jeep was the authority of an Izmailovo criminal group who  was under federal investigation for robbery with use of  firearms, that they fired at the wheels...    A militia operation in the private club White Cockroach was  described in the same vein.    [Danilkin] Do you want to say that the Regional Directorate  for Fighting Organized Crime has declared a psychological war?    [Rushaylo] We have always been in a state of war with crime.  It is simply that new, legal forms of struggle against us have  emerged. And we must be prepared for this. For discreditation of  our employees, unfounded accusations, and fabricated  compromising material. These methods are known throughout the  world.    [Danilkin] How do you intend to react to such accusations?    [Rushaylo] I can firmly promise our opponents one thing: Any  attempt by criminals to employ weapons against our employees  will end with one and the same thing--we will shoot to defeat  them. This is our tough, principled position. No kinds of rumors  or planned accusations of alleged illegal actions will prevent  our employees from acting within the scope of the law and the  powers granted them. Incidentally, the series of newspaper  articles apparently lack one more thing. The other day, during  the arrest of a group of criminals, a Regional Directorate for  Fighting Organized Crime employee shot one of them. It happened  this way: When a bandit pulled out a TT [Tula Tokarev] pistol  with a bullet in the cartridge chamber and pointed it at the  operative, the militia employee proved to be faster on the draw.  Now we are awaiting a new description of our "criminal errors."    [Danilkin] But you will agree that it was just a few years  ago that every time the militia used a weapon was almost a  sensation and a reason for endless justifications.    [Rushaylo] Yes, it happened. The press wrote for a whole  week  about a mentally ill person who fired a hunting rifle several  times from a balcony, and the entire militia leadership came to  the scene of the incident. Today shots can be heard on Moscow  streets every day. How can this wave of violence be stopped?  Only with harsh measures. But, I emphasize, within the scope of  the law. In the last five years crime in Moscow has increased by  a factor of three. Our service often frees four to five hostages  in a day, we are fired upon, we confiscate mountains of weapons,  drugs...    [Danilkin] Do you not get the impression that Regional  Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employees are now  working in an "emergency first aid routine"--there are not  enough hands despite regular increases in the size of the  directorate?    [Rushaylo] There is such a danger. But we are counting on  the  people's understanding and the support of the leadership of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs and the municipal authorities. This  will greatly help us in suppressing the criminals'  ever-increasing onslaught.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   In one day, just before this material was sent to press,  employees of the Moscow Regional Directorate for Fighting  Organized Crime arrested a group of hired killers from Saransk  (four murders), a crime kingpin, and three authorities in the  criminal world; prevented the theft of money in the sum of 2.4  million French francs; solved six crimes; confiscated four  firearms; and began work on seven complaints that came in that  day.</p>

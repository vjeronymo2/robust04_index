			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: Contracting out - the legal cases favouring employers, and an alternative solution Sir, Your report of government advice on contracting out of public services ('Caution on 'grey area' in tendering', February 4) illustrates that ministers have finally been forced to accept that the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Tupe) and the EC Acquired Rights Directive do apply to the market testing and compulsory competitive tendering programmes. After months of public service minister William Waldegrave and employment minister Michael Forsyth frantically denying any such thing (a 'red herring' was how they described Tupe), we now have the ridiculous spectacle of the government advising departments to seek legal advice on every market test. With hundreds of market tests, just how much is this likely to cost the taxpayer? Desperate to find some face-saving formula for the legal ostriches of the department of environment's compulsory competitive tendering team, all ministers can manage is an enormous job creation scheme for lawyers. There is a straightforward solution to the government's problem: cancel the market testing programme or, failing that, issue instructions to departments that all invitations to tender should specify that Tupe applies. John Sheldon, acting general secretary, NUCPS, 124/130 Southwark Street, London SE1 0TU</p>

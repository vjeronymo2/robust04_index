Kalashnikova, under the rubric "Anniversary": </F> "Dreaming About the High Heavens, TsAGI Is Busy Making Its Own  Boots"]    [Text] Throughout its entire 75-year history, the N. Ye.  Zhukovskiy Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) -- the  leader and head institute of domestic aircraft building -- has  been proud of its contribution to "everything that flies in the  skies over our country." Today, it is concerned with its needs  on the ground.    Things are not easy in the current conditions for the one  who  for so long was the country's favorite brainchild, to whom  nothing was refused, and whose requests were a top priority. In  the years of shortages, lines, and product cards, Zhukovskiy's  aviation center was in no need "in the field" or at home. Now  TsAGI is learning not only to count money, but also to earn it.    Before, fundamental scientific advances, high-tech aerospace  hardware, and defense products were fully ordered, financed, and  used by the state. Now, in crisis conditions, the state accounts  for only 40 percent of the TsAGI budget. The actual situation,  in the estimation of TsAGI director German Zagaynov, is that, in  the near future, society will be unable to support a  considerable portion of the intellectual potential and high-tech  research that have been accumulated.    The problem is not just in the expensiveness of a commodity  whose affordability is limited to only the state or, in the  extreme, large firms who need the product. TsAGI's misfortune is  that it used to be far in the lead in the technical standards of  our society, which is still incapable of making skillful and  full use of the scientific-technical wealth created in the  institute. The institute has to survive on its own: the state  hasn't proposed any special conversion programs or any policy  stimulating internal or foreign investment to support basic  research.    With Russian partners, TsAGI has built and is the proprietor  of a factory that has already begun series manufacture of ...  men's and women's shoes. All the staff members of the institute  will, within a year, be shoed in boots of their own making.  Other commercial enterprises that have been created at TsAGI and  that produce metal tiles, lining panels, mixers, ceramic dishes,  lamps, wood-drying chambers, etc., are also operating  successfully.    A special commercial-conversion service has been created in  the institute to coordinate the new types of activity. It  organizes investment and holding companies and institute banks  and insurance structures; it sets up shareholding; and it is  involved in privatization. The funds attracted in connection  with contracts with domestic industry represents 27-30 percent  of the institute's budget today.    TsAGI's commercial activity is not just a means of becoming  independent in the absence of the customary trusteeship of the  state. It is a means of saving its unique personnel from being  sold off as state orders are cut back and wages drop to low  levels (they are more than twofold lower than the average in the  country). Overall, over 5-6 years, up to 30 percent of the  institute's staff members are expected to be hired by contract.  The fall of 1993 saw the introduction of a system of grants for  young specialists who are developing promising advances, wages  increases of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles [R] for those who enter  master's programs, and awards of a half a million rubles for who  defend their dissertation.    In the opinion of German Zagaynov, to survive, the economy  today needs "monsters" -- powerful multiprofile, multifunctional  corporations capable of combining science and applications,  i.e., basic advances, experimentation, and production. That is  why, at the initiative of TsAGI, the Association of Aerospace  Enterprises and Institutions of the Southeastern region of  Moscow Oblast was formed in October of this year. The operating  program of that consortium involves not only conversion measures  capable of creating and maintaining new markets, but also the  solution of a long-existing, painful problem -- how to raise the  standards of production rapidly.    The initiators of the project feel that it can become a  fragment of the scientific-industrial policy of Russia and that  it will at the same time make it possible for the institute to  "become integrated into the region, work for it, and get results  from the region." There is a hope that the regional corporation  will help to develop and transform for the internal and external  market TsAGI's high-level technologies, which, in return, will  give to the institute its former high professional standing and  to Russia, an economic dynamism, a high standard of living, and  prestige in the world.</p>

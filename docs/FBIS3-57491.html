			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Gladkevich report under the rubric "Housing for the </F> Army": "House Warming Parties in Torzhok"]    [Text] Around 50 military aviators and their families are  this week giving housewarming parties in Torzhok (Tver Oblast).  This is the result of a contract concluded in 1992 between the  Russian "Konversiya-Zhilye" concern and the German firm "Buk  Inpar" [name as transliterated].    Under this contract, implementation of which began in summer  1993, residential settlements for servicemen withdrawn from  Germany and without accommodations are to be erected in Torzhok,  Siverskaya, and Garbolovo by the end of the first quarter of  this year. The contract overall is scheduled to continue  through 1995 and is based on credits totaling 550 million Marks  [DM] granted by German banks and guaranteed by the Russian  Government. Ultimately Russian military men without  accommodations should receive more than 7,000 apartments with a  total area of more than 400,000 square meters.    More than 20 apartment blocks have been assembled in Torzhok  since August; each block has 18 or 16 apartments. Such rapid  construction is possible because the blocks are assembled from  modular constructions produced in Pinnow (Germany), where they  are furnished with all the materials necessary for house  building. They are delivered to the aforementioned regions,  where Russian Federation Defense Ministry construction  organizations and the concern itself assemble the buildings.    "Today we have 320 servicemen without apartments," unit  commander Major General of Aviation Boris Vorobyev says. "The  300-apartment camp which is being erected here will enable us to  provide virtually all of them with housing by the spring. True,  the process of withdrawing troops from the Western Group of  Forces is continuing and new servicemen are arriving in need of  apartments. So we are very much counting on the continuation of  Russian-German cooperation."    Unfortunately these hopes may not be justified. At the  moment the implementation of the first part of the construction  program is being completed -- its construction has cost DM117  million, but that is only a part of the credits needed. The  German side is currently under strong pressure, according to one  of the leaders of "Buk Inpar," Hans Wirtz. The idea of changing  the terms of the credit agreement has gained currency in the  European Community, and that could effectively jeopardize the  program. If it happens, Russia will have obtained 6,000  apartments short of the stipulated number, and the Germans will  lose around 150,000 jobs created thanks to this program.    At the same time, continuing the program in the form  projected by "Konversiya-zhilye" and "Buk Inpar" on the basis of  the second tranche of credits would enable the production of  modules to be launched in Russia itself. Some of the money  could be assigned to organizing this production process at the  Izhora plant, which is not experiencing the best of times. The  use of mainly local raw materials and fabrics would enable the  factory cost of each square meter of housing to be reduced by 40  percent without any deterioration in quality, and, consequently,  allow the construction of an additional 30,000 square meters, to  fulfill the entire program in good time.    The problem of eliminating homelessness in the Army is acute  nowadays, and the possibilities of funding housing construction  from the state budget are extremely limited. In these  conditions we would like any possiblity for nonbudget funding of  housing construction for the military to be exploited 100  percent, and for more and more partners to be involved in this  work.</p>

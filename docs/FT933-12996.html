			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: News Corp aims to target Asia market with Telstra NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group, is in the process of forming an alliance aimed at the Asia media market with Telstra, Australia's biggest telephone company, Reuter reports from Canberra. Industry sources said the state-run Telstra has informally advised the Australian government that the alliance would pursue investments in such services as pay television and home shopping. This is the third recent deal between News Corp and Telstra. They plan to take a substantial stake in Seven Network, the Australian television operator: and they are also in a consortium bidding to operate pay television in Australia. Any alliance would combine the expertise of Telstra with News Corp's media experience and access to TV material. News Corp owns newspapers, magazines, the US-based Fox and its subsidiaries Fox Network and Twentieth Century Fox plus 50 per cent of BSkyB, the UK satellite broadcaster.</p>

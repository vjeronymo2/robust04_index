			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets: Endless growth, full employment, utter gloom - Wall Street These can be confusing times for anyone who follows Wall Street. Consider this: the US economy is in its fourth year of growth and about to enter a fifth, corporate profits are healthy, consumer spending is strong, inflation is low, and the expansion in the labour market has pushed the national unemployment rate down to a level low enough for some analysts to claim that the economy is close to full employment. Yet, instead of celebrating their good fortune, investors in the US stock and bond markets are unhappy. Yesterday's seemingly good news from the September employment report - non-farm payrolls rose by 239,000 and the national jobless rate dropped from 6.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent, its lowest level in four years - was greeted with a marked absence of enthusiasm on Wall Street. After an initial rally, bond prices and stock prices fell back yesterday, and were either flat or below their opening values by midday. Stocks took a beating this week because of fears that the economy is growing too strongly, and bonds are trading close to levels where the yield on the 30-year issue flirts dangerously with 8 per cent, a mark many analysts label 'psychologically important'. (This means that investors will have a nervous breakdown and sell everything in a wild panic the moment the yield rises above 8 per cent.) At least the bond market's discontent makes sense. Rising economic growth almost invariably translates into higher inflation, and inflation undermines the value of fixed-income assets such as government securities. The fact that inflation is low today is not reassuring - it is the prospect of higher inflation tomorrow, and next year, that has the bond market rattled. The explanation for the stock market's behaviour is less straightforward. Although a strong economy and rising employment means higher corporate profits, equity investors - like their counterparts in the bond market - are looking forward six or 12 months. What they see ahead is a worrying reversal in both economic and company earnings growth, a reversal engineered by the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates five times this year in an attempt to slow the economy and restrain inflation. The immediate fear in both markets is that the Fed will raise rates a sixth time, possibly as early as next week when the government releases the September inflation figures. In fact, for much of this week, investors were concerned that the Fed would tighten monetary policy yesterday, after the jobs data were released. Although the employment report failed to trigger a rate rise, it proved to be a mixed blessing for markets. The 239,000 rise in non-farm payrolls was smaller than forecast, but for anyone worried about jobs growth this news was offset by upward revisions in the previous estimates of July and August payrolls. The revisions meant that 106,000 jobs were created this summer of which the markets had been unware. When combined with the unexpected drop in the national unemployment rate to 5.9 per cent, the September report was unsettling news. Analysts said yesterday that if the figures were not bad enough on their own to prompt an immediate Fed rate increase, they certainly increased the pressure on the central bank to raise rates. If next week's inflation numbers come in above the forecasts, analysts are convinced that the Fed will tighten policy. A sixth interest rate increase in eight months would spell trouble for stocks, which after a solid third quarter (the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6 per cent between July and September) are looking vulnerable to a sharp sell-off. If the Fed does act, a rate rise will spoil what should be another encouraging quarterly reporting season. Since the Fed first put up rates in February, the one factor sustaining share prices has been corporate profits, which have grown steadily. Soon that crutch may be removed. At some stage, higher interest rates will effect the economy and earnings. So far, only two sectors have felt the sting: the Wall Street investment banks and brokerage firms, which have seen their profits from securities trading, underwriting and broking plunge, (on Thursday Salomon said it would report a loss of about Dollars 100m in the third quarter because it had lost money trading its own capital in the markets), and the money-centre banks, which have been hurt by lower securities trading profits. Eventually, other industries will start to suffer. Analysts warn that this could happen as early as the first quarter of next year. It is these warnings of trouble tomorrow that are depressing prices today. Monday       3846.89 + 03.70 Tuesday      3801.13 - 45.76 Wednesday    3787.34 - 13.79 Thursday     3775.56 - 11.78 Friday       3797.43 + 21.87</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Promotion at McDonald's MCDONALD'S, the world's largest fast-food company, announced that Mr Jack Greenberg, its chief financial officer, has been promoted to vice-chairman. He will continue as chief financial officer and as a director. He joined the company in 1982. The chairman, Mr Michael Quinlan, said Mr Greenberg had, during the past 18 months, put 'even more ketchup in his veins' - the highest compliment that can be given in McDonald's corporate culture. Mr Greenberg has worked in all facets of the restaurant business. He is expected to shoulder responsibilities in legal issues, government relations, insurance, licensing, personnel, purchasing, real estate and construction, in addition to duties on tax and treasury matters and investor relations and corporate communications. The company, which now has 12,000 restaurants in 59 countries, has been struggling against increased competition in the US domestic market. Sales in its foreign restaurants have been posting double-digit increases, helping to boost overall results. For the first nine months last year, net income rose 7 per cent to Dollars 659.2m, compared with the same period in 1990.</p>

			<p>Conducted   in Japan, Europe, and US: Current Situation of EB  Measurement   <F P=102> 94FE0436B Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES in Japanese Mar 1994 pp  53-56--For Official Use Only </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0436B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] ``SEMI Standard Metrology Committee'' conducted  questionnaires between June 1992, and December 1993 in Japan,  Europe and U.S., to obtain the current status of precision  measurement in LSI circuit lines (see table 1).    In order to maintain the secrecy of a person who responded  to  the questions, and to eliminate the presupposition, no name was  required. In order to collect lively responses, quite a few  descriptive responses were included. The survey using a real  sample was conducted in 1992 by the U.S. SEMI, and although the  real sample was not presented this time, an opinion about  whether such a survey in Japan is possible or not was requested  from the participants.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Responses were returned from 64 departments (including  multiple responses from a single company) such as LSI makers,  equipment makers, material makers, and national organizations.  As for regions, the numbers are: 44 from Japan; 14 from North  America; and 6 from Europe. Sixty-four percent of responses are  in regard to wafer measurment which makes up the major response.  After studying the survey, wafer measurement became the focus of  this discussion leaving the problem of the mask. The majority of  responses were distributed as follows: 47% are from LSI  related  makers; 31% are from concerns in experimental  productions; and  11% are from the concerns in mass production. As for the  equipment methodology, 56% employ the EB method, and  35%  employ the optical method leaving the EB method with a good  lead. Eighty percent of EB method use is in development and  experimental production. On the other hand, 68% of the  optical  application is used for research and development. And it is used  widely in mass production. For price and ease of use, the  optical method is still popular in mass production sites.    After collecting data from LSI makers, it became apparent  that the present measurement capacity is not satisfactory,  although EB will lead over the optical method (see figure 4). It  was also clear that for the improvement in high precision and  aspect ratio that:    (1) resolution including image contrast;    (2) rendering measurement;    (3) wafer charge up;    (4) measurement tolerance between equipment;    (5) improved throughput are needed (see table 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-44A>      Figure 4.

In addition, it was clear that  there is a need to establish standardization including absolute  dimension measurement (see figure 8).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-45A>      Figure 5. Distribution Of Measurement Environments </FIG>     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-46A>      Figure 6. Distribution Of Measurement Method </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-47A>      Figure 7.

Necessity Of Absolute Dimension Measurement and </FIG>   <H5>  Importance Of Resolution, Precision And Reliability </H5>   The problem of the EB method is divided into two problems.  The first problem is to secure high resolution and precision  measurement since minuteness and aspect ratios will become  further advanced. The second problem is to obtain the easiness  of measurement and reliability.    In the first problem, low image contrast as the pattern  aspect ratio becomes high, and unstable image formation are  important topics to study. These problems will fall in (1), (2)  and (3) mentioned the above. Already the current equipment has a  problem of measurement even if the EB method is employed, and a  technological breakthrough is expected.    Especially in precision, there is a problem of rendering the  measurement consistent with resolution. The technology extended  to observation SEM is not solving the problem. The importance of  developing a unique measurement technology is beginning to be  realized by the makers. Therefore, improvement of  electromagnetic lens, and for example, technology that was  developed for stepper in order to improve the stage of static  precision will be necessary.    The problem of charge up will become serious after 0.35  m.  Although the problem is at present resolved by the control of  voltage acceleration, as pattern increases its minuteness, the  problem will become more severe. A technology comparable to the  optical method which can manipulate and reduce charge-up will be  needed.    The second problem will fall in (4) and (5) described the  above. Especially the problem of absolute base for measurement  is surfacing. Deviation of dimension measurement between  equipment is still a problem. However the problem may be solved  by each maker employing a certain measurement base. At present,  a sample of absolute measurement is conducted at the MITI's  industrial technology measurement research center.    Also there are quite a few places in the equipment which  require maintenance and this will influence throughput. From now  on, automatic adjustment will increase the operational  efficiency, and improvement on easy to use interface functions  for users is essential.  <H5>  In EB Method, Linear Approximation Mainly Employed </H5>   In the questionnaire, in order to clarify the problem of  measurement, the current measurement environment and method were  investigated. In terms of measurement environment, it was clear  that there are some differences between the method employed by  Japan and the method employed by the U.S. and Europe (see figure  5). In order to establish high precision and stable equipment,  standardization of environment will become important. Also, in  terms of the measurement method, measuring the bottom of the  pattern with linear approximation by the EB method is common  (see figure 6).    First of all in the measurement environment, for set up  temperature 60% answered 23C in Japan, but in the  U.S. and  Europe the value was 2 to 3less. Also in Japan, there are  quite a few cases where the control is done with +/- 1 to  2C. In the U.S. and Europe control tends to be more  stringent than that. Compared to temperature, humidity has a  wide distribution. A range from 50% with a variation of +  or -  10% is quite common, but the control range is more or less  stringent.    Thus, the equipment environment differs greatly  geographically, and the auxiliary function to correct equipment  will be needed in the system. Also it is necessary to guarantee  that with a wide range of temperature and humidity, that  auxiliary functions will not be placed in the process line. As  the equipment environment is standardized, establishing the  guaranteed range, looking at the practical situation, is the way  to promote performance improvement and price reduction.    Next, status of use looking at the rendering measurement at  the site, measurement position, algorithm for determining the  measurement, and pattern formation will be discussed.    In rendering the measurement, by the experiment in which EB  method and optical method are employed and distributed in the  center of 15 nm and 30 nm with 3 (sigma), it was clear that EB  method is superior to the optical method. In measurement  position, the bottom pattern is 58% which is quite high  in the  case where the EB method is employed. In optical method, the  threshold value is 63%.    This is because in the EB method, with the second generation  electrons from the bottom of the pattern or part of pattern, and  also the intensity ratio of reflection electrons, image contrast  is determined, it is considered that detection of bottom pattern  is easy. On the other hand, in the optical method, dispersion of  light intensity at the edge is strong, and from the threshold  value at the edge part, it is necessary to measure empirically  the bottom dimension.    Since the algorithm to determine the measurement point will  influence the precision of measurement, the makers as well as  users must apply their various know-how. The reason why linear  approximation is used, is that the method is simple and it can  capture the bottom pattern. Also the threshold value is used  with extension of the optical method.    Adjustment of equipment is important to maintain the  precision measurement for a long time, and 92%, a total  of 48  people responded excluding the response of no comments, answered  that they are employing some method of adjustment (see figure  7). The frequency of adjustment is once a day or once a week,  and most of users are doing it by themselves. For adjustment, a  sample base is used, which is frequently made by the users  themselves.  <H5>  Base For Absolute Dimension Is Urgently Needed </H5>   In addition to the current situation of measurement, the  questionnaire included questions about the future  standardization of dimension measurement. Some 85%  excluding no  comment, responded that absolute measurement is necessary (see  figure 8). The importance of this is because of the need for  compatibility of measurement between businesses such as  production lines, research centers, and mass production plants,  and data compatibility outside of companies such as the data  used at academic presentations.    The deviation of design rules is reaching the level of  influencing characteristics of LSIs. Absolute dimensional  measurement is urgently needed after the 0.35 m LSI to  increase the stability and efficiency of production and for the  research and development of terminal devices.</p>

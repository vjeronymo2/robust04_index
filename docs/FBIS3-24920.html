Both government and ANC spokesman indicated on Wednesday  that  they regarded the choice of a single ballot as a practical  choice and not an issue of principle. On Tuesday the furore  over the issue was joined by Anglo American Corporation Chairman  Julian Ogilvie-Thompson and the South African Chamber of  Business, both of whom warned that continued ANC and government  intransigence on the issue could endanger the April election.    ANC President Nelson Mandela and senior ANC negotiators have  said the ballot issue was not negotiable.    ANC spokeswoman Gill Marcus said on Wednesday that the ANC's  preference for a single ballot was not based on considerations  of principle. She said the ANC would prefer a double ballot  under ideal circumstances. However, a double ballot could  create practical problems, not the least of which were  widespread voter confusion. "We would ideally like a double  ballot. It is not a matter of principle. If you can address  the practical problems we would be prepared to support it," Ms  Marcus said. She stressed, however, that this was not a comment  on specific discussions taking place but rather an outlook on  the question in general.    A government spokesman said government did also not regard  its preference for a single ballot as a matter of principle.  "Government is pragmatic on this issue and we are willing to  discuss it."    A Freedom Alliance source said while the ANC's conceding to  a  double ballot would greatly improve relations between the  alliance and the ANC, it would not necessarily be sufficient to  bring the alliance into the constitutional process. He said the  Inkatha Freedom Party was the major force behind alliance  demands for a double ballot.    The ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) met on Tuesday  to discuss an alliance package of proposals placed before it at  talks on Monday night. The package was substantially the same  as the package of December last year which included proposed  changes to the interim constitution as well as a concession on  the ballot issue. The NEC's response would be conveyed to the  government and the alliance at their meeting on Thursday.</p>

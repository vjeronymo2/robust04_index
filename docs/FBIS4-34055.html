			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 11 Jun (AE) -- President Itamar Franco  sanctioned today, with three vetoes, the Antitrust Law (Number  8884). This law was hastily approved last week by the Chamber  of Deputies and the Senate. Despite the entrepreneurs'  criticism of the original text, the vetoes did not eliminate any  of the controversial items of the law, which was created to  control price abuses. In a message sent to the Senate, the last  house of the legislative branch to approve the draft antitrust  bill, President Franco explained the reason for the three  vetoes. One of them eliminated Article 79 from the law, as it  would have rendered vacant the positions of advisers, president,  and universal agent of Cade [Administrative Council for Economic  Defense] until the Senate appoints new officials.    The blanks left by the vetoes were filled by a new  provisional measure promulgated today by President Franco. This  provisional measure will also help regulate the functioning of  Cade until a draft bill on the issue is examined by Congress.    According to the provisional measure promulgated today, the  positions of Cade president, advisers, and universal agent  remain in effect. Cade has now become a self-supported  government organization instead of just another organization  under the Justice Ministry. In his message to the Senate,  President Franco explained that the empty positions would make  Cade nonfunctional at precisely a time when the government must  control the companies to prevent inflation in the new currency,  which is to go into circulation on 1 July.    The government created two more advisory positions. The  mandates of the officials who will occupy them will end together  with those of the current Cade members. In the future, the  mandates will last two years and one year, to make it possible  to renew 50 percent of the Cade board.    Another veto eliminated Article 22, which had been badly  written. The article linked two simultaneous infractions --  unjustified increase in prices and charging excessively high  prices -- to the Economic Policy Secretariat (SPE) of the  Finance Ministry. By replacing the preposition "and" with "or,"  the new provisional measure allows the secretariat to take  action in either case.    The provisional measure also establishes that as far as  fines  are concerned, the company's profit during the fiscal year  preceding the filing of a Cade administrative lawsuit should be  considered. The basis for the fine -- which can range between 1  percent and 30 percent of company's profit -- must be corrected  in accordance with the criteria used to update the payment of  overdue federal taxes, until the fine is paid for.  Independently from collecting the fine, the Economic Rights  Secretariat [SDE] of the Justice Ministry will ask the  prosecutor general to adopt the required judicial measures to  prevent economic abuse if the preventive measures adopted by the  SDE are not complied with.    President Franco also vetoed Article 82 of the law, which  establishes that expenses involved with the implementation of  Cade be paid for with budget funds allocated to the Justice  Ministry. The provisional measure does not really clarify how  the Ministry will meet these expenses.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Output reduction underpins continuing rise in price of tin - Market Report News of a sharp cut in production at one of the world's biggest TIN mines underpinned a continuing rise in the metal's price yesterday. Paranapanema of Brazil said it would produce 6,500-7,000 tonnes of tin in concentrate in 1994, down from 12,955 tonnes last year. That is equivalent to about 3.5 per cent of world demand. At the London Metal Exchange, where the three months tin price gained another Dollars 95 a tonne, taking its rise on the week so far to Dollars 285.50, traders said, however, that further substantial cuts would be needed to correct the present oversupply of tin. The three months COPPER price slipped from an early high of Dollars 1,936 a tonne to close Dollars 17.50 down on the day at Dollars 1,917.75 as nervousness continued about the Codelco situation (see story above). Further gains for SILVER helped GOLD to resume its uptrend but traders' were divided on whether the move heralded a run-up in prices or would attract profit-taking. Compiled from Reuter</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed &sect;6.10(e), internal audits performed by an NRTL as part of the quality control program required by the OSHA accreditation would have to be made available for review by MSHA. This provision would not require NRTLs to submit copies of all internal audits to MSHA. Instead, it simply would require an NRTL to make such audits available to MSHA for review when requested by the Agency. These internal audits provide documented verification that the OSHA-recognized NRTL continues to satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(4), is performing within its ``letter of recognition'' and its quality control program, and has not misrepresented the scope or conditions of its accreditation. Internal audits under the OSHA NRTL program are done at appropriate intervals by trained and qualified persons. Guidelines for the establishment of quality control programs for laboratories are available in ISO guides 25, 28, and 38.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;6.10(f), NRTLs recognized by OSHA to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be required to formulate and implement a ``follow-up'' program in accordance with the OSHA requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(2). In addition, the proposal would mandate that NRTLs make available to MSHA for review any information gathered by an NRTL during manufacturing site inspections or field audits of manufactured products approved by the MSHA. As indicated in the discussion of paragraph (d) on internal audits, NRTLs would not be required to submit copies to MSHA of ``follow-up'' reports of manufacturing site inspections and products audits. They would need only to provide MSHA with copies upon MSHA's request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, NRTLs would be required to notify MSHA immediately of product defects discovered so that appropriate corrective action could be initiated to protect the safety and health of the miners. Because product defects can create hazards underground, immediate notification should be by expeditious means, such as by telephone or fax. Telephone or other contact should then be confirmed in writing. The oral and written notification should include a description of the nature and extent of the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prompt sharing of NRTL product audit information would enhance the MSHA post-approval product audit program, permit rapid response to safety problems caused by product defects, and ensure the integrity of the MSHA and NRTL marks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;6.10(g) would provide that approved products tested and evaluated by NRTLs recognized by OSHA to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be subject to periodic audit by MSHA to determine conformity with the technical requirements upon which the approval was based. This aspect of the proposal would complement the ``follow-up'' program required by the OSHA recognition and provide a mechanism for independent evaluation by MSHA of approved products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (g) would require an approval holder, upon MSHA's request, to make an approved product available to MSHA for audit, at no cost to MSHA. MSHA would make such a request no more than once a year, except for cause. This would be in addition to MSHA's ongoing quality assurance program through which the Agency can obtain products for audit at any time at MSHA's expense, and the field audit program conducted by the specific NRTL upon whose testing and evaluation MSHA bases its approval action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approved products to be audited by MSHA would be selected by the Agency as representative of those distributed for use in underground mines. When an approved product is requested by MSHA for audit from the approval holder, the Agency would arrange to examine and evaluate it at a mutually-agreed-upon time and location and would permit the approval holder to observe any audit-related tests conducted. This examination and evaluation could take place at an MSHA facility, at the manufacturer's plant or distribution center, or at any other place agreed upon by MSHA and the approval holder. The approval holder would be able to obtain any final report resulting from such audits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

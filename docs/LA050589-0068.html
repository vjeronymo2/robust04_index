			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KARCHER INSIDE TRADING ACCORD RUNS INTO SNAG  </P> <P> Carl N. Karcher's proposed settlement of an insider trading lawsuit has hit a  serious snag after the U.S. attorney's office refused to guarantee that it will  not file criminal charges against the Orange County businessman, sources close  to the case said Thursday.  </P> <P> The tentative agreement reached Monday hinged on Karcher's lawyers winning an  agreement from the Justice Department that Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr.  hamburger chain, would not be the target of a later criminal prosecution for  insider trading, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> But federal prosecutors have declined to give that assurance and instead have  taken a wait-and-see approach, saying they are not ready to make that decision,  several sources close to the case said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors "want to evaluate the evidence and the case" and will decide how to  proceed sometime before the statute of limitations runs out in October, a  source familiar with the negotiations said.  </P> <P> That stance, sources said, could kill the agreement, which was reached the day  Karcher and six of his relatives were to begin trial in Los Angeles on charges  of insider trading filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> When the agreement was reached Monday, lawyers on both sides said that an  unspecified "obstacle" needed to be hurdled. But SEC and defense lawyers said  they were optimistic that a final agreement would be reached within the week.  </P> <P> Further details of the tentative agreement were revealed Thursday. It calls for  Carl Karcher to pay a fine of $332,000, the amount his relatives saved by  selling company stock after Karcher allegedly told them that the fast-food firm  was about to report a dramatic drop in earnings, said individuals close to the  case. The agreement also would require the six relatives to pay, overall, an  additional $332,000 to the federal government.  </P> <P> John Koutsos, a trial counsel with the SEC, declined to discuss the terms of  the agreement. But he said that a "fairly standard" settlement in an insider  trading case would be for a defendant to return illegal profits plus a penalty  of an equal amount.  </P> <P> If Karcher, chief executive of Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, lost the  civil suit, he personally could have been assessed a fine of three times the  total amount of losses avoided, or $996,000. His six relatives could have been  ordered to repay a total of $1.3 million.  </P> <P> The SEC filed the civil case in April, 1988, accusing Karcher, 14 family  members and company accountant Alvin DeShano of illegal trading or tipping off  others to avoid stock market losses. Karcher himself was accused of tipping off  others only, not of illegal stock trading. Charges against one relative were  dismissed while Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, was found to have been  involved in insider trading and fined $10,500.  </P> <P> Six other family members, including company President Donald Karcher, settled  with the SEC in February by agreeing to pay $187,560. But that settlement  included an agreement from the U.S. attorney's office that criminal charges  would not be brought against those who settled, said lawyers involved in the  case.  </P> <P> To date, only DeShano faces criminal charges of securities fraud through  insider trading. His trial is scheduled to start May 23.  </P> <P> Both the U.S. attorney's office and Karcher's lawyers declined to comment on  the case.  </P> <P> Sources said that after prosecutors refused to make any guarantees, Karcher's  attorneys at the Los Angeles firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher told other  lawyers in the case that they would seek a meeting with U.S. District Judge  Edward Rafeedie to set a trial date.  </P> <P> "We're waiting to see whether Gibson, Dunn is going to proceed," said Karen  Matteson, SEC trial counsel, who otherwise declined comment.  </P> <P> Irving Einhorn, SEC regional administrator, said his office is ready to try the  civil case. "I've been here five years and haven't lost a case," Einhorn said.  "I don't intend to lose this one. The evidence is conclusive."  </P></p>

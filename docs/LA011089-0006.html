			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITION APPEARS STIFF TO NAMING CONVENTION CENTER FOR KING  </P> <P> With letters and phone calls indicating overwhelming opposition to naming the  San Diego convention center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., City  Council members meet today to decide one of the most politically and racially  sensitive issues they have faced in recent years.  </P> <P> As in 1986, when the council voted to rename Market Street in honor of the  slain civil rights leader, the King tribute issue has touched a nerve in the  community.  </P> <P> In the weeks since a council committee approved adding King's name to the  nearly completed bay-front convention center, the eight council members and  Mayor Maureen O'Connor have received telephone calls and letters that reflect a  range of feeling from outright racism to thoughtful opposition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Organized Group  </P> <P> Although the volume of mail has not been especially heavy, because no group has  organized to oppose the plan, the overwhelming majority of the communications  are against the proposal, council aides said Monday.  </P> <P> Councilman Wes Pratt's file contains 14 letters of opposition and three in  favor. Councilman Ron Roberts' file contains 20 letters of opposition and four  in favor. Phone calls to those and other offices are following the same  pattern.  </P> <P> "If the City Council votes to name the new convention center in honor of Martin  Luther King Jr., the indignation of the voters will bring on a ballot  initiative that will cause embarrassment to the city far beyond that created by  the Market Street fiasco," one woman wrote to Pratt, who has led the effort to  honor King.  </P> <P> In a 1987 referendum, voters stripped the name "Martin Luther King Way" from  Market Street and reinstituted the downtown thoroughfare's former name.  </P> <P> Other opponents object to the perceived difficulty of marketing the convention  center with King's name in it.  </P> <P> "The city, the Port District and all the citizens of our community have too  much at stake in this much-needed convention center to handcuff its development  at this late stage," the general manager of an Old Town hotel wrote to Roberts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poised for Approval  </P> <P> "When people lose their fear to drive through black neighborhoods is the time  to eulogize their leaders," an El Cajon resident wrote. "I am a pragmatist and  not a racist."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the council appears poised to approve the addition of King's name  -- in some form -- to the $160-million center, which is scheduled to open this  fall. Five members of the council's Rules Committee, enough to form a majority  of the nine-member council, agreed Dec. 14 to forward two proposals to the  council.  </P> <P> One suggested by Pratt would rename the facility "San Diego King Convention  Center." That proposal is opposed by the citizens committee that recommended  naming the center after King, because it does not contain his full name. A  second suggestion, offered by Councilman Bruce Henderson, would add the full  name to the building's title.  </P> <P> A Pratt aide said Monday that Pratt will work to have King's full name  included, but believes that his initial proposal has a better chance of  approval by the Board of Port Commissioners. That panel, which named the  facility the San Diego Convention Center in a 1985 contract with the city, must  also agree to a name change.  </P> <P> Mayor O'Connor and Council Members Pratt, Roberts, Henderson and Judy McCarty  voted for the Rules Committee proposal. Councilwoman Gloria McColl, the  committee's sixth member, was absent and has taken no position on the matter.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer has said she will vote for a name change, but has  not decided which proposal she favors. Councilman Ed Struiksma is "leaning  toward" San Diego King Convention Center, and Councilman Bob Filner has not  decided, aides said Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Management set to buy British International Helicopters CONDITIONAL agreement has been reached with a management buy-out team for the sale of British International Helicopters, Mr Robert Maxwell's old helicopter company. The company has 26 helicopters and 400 staff, mainly operating in the North Sea and to the Isles of Scilly. Arthur Andersen, administrators to the private Maxwell interests, said yesterday the deal was conditional on both Civil Aviation Authority approval and on finance. The administrators added, however, that financing arrangements would be confirmed shortly. CHC Helicopter Corporation of Canada will be a minority shareholder but the majority will be UK controlled. BIH has faced uncertainty since Arthur Andersen was appointed administrators last December, a month after Mr Maxwell's death. Bids from rival helicopter companies Bond and Bristow were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission although Bristow then withdrew its bid. Yesterday, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, accepted statutory undertakings from Bond and BIH not to proceed with the proposed merger. The MMC noted that if the merger had taken place only two operators, each with about half the market, would remain to provide helicopter services to the UK offshore oil and gas industry. BIH said yesterday all existing North Sea services would continue as would the link to the Isles of Scilly. Mr Stewart Birt, leader of the MBO team yesterday praised staff for ' working so well through a difficult period.'</p>

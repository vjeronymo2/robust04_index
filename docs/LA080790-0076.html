			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON AUTO RATE HIKES TO BE EXTENDED;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: GILLESPIE SAYS THE PRICE FREEZE WILL LAST UNTIL COMPLETION OF  HEARINGS ON PROPOSITION 103. HER AIDE SAYS THE WAIT MAY BE EVEN LONGER.  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Monday she intends to extend her  10-month-old freeze on auto insurance rates in California through the  completion of hearings scheduled to begin next month on rate rollbacks called  for under Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Gillespie's special counsel for Proposition 103 implementation, Karl  Rubinstein, went further, saying that no rate increases will be granted until  the insurance company's appeals expected on the rollback orders for 1989  premiums are litigated to the appellate court level. The orders mandate rebates  to customers of part of the 1989 premiums.  </P> <P> Rubinstein's remarks indicated that any rate hikes for auto insurance could be  delayed several months at least. Insurers had anticipated that they would be  allowed to raise rates soon.  </P> <P> The statements about extending the rate freeze came after four leading consumer  advocacy organizations announced they will not participate in a different set  of hearings Gillespie has scheduled on approval of new, possibly higher future  rates for auto insurers.  </P> <P> The groups -- Voter Revolt, Consumers Union, Latino Issues Forum and Public  Advocates -- said they object to the retired state Court of Appeal judge the  insurance commissioner has named to preside over the hearings because as a  "rent-a-judge" he has in the past worked for insurance companies on a number of  cases.  </P> <P> In a letter to Gillespie on Monday, officials of the consumers organizations  said the judge, James Scott, admitted to them in a pre-hearing conference last  week that he had been paid by insurance companies whose rate applications he  would be hearing, but he had refused to recuse himself. They asked Gillespie to  remove him.  </P> <P> Gillespie and Rubinstein said Monday they believe Scott will be fair to all  sides. Also, they said, all final decisions for future rates resulting from the  hearings beginning Wednesday will be made by Gillespie and held in abeyance  pending outcome of the rollback hearings.  </P> <P> The groups maintain that the hearings on future rates should not begin until  the rollback hearings are complete.  </P> <P> Gillespie said Monday that the rollback hearings require 30 days' advance  notice, and if she waits on finishing them to begin the hearings on future  rates, "it will needlessly delay the entire Proposition 103 implementation  process."  </P> <P> A special counsel to Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp on insurance matters,  Fredric Woocher, said Monday he is concerned that Gillespie may be trying to  establish pro-insurer hearing procedures in advance of a new elected  commissioner taking office in January that will tie that commissioner's hands  later.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an attorney for State Farm, the state's largest seller of auto  insurance, disclosed Monday that at this week's hearings State Farm is asking  for approval of rates it has had in effect since last year and not for any rate  increase.  </P></p>

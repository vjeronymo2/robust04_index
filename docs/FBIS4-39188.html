			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 7 June TASS -- Armed squads of the Tajik  Security, Interior, and Defence Ministries, as well as of the  Russian military contingent deployed in Dushanbe, today began to  patrol the streets of the Tajik capital round-the-clock. These  security measures were approved on Monday by the coordination  council of Tajik law enforcement bodies, which met here under  the chairmanship of First Vice-Speaker of the Tajik Supreme  Soviet Abdulmadjid Dostiyev. The vice-speaker said that they  were prompted by the current dangerous criminogenic situation in  the city, which had, in fact, gone out of control in recent days.    As earlier reported, a wave of terroristic acts swept the  Tajik capital this May. Their victims included prominent Tajik  businessmen and journalists, as well as officers of the Russian  military contingent and the national armed forces.    The patrol squads are vested with extensive rights,  including  the right to inspect all types of transport vehicles, check the  documents of citizens, and confiscate unlawfully possessed  weapons. The areas, where Russian servicemen and their families  are housed, are being guarded with particular care.    The patrols are allowed to open fire in case of resistance  or  refusal to obey their orders.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Observer: If the cap fits It is a pity that the diminutive Texan multi-millionaire Ross Perot - a feisty critic of the shortcomings of the North American Free Trade Agreement (which he claims would create a 'huge sucking sound' of US manufacturing jobs heading south to Mexico) - should be let down by the less than deeply patriotic red-white-and-blue baseball cap which last week was being distributed by his campaign team in Florida. 'Perot for President' it reads on the outside; 'Produced for you in China' on the label inside.</p>

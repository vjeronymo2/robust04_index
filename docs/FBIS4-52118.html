			<p>BFN     [Text] MALAYSIAN International Trade and Industry Minister  Rafidah Aziz turned down a proposal from Deputy Prime Minister  Suphachai Phanitchaphak who suggested ASEAN countries review the  tariff cut schedule under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (Afta).    A source from their meeting said that Suphachai asked the  ASEAN ministers to compare the tariffs on petrochemical products  sector by sector but the ASEAN ministers said that the tariff  cut schedule should remain unchanged. Thailand has proposed to  cut tariffs on petrochemical products according to the normal  track timeframe -- that is, tariffs should be cut to 20 per cent  over five years from 1996.    Malaysia and Indonesia, however wanted to opt out of cutting  tariffs on petrochemicals. Officials said that their rates are  still lower or close to the levels implemented by Thailand.    Meanwhile, plastic industry representatives will meet with  Dr  Sippanon Ketthat, chairman of the Petroleum Authority of  Thailand, on April 29 to ask for a tax reduction on raw  petroleum in order to protect the plastic and related industries  which are to be affected by Afta.    The source said that the plastics industry would like to  discuss the effects of protecting the petrochemical industry,  and cooperation between the petrochemical and plastic industries  on problems which will arise from the government tax  restructuring in line with Afta.    The plastics industry is ready to comply with the government  tax restructuring but on the condition that the tax on raw  materials be reduced more than the tax on plastic products.    If not, small industries consuming plastic pellets would  suffer. And in the long term, the petrochemical industry would  be hurt since nobody can afford a higher price for plastic  pellets in the domestic market, the source said. Also, there is  a possibility of cheaper pellets from aboard coming into  Thailand, even if the government sets high import duties, the  source said.    Although the government will succeed in setting up an Afta  Adjustment Fund designed to help industries immediately affected  by Afta, small plastics companies will not benefit from it, only  large firms, the source said.</p>

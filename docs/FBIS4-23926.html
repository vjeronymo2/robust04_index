			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by De Wet Potgieter] </F>   [Text] A Dutch mercenary and former member of the French  Foreign Legion, recruited during the civil war in Bosnia to  fight for the far-right in South Africa, has surrendered  recently to the police in Pretoria. He is in protective custody  and is giving valuable information to the police concerning the  activities of the far-right and plans to establish an  underground "people's army" of international freedom fighters  with close neo-Nazi links in South Africa.  <H5>  German Recruits </H5>   The 46-year-old Ronald Deuster arrived in the country from  Europe two months ago with two German recruits. He was not  pleased about the amateurish way in which right-wing extremists  tried to get their underground struggle off the ground and  decided to reveal everything to the police. Before the election  Deuster converged with other foreign mercenaries and far-right  South Africans on a farm outside Brits, but since then everyone  has dispersed. A former member of the AWB, Mr. Eddie MacIntosh,  owner of the Silkaatsnek Nature Reserve near Brits, this week  confirmed that Deuster was employed there and that he had  surrendered to the police.  <H5>  Fought in Bosnia </H5>   "According to his documents Deuster was in the French  Foreign  Legion and he also fought in Bosnia, where he heard of the  possibility of coming to fight in South Africa," says Mr.  MacIntosh. "However, the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  war games did not impress him. He complained that there are too  many generals and not enough foot soldiers in the AWB."  Brigadier John Wright, executive director of Interpol's  National Central Bureau in Pretoria (Interpol NCB), this week  confirmed that his unit is playing a leading role in the  identifying of international neo-Nazi suspects in South Africa.  Brig. Wright specifically referred to the two New Zealand  mercenaries, the twins who acted as bodyguards for AWB leader  Eugene Terreblanche, and the latest breakthrough concerning the  arrest of a French citizen in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>

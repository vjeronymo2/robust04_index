Recalling that at a time when the situation  on the Korean peninsula was being aggravated by the anti-DPRK  moves of the United States, the agency Secretariat adopted at a  recent meeting of its board of governors an unfair "resolution"  urging the DPRK to "promptly allow" all inspection activities of  the agency equivalent to the full implementation of the  safeguards agreement, which went beyond the inspection for the  continuity of the safeguards, and submitted it to the United  Nations Security Council, the news analyst of the paper says:    The adoption of such a "resolution" is an improper act  blatantly twisting the fact and another pressure kickup to  attain a sinister purpose.    The agency Secretariat must know that the DPRK is in a  unique  position after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of  its withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    When it adopted another unreasonable "resolution" against  the  DPRK at the meeting of its board of governors on the basis of an  unrealistic, wrong conclusion, the agency Secretariat revealed  once again to the world that it had cast away the principle of  independence and impartiality.    The United States and the agency Secretariat following it  will have to bear full responsibility for all the consequences  arising therefrom.</p>

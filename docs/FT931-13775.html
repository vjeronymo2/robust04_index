			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures once again had a volatile session as they reacted to a poor set of retail figures and speculation of a cut in base rates, writes Joel Kibazo. Early selling of the March contract on the FT-SE, which had began trading at 2,748, said to have come from two leading US houses, was much in evidence and the contract responded by falling to 2,740. The late morning release of December retail figures pushed March lower, down to the day's low of 2,735. However, bargain hunting and speculation of a cut in interest rates revived the fortunes of March. Together with the steady performance of short sterling, it helped pull the underlying cash market forward. It reached the day's peak of 2,761 just ahead of the close. The March contract closed at 2,759, up 14 on Tuesday's close and 3 ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover improved to reach 9,845. Traded options experienced moderate activity with turnover totalling 24,734 lots. Business in the FT-SE 100 option was poor and volume was a mere 6,381 lots and that of the Euro FT-SE 706 contracts. Hanson was the most active, and it traded 2,219 lots with the February 220 calls the busiest series. It was followed by British Steel at 1,706, and by BTR at 1,395 contracts. Glaxo and National Power were also busy.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe setback Shares in British Aerospace came under pressure after Taiwan's vice-economics minister was quoted as saying that BAe's regional jets joint venture with Taiwan may not go ahead due to differences between BAe and local banks over its financing. The reports sent the stock tumbling, and at the day's worst the shares were down 23 at 445p. A denial of problems in the negotiations from British Aerospace helped to steady nerves and the shares clawed back some of the earlier loss to finish 14 lighter at 454p on volume of 4m. Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest Securities said: 'The regional jets deal is no longer a make or break issue for BAe, particularly after the disposal of the corporate jets business, but we believe the regional jets venture still has commercial logic and it will go through.' The heavy end of the building sectors came under sustained selling pressure following bearish comments on the sector from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the stockbroker, and following on from the rather gloomy picture painted by Marley on Monday. Redland, down 17 at 513p, and RMC, 18 lower at 795p, were the two main casualties in the sector, with Rugby 4 easier at 278p and Marley 6 cheaper at 157p. BPB slipped 2 1/2 to 250p after Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management said it had reduced its holding to below the 3 per cent notifiable level. Pilkington ordinary edged up to 152p and the warrants 2 to 52 1/2 p, with some dealers taking the view that the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority had recently been reducing its stake in the ordinaries and increasing its holdings in the warrants. Merchant banks and quoted market operators enjoyed another strong session with investors chasing the stocks higher again in response to the continuing high level of stock market activity. SG Warburg, viewed by many as the London market's leading and most successful integrated securities house, raced up 9 more to a peak 813p while Kleinwort Benson, another of the City's most powerful integrated operations, jumped 8 to 507p, its highest level since the Great Crash of October 1987. Smith New Court added 8 to a peak 342p. Prudential moved up 4 to 332p as insurance specialists began to focus on the group's poor performance against the market over the past month; 'the shares are due a bounce after underperforming the market by over 12 per cent on the month and by almost 5 per cent in the past quarter,' noted one specialist. Among brewers, James Capel was said to have issued a buy recommendation for several of the stocks in the sector, though the agency broker refused to confirm the recommendation. Bass, was said to have been among the stocks included on the buy list. Sentiment in the stock was also helped by news that it had sold 46 pubs to Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed for Pounds 10.78m. The shares gained 5 to 511p. A broker's recommendation together with a disposal combined to boost Hillsdown Holdings. Hoare Govett were said to have recommended the stock on yield considerations. The shares close 5 up at 171p. Turnover in Cray Electronics shares leapt to over 18m after Sir Peter Michael, a former director, sold a total of almost 9m shares at 140p. The 9m was made up of his existing holding of 3.4m shares and 5.6m shares acquired by the conversion of 'A' and 'B' Convertible shares. Cray shares edged up 2 1/2 to 148 1/2 p. Cadbury-Schweppes put on 10 to 501p, after it was recommended by SG Warburg, its joint broker. A food contamination scare in Australia weakened shares in United Biscuits and they fell 7 to 391p. Shares in Granada Group bucked the market trend finishing 2 ahead at 446p, on reports of a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson. Compass Group jumped 18 to 566p, after a recommendation from SG Warburg. Fears for the dividend, together with profit taking combined to leave Lucas Industries 4 lighter at 158p. Among transport stocks, shares in Dawson Group, jumped 60 to 303p, after it reported impressive interim figures.</p>

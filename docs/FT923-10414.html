			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / BT falls 28% as turnover declines BRITISH Telecommunications' first quarter pre-tax profit fell by 27.8 per cent after bigger than expected redundancy costs and a loss from the sale of its controlling stake in Mitel, the Canadian telephone equipment maker. For the three months to June 30 BT's pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 825m to Pounds 596m on sales of Pounds 3.27bn, down from Pounds 3.34bn. It was the first quarter-on-quarter decline in turnover since the company was privatised in 1984. An exceptional charge of Pounds 135m relates to the loss made on the disposal of its interests in Mitel, International Aeradio, its aviation services subsidiary, and Sharelink, the Birmingham-based stockbroking group. Operating profits fell from Pounds 920m to Pounds 799m. They were further depressed by redundancy charges of Pounds 56m due to the early retirement of 29,000 people - 9,000 more than expected - under BT's voluntary redundancy scheme. A further Pounds 11m attributable to the restructuring of management has been set against the provision established in 1990 for this purpose. The shares yesterday rose 13p to close at 346p as the efforts to control costs were better than expected. News of the redundancies overshadowed BT's disappointing trading performance. The number of inland calls fell by 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Revenue from international calls rose by 5 per cent, on a 12-month moving average basis, but this was due more to international calls being routed through London than an increase in people making calls from the UK. Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, said: 'The decline in turnover reflects the continued pressures of the economy, regulation and competition.' The Office of Telecommunications, the industry regulator, has told BT to cut the price of a basket of its basic services each year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points by next August, compared with 6.25 points previously. BT yesterday said: 'We are cutting costs, but there comes a time when you cannot squeeze anything else out.' Strong cash flow in the first quarter, free of dividend or tax payments, reduced net debt by Pounds 715m to Pounds 1.79bn, representing gearing of 17 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 9p to 5.6p. Lex, Page 18</p>

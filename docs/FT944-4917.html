			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: California Energy to acquire rival California Energy is to acquire its fellow Californian power supplier, Magma Power, in an increased bid worth Dollars 950m. The agreed deal ends a two-month battle in which Magma rejected California Energy's approaches, and creates what is claimed to be the world's biggest independent producer of geothermal energy. It also represents an abrupt volte-face for California Energy, which on Friday terminated its earlier offer worth Dollars 924m in the face of alleged opposition from Magma shareholders. Dow Chemical, which owns 20 per cent of Magma, said it was 'delighted' with the higher offer. The combined group will have sales of more than Dollars 400m, with Magma contributing just over half. Both companies specialise in geothermal energy, whereby electricity is generated by heat from the earth's interior. Both are active as owners and operators of power plants throughout the US and in the Philippines and Indonesia. South-east Asia is seen as the main growth market for geothermal energy. California Energy said the combined output of the group would be 545MW of power, with a further 530MW under construction. Magma has started building a plant in the Philippines with 231MW capacity. The bid values Magma's shares at Dollars 39, made up of Dollars 28.50 in cash and the rest in California Energy shares. This compares with an original bid in September of Dollars 35, subsequently raised to Dollars 38.50. Magma had contested both bids, adopting a poison pill shareholder scheme and seeking a court injunction against California Energy acquiring shares under a tender offer. Mr Paul Pankratz, chairman of Magma, said: 'We believe this transaction reflects Magma's inherent strengths and outstanding prospects.' Magma's shares yesterday closed up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 37 3/8, while California Energy's fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 15 5/8.</p>

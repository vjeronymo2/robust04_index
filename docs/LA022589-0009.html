			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IACOCCA ON THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN LOBBIES IN WASHINGTON  </P> <P> "From Toshiba to Trucks, We're Being Run Over by Foreign Lobbies," screams the  headline on Lee Iacocca's column (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 15). Iacocca complains that  "every time foreign lobbyists in Washington jerk a string . . . the American  government jumps." Iacocca contends that his complaint is not a tariff issue or  a trade issue, but "who's got the power to change the" law of the United States  if they don't happen to like it."  </P> <P> Iacocca argues that the people we elect to make our laws, instead of being  bought by foreign lobbies, should be bought by American lobbies -- that  American interests should jerk the strings that make government jump. To this I  say "the pox on Iacocca and his special-interest groups!"  </P> <P> What we need instead is a separation of state and economy. Let there be no laws  in the United States that interfere with free market exchanges between willing  buyers and willing sellers -- regardless of race, sex or nationality. Without  such laws there will be nothing to sell to lobbyists. Corruption in Washington  will be vastly diminished. Our welfare will be vastly improved.  </P> <P> ERNST F. GHERMANN  </P> <P> Winnetka  </P></p>

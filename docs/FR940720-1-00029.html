			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Postal Service undertook a review of the standards that pertain to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the content of second-class mail. This included review of the terminology involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., supplements, enclosures, attachments, novelty pages, independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publications), the substantive rules concerning eligibility of these materials for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second-class rates, the clarity of the existing rules, and the organization of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules in the DMM. The result of this review is the instant proposal for substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and editorial changes to, and deletion of a number of, existing rules with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renumbering and reorganizing of these rules for clarity and ease of use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service believes that the proposed rules, if adopted, will reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of mail acceptance and training, and facilitate timely collection of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate postage on second-class mailings. The Postal Service also believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed elimination of a number of restrictions on publication design will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promote publishers' continued use of the Postal Service for delivery of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodical publications. Moreover, the proposed changes are not expected to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any adverse operational effect on the Postal Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide clarity and improve the organization of the mailing standards governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contents and characteristics of second-class mail, Domestic Mail Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (DMM) C200 has been completely reorganized and renumbered under four main  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headings: 1.0 Permissible Mailpiece Components, 2.0 Impermissible Components,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.0 Mailpiece Construction, and 4.0 Printed Features. Within these sections are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsections that specifically identify what may and may not be included in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mailpiece claimed at second-class rates. The following discussion identifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant changes being proposed in C200.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reference to pages of a second-class publication in proposed C200.1.1 is new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and describes those printed sheets that form the second-class mailpiece. Rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than addressing advertising and ``novelty pages'' in separate standards (as is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently done in C200.5.0 and 6.0), this proposed section sets forth a general rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provides that the pages in a second-class publication, whether they contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising or nonadvertising matter or both, may be prepared with novel or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unusual characteristics, i.e., different size, shape, or construction. This proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change would limit the number of these pages to a minor portion of the publication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so that the general appearance of the material as a ``periodical publication'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained. In proposing this greater latitude on the preparation of pages to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication, the Postal Service is concerned that publishers might create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publications whose physical characteristics would encumber efficient postal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing. Therefore, this provision includes a requirement that no page may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have dimensions (when folded) that exceed the dimensions of the cover of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In another change from current standards, this new pages section would allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of grommets, string, rubber bands, and similar types of fastening materials in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor amounts in the production of printed sheets. The Postal Service has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that allowing the use of minor amounts of these fastening materials in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preparation of pages is consistent with the existing practice of allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second-class publications to be bound with staples, saddle stitching, or spiral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mailing standards governing the preparation of parts and sections in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C200.1.2 remain unchanged, although current C200.2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been condensed into one paragraph. The provision governing parts or sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced by someone other than the publisher has been retained in 1.2 to preserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the distinction between parts and sections of a publication and supplements to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonincidental enclosures at First- and third-class rates are covered in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C200.1.3, which is composed of former 8.1, 8.3b, 8.4, 8.6, and 10.2. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wording has been changed for clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed C200.1.4 incorporates current sections (C200.3.2, 3.3, 7.1, 7.2, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.3) governing enclosures and attachments mailable at second-class rates. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last sentence of current 3.2f (proposed C200.1.4b) is deleted to remove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single-fold limitation on a printed sheet accompanying a receipt, request, or order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a subscription. The Postal Service does not believe that it is necessary to limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the method used by publishers in producing this material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

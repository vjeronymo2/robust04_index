"We have to get a deal because otherwise the whole process  of  EU enlargement is threatened," Luxembourg Foreign Minister  Jacques Poos said ahead of the third effort in less than three  weeks to break the impasse.    The enlargement process was being held up by the demand of  Britain and Spain that the entry of more small countries into  the Union should not dilute the ability of London and Madrid to  block decisions they do not like.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he was not  optimistic. "There is nothing on the table at the moment that  satisfies the general concerns of the people of Britain," he  said.    The ministers were also debating a dispute between Spain and  Norway over fishing catch quotas which threatens to stop Norway  from entering the Union on January 1 next year.    Austria, Finland and Sweden finally agreed on their terms of  membership for joining the EU on March 1. The EU's negotiations  with Oslo are still blocked by Spain's demand for access to  Norway's fish-rich waters.    Diplomats expect that the fishing issue will be resolved  more  easily than the voting rights dispute, and that Norway and  Spain's EU partners might buy off the Spanish opposition to  Norwegian membership with more fish.    But Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said there were  no  new proposals to break the balance of power deadlock, which  hinges on the effect of enlargement on the EU's  delicately-balanced system of majority voting.

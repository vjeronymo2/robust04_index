			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (5): Port gains value if you are patient - Drink Investing in drink is an old idea, and while investors tend to focus mainly on fine wines, leading auction houses are encouraging shrewd connoisseurs to take a closer look at vintage port. Port prices have remained low in recent years - largely due to the drink having fallen out of fashion. However, great interest in vintage port is now being shown in the US, and this is expected to contribute to an overall increase in its value. Serena Sutcliffe, head of Sotheby's international wine department, said: 'Basically the advice is to buy young vintage port because it is still undervalued.' Vintage port is made from the growth of one year's harvest, and not every year is deemed good enough to be declared a vintage by the growers. Of recent years, Ms Sutcliffe and her counterpart at Christie's, Mr Paul Bowker, agree that two vintages - 1983 and 1985 - are likely to stand out. Taylor, Graham, Fonseca and Warre are the port houses particularly worth buying. A case of 1983 Taylor at auction today should cost between Pounds 140 and Pounds 180. A case of Taylor 1985 should cost between Pounds 130 and Pounds 160. In the long run, the 1985 is likely to prove a better vintage and to outstrip 1983 in value - making it particularly attractive for today's buyer. Those looking to make a swift profit should not invest in port. You will not see a huge return on your investment overnight. Port increases in value only as the vintage matures and comes to be drunk. When some has been drunk, the surviving cases naturally become more highly prized. As an indication of what might happen to the value of 1985 port, Paul Bowker looks for comparison to the 1963 vintage - one of the finest post war years to date. In 1974, a case of Taylor 1963 was worth Pounds 58 at auction. Today it is worth Pounds 600 (or the equivalent of Pounds 113.85 at 1974 prices). You do not have to own a cellar to invest in port - professional storage companies can ensure that your bottles are kept in the slightly damp conditions which are vital. Also, while it is possible to buy 1985 and 1983 port from some wine merchants, you are more likely to pick up a case or two at a bargain price by bidding at some of the regular auctions held by the leading auction houses. It pays to persevere with auctions - which you don't even have to attend if you put in a commissioned bid. If you set yourself a reasonable price for a lot, you may be outbid several times in a row, but eventually you are likely to get the case of port you want at the price you are willing to pay.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> ATTY. GEN. UPHELD IN LOGGING CASE  </P> <P> The California attorney general's duty to protect the public interest in the  environment does not prevent him from defending a state agency that promotes  logging redwoods, a state Court of Appeal ruled in San Francisco. The 1st  District Court of Appeal, however, faulted Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp for  taking a one-sided posture in defense of the Humboldt County logging case.  Environmentalists -- opposed to a Pacific Lumber Co. plan to cut 700 acres,  including 54 acres of centuries-old trees -- challenged the state Forestry  Department's routine approval of the plan. A Humboldt County Superior Court  ordered Van de Kamp's office off the case, ruling that a conflict existed with  the attorney general's duty to protect the public interest. But in a 3-0 ruling  reversing that decision, the appeals court added that Van de Kamp's office  could be disqualified from the case if future evidence shows a conflict of  interest.  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / BET to raise Pounds 200m to redeem Amps BET, the business services group, is to raise Pounds 200.7m in a rights issue to redeem auction market preferred stock (Amps), joining the growing list of UK companies disenchanted with the hybrid form of debt and equity. The company is to repay Dollars 380m of its Dollars 500m (Pounds 262m) of Amps by means of a one-for-four rights issue underwritten by Baring Brothers at 110p, 19p below BET's closing price yesterday. Mr John Clark, BET chief executive, said the repayment was part of a financial restructuring of the group. The cost of financing BET's Amps has risen from slightly below US commercial paper rates in 1991 to a 21 per cent premium this year, removing the benefit of what should have been a cheaper form of financing. BET's Amps issue also accounts for about 25 per cent of all the issues by non-US companies, which Mr Clark said was reducing the marketability of the instruments. US institutions tend to want to invest in the Amps of triple-A rated companies, such as Coca-Cola, and have extracted a higher dividend to compensate for the lack of liquidity and additional risk connected with BET's preference shares. The dividend rates on Amps are set at auction every month, generally in relation to interest rates prevailing on US commercial paper. Following the exceptional and extraordinary charges that BET announced with its final results last month, shareholders' funds fell almost 40 per cent to Pounds 113.8m. As a result, the preference shares made up 72 per cent of shareholders' capital and reserves, which BET directors said was too high. The Dollars 120m balance of the Amps will be repaid out of the company's own resources, either from disposals or from cash internally generated. Because BET considers its Amps to be a mezzanine form of equity and not debt, the repayment will not substantially alter the reported gearing ratio of about 25 per cent. However, if - as many analysts believe - the Amps are really debt, gearing after the repayment can be considered to have fallen from about 280 per cent to 45 per cent. Mr Clark said the redemption of the preference shares was the latest of a series of actions designed to return BET to a growth path. Lex, Page 26; Future of Amps, Page 29</p>

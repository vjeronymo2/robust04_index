			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> National banks filing appeals with the Ombudsman must submit information in writing fully describing the matter in dispute. After receipt of an appeal, the Ombudsman shall contact the OCC management official involved in the dispute. That management official shall submit written materials and relevant OCC documents pertaining to the bases of the appeal within 10 calendar days of the notice from the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman shall contact the national bank to ensure that the OCC is in possession of all relevant materials. If requested by either OCC management involved in the dispute or a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the Ombudsman shall arrange a meeting or a telephone call to more fully discuss the appeal and related issues. In the absence of any extenuating circumstances, the Ombudsman shall issue a written response to the appeal within 45 calendar days of the filing of the appeal by a national bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Follow-up by Ombudsman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the Ombudsman receives a decision on an appeal, the Ombudsman shall contact every appellant bank to inquire whether the bank believes OCC examiners have taken actions against the bank in retaliation for its appeal. The Ombudsman shall make these contacts (1) six months after the date the Ombudsman, Deputy Administrator or Deputy Comptroller issues a final written response to an appeal, and (2) six months after the date of completion of the first examination of the appellant bank following its appeal. A national bank may, of course, contact the Ombudsman at any time during or after the appeal if the bank reasonably believes that an OCC examiner is taking action against it in retaliation for its appeal. Upon identifying or learning of any possible retaliatory actions, the Ombudsman shall investigate the complaint; such investigations must be completed within 30 days. If the Ombudsman determines that retaliation has occurred, the Ombudsman shall forward the complaint to the District Administrator, Deputy Comptroller, or Inspector General for appropriate action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Appealable Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as otherwise provided, a national bank may seek a review of any agency decision or action, including a material supervisory determination. A material supervisory determination includes a determination relating to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Examination ratings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Loan classifications on loans that are significant to an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A national bank may not appeal:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Appointments of receivers and conservators;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Preliminary examination conclusions communicated to the national bank prior to the issuance of either a final Report of Examination or other written communication from the OCC; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Enforcement-related actions or decisions, including decisions to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. &sect;1831o).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An enforcement-related action or decision commences, and therefore becomes unappealable, when the national bank receives notice from the OCC indicating its intention to pursue available remedies under applicable statutes or published enforcement-related policies of the OCC. Such policies include OCC's Policy for Corrective Action (PPM 5310&hyph;3)(REV), Civil Money Penalty Policy (PPM 5000&hyph;7)(REV), and Securities Enforcement Policy (PPM 5310&hyph;5). These policies are available on request from the OCC's Communications Division, 250 E. Street, SW., Washington DC 20219&hyph;0001, 202&hyph;874&hyph;4700. For purposes of these guidelines only, remarks in a Report of Examination do not constitute notice of intent to pursue enforcement remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The appeals process established by these guidelines does not supersede any existing appeals procedures available under current law. Matters which are subject to an existing appeals process designed specifically for the issue in dispute, such as re-review of Shared National Credit findings (Banking Circular 189), and reconsideration of decisions on corporate applications (12 CFR 5.13(d)), are appealable to the Ombudsman when the agency decision is final under the specifically designed procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Effect of Filing An Appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a general rule, the filing of an appeal with either the national bank's immediate supervisory office or with the Ombudsman serves to stay all agency decisions and actions until the appeal is resolved. In the appropriate circumstances, however, the Ombudsman may put the disputed agency decision or action into effect while the appeal is still pending.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Eugene A.

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher chairman given 52% increase Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, executive chairman of retail group Kingfisher, enjoyed a 52 per cent increase in total remuneration to Pounds 1.31m last year to make him one of the UK's highest-paid directors. The company's annual report revealed yesterday that three other executive directors - Mr Alan Smith, chief executive, recruited from Marks and Spencer last April, Mr James Kerr-Muir, finance director, and Mr Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director - earned between Pounds 410,000 and Pounds 640,000, excluding pension contributions. Mr Whittaker and Mr Kerr-Muir earned between Pounds 285,000 and Pounds 375,000 the previous year. Sir Geoffrey has gained a reputation as one of the UK's most astute retailers through his stewardship of Kingfisher group - which includes Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Superdrug - and his view that retailing must become more volume-driven rather than margin-driven. But Kingfisher's shares have fallen this year amid fears that the lacklustre performance of some of its UK chains reflected the failure of Sir Geoffrey's 'everyday low pricing' strategy. His total remuneration included an increased pension contribution from Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 264,000 after an actuarial valuation revealed a funding deficit. After that, Sir Geoffrey's pay rose from Pounds 773,000 to Pounds 1.05m, or 36 per cent. His basic salary rose 2.6 per cent, from Pounds 606,000 to Pounds 622,000, but his bonus almost doubled from Pounds 167,000 to Pounds 323,000. Kingfisher said the bonus reflected the 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 205m to Pounds 309m - and 28 per cent increase in earnings per share in the year to January 29. Moreover, an 'important strategic objective' had been achieved through the takeover of Darty, France's largest electrical retailer. Sir Geoffrey also received a long-term incentive payment of Pounds 105,000. 'Geoff is recognised as one of the leading business figures in the country,' Kingfisher said. 'We have to encourage the retention of key people. Headhunters do tend to swarm around Kingfisher.' The company would not disclose exact figures for Mr Kerr-Muir and Mr Whittaker's pay, but said their basic salaries rose 5 per cent on average.</p>

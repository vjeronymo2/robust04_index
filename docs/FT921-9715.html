			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Treasury admission on housing downturn THE Treasury has admitted that its forecasting techniques have failed to take into account the effect of the depression in the housing market on the the recession, Peter Marsh writes. The admission has taken the form of a series of changes to the mathematical equations in the Treasury's computer model of how the economy functions. The model acts as a base for the department's economic forecasts. Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, a forecasting group, said the new equations could indicate that the Treasury was considering changes to fiscal policy in the Budget. One possibility could be to raise the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on mortgage relief. The Treasury said the changes were technical and 'not significant'.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard throws down the gauntlet to IBM HEWLETT-Packard has launched a bold challenge to IBM by introducing a new class of high-performance computers that will represent a cheaper alternative to conventional mainframe computers. 'Mainframes based on old and proprietary technologies can't match the flexibility or cost-efficiency of H-P's new systems, which provide similar performance at one-fifth the cost,' Mr John Young, president and chief executive of the US computer system maker, said. H-P is building on the momentum of its sales of workstations and minicomputers which helped boost first-quarter earnings, announced earlier this week, by 40 per cent. Its shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 . The company is now targeting IBM's traditional stronghold in the corporate data processing centre. H-P introduced nine new 'corporate business servers' with performance up to 75 per cent better than its current high-end machines - and more powerful than 90 per cent of installed IBM mainframe systems. However, it has yet to subject its new computers to standard benchmarking tests. The new systems incorporate the same reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology that is at the heart of H-P's computer range and will run the same applications programs. Four models are designed to run H-P's version of the Unix operating system, while five run H-P's proprietary operating system. With its new products, H-P hopes to play a leading role in the trend toward reducing the size of data processing systems by off-loading applications from room-sized mainframes onto networks of smaller computers. More than 46 per cent of mainframe computer users are taking such steps, according to a survey late last year by Dataquest, the US market research firm. H-P stressed the cost advantages of its new systems, which the company believes will appeal to companies trying to limit spending in the weak economic environment. An IBM mainframe computer with a performance equivalent to H-P's fastest model costs five times as much to operate, H-P claimed. The cost of ownership includes the initial purchase price of the system and peripherals, software and support for a three-year period. Cost savings include lower systems prices, ranging from Dollars 335,000 to Dollars 925,000, about a fifth the cost of IBM's latest mainframes. Other factors reducing costs include lower power consumption and reduced support personnel requirements. Not included in this calculation, however, is the potentially high price of converting applications to run on the H-P systems. To ease the conversion process, H-P has persuaded several leading mainframe computer software developers to produce new versions of their programs to run on H-P computers. Despite all the advantages that H-P claims for its new computer systems, the company must still prove its ability to address market segments where it has little presence. These will include the financial services sector, telecommunications industry and government markets. 'The world mainframe market is Dollars 50bn. We only have to win a modest share of that market to be very successful,' maintains Mr Lewis Platt, H-P executive vice-president and head of the Computer Systems Organisation.</p>

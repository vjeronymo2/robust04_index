			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> PUBLIC SEEKS A REMEDY TO AID CLINIC  </P> <P> When a migration of hippies to Laguna Beach created the need for a free clinic  in the late 1960s, Neal Purcell, then a police officer, wasn't one of its  biggest fans.  </P> <P> Today, Police Chief Purcell is among those working to save that financially  troubled Laguna Beach Community Clinic, which serves people from all over  Orange County.  </P> <P> A public meeting will be held Saturday at City Hall beginning at 10 a.m. to  discuss ideas to raise money for the clinic. City officials called the meeting  after they voted to forgive a $20,000 loan to the clinic, which has  subsequently reduced its deficit from $60,000 to about $30,000, said Ronald  Woelfle, president of its board of directors.  </P> <P> "We're now trying to increase public awareness of what we do," he said. "If I  leave any legacy, it'll be for the clinic not to face another crisis."  </P> <P> Purcell, who has watched the clinic grow and change since it opened in 1970,  said: "Hopefully, these talks will attract people from outside (of the city) to  be supportive. A lot of people say, 'Why does affluent Laguna Beach need a  clinic like this?' But this is a clinic for the entire area. I'd hate to see it  fold."  </P> <P> Purcell admits that he didn't feel that way in the late 1960s, when thousands  of young people came to Laguna Beach, seeking the mild weather and  permissiveness associated with the renowned artists' colony.  </P> <P> Venereal disease and drug overdoses were near epidemic then, Purcell said. So  community doctors, dentists and church leaders proposed a free clinic.  </P> <P> Despite opposition from residents who feared that it would draw more hippies to  the small seaside hamlet, the Laguna Beach Free Clinic opened in a converted  two-bedroom-and-den home at 460 Ocean Ave.  </P> <P> "The town was inundated with hippie types, dopers and transients," Purcell  said. "That was the major clientele when it first opened."  </P> <P> "I was not for it" then, he said. "I thought it would create more problems than  resolve them. But now it would be sorely missed."  </P> <P> Over the years, services were added to the original birth control and venereal  disease services. Flu shots, dentistry, psychological counseling, a rape crisis  and family violence unit and legal counseling werea added. A blood pressure  clinic, school and work physicals and a prenatal care program were also  included.  </P> <P> Purcell said the most noticeable shift came in 1975 when the clinic started  serving the elderly, including people from Leisure World.  </P> <P> "Gradually, it started shifting from serving transients in Laguna Beach to all  segments of the community," he said.  </P> <P> Now, 11,000 people pass through the doors each year from as far away as Brea  and Buena Park, Woelfle said. But the price of that service has been financial  trouble for several years, he said.  </P> <P> In 1985, the clinic faced a $40,000 deficit and possible closure. The city then  gave it an interest-free, $30,000 loan. The clinic changed its name to the  Laguna Beach Community Clinic and began charging fees on a sliding scale.  </P> <P> "But we were still losing funding from the public domain," Woelfle said. "We  had a crisis a year and were literally on the doors of bankruptcy last  October."  </P> <P> Since then, the clinic has become "leaner and meaner, but not to our clients,"  Woelfle said. "We're doing more with less. We are much more efficient."  </P> <P> Paid staff has been cut to 10 people, and more than 250 volunteers donate  35,000 hours a year, he said.  </P> <P> "And there are so many other things people can do," Woelfle said. "We need  volunteers for scheduling, the front desk and fund-raising events." LESLIE  HERZOG  </P></p>

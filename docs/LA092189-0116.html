			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERFUND AND VALLEY'S POLLUTION HOT SPOT  </P> <P> After approximately 10 years of studying the San Gabriel Valley's ground-water  pollution problems, the Environmental Protection Agency will finally begin to  notify those who possibly are potentially responsible polluters. I suppose we  should be pleased, but hardly overjoyed, since notification does not signify  that any money will become available in the near future.  </P> <P> Additionally, the EPA proposed a strategy for cleaning up ground water in the  Whittier Narrows area so that contamination from the San Gabriel Valley basin  will be prevented from spreading to the adjoining Central Water Basin.  </P> <P> Your Sept. 10 article insinuated that the Whittier Narrows area is "the most  heavily contaminated" and that "cleanup work would be financed from companies  that created the pollution." This is simply not true. The most heavily  contaminated areas are north of Whittier Narrows, and the cleanup monies cannot  come from companies that created the pollution because these "phantom"  polluters have not been identified.  </P> <P> Protection of the Central Water Basin is vital, but the EPA should clean up the  most polluted plumes in the San Gabriel Valley so that this heavily  contaminated water will not reach Whittier Narrows.  </P> <P> It is a fact that no production wells in the Central Basin near Whittier  Narrows have exceeded EPA or state drinking water standards. The EPA even  projects that the water from these wells is expected to remain useful for at  least another 30 years. In contrast, at least 25% of the wells in the main San  Gabriel basin are so heavily contaminated that they have already been shut  down. Why, as a first step, is EPA proposing to use Superfund money to clean up  an area that is relatively clean while leaving the most heavily contaminated  areas untouched?  </P> <P> NANCY E.

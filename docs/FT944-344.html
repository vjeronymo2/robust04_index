			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: James Dickie chief quits James Dickie, the engineering components manufacturer, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Hugh Jack, the chairman. He is succeeded by Mr Peter Bullock, a non-executive director. Mr Jack leaves on a high note: the company last month reported a strong full-year performance for 1994 coupled with a return to a full listing. That was followed with an announcement that trading in the first quarter of the current year was substantially ahead of the same period last time. Mr Bullock is also a director of 600 Group and Syltone, and was formerly group chief executive of James Neill, joint managing director of the UK Electrolux Group and managing director of Flymo.</p>

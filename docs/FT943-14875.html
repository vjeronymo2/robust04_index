			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (9): Technological brakethrough - Profile of AlliedSignal AlliedSignal, the US engineering group, has established a leading position in three key areas of the automotive components industry - braking, safety systems and engine components. It's automotive components operations had a turnover of Dollars 4.5bn last year and accounted for around 38 per cent of total group turnover of Dollars 11.8bn. With 33,000 employees the automotive division accounts for a similar share of the total group workforce of 86,000. AlliedSignal claims to be the world's largest independent producer of car and truck brakes under the brand names of Bendix and Jurid, and the group is achieving rapid growth from a modest base in anti-lock braking systems (ABS) for cars and trucks. It has won contracts to supply the ABS systems, for example, on important new products such as the Ford Mondeo large family car and the Chrysler Neon small car. Its market share in ABS systems in Europe and the US remains less than 10 per cent, but the group claims that it is developing more advanced technology, which should strengthen its competitive position by 1996. Under the Garret brand name it is the world's largest producer of turbo chargers and is expanding this business in particular in Europe with the growth of the turbo-diesel market for cars. Its biggest growth business is the production of safety restraint systems, where the group is an important supplier of seat belts and driver and passenger side airbags. The share of the group's main markets in its overall automotive turnover has changed significantly during the past two years as a result of the rapid growth in the North American market and the decline in European car and truck sales. Sales in North America accounted for 60 per cent of automotive turnover last year compared with 34 per cent in Europe and 6 per cent in the rest of the world, while a year earlier Europe accounted for 49 per cent compared with 45 per cent in North America. Its top 10 automotive customers include the big three US vehicle makers, the four European-owned volume car makers, as well as Navistar, the US truck maker, Nissan, the Japanese car maker and Mercedes-Benz, the German car and commercial vehicle producer. Its biggest gains have come from new contracts won from Chrysler, however, to which its sales jumped by 34 per cent last year due to growing orders for ABS braking and safety restraints systems. While AlliedSignal's total automotive turnover was virtually unchanged last year, it increased its net profits by 30 per cent to Dollars 184m from Dollars 142m a year earlier and Dollars 54m in 1991 (excluding special charges) as a result of improved productivity and a reduction in materials costs. To improve its operating efficiencies the group began two years ago to rationalise the number of its locations worldwide and by the end of 1993 it had closed 20 operating plants. In 1992 alone it reduced the automotive workforce by 7 per cent including a 50 per cent reduction in Brazil, where it has suffered continuing losses. At the same time the group is expanding its presence worldwide, however, through a combination of acquisitions and alliances. It has entered into a worldwide truck brake joint venture with Knorr-Bremse of Germany. The combined operation has annual sales of Dollars 650m and a workforce of 4,600. AlliedSignal owns 65 per cent and has management control of the North American operations including Mexico, while the German group owns 65 per cent and has taken management control of the joint venture operations in Europe and South America. In other moves AlliedSignal has formed an airbag joint venture in Europe, initially to supply Opel and Fiat with a new form of hybrid airbag inflator, it has acquired an aftermarket distribution network in Mexico, has opened a seatbelt plant in Spain and has established an airbag marketing and engineering staff in Japan. Earlier this year it acquired the seat belt business of Gilardini, the Italian components group. The group is also restructuring to meet the growing demand from auto makers to provide complete systems rather than simply components. 'This is a trend that has been talked about for years, but which is only now really taking shape,' says Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive. 'In the past we saw our role as merely the component supplier, with the customer responsible for how things fit together. Now we are responsible for the total system.'</p>

K. Khludova and T. N. Grechenko; signed to </F> press 26 Mar. 93]    [Abstract] The effects of magnesium, cobalt, manganese, and  barium salts on the electrical activity of large neurons from  the central nervous system of the common snail were studied. A  total of 147 neurons was studied; 47 of the neurons were  completely isolated, and the remainder were studied while intact  in the central nervous system. The neurons were immersed in  normal saline and tested for membrane potential, action  potential generation threshold and amplitude, and for the  ability to become accustomed to repeated intracellular  electrical stimulation. Glass microelectrodes filled with  potassium citrate with resistances up to 50 ohms were used  to  record the electrical characteristics. The same characteristics  were studied after immersing the intact neurons for 5-10 minutes  and the isolated neurons for 1-5 minutes in the same solution,  but with the addition of cobalt, cadmium, and manganese  chloride. When testing the effects of barium chloride, barium  was completely substituted for calcium, and the neurons were  immersed for 15-60 minutes. It was found that cobalt, cadmium  and manganese ions block the permeability of the neural  membranes to calcium and reduce their electrical excitability.  Barium ions compete with calcium ions, increase excitability,  reduce the action potential generation threshold, and activate  the pacemaker mechanism. All of the heavy metal ions used in the  study alter the electrical activity of only those neurons, the  action potential of which is associated with permeability to  calcium. They do not affect activity associated with  sodium-dependent processes. The presence of barium ions blocks  simple accustomization and facilitated transport processes.

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / City seethes in summit shadow: Prospects and problems for the Ibero-American conference, opening in Brazil today LEADERS began gathering in north-eastern Brazil yesterday for the third Ibero-American conference, which will focus on economic development and social justice. The two-day summit, which starts today in the city of Salvador, brings together Latin American heads of state and those of the region's former colonial powers, Spain and Portugal. Much of the two days will be spent drafting a document - An Agenda for Development, with emphasis on social development - to be presented to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, for further discussion at the UN. Most of the participating countries share urgent problems, such as high infant mortality, poor access to basic health and education services, illiteracy, malnutrition and endemic disease. Since May, ministerial meetings have been drawing up working papers aimed at tackling some of the issues. Away from the conference's main agenda, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru is expected to use the gathering to further his international rehabilitation following criticism of his dissolution of Congress and seizure of wide powers in April last year. Admiring Brazilian press articles on Peru's economic progress under Mr Fujimori pushed Brazil's President Itamar Franco to pledge this week that there would be no 'Fujimorisation' of Brazilian society. Citizens of the habitually languorous city of Salvador, Brazil's first capital, have been sharply critical of preparations for the conference and the accompanying facelift. Many claim the meeting will do little to solve everyday problems. In recent weeks the city has seen feverish activity to spruce up areas between the airport, the convention centre and the hotels where 21 leaders, including Cuba's President Fidel Castro, will be staying. Armies of otherwise unemployed men have donned bright yellow uniforms to resurface and paint the city's two main arteries and to clear up years of rubbish dumped alongside the roads and washed up on the city's beaches. Hotels have rebuilt suites, and restaurants near the conference area have been subjected to weeks of rigorous inspection. In recent years parts of the historical centre, Pelourinho, with its magnificent churches and colonial architecture, have been restored, becoming one of Brazil's main tourist attractions.</p>

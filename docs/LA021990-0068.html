			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TREVINO SHOOTS FINAL-ROUND 67 TO GET SECOND SENIOR TOUR WIN  </P> <P> Lee Trevino held off a late challenge by Bruce Crampton at Naples, Fla., Sunday  to win the Aetna Challenge by one shot for his second PGA Senior Tour victory.  </P> <P> Trevino had a final-round of 67 for a 16-under-par 200 total over three rounds  over the 6,719-yard, par-72 course at The Club at Pelican Bay.  </P> <P> Crampton finished with a 66 and total of 201. The Australian pocketed the  $35,000 second prize.  </P> <P> Trevino, who earned $60,000, won 27 tournaments on the regular PGA Tour before  joining the seniors in 1989. The victory raised his senior tour earnings to  $169,258.  </P> <P> "I think I'm striking the ball better from tee to green than I can remember and  that would include my best year on the regular tour in 1980," Trevino said.  </P> <P> Behind Crampton was Charles Coody, who shot 67 and finished third at 205. Mike  Hill scored 206 to finish fourth.  </P> <P> Jane Crafter broke a five-way tie when she sank a 40-foot birdie putt on the  final hole to win the Inverrary Classic at Lauderhill, Fla., for her first  victory in more than nine years on the LPGA Tour.  </P> <P> Crafter finished with a 54-hole total of seven-under-par 209 to edge Nancy  Lopez by one stroke. It was Lopez's first tournament of the season after  suffering a miscarriage in January.  </P> <P> Crafter, who began the day tied for the lead with Dale Eggeling and Tammie  Green, shot an even-par 72 over the Inverrary course. Eggeling shot 74 to  finish two strokes back.  </P> <P> Australian Greg Norman shot a 68 over the Huntingdale course in Melbourne to  win his sixth Australian Masters title by two shots.  </P> <P> England's Nick Faldo was second. Norman's 72-hole total was 19-under-par total  of 273.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: HATFIELD ACCEPTS CLEMSON JOB  </P> <P> Ken Hatfield of Arkansas accepted the job of football coach at Clemson Sunday,  and a threatened player boycott was averted after he met with the team.  </P> <P> Hatfield, who coached the Razorbacks for six years and led them to the Cotton  Bowl the past two seasons, replaces Danny Ford, who resigned Thursday, less  than two weeks after the NCAA accused Clemson of recruiting violations.  </P> <P> "We understand it's a very difficult situation and time, but I promise you that  things will work out," Hatfield said. "There's nothing that can't be  accomplished if everybody's part of the team and you're part of something  that's bigger than yourself."  </P> <P> The 46-year-old Hatfield had a 55-17-1 record at Arkansas, guiding the  Razorbacks to six bowl appearances in as many years. His bowl record at  Arkansas, however, was 1-5, including Cotton Bowl losses to Tennessee (31-27 in  1990) and UCLA (17-3 in 1989).  </P> <P> The choice of Hatfield, who had a 27-31-1 record at Air Force from 1979-83,  could have created more controversy. But after Hatfield met with the players,  the threatened boycott for the 1990 season was called off. Saturday, players  said that if Ford was not reinstated or an assistant wasn't promoted, they  would sit out next season.  </P></p>

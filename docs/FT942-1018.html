			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Pakistan business strikes over budget's tougher tax regime A patchy two-day business strike began yesterday in Pakistan with many stores, offices and factories shut down but public transport and most small shops staying open. The FPCCI (Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry) - Pakistan's largest business organisation made up of some 120 trade associations and 30 business chambers, called the strike to protest against the budget, announced earlier this month. Businessmen oppose the government's plans to introduce a general sales tax, new excise duties on an ad valorem basis to be collected by tax officials with the powers to search, and other measures making stringent demands on those who query their tax assessments. In Karachi, Pakistan's business capital and Lahore, the country's second city, factories and large offices were closed, but small shops ignored the call to strike. The Karachi Stock Exchange, which had announced business as usual, closed for an hour because of the absence of jobbers but then officially reopened despite lack of business. The smaller Lahore and Islamabad bourses remained officially open but trade was negligible. The FPCCI warned it would consider further measures to press its case, later this week. 'We will continue our protest. . . We will not sleep after these two days,' said Mr SM Muneer, federation president. The Pakistani government has taken a tough stand against the FPCCI and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto suggested over the weekend that the strike was in part politically motivated. Some senior government officials accuse Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, to have encouraged the business reaction. 'I appeal to professional businessmen who have no political affiliations to think of the national interest' said Ms Bhutto. She defended the budget measures and said: 'We cannot allow people to live in huge palaces and not pay taxes.' The new measures include a requirement that anyone appealing against their tax assessment deposit 25 per cent of the assessed tax demand before court proceedings begin. Senior officials justify the move on the grounds that in order to restrain the growing budget deficit, the government must confront the chronic problem of tax collection falling behind target. In the past, taxpayers have been able to appeal against their tax assessment by paying a nominal court fee. As a result, over 50,000 cases are awaiting verdicts and the taxpayers involved owe some Rs10bn (Pounds 215m).</p>

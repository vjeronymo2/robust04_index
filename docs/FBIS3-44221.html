			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The National Assembly is in emergency session  since 24 January. The devaluation of the CFA franc has already  been the subject matter of a communication by Prime Minister  Mahamadou Issoufou. Yesterday, the minister of national  education reported on the situation in the country's schools and  colleges sector. This session is currently in progress, and we  have Mohamed Ali on the spot reporting from the National  Assembly. It seems the parliamentarians debated among others an  item on discriminatory practices in various government  departments. Here is Mohamed Ali.    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] Unlike the calm  atmosphere that marked the first two days of the session,  business today was particularly turbulent. The calm was broken  both inside and outside parliament. Indeed, two incidents which  have as common denominator the criticism of policies of the  Government of the Third Republic, occurred. First, outside  parliament, university and other students arrived in small  groups early this morning for a so-called peaceful demonstration  to remind the parliamentarians that in spite of the national  education minister's reassuring utterances yesterday, their  financial problem remains unresolved. They hung on the main  gate of the closed parliament house using loudspeakers to spit  out insults at the government and the National Assembly, and  thereby preventing parliamentarians from resuming business at  the scheduled time -- that is at 0900. [passage omitted] [end  recording] [passage omitted]    Now, concerning the university and other students you  mentioned, they held a rally at which they protested the arrest  of the secretary general of the Niger Students Union [USN]  following a violent demonstration on 10 January during which  students and security men clashed. This morning's demonstrators  later embarked on a march which took them to the office of the  prime minister. Security men had taken position at several road  junctions and around the prime minister's office but they did  not intervene. Furthermore, the demonstrators issued a 24-hour  ultimatum to the government to release the USN secretary  general. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURNING TO SENIORS AS TALENTED RESOURCE  </P> <P> I was interested in a Times article printed recently that put forth the premise  that Orange County can no longer tempt talented individuals to come here from  other parts of the country for the usual reasons of high-cost housing and  traffic gridlock. It even noted that many companies spend $60,000 to move a  person from some other location and others spend much more. Considering that  person needs an adjustment period of 6 months to become useful, the real cost  is probably much higher.  </P> <P> I am part of an organization called SWAT (Seniors With Amazing Talent), which  contends that there is a source of first-class professional talent already  living in Orange County. Senior citizens are for the most part capable,  vigorous and not ready for retirement in any sense of the word.  </P> <P> The only jobs they are offered are those in the minimum service areas that are  demeaning to their backgrounds and do not pay enough to make their lives  meaningful.  </P> <P> Seniors, who make up a huge slice of the population, need more income to exist  these days and to feel that they are contributing independent people like  anyone else. I am shocked that employers in Orange County will not look at this  talented resource before they look elsewhere.  </P> <P> GEOFFREY POST  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

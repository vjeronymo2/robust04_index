			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Cambodia guerrillas in peace gesture to rivals KHMER ROUGE guerrillas are willing to join Cambodia's new national army to try to bring peace to the country, according to Mr Khieu Samphan, the faction's president, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. He also told reporters that Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state, had offered the Khmer Rouge ministerial posts in the new government. 'We have proposed to establish a quadripartite army so as to avoid clashes and confrontation on the military field,' he said after talks with the United Nations military commander and the deputy peacekeeping chief. 'We see it as the only way to solve and avoid clashes and confrontation.' A diplomat warned, however, that the Khmer Rouge may be putting a rosier glow on its new-found friendship with the government than was warranted. 'It sounds as though only one concession has come out,' he said. But he noted with concern that the Maoist group's willingness to join a united army did not mean it would give up the 15 per cent of Cambodia that it now controls, or even allow free access to the areas. The hardline Khmer Rouge fields 10,000 to 15,000 guerrilla fighters. About 100 of them last Wednesday attacked government troops and overran the 12th century temple they were guarding near the country's northern border with Thailand. Mr Khieu Samphan returned to Phnom Penh yesterday after an absence of three months and went straight into a meeting with Prince Norodom Ranariddh, joint leader of the interim power-sharing government. The prince told him that Cambodia's head of state 'has in mind to give us some ministerial posts,' Mr Khieu Samphan said. 'If that is the case, we will accept with pleasure in the spirit of national reconciliation.' He added, however, that the Khmer Rouge sought a role as advisers rather than cabinet posts. The US has said it would have difficulty supporting a government that included the Khmer Rouge. The 3 1/2 -year Khmer Rouge rule claimed 1m lives until Vietnam invaded in December 1978 to oust the group and install a sympathetic government, led until UN-organised elections in May by the then prime minister Hun Sen. The Khmer Rouge and two non-communist guerrilla allies waged a civil war against that government until a UN-sponsored peace pact in October 1991 that led to the elections. The Khmer Rouge later abandoned the peace agreement. It boycotted the polls narrowly won by Ranariddh's royalist party, their civil war ally. The diplomat noted that the guerrilla leader had not met Hun Sen, once his most bitter foe and now a co-president in the interim government that will rule until elected representatives can write a new constitution.</p>

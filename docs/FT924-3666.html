			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Concern grows over China's HK stance CHINA'S unbending attitude toward Hong Kong is causing increasing concern among western diplomats and some mainland Chinese officials in the colony, who are worried about the consequences for Beijing's relations with the US and Taiwan. Diplomats say they are dismayed at the way in which Beijing's top leadership has interpreted a recent instruction from Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old senior leader, to be tough with the British. 'We all know that Deng has said 'Teach the British a lesson',' said the head of one western mission in Hong Kong. 'But for that to be interpreted in the way it has been is quite worrying.' Last week, the local stock market fell sharply after a series of threats from Beijing were aimed at proposals for more democracy by Mr Chris Patten, the governor. Brokers expect choppy trading ahead of this week's meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group - the body overseeing the transfer of Hong Kong from the UK to China. A week ago, China said it would repudiate business contracts entered into by the Hong Kong government if they were not approved by Beijing. Last Thursday it suggested that the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration might be in doubt if the UK did not back down on plans for limited democracy in the colony. The western diplomat said that China was losing sight of its other vital interest, namely its relationship with the US and its improving relations with Taiwan. Taiwan goes to the polls in two weeks for its first fully democratic elections, and Beijing's tough stand on democracy in Hong Kong is seen as boosting the electoral prospects of the island's independence movement. There is growing concern in the US - especially among Democrats in Congress  -of China's perceived intimidation of Hong Kong. China's sale of missile technology to Pakistan is also seen as weakening further the narrow base of support Beijing currently enjoys in Washington. These concerns were echoed by local mainland officials in Hong Kong, who also pointed out that Beijing ran the risk of undermining the Joint Declaration in the eyes of local people. The Joint Declaration provides for Hong Kong to be 'ruled by Hong Kong people' and for it to enjoy a 'high degree of autonomy' under the concept of 'one country, two systems'. Beijing's statement a week ago that it would act on behalf of the future government of the colony in approving pre-1997 contracts was seen by some of its own officials as weakening these commitments.</p>

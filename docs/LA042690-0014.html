			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES IN UNITED STATES  </P> <P> Roche, a college president, shows a surprising ignorance regarding hate crime.  Contrary to his claim, no "new categories of criminal activity" have been  created.  </P> <P> The definitions of hate crime used by the Los Angeles County Commission on  Human Relations for the past decade simply identify those violations of  existing law (assault, arson, malicious mischief, etc.) that are based on a  victim's race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation.  </P> <P> These definitions have been adopted by local law enforcement agencies, and for  statewide police training.  </P> <P> The California and U.S. attorneys general have yet to establish hate crime  definitions, in response to recent legislation, but it seems likely that their  definitions will be similar.  </P> <P> Roche also has difficulty distinguishing among theology, prejudice and crime.  </P> <P> He believes that people simply "prefer" one sexual orientation over another,  and this somehow leads him to conclude that crimes against gays and lesbians  are less serious than crimes against followers of a particular religious faith,  although his logic here is unclear.  </P> <P> EUGENE S. MORNELL  </P> <P> Executive Director, Los Angeles County  </P> <P> Commission of Human Relations  </P></p>

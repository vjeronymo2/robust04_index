			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Lyell blames officials over PII certificates Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, yesterday blamed civil servants under his supervision for errors over the handling of ministers' claims for public interest immunity (PII) during the Matrix Churchill trial. In his final day giving evidence to the Scott inquiry, Sir Nicholas admitted that both the trial judge and prosecuting counsel should have been told by government lawyers from the Treasury Solicitor's Department that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had objected to signing a PII certificate. Although insisting he was not trying to evade his responsibilities as the minister responsible for supervising Treasury Solicitor's Department lawyers, Sir Nicholas said he could not be expected to 'second-guess' the way they carried out their work. Mr Heseltine had been concerned that the PII certificate, which attempted to prevent official documents being disclosed to the defence, would endanger the chances of a fair trial. He consulted Sir Nicholas who then instructed him that he was under a duty to claim PII and had no discretion in the matter. Sir Nicholas said he had trusted lawyers in the Treasury Solicitor's Department to pass on the correspondence between himself and Mr Heseltine on the issue to Mr Alan Moses QC, the chief prosecutor. This had not been done and the failure meant the case for claiming PII was wrongly argued by Mr Moses to the judge, Sir Nicholas admitted. 'There were a number of things that did not happen as they should,' Sir Nicholas told Lord Justice Scott. He agreed that instructions given by the government solicitors to Mr Moses were too brief and misrepresented the position in stating that all ministers concerned were seeking the disclosure of the documents. The attorney-general agreed with Lord Justice Scott that it would have been both possible and preferable for Mr Moses to have told the judge of Mr Heseltine's concern for the documents to be disclosed. Sir Nicholas said: 'I am a minister of the Crown. The Treasury Solicitor's (Department) falls under my responsibility and I accept that.' However, distancing himself from his staff, he said his job did not include 'day to day' supervision of their activities. It was impractical for the small team of people in the attorney-general's office to monitor all the activities of the Treasury Solicitor's Department, he said. Sir Nicholas also stated that Mr Moses had given him a firm assurance that the documents the government wanted withheld would not endanger the prospects of a fair trial. Not having seen the documents himself, Sir Nicholas said he had personally checked this with Mr Moses shortly before the trial started. 'Mr Moses did indeed confirm it,' he said.</p>

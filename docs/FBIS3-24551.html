			<p>Language: <F P=105> RUssian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Lezin: ``The Club of Voters Attached to the </F> Russian Academy of Sciences Storms Parliament'']    [Text] ``Who is for whom?''--this question was this time  probably the most interesting one in the absorbing game called  ``The Election Campaign.'' Shortly before the election the  politically most active part of the academic community--the  members of the Club of Voters attached to the Russian Academy of  Sciences--decided to direct attention to their ``party  affiliation.'' A press conference was held in this regard at the  Parliamentary Center.    Thus, with whom is the KIAN [Club of Voters attached to the  Russian Academy of Sciences]? The club decided to support two  blocs: the one headed by Yavlinskiy, Boldyrev, and Lukin, and  Russia's Choice. Lyudmila Vakhnina, cochairman of the KIAN,  noted that many scientists had displayed adherence to  principles, having chosen in favor of Choice, in spite of the  fact that they were in the social category which had suffered  greatly during the reforms.    As Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the Coordinating Council of  the club, explained at the press conference, this was done for  the following reasons. Russia's Choice is the party of power,  which needs constructive opposition. For the good of the reforms  that are being implemented by it. Especially now, when in the  structures of power there are forces that are trying to suppress  any displays of dissidence. The alternative democratic bloc  should become such opposition. The bloc of Yavlinskiy, they  decided in the KIAN, will cope best of all with this task.    Moreover, it had not been possible to discover in the  programs of any of the associations provisions in which science  was specified as a sphere of state interest. The KIAN has a plan  of the reform of science, and the bloc of Yavlinskiy had  integrated it into its own program. In the opinion of A.  Zakharov, the mistake of the reformers was that they, having  indicated the necessity of state support of world-level  research, did not propose a mechanism of its selection. As a  result real transformations did not occur, while the financing  of all research and development was merely cut back. The Club of  Voters believes that the competitive financing of priority  research in case of an independent examination and the creation  of the appropriate legislative base should be at the basis of  the new scientific and technical policy.    The support group of the bloc of Yavlinskiy from the KIAN  gathered about 10,000 signatures of voters in support of the  bloc, mainly at regional academic centers. Eight candidates from  six regional organizations of scientists were placed on the  ticket of the ``Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc'' association,  while Aleksey Zakharov was nominated for the State Duma on the  federal part of the ticket.    We will report in subsequent issues on how successful the  participation of the Club of Voters in the election was.</p>

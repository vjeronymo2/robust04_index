			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FAN FRENZY FORCES CANCELLATION OF NEW KIDS BENEFIT CONCERT  </P> <P> A benefit concert Wednesday night featuring the pop music band New Kids on the  Block was canceled when hundreds of ardent fans, mostly screaming teen-age  girls, surged forward and threatened to overrun the stage.  </P> <P> The band appeared at Boston's World Trade Center for about one minute before  retreating backstage to avoid the crush. "The kids were hysterical," said John  Drew, head of the trade center. No arrests or major injuries were reported in  the crush, but one report said several fans fainted or cried in the excitement  and dozens of girls tried to sneak backstage to meet band members.  </P> <P> About 4,000 concert-goers -- primarily teen-age girls and their parents --  attended the show, a benefit for Boston Against Drugs. New Kid Donnie Wahlberg  called the fan attention "flattering." Backstage, the band presented Boston  Against Drugs a $25,000 check.  </P> <P> The band appeared in concert in Los Angeles earlier this month, without  incident.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INVENTOR WINS PATENT SUIT AGAINST FORD;  </P> <P> AUTOMOTIVE: VERDICT ON INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPERS COULD AFFECT SIMILAR  ACTIONS AGAINST 27 OTHER COMPANIES.  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. infringed on a former professor's patent for the intermittent  windshield wiper used on its cars, a jury ruled in a potentially far-reaching  and lucrative case for the inventor.  </P> <P> The verdict Monday could affect similar lawsuits by Robert W. Kearns against  General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., Daimler-Benz, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and  21 other companies.  </P> <P> The Ford case was the first to go to trial.  </P> <P> The federal jury will reconvene Feb. 26 to establish how much Ford must pay  Kearns.  </P> <P> However, U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn ruled earlier that Kearns failed to  prove he could have made and marketed the system on his own and thus can claim  only a royalty on each wiper, instead of Ford's profit.  </P> <P> Ford had contended that the patent was invalid because the windshield system  contained no new concepts.  </P> <P> But Kearns argued that a new combination of parts made his invention unique.  The invention allows the driver to set the interval at which the wiper sweeps  the window.  </P> <P> Kearns, a former professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who now lives  in Gaithersburg, Md., obtained the patents between 1967 and 1974.  </P> <P> Kearns claimed in his lawsuit that he installed a set of his wipers on a 1962  Ford and took it to the auto maker.  </P> <P> Kearns "made numerous disclosures of confidential engineering test designs" to  Ford engineers, the lawsuit claimed. Because they repeatedly asked him to  discuss designs, the lawsuit said, Kearns was led to believe Ford would buy his  system.  </P> <P> Kearns, his attorneys and Ford all said they were forbidden by the judge to  talk about the 12-year-old case.  </P></p>

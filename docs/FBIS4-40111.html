			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 13 Jun -- "Thanks to our consistent foreign  policy, Ukraine has now emerged as a state on the world stage",  Leonid Kravchuk declared today when he set out his election  program on national radio. "As president, I have done my utmost  to promote Ukraine's further integration with European  structures and to strengthen economic and political relations  with CIS countries, above all Russia," he stressed.    The Ukrainian head of state believes that "the signing of  the  tripartite agreement, which gave the Ukraine clearcut guarantees  for its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and financial,  economic and technical assistance, has made a great contribution  to improving the international situation." The president  reminded his listeners that Ukraine was one of the first to sign  the Partnership for Peace, and it has become a participant in  the NATO program. But according to Leonid Kravchuk,  "cooperation with the CIS countries remains a priority for us,  and it was in this context that Ukraine signed all the important  economic agreements." The president singled out Russia as "a  traditional partner with whom we have signed over 75 documents  of various kinds on the development of economic and political  ties".    It was reported by Leonid Kravchuk that a broad-scale  agreement on cooperation, friendship, and partnership with  Russia is currently being drawn up which, in his opinion, "will  bring Ukrainian-Russian relations onto a qualitatively new level  and will register fundamental clauses determined by our way of  life, history, and the futures of the two countries." The  president is reckoning on signing this document immediately  after the problem of the Black Sea Fleet has been solved.    Touching on the issue of ways for Ukraine to extricate  itself  from the crisis, Leonid Kravchuk said that "first of all, a  block of financial problems must be resolved: mutual  computations, credits, the banking system." He reported to  listeners that this program already exists and it has been  agreed upon at all levels. The president thereby name the  priorities for getting out of the crisis -- foodstuffs and  energy resources. "The successful solution of these issues will  give an impetus to the development of other sectors," Leonid  Kravchuk stressed. In his view, it is also necessary to set up  a normal investment climate in the country. "The laws on  investments should be stable."    In his speech the president paid considerable attention to  the issue of building a sovereign state. He thinks that "at the  present time, it is necessary to stop any discussion on where we  are going and what kind of society we are building." The  forthcoming elections themselves will testify to the fact that  the people are voting for a presidential-parliamentary republic.  "Therefore," Leonid Kravchuk noted, "a new constitution must be  adopted immediately after the elections, the relative power  structures and a strong government must be set up and the  necessary powers must be given to the president, and additional  elections to the Supreme Soviet need to be held."</p>

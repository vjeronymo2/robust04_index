			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Observer: Usherettes? The House of Lords is advertising for a Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod to help the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod and Serjeant at Arms keep their lordships in order. Someone with proven management skills and some experience of information technology is being sought. No problem with that except for the fact that the advert states that the House of Lords is an Equal Opportunities Employer. Since when has equality of opportunity had anything to do with getting a job in the Lords?</p>

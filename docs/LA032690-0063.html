			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES  </P> <P> A Master Teacher  </P> <P> Michael Milken has been taking time out from preparing his legal defense and  running a new company to impart some mathematical wisdom to elementary school  students. Since September, Milken, the former junk bond wizard at Drexel  Burnham Lambert, has appeared every two weeks to teach sixth-graders at the  elementary school run by his synagogue, the Stephen S. Wise Temple in Bel-Air.  He has taught similar classes at other schools. In class, Milken so far has  shunned the more arcane areas of his expertise, such as calculating junk bond  yields -- or underwriting fees.  </P> <P> But the classes, described by school officials as extremely popular, do give  some insight into his own mathematical prowess. Much of his instruction  involves tricks for doing swift calculations mentally, such as shortcuts for  doing multiplication without the aid of pencil or calculator.  </P> <P> Ellen Howard, the math teacher whose classes he speaks to, says he has also  taught some rudimentary trading skills, including a unit on bartering that  required students to imagine that they were stranded on an island and had to  trade different kinds of scarce food.  </P> <P> Although Milken is under indictment on racketeering and securities fraud  charges, Metuka Benjamin, director of education at the temple, says she has  heard no complaints from congregation members about the classes.  </P> <P> Benjamin says Milken is teaching for free.  </P> <P> (Milken is contesting the criminal charges.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Schussing Briefcases  </P> <P> Hewlett-Packard proves that it is not only strong in the computer field but on  the ski slopes, as well. For the third year in a row, the Palo Alto company has  come in first in the Corporate Ski Challenge at Alpine Meadows at Lake Tahoe.  </P> <P> Harrah's came in second place in the 10-year-old event, which now attracts 75  corporations, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric was third. Other participating  companies included Chevron, AT&amp;T and Citicorp.  </P> <P> "Corporations are acquiescing to the industrial psychologists' very vocal pleas  to blend health and fitness with workloads and participating in this event is  one way of doing it," says Dan Nourse, director of communications at Alpine  Meadows.  </P> <P> Larry Goodman, a vice president at Digital, puts it another way: "It gives us a  chance to do something past the usual bonuses and expected benefits."  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Time -- at Least Once?  </P> <P> If you hate airline delays -- and who doesn't? -- here's a tip to use when  you're booking your next flight. In addition to asking your travel agent about  the cost, arrival and departure times or the availability of your favorite  seat, also ask about that flight's on-time record.  </P> <P> Few travelers, even the most seasoned, know that such information is available  for the asking. The key is found in the flight code that appears in airline and  travel agent computers.  </P> <P> A last digit of "1" means that particular flight has landed on time 10% to 20%  of the time for the past month, "2" for 20% and 30% on-time arrivals, and so on  up to a 90% to 100% on-time record.  </P> <P> The data comes from the reports that airlines are required to file each month  with the government and does not include delays caused by mechanical problems.  </P></p>

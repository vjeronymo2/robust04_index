			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Southern Water buoyant with 7% advance Southern Water was in buoyant mood yesterday as it reported a 7 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 127.5m, against Pounds 119.2m, and gave an encouraging report on the capital intensive coastal clean-up programme. Mr Martyn Webster, managing director, said Southern had made excellent progress in its Operation Seaclean project, in spite of several surprising and uncontrollable variables: seagulls, for example. 'Two seagulls equals one human, in terms of the polluting effect,' Mr Webster said. Southern finished the year to March 31 with sales 9 per cent higher at Pounds 347.7m (Pounds 319.2m), helped by a strong performance from the non-regulated businesses. Mr Webster said the engineering, environmental services, and systems businesses built up since privatisation 'are more than paying for themselves'. At the operating level, and after start-up costs, they increased profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 10.1m, representing almost 8 per cent of group profits. Interest gains added a further Pounds 2m to profits, on sales up by 14 per cent to Pounds 88.1m. The core utility business returned an 11 per cent increase at the operating level to Pounds 123.5m. Mr Webster said costs had risen by less than 4 per cent in the water and sewerage division. When one-off expenses such as rationalisation and last winter's flooding were excluded, ongoing costs rose by less than 3 per cent. Unlike most of Southern's colleagues in the water sector, Mr Webster said the group expected to increase the number of employees in both regulated and non-regulated business. The rapidly expanding non-regulated businesses and the complex capital spending programme would require new types of skills, he said. However, Southern remained committed to cutting costs where possible. The dividend is raised 8.5 per cent to 23.1p (21.3p) with a recommended final of 15.4p with a scrip alternative. Earnings, held back by previous scrips, rose just 6 per cent to 70.3p (66.3p) per share. COMMENT Southern was the best performing water stock last year, and yesterday confirmed that support. Net cash of Pounds 10m and small underlying cost increases reinforce faith in its cash management. This will be vital in the forthcoming rigorous price regime, when the group will be expected to cope with capital investment of between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn. In the end, everything rests on the spending authorised by Ofwat. Southern's track record may make it attractive relative to the sector, but water stocks in general are likely to languish until price uncertainty is cleared up. Forecasts are for between Pounds 135m and Pounds 140m pre-tax, with an 8 per cent increase in the dividend to 25p.</p>

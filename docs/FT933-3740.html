			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Sport: Four favourites in a bright season - Cricket I HAVE enjoyed this season's county cricket. The four-day game seems to me to have been a success, producing more close finishes and varied bowling than the three-day game, which had become stale and, all too often, contrived. In some ways this has been a summer of the unexpected, with regard to both counties and players. I had not guessed that Glamorganshire would end up fighting Worcestershire for second place in the county table. And in picking the four county cricketers whose play I have most enjoyed this summer, I am making up for my lack of perspicacity by leaving out the obvious top performers, such as Graham Gooch and Curtly Ambrose, in favour of four who have surprised as well as delighted. Surrey's Joseph Benjamin, for instance, has improved beyond recognition, without being overshadowed by Waqar Younis and Martin Bicknell in an exceptionally strong bowling attack. By mixing swingers and cutters in with full length balls he has established his weaponry. Surrey have just given Benjamin his county cap, which he well deserves. He bowls very fast medium, with unpredictable, sharp bounce. His 62 county wickets so far this season have been a bit expensive, but were often taken when the batsmen were deeply entrenched. He adds a touch of toughness to Surrey's efforts. Released at the end of 1991 by Warwickshire, after three disappointing years there, he has come into his own at the age of 32, at a county that is inclined to come and go without really getting anywhere. He has learnt to be a cricketing realist. John Emburey, I am sure, was born a realist. He is a 41-year old perennial from Peckham, proud of having learnt his cricket on the streets and having played it with Middlesex for the past 20 years. Emburey is not the kind of full-flighted, aggressive spinner I most like to watch, but his tireless, rather flat off-spin is economical. It often frustrates batsmen into surrendering their wickets by trying to hit their way out of stagnation. So far, 223 of his 708 overs have been maidens and he has taken 68 wickets. At the top end of the averages, only Mushtaq Ahmed and Steve Watkin have taken more. Emburey is not defensive, but he attacks carefully. He has worked out an effective bowling partnership with Philip Tufnell, Middlesex's much younger, more resourceful and more temperamental off-spinner. His batting is better than Tufnell's - most cricketers qualify for that accolade. His 55 not out in the first innings of the Edgbaston Test was a resolute display of his speciality, sweetly described by Christopher Martin-Jenkins on the radio as 'letting the ball hit him on the bat'. Once or twice this season for Middlesex it has hit him prodigiously hard, as on the way to his recent 120 against Northamptonshire. It is always possible that Emburey has one more trick up his sleeve, which makes him a great team asset. Team values tend to be under-rated nowadays, as individual achievement is emphasised and often judged apart from the co-ordinated achievements of the team. Wicket-keepers are the least prone to this because they are the pivots of all the activities on the field, completing the course of the bowling, preying on the batting and catching the whole fanfare of fielders' throws into the stumps. A good keeper boosts team morale, which is why Robert 'Jack' Russell is so valued at Gloucester. Russell has long been a good and cheerful keeper, never tired of trying to improve. He is in the Alan Knott style: slight, bouncy, alert, close to the stumps and at times airborne in the course of duty. He has only ever played county cricket for Gloucestershire, his home county, a striking demonstration of loyalty. Gloucestershire are in hard times at present but Russell's outstanding quality, as always, is his determination. No-one has ever accused him of being half-hearted. In his last county game, at Taunton, he stumped Adrianus van Troost, Somerset's Dutch speed merchant, for nought, off the young off-spinner Martyn Ball, though Somerset were in the 380s and Gloucestershire were tired. If Russell was tired, he did not show it. It was one of seven stumpings and 50 catches he had taken since the season began, an impressive tally. I was given the figures from Russell's cricketing diary, in which he records details of every match he plays. Derbyshire's John Morris, far from keeping a cricketing diary awash with statistics, told me he did not know how many runs he had scored this season (1,439, at an average of 55). He belongs to the more stately school of cricket, remote from figures and fitness regimes, unlikely to drink 20 cups of tea or run six miles a day, as Russell does. Like many naturally talented batsmen, Morris sometimes plays with an air of taking his triumphs for granted, although they are always powerful. His recent 127 against Surrey, in which he warmed up with a six back over Younis's head and right out of the playing area at Derby, was a savage example of this. Younis was quickly taken off. Morris carried on hitting as though he was enjoying an afternoon off work. He is a majestic batsman, hooking and driving freely, particularly relishing fast bowling that rushes on to the bat in search of punishment. With batsmen like Morris concentration is liable to lapse when faced with dull or undemanding bowling. He has had some poor games for Derbyshire this summer, but has had some grand ones too and is more consistent than he used to be. I like Morris's batting because it has a touch of grandeur seldom seen in modern cricket. His fielding is of the sort more often seen in older cricket, before the South Africans brought speed and efficiency to the field in the 1960s. He has improved, but still gives the impression that rather than sprinting to stop the ball, he would do better to let it find rest in his body. The real devastation will come with bat, not ball, in hand.</p>

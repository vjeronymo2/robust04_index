			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev--The Central Electoral Commission registered  the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine [LDPU] on 3 January as  the 20th party that will nominate candidates during the upcoming  elections to the Ukrainian parliament. As Volodymyr Klymchuk,  the party's leader told a UNIAN correspondent, the "LDPU is  cautious about forming blocs with other political forces. It  is, above all, afraid of the efforts that have been announced by  some blocs to form excessively rigid structures that could  hinder the opportunity to operate independently. However, this  does not mean that the liberal democrats will halt contacts and  consultations with other parties."    According to Klymchuk, the communists and socialists are the  only ones considered by the LDPU to be opponents.</p>

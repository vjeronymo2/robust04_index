			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Future worries affect the present - A look at the clearers' prospects in the wake of Lloyds' results On the basis that it is better for a company's share price to travel hopefully than to arrive, yesterday was a predictably bad day for UK banks. Lloyds' arrival at the point of a high return on equity, huge cash flows and a large dividend rise was greeted by a sharp fall in its shares. The interim reporting season of the clearing banks, which was started by Lloyds and will continue next week with Abbey National and National Westminster, will show an industry in exceptionally good shape. But it will also indicate reasons why most investors think the future will be tougher. If there were no worries about that, Lloyds' 22 per cent return on equity would appear manna from heaven. 'You rub your eyes at the returns,' says Mr Chris Ellerton, banking analyst at SG Warburg. 'The sector cannot sustain a return like that, or everyone would want to start a bank.' One reason that the banks' results are likely to be so good is that bad debts are now falling quickly. The credit quality of UK companies improved strongly in the first half - shown by the fall in Lloyds' specific bad debt provisions for large corporate lending to Pounds 7m, against Pounds 38m. Bank shares have already fallen sharply this year. This is largely because of tightening US monetary policy, which brought an end to UK interest rate falls. The shares of HSBC Holdings - parent of Midland Bank - and Standard Chartered have also been badly affected by unsettled Asia Pacific markets. The shares have also responded adversely to the belief that banks face testing times. They could ratchet up earnings during the recession by increasing charges and loan margins. But analysts and investors now think that their high profits and capital will be frittered away in competition. Lloyds' results reinforced this impression in a number of ways: The bank's loans and advances to customers fell from Pounds 39.2bn at the year-end to Pounds 38bn at the end of June. Loan demand has been subdued despite the recovery, although Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, said a rise in demand for loans was likely to give the bank 'a tail-wind' by the year-end. It added a further half percentage point to its tier one ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets, taking it to 7.1 per cent. It could be taken to less than 5 per cent by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester acquisition, but it is a sign that other banks will soon build up capital well in excess of their needs. Fees and commissions were flat, rising only from Pounds 656m to Pounds 695m. The rise in fees was one of the main methods by which banks improved operating income in the early 1990s, taking the opportunity presented by either losses or slim profits to re-price services to companies and individuals. Net interest income in the UK retail banking and insurance business fell marginally, from Pounds 661m to Pounds 655m. The bank's mortgage balances grew faster than the industry as a whole, but suffered an erosion in margins. Sir Brian emphasised the extreme price sensitivity of the mortgage market. Taken together, analysts argue that this means banks are building up cash for which they have no use. It will either find an outlet in acquisitions similar to Lloyds' purchase of C&amp;G, or will be handed back to shareholders, or will be used to pay for price competition to gain market share. Lloyds mooted all three possibilities yesterday, although it sounded unenthusiastic about the second. Sir Robin Ibbs, chairman, said that it might buy back shares as a means of distributing capital in the medium-term, but only 'if we found there was no better way of using the money'. The possibility of price competition was openly discussed by Sir Brian, who said Lloyds might lower the gap between the cost of equity - currently at 12 per cent - and the return on its equity by lowering prices. However, it would only do so if it calculated that volumes would rise to compensate. In practice, analysts believe that banks will have little choice but to succumb to price competition in an overcrowded retail market. Mr Ellerton cites the example of a colleague charged a 43 per cent annual percentage rate of interest on his Pounds 500 mortgage, after taking fees into account. 'A lot of the charges they stuck on in the recession will unwind now. They just will not be able to hold them,' he says. Mr Ellerton says that lower-cost financial services producers such as Lloyds and C&amp;G will initiate price wars because they will be able to bear competition more readily. This provides an uncertain future for bank dividends, after the large increases paid out by several at the full-year. Such is the expectation generated by banks' capital strength that Lloyds' 14 per cent rise was greeted with derision yesterday. That will not have comforted the banks yet to report.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: PEPPERY STEW WARMS A WINTER DAY  </P> <P> Nothing warms a wintry day faster than a peppery stew from South of the Border.  And nothing accommodates the hurried cook better than almost effortless main  dishes, especially if they can be microwaved a day or two ahead of time then  reheated just before serving.  </P> <P> Our Picadillo and Chicken Mole, rich with the flavors of Old Mexico, fill the  bill on both counts. Best of all, they need only a crisp green salad and a  fresh fruit dessert to round out the meal.  </P> <P> Like stews made the old-fashioned way, you'll find that both of these Mexican  classics profit from a stay in the fridge because their exotic flavors have a  chance to mellow and marry.  </P> <P> PICADILLO (Spicy Mexican Chili)  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1 large onion, minced  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 pound lean ground beef  </P> <P> 1/3 cup tomato paste  </P> <P> 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Dash pepper  </P> <P> Dash ground cloves  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons minced raisins  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons minced blanched almonds  </P> <P> Hot cooked rice  </P> <P> Microwave oil, onion and garlic in wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe 2-quart  casserole on HIGH (100% power) 3 1/2 to 4 minutes, stirring at half time, until  onions are glassy.  </P> <P> Mix in beef and press into doughnut shape around edge of casserole. Recover  with wax paper and microwave on HIGH 4 1/2 to 5 1/4 minutes, breaking up beef  clumps and stirring at half time, until no pink remains.  </P> <P> Mix in tomato paste, red pepper flakes to taste, oregano, salt, pepper, cloves,  raisins and almonds. Recover with wax paper and microwave on MEDIUM-HIGH (70%  power) 4 minutes, stirring at half time, until flavors are well-blended.  </P> <P> Serve at once over hot cooked rice or cool to room temperature, cover and  refrigerate until ready to serve. To reheat, microwave covered casserole on  MEDIUM-HIGH 5 to 6 minutes, stirring at half time, until mixture simmers. Makes  4 servings.  </P> <P> CHICKEN MOLE  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, minced  </P> <P> 1 large clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 (3- to 3 1/2-pound) broiler-fryer chicken, disjointed and skinned  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups chicken broth, about  </P> <P> 1 (4-ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained  </P> <P> 1 large tomato, peeled, cored and seeded  </P> <P> 1/4 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1 (1-ounce) square unsweetened chocolate  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons roasted blanched peanuts  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons toasted blanched almonds  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sesame seeds  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon chili powder  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon ground anise  </P> <P> Dash pepper  </P> <P> Dash ground cinnamon  </P> <P> Hot cooked rice  </P> <P> Spread onion and garlic in microwave-safe, 3-quart casserole at least 10 inches  across. Arrange chicken on top with meatiest parts toward outside and wings in  center. Dissolve salt in 1 cup broth, pour over chicken, cover with lid and  microwave on HIGH (100% power) 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Combine chiles, tomato, raisins, chocolate, pumpkin seeds, peanuts, almonds,  sesame seeds, chili powder, red pepper flakes, anise, pepper and cinnamon in  food processor and process 15 to 20 seconds. Add 1/4 cup chicken broth and  pulse 5 seconds. Scrape mixture into microwave-safe 1-quart measure.  </P> <P> When chicken has cooked 10 minutes, remove from oven, turn pieces over and  rearrange. Recover and let stand while cooking sauce. Cover measure with vented  plastic wrap and microwave sauce on HIGH 4 to 5 minutes, stirring at half time,  until mixture bubbles vigorously.  </P> <P> Pour sauce over chicken, recover and microwave on HIGH 10 minutes. Rotate  casserole 180 degrees and baste chicken with sauce. Reduce power to MEDIUM (50%  power), recover and microwave 10 to 12 minutes or until chicken is tender,  rotating casserole 180 degrees and basting chicken with sauce at half time.  </P> <P> Adjust salt as needed. Thin sauce with additional chicken broth if too thick.  Serve at once over hot cooked rice or cool to room temperature, cover and  refrigerate until shortly before serving. To reheat, microwave covered  casserole on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 8 to 10 minutes, rearranging chicken in  sauce and stirring at half time. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking time about 15%.  </P></p>

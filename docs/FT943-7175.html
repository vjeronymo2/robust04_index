			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / German poll finds little love for banks German banks not only have too much influence over industry, but they fail to use it effectively, according to a poll of the nation's management and political elite. They have also lost the confidence of many ordinary customers who now believe they will get a better deal from a car salesman than from their bank manager. The tax man, too, appears to require protection from Germany's unloved financiers. According to the respected Allensbach polling institute, banks offering overseas investment advice to savers will frequently throw in advice on tax avoidance as a bonus. In a process akin to sticking a finger in boiling water to check if it is hot, the institute carried out a survey recently as the nation steamed over the third successive bank-related corporate calamity, and while tempers simmered over bumper bank profits garnered during the recession. Questioning of a 650-strong sample on the topic of bank power, the institute came up with a clear majority believing banks should not be allowed to hold stakes of more than 15 per cent in other companies. Three-quarters of the sample, which included premiers, board directors and top managers, said bankers should be granted fewer seats on other companies' non-executive supervisory boards; two-thirds believed they did not take their responsibilities seriously enough. Long a favourite target of the popular press, German banks have now emerged as not much liked in the higher ranks of society. Although the timing and tone of the survey - for Capital business magazine - questions might arguably have distorted the results, the findings underlined the need for some image-building. In an unaccustomed display of contrition, Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank chairman, and target of much abuse, recently admitted to 'arrogance'. Sensitivities have been outraged in particular by the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft in which leading banks had large holdings and considerable supervisory board clout. This and the subsequent alleged multi-billion scams perpetrated by property shark, Mr Jurgen Schneider - now on the run - and managers of an athletics track supplier, injected new life into a prolonged debate on the power of the financial institutions. Fewer than 50 per cent of the managers in the group said banks helped the economy to function while 40 per cent said they acted as a brake on entrepreneurial initiative. The federal banking association greeted the survey with 'great astonishment,' adding there was nothing new in the results.</p>

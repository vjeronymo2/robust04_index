			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with media magnate Silvio Berlusconi by reporter </F> Fabrizio Ferragni, following meeting with President Scalfaro on  15 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Ferragni] Mr. Berlusconi, you had a full hour of  talks with Scalfaro. About a month and half ago you criticized  the head of state. Today, after this meeting, is the dispute  over?    [Berlusconi] I believe so. I explained the motives behind  that statement to the president, but I also told him that I  found his conduct in these difficult moments of the election  campaign beyond reproach.    [[Ferragni] At the moment the election campaign is very  vociferous and annoying people. What do you think?    [Berlusconi] I agree that is exactly how things are. Above  all television is showing voters an election campaign of  personal attacks, people speaking over each other, ambushes and  traps, and very little in the way of concrete substance.    [Ferragni] Until a few days ago you were the chairman of  Fininvest. Now you are a candidate and a leader. Is everybody  going to get equal time?    [Berlusconi] I believe that the rule of equal time should  apply -- i.e. giving all politicians and the leaders of the  various political forces equal time and space.    [Ferragni] Do you mean, in journalistic terminology, a kind  of electoral forum spread over all the TV channels, during this  difficult and important campaign?    [Berlusconi] Yes, according to the criteria used in all  democracies -- in France and Spain where I am familiar with the  television system -- and in America, for example, where each  candidate has the right to a certain amount of air time to  explain his program. Even when he is face to face with an  opposing candidate, he has an impartial moderator who is chiefly  responsible for keeping time, and he answers questions put to  him by his opponent or by journalists, and he is allotted time  to complete his arguments and to explain his position and that  of his party in depth.    [Ferragni] You are now -- in the run up to the elections --  allied with Bossi and Fini. After the elctions, do you think it  would be possible to break up the alliance and form a new one?    [Berlusconi] No, absolutely not. It is a requirement in  elections that an important alliance is formed around a program  with a view to carrying it out after the elections -- otherwise  there would be no sense in it.</p>

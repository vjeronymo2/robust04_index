(File No. 912&hyph;3347), which is attached.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 --> Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen in the Matter of Metagenics, Inc. (File No. 912&hyph;3347)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although I believe that certain of Metagenics' claims were unsubstantiated and, therefore, I would have been inclined to support a more narrow complaint, I must dissent from today's Commission action because I believe that, on balance, it runs contrary to the public interest. I fear that the breadth of the allegations in the administrative complaint may convey the wrong message to the public and thereby discourage not only truthful and nondeceptive claims about calcium supplements but, ultimately, their use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Commission has taken great pains in recent years to articulate and justify its standards for advertising interpretation and substantiation. In taking this action today, I believe that the Commission has essentially ceded its authority to the FDA on both counts. In short, I find today's Commission action overly restrictive and inconsistent with the previously announced policies of the Commission. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22432 Filed 9&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;M  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

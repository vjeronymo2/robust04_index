			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Sport: Sampras floats towards his slam - Tennis / John Barrett looks at the men most likely to win the French Open 'He seems to be flying. I have never seen a player play that well against me . . . and I had the best seat in the house]' Thus spake Boris Becker in Rome last Sunday, no longer the dominant superman whom Nietzsche would have admired. The 26-year-old German had just been thrashed 6-1 6-2 6-2 by Pete Sampras. It was the American's 27th consecutive winning match and his seventh title of the year, the fifth in succession. I am glad I was there to witness this virtuoso performance because few men ever reach the level of perfection Sampras achieved that day. This was a truly majestic display of controlled aggression on clay from the powerful 22-year-old world No 1 and was achieved without undue help from his serve, usually his most potent weapon. 'I guess I'll have to work on it before Paris,' he told me. As we approach the 1994 French Open, the unofficial world championship on clay which begins at the enlarged and improved Stade Roland Garros on Monday, everyone is wondering whether Sampras, already the Wimbledon, US and Australian champion, can complete a consecutive slam. With the holder, Sergi Bruguera and the 1991 and 1992 winner, Jim Courier, both in his half, Sampras was treated harshly by yesterday's draw. In the entire history of the game only four men have won all four of the game's great titles and only two have won them all in the same year. Britain's great champion of the 1930s, Fred Perry, collected his quartet between 1933 and 1935. Then, in 1938, the red-headed Californian Don Budge, already the holder of the previous year's Wimbledon and US titles made a special journey to Australia in quest of that title. Having won it Budge proceeded to add the French Championship to his growing collection. He was now the holder of all four major titles, the feat that Sampras is trying to emulate. However, it was not until Budge had won a second Wimbledon that year and arrived in New York to defend his US title that John Kiernan, writing in the Herald Tribune, suggested that ' . . . if he wins it will be the equivalent of a bridge player scoring a grand slam in no trumps, doubled and redoubled.' Budge duly beat Gene Mako in a four-set final. From that moment the Grand Slam became the holy grail of tennis. The great Australian left-hander, Rod Laver, equalled the feat as an amateur in 1962 and repeated it seven years later in the second year of open tennis. In between, his compatriot Roy Emerson won the first of his two Wimbledon crowns in 1964 to complete his collection. Eventually Emerson would amass a record total of 12 Grand Slam singles titles, but he never held all of them at the same time. It was Laver whom Sampras most admired when he was growing up in California. At the suggestion of his first coach, Dr Pete Fischer, Sampras used to watch tapes of the great man's matches. Unconsciously perhaps, he has inherited some of Laver's most attractive qualities - modesty, shyness and a sense of history. Who might prevent Sampras from emulating his boyhood idol? Until Michael Chang won the French Open in 1989 as a 17-year-old to become the youngest-ever men's champion, no American had been successful since Tony Trabert in 1954 and 1955. Chang's victory ended the hoodoo and paved the way for Jim Courier's convincing wins in 1991 and 1992 against fellow American Andre Agassi and Petr Korda of the Czech Republic. Here, we thought, was the new strong man on clay. It was a surprise therefore when Courier, a firm favourite to become the first triple winner since Bjorn Borg (1978-1981), lost in last year's final to Bruguera of Spain after holding a break of serve in the final set. This was not the ruthless match player we had come to admire. That painful loss, and another in the Wimbledon final, seemed to knock the stuffing out of Courier who lost to the unconsidered Frenchman, Cedric Pioline in the fourth round at the US Open and finished the year poorly. His personality seemed to have changed too. He had become grumpy, supercilious and withdrawn. After a mediocre start to 1994 and another disappointing loss in Monte Carlo to the 19-year-old Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev, Courier said: 'There is no reason for me not to be happy . . . I have a career and a perfect family and the fact that I lose a tennis match isn't going to change all that . . . I just want to be happy and get rid of all that excess baggage on my shoulders. I don't care that much about the rankings. All I want to do is play my best tennis.' Which might make Jim a more likeable guy, but will rob him of the intensity that made him such a great competitor. From No 1 in the world in April last year he has slipped to No 7. Another strong contender is the holder, Bruguera, in spite of the pressures of high expectation. He must first deal with the tough Austrian left-hander Thomas Muster, who won seven titles on clay last year, or the unseeded Agassi. These two clash in an outstanding second round match. The No 2 seed, Michael Stich, has a dream draw until Chang looms in the quarters. The brilliant 20-year-old Russian, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, may reach the same round at the expense of Cedric Pioline (14) and Stefan Edberg (3) to test sixth seeded Goran Ivanisevic in the lower half. I do not see Becker, Martin or Korda having any real chance. The ladies? Steffi Graf to repeat.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: INTERNATIONAL MUSEUM OF GRAPHIC COMMUNICATION  </P> <P> The International Museum of Graphic Communication in Buena Park documents the  evolution of the printing process and provides an enjoyable tour, especially  for the visitor  </P> <P> who has made the rounds of nearby amusement parks and is seeking something more  substantial.  </P> <P> "This is a working museum," says curator Mark Barbour. "That means everything  here can be demonstrated and visitors get actively involved in what is being  presented to them. There is nothing more boring than looking at rows of old  machines, so we came up with ways to make the museum lively."  </P> <P> The 25,000-square-foot facility, opened in 1988, houses the personal collection  of Ernest A. Lindner, a Los Angeles businessman who started in the printing  business in the 1940s by reconditioning and selling used Linotype machines.  Lindner began purchasing printing presses and other tools of the trade and  gradually accumulated a collection that documents the progression of the  technology through the days of hot type to today's cold-type methods.  </P> <P> "But what happens here is that the visitor swallows the pill of education  without even realizing it," Barbour says. In its presentation of the printing  trade, the museum also provides the inescapable lessons in democracy and  freedom that intertwine with printing's rich history. "We also touch on the  evolution of business, of labor unions and inventing," Barbour adds.  </P> <P> Weekend visitors are invited to watch a live performance in the museum's  theater complex that makes the historical personalities of printing spring to  life. Johann Gutenberg, who invented movable type in 15th-Century Germany,  sings about his struggle to print the entire Bible while using his new method.  And Benjamin Franklin tells of printing's involvement in the American  Revolution.  </P> <P> A restaurant and gift shop are scheduled to open at the museum within a few  months. Future plans also include hands-on workshops in papermaking and  hand-set printing methods.  </P> <P> Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.  </P> <P> Address: 8469 Kass Drive, Buena Park  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 523-2070 or 714-523-2080 recorded information  </P></p>

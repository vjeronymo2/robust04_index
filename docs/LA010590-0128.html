			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE DRESSES CHILDREN TO MOVE IN STYLE, COMFORT AND SAFETY  </P> <P> How do you get a screaming baby to calm down and maybe even smile? Try removing  his clothing, because it just might be making him miserable, suggests Shelley  Armstrong, who recently opened Cotton Kangaroo, a children's store in Pasadena  for infants to children Size 7.  </P> <P> Armstrong opened the store because she had difficulty finding the kind of  clothes that made her children happy. Now she is running a one-woman campaign  to teach parents how to dress their children for maximum comfort.  </P> <P> "There is a science to this. The wrong clothes may even interfere with a baby's  development," warns Armstrong.  </P> <P> For example, when your baby is around 4 months old and begins to roll,  protruding buttons or decorations will hurt and encumber him. Some babies will  even give up trying to roll if the clothes are binding, she says.  </P> <P> Armstrong believes children of all ages need clothing that allows complete  freedom of movement. But as small children's motor skills develop, their  clothing needs change. To help parents choose the appropriate items, she offers  the following tips in her informal classes held twice a month and free of  charge at the store:  </P> <P> INFANTS: Babies need to be able to explore with their hands, so avoid outfits  with attached mittens. If you are using mittens to prevent the baby from  scratching himself, try a simple manicure instead. Overuse of mittens inhibits  children learning how to use their hands, Armstrong says.  </P> <P> Dress your baby in the same number of layers of clothes that you are wearing;  it is a great misconception that babies get cold more easily than adults.  </P> <P> Make sure that buttons are sewn on securely, so that your child cannot pull  them off and pop them in his mouth.  </P> <P> CRAWLERS: This is the time when children can become the most encumbered by  their clothing. They get tangled in skirts, dresses and loose-fitting pants.  Armstrong recommends pants with elastic around the bottom of the legs to ensure  the knees have some padding and to prevent the child from crawling out of the  clothes. The knees take a lot of abuse at this stage of development so it is  wise to keep them covered to prevent chapping.  </P> <P> Make sure neck and arm openings are large enough for comfort. Some young  children wonder if they are going to get stuck in turtlenecks while putting  them on. If possible, children should try them on in the store to ensure proper  fit.  </P> <P> TODDLERS: Children need and like to learn how to dress themselves, so buy  clothes that ease the process. Elasticized pants and uncomplicated pullovers  without buttons and zippers are best. Mark the sides of your child's shoes so  that he can distinguish left from right.  </P></p>

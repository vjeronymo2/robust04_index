Nigmatulin. V.N. Blinkov, O.I. Melikov, and </F> P.G. Gakal, Elektrogorsk Scientific Testing Station; UDC  532.529.5]    [Abstract] The flow of a boiling coolant through parallel  heat exchanger channels in a reactor core is analyzed for  stability on the basis of the 1P2T1W (P-pressure, T-temperatures  of liquid and vapor respectively, W-velocity). The equations of  this mathematical model are one-dimensional first-order partial  differential equations describing the flow of kinetics of a  two-phase stream including its one-phase segment and the laws of  mass-energy-momentum conservation in such a channel with  appropriate boundary conditions. These equations are integrated  numerically by the method of finite differences, the four sought  variables being: pressure, temperature of the liquid, velocity  of the stream, and the volume fraction of vapor. Friction at the  channel walls is described by simple correlations for a  homogeneous liquid, as a function of the Reynolds number. The  interphase heat transfer is assumed to be sufficiently intense  for disregarding the small thermal unbalance between the phases.  The boundary conditions are: constant pressure at the outlet;  given temperature and flow rate of entering coolant. Both bubble  boiling and film boiling during the flow are considered, the  boundary between both modes in the stream being defined in terms  of the critical heat flux as a function of the mass fraction of  vapor within its subcritical range. Calculations made without  applying the Courant condition reveal an onset of instability  and its subsequent evolution by a mechanism associated with heat  load changes under a constant pressure head and the consequences  thereof. As stabilizing factors are identified friction at the  wall and heat transfer from it to the entering one-phase stream  segment. The combination of these factors with thermal inertia  of channel wall, hydrodynamic losses due to flow rate and  attendant density perturbations as well as due to friction and  internal drag within the two-phase stream segment will determine  the flow dynamics. The adiabatic one-phase stream segment is  replaced with an equivalent hydrodynamic drag element. Both  heated and two-phase stream segments are subdivided into equally  thick discrete slices. The calculations have been made for an  actual system with a circulation pump and six parallel identical  parallel heat exchanger channels between a common collector  followed by six throttles and a common separator for preceded by  six throttles, the coolant flowing as follows: 1. liquid  entering the collector, 2. liquid-vapor mixture entering the  separator, 3. liquid alone returns to the pump after passage  through the heat exchanger. The stabilizing effect of a digital  Bernoulli flow rate meter on the inlet side has also been  evaluated, on the basis of calculation of the flow rate as a  function time with and without such a device in the circulation  loop.

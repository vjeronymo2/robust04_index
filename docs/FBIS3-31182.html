He described as strange the allegations of 24 CHASA  -- the daily of the largest circulation in Bulgaria, about his  prediction of a Balkan war and Bulgaria's involvement in it.  Last Thursday [10 February] 24 CHASA reported of a statement  made by General Asparukhov at a closed door session of the  Parliamentary National Security Committee that "air strikes in  Bosnia pose the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national security  in 50 years." "This is the first time in 50 years that war is  being waged near Bulgaria's borders and this fact should not be  neglected and should keep us on our guard," the Bulgarian  intelligence chief said tonight. He called the allegations of  24 CHASA that his views on Bulgaria's attitude to the  Yugo-crisis differ from those of Deputy Defence Minister Boyko  Noev mere speculation.    "Bulgaria has always been for a peaceful solution of the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov said in Panorama in response to a question on  possible air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. He recalled  that the first section of NATO's resolution of February 9 sets  the peaceful solution of the crisis as the principal goal of the  organization. If NATO's decision for air strikes against the  Bosnian Serbs is brought into operation, there should be  guarantees that there will be no casualties among the civilian  population and that these air strikes will not lead to a spread  of the conflict, Foreign Minister Daskalov said.    According to a regular poll among 100 prominent Bulgarian  journalists, less than 8 percent believe that there will be air  strikes in Bosnia, 84 percent do not believe this, and 8 percent  are not sure.</p>

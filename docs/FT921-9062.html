			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Honda criticises US over ruling on Canada plant HONDA, the Japanese car maker, has angrily protested against a US government ruling that cars assembled at its Ontario plant fail to comply with the duty-free threshold of the US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA). A Honda Canada official said yesterday the plant was currently operating at full capacity and would not be affected by the ruling for the moment. The decision could result in a 2.5 per cent duty being imposed on Honda Civics shipped to the US, which accounts for about three-quarters of its annual output of 100,000 vehicles. The dispute, involving the application of the FTA's complex rules of origin to the Civic, is becoming one of the most vehement trade rows between Washington and Ottawa in recent years. Besides concern that the ruling could discourage future Japanese automotive investment in Canada, it is also likely to increase public pressure on the government to reconsider its participation in the current round of talks with Mexico on a North American free trade area (Nafta). A Canadian official indicated yesterday that the Honda dispute had emphasised the need for tighter and clearer rules of origin in the Nafta pact. Canada is likely to refer the Honda ruling to a bilateral dispute settlement panel. Honda's US subsidiary concludes in a letter sent to US Customs Commissioner, Mrs Carol Hallett, earlier this week that it 'is only the first of many Canadian manufacturers who will face irrational and absurd interpretations of the FTA by Customs, essentially nullifying much of the benefits of that treaty for Canada'. The FTA allows cars built in Canada to be imported duty-free to the US provided they have a minimum North American content of 50 per cent. The dispute centres on what constitutes local content. While Canada issued rules-of-origin guidelines to the automotive industry in 1988, the US only produced guidelines last month. According to Honda, most of the US guidelines 'take the opposite position from those adopted by Canada, although both are interpreting the same FTA language'. For instance, the Customs Service has disallowed spending on worker health and safety as well as environmental protection on the grounds that they are not 'directly incurred' in producing cars.</p>

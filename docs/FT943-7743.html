			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Shots fired to discourage refugee flood A Zairean paratrooper fires into the air to discourage thousands of Rwandan refugees from crossing the Ruzizi bridge into Zaire yesterday. The refugees, mainly Hutus who fear reprisals from Rwanda's Tutsi-led government, had earlier watched evacuating French troops cross the bridge before the border was closed to halt the flow of people into the refugee camps at Bukavu. Later, the tension eased when a bridge 15 miles away was opened as a crossing point. Panic as French quit Rwanda, Page 4</p>

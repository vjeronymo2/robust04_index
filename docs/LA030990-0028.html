			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LITTLEST INTERPRETERS' GROW UP FAST, BUT THE BENEFITS CAN BE MANY  </P> <P> My family came to this country from Hong Kong in 1975 when I was 11. No one of  the four in the family spoke English.  </P> <P> With a younger brother who has chronic asthma and a mother who has a congenital  heart problem, I can claim to have made the rounds to all the major hospitals  in L.A., translating all sorts of symptoms from Chinese to English.  </P> <P> On one trip to the gynecologist's office for my mother's annual exam, the  doctor, male, asked, "How often do you and your husband have sexual  intercourse?" I thought, "Yeah, I'm going to ask my mom that?" I looked at my  mom, and she's waiting to find out what this next question was, and I said to  the doctor, "They don't." The doctor looked at me -- age 13 and blushing in  tomato red -- and went on to an easier question.  </P> <P> Children such as Adriana, Claudia, Faustino and Iran are often exposed to many  situations adults handle by themselves. From my own experience, this exposure  makes growing up fast. And I can't say it's bad. The little interpreters get a  firsthand look at what the adult world is about.  </P> <P> LILY Y. LEE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

Nearly three years ago when the USSR still existed the jets  arrived in the city of Baranovichi for repairs. They could not  be sent back because of the UN embargo that was imposed after  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    Tushinsky said that they jets could be taken over by Russia  when the former USSR's military hardware was divided between its  republics but Russia did not want them.</p>

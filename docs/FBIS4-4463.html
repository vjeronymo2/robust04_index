			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Le Xuan Tung: "Some Thoughts on the Danger of </F> Disorientation From Socialism in the Renovation Process"]    [Text] At the Seventh National Party Congress [SNPC], with  a fine capacity for planning and making correct forecasts, our  party referred to one of the first experiences of the renovation  as: "We must maintain the socialist direction in the renovation  process." At that time, this experience was mainly aimed at  criticizing manifestations which denied the achievements  recorded by socialist regimes and considered that socialism has  all type of inevitable shortcomings. These manifestations will  distract us on the goal and path to socialism in our country.  The origin of these manifestations lay in the fact that  socialism was facing great difficulties in Eastern Europe and  the USSR and our country was in a critical socioeconomic crisis.    At present, after three years of implementing the SNPC  resolution, we have recorded very important achievements both in  national issues and external affairs. The stature and strength  of our revolution is improving. An absolute majority of our  people have increased their confidence in the party and state's  line and policy, the socialist path, and the bright national  future.    However, we still have many shortcomings, weaknesses, and  newly arising problems. One of the newly arising problems, as  mentioned in the political report of the Mid-term National Party  Conference, is "the danger of disorientation from socialism if  deviations in the line and policy and in the implementation of  the line and policy are not overcome". This also proves that  the lesson "We must firmly maintain the socialist direction in  the renovation process" mentioned in the SNPC is still correct.  On the other hand, this lesson has a new application,  reflecting the real situation in recent years: that is, in  addition to our fine and correct actions, we must be vigilant to  prevent the danger of disorientation from socialism in the  renovation process.    Does this danger exist? Is it a real danger or an  exaggeration?. Is it contradictory when we mention the danger of  disorientation at the same time as referring to our achievements  of the past years, because these achievements are the result of  the correct line and policy and the efficient execution of our  line and policy in life? Looking squarely at the truth, we must  admit that the danger is real. That is not an exaggeration.    To say that our entire renovation undertaking, from all  socioeconomic platforms and strategies to the line and policy  and their implementation, is disorientated is totally incorrect  and not in conformity with our great achievements. But it is  also not correct if we say that everything has been fine,  without chaos and confusion in any field or anywhere, and that  we do not need an alarm about any danger. The truth is that, in  the process of organizing the implementation of the renovation  line, deviations, mistakes, and shortcomings have emerged. If  we do not sufficiently prevent and overcome them with suitable  measures, then who dare say that in the future the  disorientation will not become bigger with unpredictable results?    Manifestations of disorientation have appeared, are  appearing, and possibly will appear in the fields of the  economy, politics, theory, ideology, culture, society, cadre  organization.    There will be stronger manifestations of disorientation  appearing in the implementation process due to an incorrect  understanding of the line and policy.    Manifestations of disorientation may also appear in the  process of outlining practical guidelines and policies to  execute the socioeconomic platforms and strategies.    Manifestations of disorientation can not only appear in  people who doubt our national advancement path. It is worth  noting the possibility of unconscious disorientation in our  cadres -- though we have no doubt about their loyalty to the  regime -- due to their poor understanding, bureaucratism, and  lack of responsibility in their work.    Negativism, especially corruption, is a fertile ground for  those who act against the socialist direction and overlook the  most correct line and policy for money.    Disorientation occurs on two sides: left and right. Both  sides will cause damage. At present, we have to pay more  attention to the rightist disorientation, especially when  external forces are trying to impose this type of disorientation  on us for their "peaceful evolution" goal.    It is difficult to fully cover all the types of  disorientation within the limitations of an article. The  disorientation from socialism has appeared at different levels.  The economy is one of the fields that has shown such a sign.    In this field, there is no less incorrect understanding and  wrong action, especially in the market economy. Some opinions  have it that, in the market economy, capitalism and socialism  are just the same with no differences, and speaking of the  market economy under the socialist direction is coercive.    In fact, in both theoretical and practical contexts, the  socialism-oriented market economy bears both similarities and  differences to the capitalist market economy. Being  market-driven economies, they both use the market as the basic  tool in distributing and consuming economic resources; prices  are to be determined in accordance with the rules of value and  supply and demand; competition replaces monopoly; economic units  are to be independent in production and business operations;  production elements must circulate in the market, and different  types of markets will come into existence.    The difference between the two is for whose interests state  intervention in a market economy is supposed to serve -- for the  laboring people or for the exploiting minority. Production  resources ownership is another difference. In socialism, the  all- people and the collective ownership have gradually become  the basic concepts, and the state-run economic sector is a  leading element in a multisectoral economy where ownership is  displayed in various forms. In distribution, socialism uses  labor as the main criterium.    These differences are domains where disorientation from  socialism in the economy occurs.    Can we afford to continue to leave the situation as it is  now  regarding the heavily differentiated prices between industrial  products and services, and agricultural products? Prices  reflect economic relations and relations of interest. The  existing price scale puts peasants in a disadvantaged position.  While carrying out recent operations in various localities,  many state trading establishments and trading cooperatives left  the battlefield open to private traders in a number of areas  such as production supplies, fertilizers, some agricultural  products -- rice, coffee grain, pepper grain, coconut -- thus  causing losses not only to producers but also consumers. These  practices cause harm to the relations within the worker-peasant  alliance. It also shows how important the state regulatory role  is for a market economy.    Development of a multisectoral merchandise economy is the  main concern in the renovation process of our party. We have  completely eliminated the antipathy, prejudice, and prohibition  against private capitalist and individual economic sectors, thus  creating conditions for all production forces to develop for the  sake of the country and the people. But deviations have come.  Many people are now advocating the privatization of the  economy, considering it the only path for the economy to take  off. Equitization is also being seen as privatization. The  various forms of production resources ownership are being  regarded only as the means for economic development, and it is  not essential to pay attention to the difference between state  and collective ownership.    These are the points that a number of foreign forces would  like to see developed in our country. The CHRISTIAN SCIENCE  MONITOR journal in last January's edition carried an article by  an overseas author saying: "The key of the political reforms in  Vietnam lies with the private business sector.... The  Vietnamese communists have braved all military attacks from the  French and the Americans, but they cannot survive for long with  the positive conditions created by private business." That  shows too well what they want.    We all know that each society possesses not only the  ownership forms it inherited from the society which existed  before it, but it also has its own ownership relations which  constitute particularities of that society. This is also true  for our society. While we encourage the development of other  economic sectors, we cannot pay any less attention to the  consolidation and development of the role of state-owned,  collective, and cooperative economic sectors.    Consolidation does not mean disorderly development without  control and consideration for consequences. And development of  the sectors does not mean we have to increase the proportion of  these sectors to the highest percentages in all domains of  industry and trade. Reality shows that we have not done enough  to keep the state-managed business sector worthy of its leading  role in production and distribution. Again, to encougage  development of the state-managed business is not to compensate  losses and subsidize it from the national budget, as we used to  do before. The same principle applies with the collective and  cooperative economic sectors.    Among all agricultural cooperatives countrywide, only 12  percent of them satisfactorily operate. The operation of small  business and handicraft cooperatives has been mostly  spontaneous, leading to the current uncontrollable chain  collapse of these cooperatives. In Hanoi alone where there used  to be over 70,000 cooperative members, we now have less than one  tenth of that figure. We do not want to maintain old-styled  small business and handicraft cooperatives since they are no  longer fit to exist. Cooperatives need to be revived with new  vitality, and the state plays important role in this task. We  should not use the simplistic distinction between state and  nonstate business establishments as an excuse for neglecting  these economic sectors, as the party platform clearly  stipulates: The state and collective economic sectors are the  foundation of the national economy.    Nonetheless, there is still much room for improvement. It is  not our policy to apply an equal income distribution system  because such a move would destroy the motives behind production  and business operations. At the same time, we do not accept a  very wide income gap, especially when it comes to income  illegally earned. According to investigation results, nearly 18  percent of the households in the countryside and in  high-altitude, remote, or former revolutionary base areas are  still listed as poor. The average value of the assets of rich  family members stands at 60 million dong each whereas that of  poor family members in the countryside is less than one million  dong each. In many cases, people who have made the most  meritorious contributions to the revolution survivors of fallen  combatants, war invalids, members of the Armed Forces, retirees  are also the very persons who experience the greatest  difficulties in life. There are some business sectors which  generate very high income compared with the general level of  income distribution in society. There are many cases in which  "some people have more than they need whereas others do not know  how to make ends meet." This phenomenon is at variance with the  nature of our society. If we do not work out appropriate  measures to deal with this situation, the gap between the rich  and the poor will be widened and social conflicts will increase  in intensity. Here, the role of the state as a regulator is of  great important significance.    Some people maintain that because we opt for the market  economy, we must accept its negative aspects. It is true that  besides positive aspects, the market economy also displays many  negative phenomena. Nonetheless, this does not necessarily mean  that we must adopt a negative attitude. Instead, we must  persist in our struggle to limit, contain, and gradually  eliminate those negative aspects from social life. This  undertaking requires much manpower and time. As far as the  market economy is concerned, money has a very great role and  effect. Nonetheless, there is no way we can accept a lifestyle  in which we do anything to get money, regarding it as "God," and  worse still, let it affect our conscience, honor, and human  dignity. We may not use the market mechanism or customers'  taste to justify our attempts to commercialize cultural and  artistic activities. This would give rise to the development of  unhealthy cultural and artistic activities. Realities indicate  that such incidents have occurred. We may not interpret the  elimination of the state subsidization system in a simplistic  and indiscriminate manner. We may not use openness and cultural  exchanges with the outside world as a pretext for allowing  miscellaneous and harmful publications to penetrate our country.  Such phenomenon have occurred. Prompted by goodwill, a foreign  friend warned us: If you do not take timely counter-measures,  you will be subjected to a massive invasion by material  civilization. Nothing is more frightening than cultural  invasion. You have won the war for national defense, which was  rife with difficulties. Yet, in my opinion, that war is easier  compared with the war on the cultural front in the days ahead.  You should remember that if you lose your culture, you will  lose our country as well. That poses a real danger if we do not  heighten vigilance.    We must guard against disorientation even in party-building  work. Disorientation occurs if party organizations belittle  their leadership role and the principles governing democratic  centralism, collective leadership and individual responsibility,  and criticism and self-criticism. It also occurs when there is  a lax observance of discipline and a low sense of unity and  singlemindedness. If party organizations fail to assume their  role as political nucleus, other political and ideological  concepts will fill the gap. Of course, if party organizations  take charge of everything, give orders to everybody, and fail to  respect the law and other operating procedures of mass  organizations, then that is another form of disorientation. It  is the very objective of the current movement to renovate and  revamp the party to overcome both of those two forms of  disorientation.    It is necessary to point out that it is not easy to set a  clear cut boundary between socialist disorientation and a firm  grasp of socialist orientations at the initial stage. This is  particularly true with the renovation process when things do not  take well-defined forms at an early stage of development.  Instead, this process requires time, research, and experiments  before correct conclusions can be reached. Only by stepping up  efforts to inspect, review, and draw experiences from real life  situations as well as rectify mistakes can we overcome  irregularities.</p>

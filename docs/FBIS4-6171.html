			<p>BFN     [Text] Hiroshima, April 15 KYODO -- The Japan Atomic  Industrial Forum ended Friday [15 April] a three-day conference  in Hiroshima, the world's first atom-bombed city, with a  declaration affirming its opposition to nuclear weapons.    On the final day, delegates debated the development of  nuclear energy in the Asian region and the effects of  radioactivity.    A declaration issued at the closing affirmed the delegates'  opposition to nuclear weapons. It also called for continued  efforts by countries involved in dismantling nuclear weapons and  the development of research into technology aimed at making the  peaceful use of nuclear energy safer.    At a news conference after the conference, Takashi Mukaibo,  chairman of the forum that promotes peaceful use of atomic  energy, said the group came to Hiroshima "to learn." About  1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad took part  in the 27th annual conference.    Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), told delegates the IAEA will hold a  special meeting on April 21 and 22 in Vienna to discuss the  Chernobyl nuclear reactors in Ukraine. Chernobyl was the scene  of one of the world's most serious nuclear accidents in 1986.    Antinuclear activists protested the gathering around the  conference hall in central Hiroshima.    Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing  during the closing days of World War II.</p>

The proposed rule requires the Bank in its AHP implementation plan to define more specifically each of the five other objectives categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for satisfying each category. For each category, the Bank shall award the maximum number of points allowable for such category to the application(s) that best achieve(s) the objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted and awarded points on a declining scale basis. The five other objectives categories are set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) AHP subsidy per unit. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award points to applications based on the extent to which the project proposes to use the least amount of AHP subsidy per AHP-subsidized unit. Projects should be scored relative to each other; however, owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as one group and rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group. This scoring criterion may not include a leveraging criterion whereby the application is scored based on the percentage of the project's total development cost that is to be financed with the AHP subsidy. This replaces the effectiveness criterion that can receive a maximum of 15 points in the existing scoring methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Applicant participation. An application can receive a maximum of five points for this category. The Bank shall award points to applications based on the extent to which the project involves participation by applicants other than the receipt of a subsidized advance or direct subsidy under the AHP. Such participation can be financial or non-financial, including but not limited to debt or equity financing of the project, grants to the project, applicant involvement on the boards of nonprofit sponsors, and applicant provision of technical assistance to the nonprofit sponsors for the project. This is a new scoring criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Community involvement. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award points to applications based on the extent to which there is demonstrated support for the project by local community organizations and individuals other than as project sponsors, such as through the commitment by such organizations and individuals of funds, goods and services, and volunteer labor. The Banks should not award points for this category based solely on the number of letters of support received for the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Community stability. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s) maximize(s) community stability, such as by: committing to maintain a greater long-term period pursuant to &sect;960.5; revitalizing vacant or abandoned properties or being integrally part of a neighborhood stabilization plan, if such revitalization or stabilization is not identified as a special needs category by the Bank pursuant to &sect;960.10(d)(3)(iii); and not displacing low- or moderate-income households, or if such displacement will occur, indicating how such households will be assisted to minimize the impact of such displacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Innovation. An application can receive a maximum of five points for this category. This is a reduction from 10 points under the existing regulation. The Bank shall award points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s) involve(s) a particularly new or unusual approach, either financial or non-financial, for meeting the requirements of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Modifications of Approved AHP Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.11(a) of the proposed rule provides that an applicant that seeks a modification of an approved AHP application before completion and occupancy of the project must submit a request for such modification in writing to the Bank for review and approval. A modification is any change that affects or could potentially affect the material facts under which the application was originally evaluated and scored. Modifications are changes in the specifics of an application such as requests for additional AHP subsidy or changes in approved income targeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.11(b) of the proposed rule provides that a request for a modification of an approved AHP application must include, at a minimum:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

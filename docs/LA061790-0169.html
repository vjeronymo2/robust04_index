			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EL DORADO COUNTY;  </P> <P> WATER RELEASE INTO STREAMS CONTINUED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has been ordered to continue  releasing water into four Mono Lake streams that have suffered damage from  diversions into the city's aqueduct. El Dorado County Superior Court Judge  Terrence Finney ruled on behalf of the National Audubon Society and Mono Lake  Committee, which had said Los Angeles' diversions through the years have  eliminated fisheries and streamside flora.  </P> <P> Los Angeles was required by earlier rulings to give up part of its water supply  to restore the streams and Mono Lake. But the new order details the minimum  flows Los Angeles must maintain down Parker, Walker, Lee Vining and Rush  creeks. A hearing to set the minimum water level of Mono Lake also is set to  begin June 19.  </P></p>

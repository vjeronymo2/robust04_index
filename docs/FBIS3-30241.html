			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of </F> Democrats of the Slovak Republic and former foreign minister, by  Jana Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "What Was Lexa  Doing in Yugoslavia?"]    [Text] [Pankovcinova] What information do you have about  the purpose of Ivan Lexa's visit to the former Yugoslavia in the  fall of 1992?    [Knazko] I found out after the fact that Mr. Lexa had gone  to Yugoslavia with the blessing of the prime minister. I never  found out anything about the purpose of this visit and no report  was ever written about it. Thus, the government resolution  according to which every government member--anyone who was in  any way involved in Slovak foreign policy--is obliged within 14  days of returning from a visit to submit a report on it was  infringed.    [Pankovcinova] However, Mr. Lexa was not a government  member, neither a minister nor a state secretary, at that time.  Did this resolution apply to him?    [Knazko] He was head of the Slovak Government Office at that  time and this resolution applied to him if he went there with  the blessing of the prime minister. Without his blessing, of  course, he could not have gone there.    [Pankovcinova] Why did you not say anything about this  before?    [Knazko] I did. I wrote a letter to the prime minister, but  I did not receive a reply. This was not the only instance.  Later, I also informed the press about visits that were not  discussed in advance with the Foreign Ministry--for example,  when the prime minister was in Germany or Austria without the  knowledge of the deputy prime minister and foreign minister. We  never received a report at the Foreign Ministry on these visits  by the prime minister.    [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 27 January on page  2, under the headline "A Question for Ivan Lexa," carries the  following 100-word "(SD)"-signed question and Lexa's response:    "In a speech delivered to the National Council of the Slovak  Republic, M. Knazko indirectly described you as the person the  prime minister sent to the former Yugoslavia in the fall of 1992  without the knowledge of the Foreign Ministry. Do you have  anything to say to this?    "Lexa: No comment."]</p>

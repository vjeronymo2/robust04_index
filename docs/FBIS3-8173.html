			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Milos Antic: "Lasso in the Hands of Indecisive </F> Authorities"]    [Text] The question whether Ibrahim Rugova -- the  president of the so-called republic of Kosovo, the chairman of  the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, and the chairman of two  coordination committees of Albanian political parties from  Kosovo and other territories of the former Yugoslavia -- will be  arrested is becoming increasingly interesting in Kosovo.    Not so much because the Party of Serbian Unity promised on  two occasions that Rugova "would be arrested," or "that the  Party of Serbian Unity would find ways and means to bring Rugova  to court if the present political leadership of the country did  not do so," but because 11 members of his Defense Ministry have  already been arrested. Rugova established an army of 40,000  soldiers, armed it, and prepared it for "the liberation of the  republic of Kosova."    There have been rumors about his detention since the time  when he became chairman of the Albanian movement for the  "republic of Kosovo." It is claimed, however, that the Serbian  leadership opposed his detention as long as his activity was  only verbal. The leadership tolerated his activities as long as  he founded ministries of education, health, culture, sports, and  such, which were not considered dangerous, but after it became  known that he had also established a defense ministry that  worked on establishing an army, things changed.    The name Ibrahim Rugova is not mentioned in the indictment  against the 11 members of the Defense Ministry. Anton Koljaj,  his deputy, who is now on the run, is charged with the  establishment of the ministry, but it is stated that it was  established according to the instructions of the Democratic  Alliance of Kosovo.    The attorney general was asked by journalists whether Rugova  would also be arrested, and he answered that "the authorities in  charge were doing their job, that they were collecting facts and  that only those people whom it was proved that they were engaged  in illegal activities would be charged." Rugova can still  perform his political activities freely, he is still receiving  foreign delegations and is going on visits abroad, where he can  meet Bujar Bukoshi, the prime minister in exile, and try to  achieve recognition of the "republic of Kosovo." He also wants  Kosovo to become an international protectorate, as a  transitional period for secession from Serbia and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia.    Whether Rugova will be arrested depends on the outcome of  the  trial against the 11 members of the Defense Ministry, which is  still not known. Apart from that, everybody knows that the  Albanian police exist, but proof has to be found. It would also  be enough to arrest Rugova.    There is another aspect of the "Rugova case." It is believed  that there is more than enough proof for his detention, but "the  present authorities must not do it because of the international  community." Rugova has the image of a democrat and a man  fighting for his aims with political means, so that his  detention would upset the international community and affect the  already unfavorable position of Serbia.    Some people even think that the detention of Rugova's  assistants and followers who were arrested for arms smuggling  has the goal of making Rugova flee abroad, so that the present  authorities do not have to arrest him. This would also have an  additional effect. The Democratic Alliance of Kosovo would be  dissolved, which would weaken the Albanian movement.    The recent detentions of the illegal defense ministry  members  and the undermining of weapons supplies made it clear that  illegal Albanian institutions would be treated more severely.  It remains to be seen who has better nerves, the present  Serbian leadership in tolerating Rugova's activities, or Rugova,  who relies on international support and "indecisive Serbian  authorities." When asked several days ago to comment on the  announcement of his detention, Rugova answered: "I am here,  they may come." This statement was interpreted as a provocation  of the Serbian authorities, because Rugova pretended that he  wanted to be arrested and tried, since this would make him "a  living martyr."</p>

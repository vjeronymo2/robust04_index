			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Rate-cut hopes kept alive as Bundesbank eases repo THE small drop in the Bundesbank's rate for 14-day securities repurchase agreements and a slowdown in German money supply growth kept rate-cut hopes alive, lifting prices in the German bond market and most of its European neighbours. Initially, traders were disappointed by the three basis-point drop in the repo rate to 6.67 per cent and the 7.0 per cent September M3 rate following market talk of a repo easing of up to 10 basis points and M3 around 6 per cent. However, the Bundesbank's conciliatory tone on inflation and its liquidity injection at the repo were seen to indicate more near-term easing. 'It reinforces our view that they want to steer the repo rate lower in the next few weeks,' said Mr Craig Shute, bond market analyst with Bear Stearns. However, most market participants did not expect the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council to cut key rates today. FRENCH bonds dipped on disappointment over the small German repo easing, which was seen to give the Bank of France little room to cut rates at today's repo. However, prices remained underpinned by Bunds' strength and the December notional bond contract ended 0.18 point higher at 124.70. UK gilts continued Tuesday's rally, lifted by the German repo drop and by UK economic data which underpin hopes for non-inflationary growth. The long gilt contract hit another high at 115 7/32 and closed at 115 3/16 , up  5/8 on the day. The Bank of England announced the sale of Pounds 400m in tranches of existing index-linked bonds for dealing from today: Pounds 150m of the 2 1/2 per cent stock due 2003 and Pounds 250m of 2 1/2 per cent stock due 2020. DANISH bonds rose sharply on fresh easing hopes, with the 10-year benchmark bond rising 0.60 point to 111.27. Its yield gap over bunds shrank to 54 basis points from 59 on Tuesday. SPANISH bonds posted sharp gains as the currency's strength and the German repo easing spurred hopes for further cuts in Spanish interest rates. The Bonos contract in Madrid rose 0.58 point to 103.65. AT its first government bond auction, Luxembourg sold LFr3.845bn of 6.5 per cent bonds due October 2003. The weighted average auction yield was 6.185 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds hit six-year highs, spurred by heavy institutional buying and the drop in the three-month certificate-of-deposit rate to a record low of 2.40 per cent - some 10 basis points below overnight money rates. The December JGB futures contract rose 0.54 point to 113.74. US Treasury prices were mixed in light trading volume yesterday following the afternoon announcement of the Treasury note auct-ions. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 106, yielding 5.819 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.823 per cent. Longer-dated securities eased slightly at the opening in response to rising gold prices, but quickly regained their losses and moved into positive territory amid talk of further buying of Treasuries by municipal authorities refinancing their bond issues at lower rates. Otherwise, the focus of dealers and investors' attention was on the afternoon unveiling of the next round of note auctions. As expected, the Treasury announced it would sell Dollars 16.5bn of two-year notes and Dollars 11bn of five-year notes next week.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / People: Opportunity for Naish Peter Naish, former chairman of the National Federation of Housing Associations, was yesterday appointed as the new chief executive of the Equal Opportunities Commission. He succeeds Valerie Amos who left a year before the end of her contract to pursue other interests. It was understood that she had some difficulty in developing a good personal relationship with Kamlesh Bahl who took over the commission's chair in June. The job of chief executive - which attracted 150 applications - is mainly a management one of implementing policy, with the role of lobbying the government, developing a public profile and making policy resting with the chair.</p>

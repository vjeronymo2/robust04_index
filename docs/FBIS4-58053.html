			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, April 29 (AFP) -- The danger of  further bloody clashes between rival Yemeni troops eased Friday  [29 April] after a southern armoured brigade retreated to the  mountains around 'Imran north of Sanaa, scene of fierce tank  battles which left more than 100 dead.    Military officials of the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party  (YSP) said the 1,200 troops pulled out after reinforcements of  northern troops, including elite Republican Guards, arrived at  'Imran, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Sanaa.    Yemeni journalists who visited the scene said the northern  troops gained the upper hand in the fighting which began on  Wednesday, and the southern forces sought refuge with an allied  tribe, the Bakil.    YSP officials described the southern forces' retreat as a  "brilliant tactical manoeuvre," which avoided unnecessary  casualties.    President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih blamed south Yemeni  "secessionists" for the fighting, which also left 200 people  injured, and warned them to halt the provocations.    The official SABA' news agency said Salih, visiting northern  troops wounded in the clashes, appealed to the southerners "to  see reason and to adopt peaceful dialogue as a means of  resolving differences."    A pro-YSP newspaper, October 14, said Friday northern troops  based in the south were reinforcing their positions.    "The (northern) al-'Amaliqah brigade is stocking up with  weapons and ammunition in order to tighten its grip on Abyan  province and a key point commanding eastern the gateway to  Aden," the paper said.

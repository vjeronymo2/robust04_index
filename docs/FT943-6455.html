			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Credit squeeze leaves China lower - The Emerging Investor After a burst of activity earlier this month, which sent share prices rocketing, China's fledgling stock markets have slid back under the weight of negative economic news and poor interim results for listed companies. Shanghai's B-share index for foreign investors is down by about 6 per cent from its month's high, finishing last week at 77.71. A-shares for local investors have also slipped. Foreign brokers say that a credit squeeze, imposed last year to calm an overheating economy, is continuing to have a negative impact on company earnings, and circumstances seem unlikely to improve in the short term. Government anti-inflation efforts were set back by a jump in retail prices in July after the rate of price increases appeared to be slowing. Another worrying development was a leap in capital spending in July, in spite of government attempts to restrain investment in fixed assets as part of its anti-inflation strategy. While sentiment among foreign investors had improved in recent months, poor results for the six months to June, combined with uncertainties over the economy, are certain to be giving fund managers pause for thought. In Shanghai, Mr Paul Vibert, an analyst at Baring Securities, said the outlook was still very shaky. The B-share index - B-shares are denominated in yuan but are traded in US and Hong Kong dollars - had picked itself off the floor, after falling by about 40 per cent this year. It is now down by about 22 per cent for the year. Brokers had expected B-shares to recover their lost ground by the end of 1994, the index finishing at about 100, where it began the year. This now seems difficult in the light of faltering performances by many of the 28 listed B-share companies. Earnings, even allowing for excessively optimistic revenue projections for newly-listed stocks, were little short of disastrous with a couple of notable exceptions, including Pilkington Glass, whose performances matched expectations. At least half the B-share companies failed to achieve targets, and in a number of cases, such as Forever Bicycle, earnings were much less than forecast. The worst performing sectors were textile machinery and other light industrial equipment. China's problems with 'triangular debt' - the inability of one faltering enterprise to pay another for goods and services - have almost certainly contributed to the poor results. Underlining a slowdown after this month's almost frenzied burst of activity, with the A-share index more than doubling after the authorities intervened to prop-up a collapsing market, is the fall in trading volumes. Last week volume was down to between Yn3bn and Yn4bn compared with a daily turnover of Yn10-12bn two weeks ago. In the light of a tricky period ahead for the government economically, with pressures intensifying for stronger medicine to curb inflation, stock market activity seems likely to continue to be subdued. But brokers believe a melt-down similar to last year's when disappointed local investors deserted the market, is unlikely, especially if the authorities continue to extend credit to securities houses and also maintain a ban on new listings. Heavy buying by local institutions is believed to have been behind the recent surge in A-shares. 'The A-share market appears to be consolidating a little bit,' said Mr Vibert. 'Local investors appear to have regained confidence.' For the B-share market, the picture is different in that external factors are almost as important for market sentiment as local developments. The market performance of Hong Kong-listed mainland companies, so-called H-shares, has a direct bearing on the demand for B-shares. The perception of China investments is also being guided by the reception given to a dribble of Chinese listings in New York. The initial reaction could at best be described as wary. Both the A and B markets are continuing to be bedevilled by confusion over the regulation of China's markets. The China Securities Regulatory Commission is nominally in charge, but other bodies such as the People's Bank of China, the central bank, and State Council, the cabinet, are also involved. Co-ordination is poor. In the absence of a securities law, defining regulatory responsibilities, uncertainty prevails.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Friday     Week on week change Stock                      Country      26/8/94    Dollars      %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TPI Polene                 Thailand     10.7329     1.5237     16.55 HM Sampoerna               Indonesia     9.9299     1.2802     14.80 Daewoo Heavy Industries    S Korea      18.7067     2.4071     14.77 Ege Biracilik              Turkey        3.6254     0.4472     14.07 Vitro                      Mexico        7.7115     0.9393     13.87 Investimentos Itau (Pfd)   Brazil        0.6532     0.0709     12.17 Companhia Suzano (Pfd)     Brazil        5.1295     0.5382     11.72 Banco Frances              Argentina    10.2510     1.0674     11.62 Putra Surya Perkasa        Indonesia     1.3792     0.1418     11.46 Eletrobras                 Brazil        0.4178     0.0427     11.37  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

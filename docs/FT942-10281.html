			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew sets up new joint venture Smith &amp; Nephew, the medical goods company, has made the first of what could be a series of investments in the biotechnology sector by setting up a joint venture to develop a product for what it says will be a Dollars 1bn a year market. The venture is with Advanced TissueSciences, a California-based Nasdaq-listed company with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m). ATIS grows living cartilage in the laboratory which is then surgically inserted into the patient's knee. The technology has been demonstrated in animal tests and the joint venture would now put it into clinical trials, said Mr John Robinson, chief executive. S&amp;N is already a large supplier of joint replacement systems such as knees and hips, but the technology has not changed fundamentally for many years. It is putting Dollars 10m cash into the venture, with the cartilage technology valued at Dollars 10m coming from ATIS. Mr Robinson hoped to have the product on the market by 1999.</p>

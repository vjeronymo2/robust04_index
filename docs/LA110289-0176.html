			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENTIST FIGHTS A 2ND DUST BOWL  </P> <P> According to legend, the 16th-Century Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de  Coronado stood on a grassy butte 10 miles south of here and scanned the horizon  in disappointment. The rumored city of gold that he was seeking was nowhere in  sight, just mile after grassy mile of prairie.  </P> <P> Wes Jackson, an explorer of another kind, also scans the horizon here with a  hard heart. What he wants to see is real prairie -- firm sod of big bluestem  and Indian grasses and a dozen other deep-rooted plants that brace the soil  against wind and rain and man.  </P> <P> Instead, what Jackson sees in the Kansas midlands is a patchwork of  cultivation, land tilled and laced with chemicals to maximize production. He  sees ecological ruin under way in the form of erosion, contaminated ground  water and tainted food. A child of Depression-era Kansas, Jackson has fashioned  his own response to an agriculture that he believes will prove to be as ruinous  as the Dust Bowl.  </P> <P> Thirteen years ago, he founded the Land Institute, a think tank on the prairie,  classrooms for students and experimental plots for researchers. His idea is to  turn Kansas farmland back to prairie, harvest the seeds of wild rye and other  wild grasses, let nature's wisdom prevail.  </P> <P> It is at once "a deep probe into the future and a deep probe into the past,"  Jackson likes to say.  </P> <P> On a recent weekend, a tweedy clutch of academics, environmental activists and  researchers convened at the Land Institute, attracted by Jackson's radical but  enduring experiment at his 100-acre prairie laboratory.  </P> <P> Jackson, who has a doctorate in plant genetics, convened the group to consider  an issue that recently has come to permeate the public policy debate on  agriculture-the environmental impact of farming practices. The symposium was  dubbed "The Marriage of Ecology and Agriculture."  </P> <P> The meeting on a rise above the Smoky Hill River outside Salina crackled with  current flowing between two poles -- the prairie stoicism of Jackson and the  dark anger of a Kentucky agrarian poet named Wendell Berry.  </P> <P> Jackson presided over the event more with his presence than his words. In  interviews, he invoked the Pre-Industrial past as a guide to the future, but he  acknowledged readily that his prairie experiment may falter and indeed that  mankind "may not pull through."  </P> <P> "The human experiment may fail," he said blandly.  </P> <P> Berry, a tall and spindly man who resembles Jimmy Stewart in the role of a  fire-and-brimstone Baptist preacher, cut through the drone of the symposium's  academic discussion like a knife.  </P> <P> "For a long time now," he said, "we have understood ourselves as traveling  toward some sort of industrial paradise, some new Eden conceived and  constructed entirely by human ingenuity. . . . Now we face overwhelming  evidence that we are not smart enough to recover Eden by assault and that  nature does not tolerate or excuse our abuses. If, in spite of the evidence  against us, we are finding it hard to relinquish our old ambition, we are also  seeing more clearly every day how that ambition has reduced and enslaved us."  </P> <P> Later, with Jackson looking on from the wings like a mortician at a funeral,  Cornell University entomologist David Pimentel enumerated the grim trends of  modern agriculture. Erosion, he said, is proceeding at 20 times the rate of  replenishment; in 150 years, Iowa has lost one-half of its topsoil.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he said, American agriculture is responsible for 81% of the nation's  water use and is soaking up aquifers at an alarming rate, especially in Kansas.  Pesticides, Pimentel said, are being dumped on the land at a rate of 1 billion  pounds a year, yet pests are destroying larger and larger portions of the crop.  </P> <P> The paradoxical result, he and others assert, is pest proliferation on farms  where large-scale methods are in use.  </P> <P> Jackson's vision of prairie agriculture does not provide a complete fix for all  of these troubling trends. The grasses he hopes to cultivate in a "domestic  prairie" promise a lower-yielding form of agriculture, one designed to  complement a small-is-beautiful kind of local economy. Such an economy  presupposes a radical revision of American life.  </P> <P> That theme of revision was woven through the three-day symposium, as speaker  after speaker proposed modifications to the status quo. Ironically, the only  participant to offer an unequivocal celebration of the American landscape was  Eugene Ryabov, a visiting Soviet soil-conservation specialist.  </P> <P> At the close of a dinner program, Ryabov recited favorite verses in thickly  accented English, minus the music:  </P> <P> Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play.  </P> <P>  Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all  day.  </P></p>

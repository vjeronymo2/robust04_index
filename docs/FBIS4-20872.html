			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Skjalg Fremo report: "Ban Adopted -- And Forgotten"] </F>   [Text] Trondheim -- The amendment to the law was meant to  prohibit Norwegians from acting as intermediaries for sales of  arms and military equipment from one foreign country to another  without special permission.    The amendment to the law was adopted by the Stortinget  [Norwegian Parliament] in spring 1990 following rapid  consideration. However, a formal error in its processing by the  government meant that the ban first took effect last Friday.    The acting press spokesman for the Norwegian Department of  Foreign Affairs (UD), Arthur Baste Knutsen, told us that the  fact that the law has only just come into force had no practical  meaning.    "Since the summer the law was adopted, there have not been  any cases where this legal provision has come into play," Baste  Knutsen said.  <H5>  Slip in Minutes </H5>   The statutory provision, which has not been in application  for three-and-a-half years after all, is contained in the law  governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products,  services, and technology. The Lovdata [legal data] organization  discovered the formal error, which appears to have been made  when the new provision was meant to be approved by the king at  the cabinet meeting held on 22 June 1990. The law was indeed  approved that day, and the intention was to implement it  straight away.    However, this latter provision was omitted from the minutes  of the cabinet meeting, probably by error. Consequently, the  entry into force of the law was not announced in the NORWEGIAN  LAW NEWS, Lovdata revealed in a letter to the Department of  Foreign Affairs.  <H5>  Arms Intermediaries </H5>   The background to the amendment of the law was an actual  case  that came to light in the winter of 1990 when a Norwegian  company acted as an intermediary selling arms from one country  to another. The Justice Department discovered that the law in  force at the time failed to give the Norwegian authorities any  authority to intervene against such activities -- because it was  not a question of selling arms, but rather merely acting as an  intermediary for arms sales.    Kjell Magne Bondevik, the foreign minister at the time,  reacted quickly to close this loophole in a law dating from 1987  governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products,  services, and technology. Under the provisions of this law,  Norwegian citizens must have a special approval to sell arms,  while simple mediation was not affected.    The UD issued a proposal for an amendment to the law on 6  April 1990. The proposal was adopted by the cabinet that same  day, and the matter was passed on to the Stortinget.    The Norwegian parliament also reacted swiftly. The Committee  on Foreign Affairs, led by [Prime Minister] Gro Harlem  Brundtland, issued a unanimously adopted recommendation on 3 May  1990. Odelstinget [larger division of Norwegian parliament]  passed a unanimous resolution on 21 May 1990, and Lagtinget  [smaller division of Norwegian parliament] confirmed this on 29  May 1990.    Evidently, everyone agreed that the mediation of arms sales  should be monitored. Accordingly, the amendment to the law  should have been approved by the king in the cabinet. The bill  states that: "This law shall take effect from a moment to be  stipulated by the king." In a letter sent to the UD on 18  February 1994, Lovdata pointed out that no decision had ever  been made on its entry into force. Consequently, up until now  it was lawful for Norwegian citizens to act as intermediaries in  arms sales between one country and another, in direct  contravention of Stortinget's 1990 resolution.</p>

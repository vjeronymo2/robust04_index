			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURNOVERS TURN IT FOR RANCHO SANTIAGO  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago College realized a five-touchdown windfall because Golden West  was careless with the football Saturday in a Mission Conference game.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago intercepted five passes and recovered a fumble in a 33-9  victory at Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> Golden West led, 9-6, early in the third quarter, when its troubles began.  </P> <P> Manuel Gonzales intercepted a pass by Golden West quarterback David Brunet and  returned it 23 yards to the Rustler 10.  </P> <P> Four plays later, Estrus Crayton scored on a one-yard dive to give Rancho  Santiago a 13-9 lead with 2 minutes 52 seconds left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Gonzales also had a second-quarter interception that set up the Dons' first  touchdown.  </P> <P> With 13:06 left, Scott Strini intercepted a Brunet pass that had been tipped.  The turnover gave Rancho Santiago (5-3, 2-1 in the Central Division) a first  down at its 46, and Crayton capped the eight-play drive with a 10-yard run to  give Rancho Santiago a 20-6 lead.  </P> <P> Crayton finished with 106 yards in 20 carries. A 73-yard touchdown run was  called back because of an illegal-use-of-hands call. The Dons had three  first-half touchdowns called back because of infractions.  </P> <P> Crayton's two touchdowns give him 20 this season, tying his Rancho Santiago and  Mission Conference records set last year.  </P> <P> After Crayton's second score, Golden West (5-3, 1-2) switched to quarterback  Steve Ramirez, but the result was the same -- only quicker.  </P> <P> His first pass was intercepted by Gary Bladow and returned 10 yards for a  touchdown with 9:02 left to put the Dons up, 26-9.  </P> <P> But Golden West, which has lost three of its past four games, wasn't finished  being kind to defensive strangers.  </P> <P> Brunet came back, only to fumble a snap that linebacker Richard Valenzuela  recovered at the 11. Valenzuela also had an interception.  </P> <P> Two rushing plays lost six yards, but quarterback Richard Fanti completed  17-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Trent Julian for a 33-9 lead with 6:50  left.  </P> <P> "It was a competitive football until those fourth-quarter turnovers," Golden  West Coach Ray Shackleford said. "We didn't play well after that."  </P> <P> Fanti had given Rancho Santiago a 6-0 lead in the second quarter on a 24-yard  scramble, when he faked out three defenders and broke two attempted tackles.  </P> <P> After completing his first nine pass attempts for 76 yards, Fanti finished 11  of 18 for 89 yards. He also rushed for 58 yards in eight carries.  </P> <P> Brunet completed 10 of 20 for 99 yards and four interceptions, two of which  were tipped by his receivers.  </P> <P> Mike Graff scored Golden West's touchdown on a 25-yard run in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> The Rustlers rushed for 206 yards, led by Frank Vaccaro, who had 63. Doug  Cunningham, coming back after a leg injury sidelined him for a month, had 51  yards in 10 tries.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No change in the scope of required examinations was proposed by Notice 82&hyph;15, Duration of Medical Certificates. Where an applicant for medical certification demonstrates by history or by findings that additional or more detailed medical evaluation is required, current regulations permit the FAA to obtain it. The routine examination used for many years has proven adequate for the identification of those airmen who should be further evaluated yet places only minimum burden on that majority of persons who can be immediately certificated. Nevertheless, the FAA announced and conducted a complete review of the standards for airman medical certification (47 FR 16298, April 15, 1982 and 47 FR 30795; July 15, 1982), and examination scope was one object of the review. The larger part of this notice announces proposals related to standards and administrative procedures for airman medical certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> History of Medical Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Airman medical standards have been in effect for many years. The 1938 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR parts 20 and 21, 1938) under the authority of the Air Commerce Act contained minimum requirements for the physical condition of airmen. The early rules did not provide for the issuance of airman medical certificates. However, they did require that an appropriate physical examination be given before a pilot could be tested for a pilot certificate. In 1942, a system for the issuance of medical certificates was adopted that provided for the issuance of first-, second-, and third-class medical certificates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discretion in the issuance of medical certificates has always been a feature of the FAA medical certification system. Over the years this feature has been modified but the basic provision for special issuance of a medical certificate to a person who does not meet the required medical standards has remained. To be granted a special issuance, an airman has had to demonstrate by operational experience, flight testing, special practical evaluation, or a special medical evaluation that he or she can carry out the appropriate airman duties without endangering public safety during the prescribed time period of the medical certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of specific changes to the medical standards took effect in 1959. Electrocardiographic examination was required of first-class certificate applicants. The ECG is to demonstrate the absence of myocardial infarction and to identify other cardiovascular conditions. A second amendment provided for additional medical standards related to a person's general physical condition and nervous system. These revisions were based primarily on a study conducted by the Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. (FSF). The study proposed that the existing certification criteria be expanded to cover the following specific medical conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An established diagnosis of diabetes requiring insulin or other hypoglycemic treatment agents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A history of myocardial infarction or other evidence of coronary artery disease; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A history of an established diagnosis of psychosis, severe psychoneurosis, severe personality abnormality, epilepsy, chronic alcoholism or drug addiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FSF position was that the existence of any of the above conditions was an appropriate basis for disqualification for any class of medical certificate. The FSF based its recommendation on the belief, at that time, that medical prognostication for these conditions was too imprecise to provide assurance that these conditions would not interfere with the safe piloting of an aircraft. The FSF found that the likelihood of an occurrence of a partially or totally incapacitating state directly related to these conditions was so great that an airman with one of these conditions posed a potential hazard to flight safety. As a result of the FSF's recommendations, the procedures were amended to prohibit the granting of special issuances to airmen with these conditions. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, however, provided for the granting of exemptions by the Administrator. In 1960, the FAA specified that the existing general exemption procedures applied to the medical standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rapid developments in medical knowledge about the disqualifying conditions and the development of improved techniques for prediction of their risk for incapacitation led the FAA shortly afterwards to grant exemptions, with appropriate limitations, to many persons with these conditions. Though exemptions were available, requests from individuals with severe manifestations of some conditions were denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1971, the authority to grant or deny petitions for exemption from part 67 was delegated to the Federal Air Surgeon (Amendment 11&hyph;11; 36 FR 3462; February 25, 1971). This revision was designed to reduce administrative processing time and lower costs for the FAA in the granting of exemptions. The FAA granted over 3,000 medical exemptions in the ensuing years. Overall, the safety record of airmen who were granted exemptions has been at least as good as that of the general population of airmen who hold medical certificates issued under the medical standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Bidder will, before the first application, submit to the Architect, a schedule of values of the various parts of the work, including quantities, aggregating the total contract price, divided so as to assist in determining the accuracy of payments to subcontractors and of the applications for payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Upon Completion of Construction, the Architect shall inspect the Project, and if he shall find the work acceptable and all provisions hereunder fully performed, he shall furnish the Owner two copies of a Certificate of Completion, on forms satisfactory to the Administrator, and shall certify thereon the final Contract Price.

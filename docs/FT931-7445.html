			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Amicable cuts bonus Scottish Amicable, the mutual life insurance company, has made one of the biggest cuts in bonus of the current season. The Glasgow-based group has reduced pay-outs on 10 year with-profits policies by more than 15 per cent. Mr Roy Nicholson, managing director, said that the cuts were caused by the group's investment focus on small company shares, which had suffered particularly badly in the recession. The pay-out on a 10 year policy is being reduced from Pounds 7,331 to Pounds 6,174 (based on a male, aged 29 at outset, paying Pounds 30 per month in premiums). However, the poor investments returns earned in recent years have much less effect on longer term policies. Scottish Amicable is cutting pay-outs on 25 year policies by just 4.7 per cent, from Pounds 62,543 to Pounds 59,602. The pay-outs represent annual returns of 10.4 per cent for the 10 year policies and 13 per cent for 25 years. Although the stock market rose in 1992, most life companies are cutting pay-outs.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAPE MEASURES  </P> <P> I read Mary King's review of Ralph Abernathy's "And the Walls Came Tumbling  Down." I hope to read the book. Provided I can figure out a way to do so  without buying it.  </P> <P> My disillusionment with Dr. Abernathy began when it became apparent that he  could not carry the banner that he had grabbed from the dying hands of Martin  Luther King as King fell. But then, who could?  </P> <P> That disillusionment was complete some months ago as I dutifully went through  the several pounds of mail solicitations I receive each week. There it was,  Ralph David Abernathy, among the names of board members of some organization  that was raising funds for Col. Oliver North's defense. (How did I get on that  mailing list?)  </P> <P> I wrote Abernathy in care of the organization, whose name I did little note or  long remember. I wanted to know how a man who once marched with Martin King  could now fall in step with Oliver North. I never got an answer.  </P> <P> Direct mailing being what it is, hundreds of thousands must have received that  solicitation. I have never heard anyone else ever raise the question.  </P> <P> Perhaps Abernathy has taken his considerable ego to other parts of the body  politic in an effort to find gratification.  </P> <P> BOB BRIGHAM  </P> <P> MANHATTAN BEACH  </P></p>

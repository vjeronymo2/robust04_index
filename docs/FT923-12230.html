			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Costly place to live, even with low inflation Sir, A big thank you to Guy de Jonquieres ('The price is all right in America', July 11) for spelling out so clearly what became all too apparent to me when I returned to Britain in December 1990 after spending three years in New York - that no matter how low the headline rate of inflation falls, no matter how low the underlying rate falls, this is a very expensive country. If I have one quarrel with his article it is that he places too much stress on the current exchange rate and the dollar's relative weakness; in my view, for a whole range of products it makes more sense to shop in the US, no matter what the exchange rate. A couple of years ago I paid Dollars 175 for spectacle lenses in New York. (I am very short-sighted and the lenses are thus complex.) A top chain in the UK recently quoted Pounds 150 for lenses of a comparable quality. I would love to know just why it is that British myopes must pay so much more. I have refrained from buying a car, simply because I cannot bring myself to fork out so much more than my US friends do when they invest in new cars. Nor will I buy compact discs in this country; it is outrageous that the sterling and dollar prices are virtually identical. This is a product that is, as far as I can fathom, international in all its dimensions - international pop or opera stars record in studios in countries all over the world, and the discs are pressed in one country for distribution worldwide. Can anyone from the record or motor industries offer an explanation, let alone a defence for the gross differences in prices? What it all boils down to is that I for one am not going to help kick-start the economy by going on a spending spree when I know that the same goods are on offer much cheaper elsewhere. I prefer to do without and save my money than be taken for a ride by British manufacturers and distributors. Elizabeth Balsom, 16 Coalecroft Road, London SW15 6LP</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Fuelling partnerships to explore mutual interests - How BP is oiling the expensive wheels of progress via alliances AFTER DECADES of growing on its own through takeovers and internal expansion, British Petroleum is rediscovering the value of co-operative ventures and alliances. It will finalise soon, for example, a joint initiative with Norway's Statoil to market and sell gas in the UK, launching a substantial challenge to British Gas' dominance of the UK industrial gas market. The deal, which covers other areas such as oil exploration, is part of a wider understanding between the two companies. BP has dubbed it a strategic alliance. Indeed, it says that the Statoil deal could be followed by other strategic alliances currently under discussion which could come to fruition later this year. This approach revives an idea which has been around since multinational oil companies received concessions to explore for oil across the world in the 1950s, but which was buried as countries nationalised their oil interests and the industry turned its eyes towards the mega-takeovers of the 1980s. Under the constraints of today's chastened financial environment, a link-up with a like-minded company to explore areas of mutual interest can be a useful and much cheaper alternative to a hostile takeover bid. 'The mind-set of the 1980s has changed,' says Mr David Simon, BP's chief operating officer and deputy chairman. 'People are understanding that it is possible to have a common vision and work through a strategy without worrying about the issue of control. In an alliance, you are pooling your abilities to create value rather than worrying about who is stronger.' For BP, with gearing of close to 40 per cent and a capital budget of Dollars 7bn a year (Pounds 4.1bn at the current exchange rate) just to fund internally-generated projects, there is little room to contemplate a large acquisition in any case. Mr Simon insists that the company is not forced into alliances because it is cash-constrained, but that 'this is a sensible way of growing the business and creating value for shareholders'. BP's initiative with Statoil grew out of a personal relationship between Mr Simon and Mr Harold Norvik, Statoil's chairman, both of which share similar views on the development of EC energy markets in the run-up to the single market in 1992 and beyond. The link on gas between the two companies will give BP access to the largest gas reserves in Europe to supply burgeoning gas demand in the UK and, possibly, later export to a more liberated EC gas market. Gas production and sales currently account for 10 per cent of BP's business, but the company is putting more resources into its development and could see its exposure to gas doubling over the next couple of years. Another chief reason behind the move towards strategic alliances is the need to share the risk of highly capital-intensive exploration projects which are often located in politically-sensitive regions of the world. BP and Statoil are looking to explore jointly for oil and gas in West Africa, offshore China, Vietnam and the Soviet Union. Under this arrangement, both companies can share the cost and technological burden of searching for additional oil reserves outside the Middle East, an objective which is important to both. Much of the world's oil reserves are in the hands of state-owned companies. Many of them are in severe need of capital and technological expertise to maximise output. This could be provided by the large multinationals in return for access to the oil. Some oil industry observers are expecting a return to the partnerships of the 1950s which helped develop the reserves in the first place. At the beginning of April, BP signed an agreement with Venezuela's national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, to co-operate in oil exploration and production in the country. This was the fruit of a 10-year relationship between the two companies which started as a partnership on technology. Venezuelan oil is very heavy - which means it contains a lot of sulphur - making it difficult to transport and to burn in power stations. The two companies developed a technique of mixing water with the oil by a process called Orimulsion and formed a joint venture to market it in Europe. By courting the Venezuelans in this way, BP secured a deal to help develop its reserves and co-operate on refining. Similarly, research into new technology is a ripe area for link-ups between large oil companies since they help defray the heavy costs. Statoil and BP have also gone down a third route in the alliance and have set up a joint venture research and development project. This will pool resources on some aspects of technology development and, since BP has the upper hand on research, Statoil has paid Dollars 20m for its part of the venture. In another bid to rationalise costs, BP has joined with Texaco, the US oil company, in upgrading two refineries in Rotterdam by linking them by pipeline. The agreement pools up-to-date refining equipment owned by each at the different sites and allows them to close the older parts of the plant. Speculation about future alliances for BP have centred around the Far East where demand for oil is growing at a faster rate than anywhere else in the world. The company would certainly like to gain more exposure to the Japanese market, but it is very difficult to penetrate. It is not a process that can be rushed, Mr Simon stresses. 'It is a way of looking at the development of markets and political structures which means you can do business together,' he says.</p>

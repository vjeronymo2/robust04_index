			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian presidential aide Georgiy Satarov in an  interview with Interfax on Tuesday spoke against the  transformation of the treaty on civil accord from a political  document into a judicial one.    In particular, he considers it inexpedient to hold a  referendum or a plebiscite on the treaty, as well as its  adoption as a federal law. In his opinion, responsibility for  non-observance of the agreement should be more of a moral  character. In this connection, Satarov pointed out the role of  media as one of the most effective controllers of the treaty's  implementation by the sides.    Satarov suggested that relations between those who will sign  the document on April 28 and "non-signatories" will be built  "normally." To prove his viewpoint he cited an episode during  the recent meeting between Boris Yeltsin and leaders of the  factions; when reacting to sharp criticism of the draft by a  Yabloko representative Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy, the president  said: "Whatever you say about the agreement, we will still be  friends."    "The non-signing of the treaty does not mean discrimination  against nonaligned public organizations," Satarov pointed out.  Otherwise, he said, "the idea of civil accord itself would be  discredited."    Satarov noted that the process of civil reconciliation  should  not be exhausted with the conclusion of the treaty. He  considers the mechanism for the solution of concrete problems as  the most important issue in the document. Satarov has in view  one of the functions of the conciliatory commission, to be  created under the treaty, which will organize roundtable  meetings and working groups on various issues.    The presidential aide said that "according to latest  reports"  about 220 people had been invited to the ceremony of signing the  civil accord treaty on Thursday.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALEXANDRIA COMES OUT OF SHADOWS  </P> <P> Lorez Alexandria has never quite received the recognition that her work has  deserved. Much respected by musicians, as well as other singers, she has spent  a good part of her several decades-old career in the shadow of performers like  Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> Alexandria's opening night set at Marla's Memory Lane Friday night  demonstrated, however, that she is an artist with much to offer. To her credit,  and rare for most jazz singers, she sang a program that added brand new songs  to the usual collection of familiar standards, sultry ballads and hard swinging  up tempos.  </P> <P> The always-dependable trio of Art Hillary on piano, Clarence Johnston on drums  and Allen Jackson on bass opened the evening with a group of jazz-worthy tunes  -- "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes," "It Could Happen to You" and "Softly, As in  a Morning Sunrise" -- that were energized by Jackson's smooth, harmonically  evocative bass lines.  </P> <P> Alexandria kicked off her part of the show with a hard rocking groove on "I  Wish I Knew" and a somewhat less-dynamic "Bittersweet." She hit her stride with  Johnny Mercer's "I Remember You" and Duke Ellington's "I Got It Bad."  </P> <P> But her finest moments came on new songs like "Sweet Pumpkin" and "Where Have  You Been." Obviously delighted to have material that she can mark with her own  stamp, Alexandria produced interpretations that reached into the heart of the  music -- especially during a moodily introspective rendition of Arthur  Hamilton's lovely "Are You With Me?"

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Rocky to Fight Yet Another Bout: Sylvester Stallone is going in for another  round of struggle and success in the boxing ring. Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt  Young and company will begin filming "Rocky V" in Philadelphia Jan. 15, Mayor  W. Wilson Goode announced.  </P> <P> The new film will feature the familiar formula -- fighting and winning. Rocky  Balboa, perhaps Philadelphia's most famous resident since William Penn, faces  his greatest challenge, producers say, a test that will pit him against his own  values, strength and, ultimately, his own spirit. Boxing heavyweight contender  Tommy Morrison is featured as Rocky's protege, Tommy Gun. John Alvidsen, who  directed the first "Rocky" in Philadelphia in 1975 with the then-unknown  Stallone, will direct the fourth sequel and filming is expected to last about  six weeks.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Review of the First Week of the Year"] </F>   [Text] Last week's celebrations of the Iranian new year  coincided with some international events worth mentioning.    The world once again witnessed Israeli aggression against  Palestinian freedom fighters and the innocent population of  Southern Lebanon. Both Zionist actions were the result of the  United Nations' foot dragging on the resolution condemning  Israel for the al-Khalil massacre of the Palestinians last  February.    Recent attacks on Lebanon and on the Palestinians once more  prove that Israel, enjoying full support of the United States in  the UN, will ignore any internationally accepted law it  considers contrary to its own interests. This intransigent  attitude towards UN resolutions should serve as a warning to  those Arab states who currently entertain the idea of a real and  genuine peace with the Zionist state.    Armenia, another regional trouble spot, was also in the news  last week. A C-130 plane belonging to the Islamic Republic  carrying Iranian diplomats and students coming home for the new  year crashed in Armenian territory killing all 32 people on  board. This tragedy deeply saddened our people especially  considering IRI's recent mediating efforts in the Azeri-Armenian  territorial dispute.    Iranian blood should not be spilled because of conflicts of  its neighbors. Iranian-Armenian relations are based on  centuries of coexistence and cultural exchanges between the two  ancient peoples. It is incumbent upon the Armenian authorities  to do whatever is necessary to regain the good will of the  Iranian people and to continue the Iranian-initiated peace  process with Azerbaijan if peace is really their ultimate  objective.    Kashmir and the conduct of India's Border Security Forces  (BSF) were also prominent in last week's news. A report by an  Indian commission accused the BSF of having fired on Kashmiri  Muslims killing at least 30 unarmed protesters without any  provocation. The commission recommended the court-martial of  several BSF members including two of its top officers.    India's swift and impartial actions regarding the renegade  members of the BSF in Kashmir deserve international praise and  we hope will serve as a model for other countries when faced  with a similar situation.    The new year message of Iran's Revolutionary leader,  Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, emphasizing social discipline  and work ethics in the everyday lives of the Muslim people began  the year 1373 with a national spirit of hope, and motivated the  Iranians to begin the new year with a resolution to work towards  achieving the country's objectives of self-sufficiency and  independence.</p>

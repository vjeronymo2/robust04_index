			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: Focus stays on interest rate outlook - London British politics may have been changed utterly by the sudden death of John Smith, Opposition leader, but the City's attention has remained firmly focused on interest rates. The FTSE 100 surged by 38.5 points on Tuesday, as traders got wind of the Bundesbank's intention to cut Germany's leading interest rates to their lowest level for five years. London followed other European equity markets up, in spite of a stiff warning on the same day from the Bank of England that it would not hesitate to raise UK interest rates if expectations of higher inflation led to an increase in the pace of wage and price rises. The Bank has some grounds for concern. Average earnings growth rose to 3.5 per cent in February from 3 per cent in November, and may have been higher in March. The chart shows that employees' inflation expectations remain above the 4 per cent level, in spite of the sharp fall in headline inflation, the key indicator for pay negotiators. The stockbroker Hoare Govett says: 'The labour market is tightening only slowly, but job prospects and security should improve as economic recovery continues, encouraging more inflation-plus pay deals.' No-one expects an increase in UK interest rates in the short-term, and there may even still be scope for another small cut. However, most analysts believe we are now at the bottom of the interest rate cycle, and the next movement will be up - even if it does not come this year. Much more likely is a small increase in US interest rates, to support the dollar and prevent America's rapid economic growth translating into higher inflation. This possibility continues to transfix the London market, which attracts institutional buying when the FTSE 100 dips towards the 3,100 level, but has been unable to break through a ceiling of 3,150 for more than a month. After Tuesday's rise, the market drifted on Wednesday and Thursday. Yesterday it closed down 18.6 at 3,119.2 as traders again focused on expectations of a rise in US interest rates next week. The uneven nature of the UK recovery was demonstrated by an unexpected drop in the manufacturing output figure for March, after two months of strong growth. However, the combined figures for the first three months recorded the largest rise in output for five years. The week's main corporate results were also generally upbeat. J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, announced an increase in underlying profits, and a stabilisation of its profit margins, in spite of fierce price battles in food retailing. Kwik Save, the biggest discount grocery retailer, was less sanguine. Despite increasing its interim profits, the group said trading was being damaged by last month's tax increases. It estimated that grocery prices were now 3.5 per cent lower than last year, owing partly to intense price competition. Big insurers such as General Accident, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance all confirmed the steady recovery in profits in a sector which was dogged by losses between 1990 and 1992. In spite of an improvement in their underwriting performance, all suffered from a decline in the value of their investments in both bonds and equities during the first quarter. The recovery by the banks also continued apace, as demonstrated by the Royal Bank of Scotland's achievement of doubling its interim pre-tax profits and tripling its earnings. Shareholders who fear that the banks may only rebuild their books in order to start throwing the money away again in another wave of bad loans may be encouraged by the Royal Bank's success with Direct Line, its insurance subsidiary which sells to the public by telephone. Direct Line is already the UK's leading motor insurer and has nearly doubled its share of the household insurance market since last year. The Royal Bank said it had injected a further Pounds 35m of capital into the continued expansion of the business, which nearly tripled pre-tax profits to to Pounds 40m. This success poses a threat to the profitability of more traditional insurers and buildings societies, who have long enjoyed high commission rates in the home insurance market. Not that the Royal is hostile to building societies: indeed the bank confirmed it had been interested in acquiring the Cheltenham and Gloucester, for which Lloyds has bid Pounds 1.8bn. George Mathewson, chief executive, said he would still like to buy a medium-sized society with a 'recognisable name' in the high street, as part of the bank's strategy of diversifying its interests, and making earnings less volatile. The brewers' reporting season got off to an unhappy start when the head of Vaux Group, one of the largest regional brewers, attacked the government over the 'scandal' of bootleg imports of beer from mainland Europe. The Sunderland-based group claimed that cross-Channel shipments were now running at more than 2m barrels a year, equivalent to four times the production of Vaux itself, which last year sold beer worth more than Pounds 100m. Brewers have been lobbying the government to reduce the duty on beer to bring it closer to French levels. But there seems little chance of the treasury accepting the initial drop in revenue which such a move would entail. Grand Metropolitan, the international drinks and food group, gave the market a jolt on Thursday when it revealed that de-stocking in the US drinks market was likely to cost it Pounds 40m this year. Apparently the recovery of the US economy encouraged GrandMet's IDV drinks subsidiary to stock up last autumn in the hope of increased sales. In fact, the market fell.</p>

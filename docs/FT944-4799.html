			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Singapore seeks light-rail tenders Singapore has called for tenders for two light-rail train (LRT) systems which will serve as feeder services to stations on the existing mass rapid transit (MRT) rail network. Each of the new LRT systems will be about 10km long and cost about SDollars 300m (USDollars 205m). Although Singapore has one of the world's most modern and efficient transport systems, the government is under political pressure to improve the network. A licensing system which seeks to limit the number of cars on Singapore's roads has pushed the price of owning a vehicle beyond the reach of many citizens. 'We cannot promise every Singaporean a car,' said Mr Mah Bow Tan, communications minister. 'But we can promise every Singaporean a comfortable, convenient and cost-effective transport system.' Tenders have been called on a turnkey basis, with submission by the end of January. Preference will be given to proposals involving joint ventures with equity participation by Singapore-owned companies.</p>

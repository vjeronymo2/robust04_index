			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party leader Kiro Popovski by </F> Branko Geroski; place and date not given: "We Are Not an  Appendage of the Coalition!"]    [Text] I don't know which big parties people think we  are an appendage of. Some of those parties, however, fell below  us in popularity.    We are continuing our series of interviews with prominent  party leaders with an interview with the leader of the Socialist  Party, Kiro Popovski. It is interesting that this is Popovski's  first interview with the press since the first elections, at  least according to his own records.    [Geroski] In view of the results of the by-elections in  several electoral districts, including the latest ones in the  103d, and especially the results of some public opinion polls,  one gets the impression that your party's standing, at least in  comparison with certain others, let us say, has shown growth,  which is being perceived as a surprise....    [Popovski] The surprise is a consequence of the simplified  assessment of the standings of political parties, which are  reduced to the number of deputies in parliament. That figure  does not actually correspond to the number of votes that we  received from the citizens. Let me recall that in the first  elections we received about 95,000 votes--the other parties  received more, but not as many as the difference in the number  of deputy seats seems to indicate. In any case, you will agree  that any party's standing is best shown through support in the  elections themselves, which means that it will evidently be  demonstrated in the next elections. In some cases, there may be  indications from the results of several parliamentary  by-elections during this term, but not just in the 103d, in  addition to public opinion polls, especially those of the Gallup  Institute. In general, I think that we can be satisfied with the  Socialist Party's standing, and especially with the fact that in  all those tests we did not have any fluctuations and declines,  which indicates stability in membership, sympathizers, and  support. I think that that is also confirmed by the results that  we achieved in the previous three by-elections. In two electoral  districts, our candidates were in second place, and in all  three, we got into the second round. As far as the 103d is  concerned, we have a large membership and sympathizers there,  and consequently part of this electoral district is represented  by our deputy in the City Assembly.  <H5>  Without an Inheritance </H5>   [Geroski] Why, then, didn't you decide to try your luck  independently?    [Popovski] Such proposals were made, and we were prepared;  we  even had our own candidate. Nevertheless, because of the  polarization that occurred and the political grouping that was  expected, we assessed that we would achieve better results if we  came forward with a joint candidate. I think that our  participation was significant in the outcome of the election  campaign, and that fact is also acknowledged by the other  coalition partners. At the same time, it was a sort of test to  see how much our sympathizers and the sympathizers of the other  two parties would accept our decision on a joint approach. In  discussion groups and conversations in this electoral district,  we received broad support for this platform from citizens. In  any case, these days our party is having several meetings and  discussion groups throughout the republic, and almost nowhere  have we been in a situation in which we have had to interrupt  them, as has happened to several other parties.    [Geroski] In the past there was an impression that your  party  was, in a certain way, to put it crudely, an appendage of the  coalition or of the major parties, but the results show that in  the future a different balance of power is possible. How much is  that influenced by the fact that you are one of the parties  which inherited an infrastructure, in terms of personnel, office  spaces, possibly even money...?    [Popovski] Let me tell you at once--we did not inherit any  kind of office spaces. In almost all the municipalities, we get  the same treatment as all the other parties: As part of the  distribution of office spaces, in the majority of  municipalities, we only got one office. Other parties are far  better situated than we are. Nevertheless, probably through  inertia, and in view of the situation in several other political  structures, that is being said of us, but it is not true. It is  true that even before pluralism we had a well-equipped  infrastructure, and that for the past four years that  infrastructure has continued to function throughout the entire  republic. Otherwise, with respect to what you were saying--an  appendage--I don't know what big party you are thinking of,  since some of those big parties have dropped below us in  popularity. Furthermore, we have clearly declared that we are  finally getting rid of all those former encumbrances and that  the Socialist Party is acting as an independent political  entity, with its own platform and positions. The fact that in  some discussions, in parliament and elsewhere, our positions  coincide with those of some large parties, which are primarily  civic-oriented, is a result of the closeness of our programs. We  are in a coalition now, and the party that has the largest  number of deputies has the most say in the coalition, so someone  thus draws the conclusion that we are under the wing of some  party, which is not true. Figuratively speaking, the 28 deputies  of that party have as much weight as our six, since neither they  nor we can form a majority in parliament by ourselves.  <H5>  Coalition for November? </H5>   [Geroski] Will that ruling coalition, which is now also the  campaign coalition from the 103d, maintain itself until November?    [Popovski] I would like to remind you of something, although  it will perhaps sound immodest: In 1990, the Socialist Party was  the only one that had a realistic assessment of what would  happen on the political scene in the republic. We established  that assessment on the basis of the situation after the initial  results from the parliamentary elections in Croatia and  Slovenia. We realistically estimated that two national blocs  would be created in the republic, and would not have a civic  orientation; and that if the democratic parties were not united,  their performance would be significantly worse. For that  purpose, we also published a special declaration that year  regarding the formation of a coalition of democratic forces in  Macedonia. It is well-known that that coalition was not  fulfilled; the only ones to join us were PCER [Party for the  Full Emancipation of Romanies] and the Association of Macedonian  Muslims. We estimate that in the next elections as well there  will be a grouping of parties, since I do not believe that with  this kind of political map in Macedonia one party can win the  elections. It has also been demonstrated that the formation of a  coalition between two rounds or after elections is hard to  achieve, and without the same effects as in an election  campaign. So far, there have not been any really direct talks on  this level, except for this attempt in the 103d. I expect that  soon every party will prepare realistic assessments of its own  capabilities, and that there will be a grouping. There are  already indications in the national bloc, and I assume that  there will be a corresponding grouping among the parties of the  nationalities. The parties that are now acting jointly are  arguing that they are civic and democratic, and I think that in  this case as well common interests may be found for the  formation of a campaign coalition. In any case, if such a  coalition is formed, we will urge that it be exclusively on an  equal basis, and based on a clearly defined program and mutual  obligations, since the one we have now is far from what it  should be, and that is why we have this situation in parliament  and elsewhere.    [Geroski] Entering that kind of coalition will be hampered  by  the voters' "memory" that that government coalition has one more  member--the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity]. That will  also be one of the key campaign themes that will be pushed by  the opposition....    [Popovski] I don't know whether any party is proceeding on  the basis of an assessment that if it gains power it will  exclude representatives of the nationalities in Macedonia,  although from the political and legal standpoint, in a pluralist  and parliamentary system, the party that wins the elections also  assumes power. Nevertheless, I think that excluding the  nationalities from power would mean the further exacerbation of  interethnic relations and an intensification of mutual distrust,  which will contribute to separating and homogenizing them, which  in turn will lead to mutual conflicts. After all, that has also  been demonstrated on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. I  don't know why or with which of the nationalities' parties we  would enter a coalition--our example with PCER shows that it can  be done, if a firm program and elements for the functioning of  such a coalition are prepared. Nevertheless, the hindrance that  you are talking about does perhaps exist, since there is  speculation that the coalition that exists now means the  abandonment of any sort of principled policy by the parties that  associate with the PDP. They want to use those national parties  to create an artificial hindrance, in order to lower the  standing of the coalition's parties. I think, however, that the  citizens will be able to assess realistically what is what.  <H5>  "Rigid" or Principled? </H5>   [Geroski] At the last two meetings of the Assembly, there  have been incidents (the stalemate over the electoral law, the  problems with the Census Law), which seem to be increasing that  risk....    [Popovski] What you are saying to me now is confirmation of  my previous assessment about the principled nature of the  positions of these parties in the coalition. If we were to act  in an unprincipled manner, that crisis would probably not have  occurred: We would accept all the demands of the participants in  the coalition and we would adopt all those laws without any  problem. It is precisely because of that principled approach  that we cannot comply with demands that are unacceptable to us.  That is why the crisis is occurring.    [Geroski] They say that you are somehow the most principled  of the principled, not to say the "most rigid" with respect to  that so-called conciliation of the Albanians in the coalition.  Is that true?    [Popovski] And now, whether I am "rigid" or not... I think  that I am principled. Our slogan in 1990 was, and still is, that  no one in Macedonia should be threatened because of his ethnic  identity and that all citizens must be equal before the  Constitution and the laws. Coexistence and mutual trust have to  be ensured. Any other alternative will be fatal to our state.  Some people perceive the fact that I am principled to the end as  my being harsh on certain issues, or "rigid," as you say. I  think, however, that it has to be assessed realistically. Some  things in our country are still not fully developed as legal  solutions, and one must always take into account expediency and  reality. For more radical changes in mutual relations, it is  also necessary to have a broader awareness among the citizens, a  higher level of economic development, and greater mutual trust.    [Geroski] Finally, the last question: The elections are  close. What is the minimum that the Socialist Party will  consider a success in these elections?    [Popovski] I don't know whether any party could give you an  answer to that question. In any case, if we exclude the  Socialist Party of Serbia, we are the only socialist party in  the former Yugoslav republics that has not only survived, but  has also done continuously risen in popularity. Probably the  minimum will be that we continue to remain in the inner circle  of the political parties that have a fundamental influence upon  the overall policy and development of the republic. That is not  just for the sake of our political interests and party standing,  but also so that we can make our own contribution to the state's  survival and to ensuring prospects for its development.</p>

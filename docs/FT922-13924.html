			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cairn Pounds 28m deficit after write-downs Cairn Energy, the oil and gas explorer, surprised the City with pre-tax losses of Pounds 27.6m for 1991 after a substantial exceptional write-down which almost halved the value of balance sheet assets. The losses compared with Pounds 334,000 in 1990. Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the decision to make a Pounds 24.5m write-down reflected a 'greater degree of realism' across the oil industry. The write-down partly covers gas-producing assets in the US and some of the company's stakes in North Sea oilfields. The company would have made a profit of Pounds 1.2m last year if it had continued with its previous policy on depletion charges, but Mr Gammell said he did not want the charge to dominate the profit and loss account in future. Other independent oil companies, including Lasmo, Clyde, and Aran, have made accounting changes which depressed profits in 1991. The oil sector is currently coming under extreme pressure from low oil prices and a weak dollar. Cairn's write-down leaves its oil and gas assets on the balance sheet at Pounds 31.8m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 19m. Turnover increased to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9.95m) but losses per share plummeted to 113.7p (1.5p). Production increased to 1,708 (1,535) barrels of oil a day and 15.5m (14.7m) cu ft of gas a day.</p>

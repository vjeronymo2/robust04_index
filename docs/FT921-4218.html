			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Factory-gate prices up 0.4% in February THE ANNUAL rate of core inflation stuck at 4.4 per cent in February after a higher-than-expected monthly increase. Prices rose by 0.4 per cent in the month. Figures issued by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show that in February the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of factory goods - the key rate of core inflation - was the same as in January, which was the lowest figure since mid 1988. Although the figures disappointed City expectations of a 0.3 per cent monthly increase, economists said underlying inflation remained on a downward trend. The latest data suggest many manufacturers are avoiding price increases in an attempt to maintain sales in a climate of fragile demand. Excluding volatile items such as food, drink and tobacco, the index rose only 2.8 per cent on the year compared with a 3.1 per cent rise in the year to January. The CSO said this figure was the lowest since June 1969, when it was 2.7 per cent. It compares with a peak of 6.4 per cent in February last year. However, the cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry jumped by 1.6 per cent between January and February, bringing the annual rate of increase to 0.5 per cent after a fall of 1.1 per cent in the 12 months to January. The CSO said the higher-than-expected increase was due mainly to the higher prices of sheep, lambs and pigs. It also reflected a stronger US dollar against the pound and other European currencies.</p>

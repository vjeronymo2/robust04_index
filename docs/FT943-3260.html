			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Unctad criticises restrictive economic policies of west Leading industrialised nations are running restrictive economic policies which are suppressing global demand and contributing to high unemployment and international trade frictions, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The organisation's latest Trade and Development Report also unabashedly favours demand management and the efficacy, at least in some circumstances, of government intervention to hasten economic development. The report forecasts world economic growth of only 2.5 per cent this year, far slower than normal in a recovery and below the sustainable long-term growth rate. The current policy consensus among western governments and the main multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank neglects the importance of effective demand and invariably treats inflation as a more serious threat than unemployment, the report says. The result has been a persistent deficiency of global demand which has promoted 'the mistaken - and mercantilist - notion that countries should seek growth by improving their overall competitiveness vis-a-vis other countries'. The report points out it is impossible for all countries to improve their relative competitiveness. If demand is insufficient, higher productivity will raise unemployment rather than output, it says. 'Global demand deficiency is a recipe for wasting the world's productive potential and an invitation to conflict among nations.' It says financial deregulation has increased the need for demand management. Deregulation has encouraged 'waves of private debt and credit creation and contraction which have spawned disturbing speculation' and produced large current account imbalances, which have put strains on foreign exchange markets and the trading system. The report, deliberately released before the forthcoming annual IMF-World Bank meeting, urges the world's three leading economic powers, and particularly their monetary authorities, to act to boost growth: The US 'needs to be cautious in applying monetary brakes', so as not to stifle the recovery of investment and employment; Western Europe needs to cut interest rates 'substantially for a prolonged period' and to postpone tackling inflated budget deficits until recovery is well under way. The European Union should delay plans for monetary union in 1996 or relax restrictive conditions agreed at Maastricht; Japan should loosen monetary policy and expand domestic demand and consumption. Otherwise, the report warns, it could soon have unemployment levels matching those in the US. Unctad extends its thesis to the developing world where, it says, the pendulum has swung too far in favour of leaving private enterprise to get on with the job. The report points to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan as cases where government intervention proved highly effective in forcing the pace of development. The 'economic miracle' in these countries 'was not entirely a miracle of the market', the report says. While admitting that these examples cannot necessarily be replicated, Unctad argues policymakers need to accept there may be different models of development that work. The report also points out that the Uruguay Round global trade agreements will in time prevent many developing countries from using some measures employed successfully in east Asia such as export incentives, import controls and restrictions on foreign investment. Developing countries' growth should average about 4 per cent this year, Unctad says, though there is a widening gap between rapid growth in east and south-east Asia and Africa's dismal performance. It argues that many of Africa's problems reflect weak prices and lack of external finance, the report argues. It also has doubts about recent improvement in Latin American growth rates, which it sees as excessively dependent on consumption and inflow of foreign funds, mainly in the form of high risk 'junk' bonds and one-off investments related to privatisation. *Trade and Development Report 1994.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Singapore Airlines ahead midway Singapore Airlines (SIA), the world's most profitable airline last year, has confirmed the financial recovery in the airline industry by reporting a 20 per cent rise in group operating profits to SDollars 478m (USDollars 322m) for the half year to September. The airline itself reported an even higher jump in first-half operating profits of 57.7 per cent to SDollars 385m, reflecting the economic recovery in leading industrialised countries and lower fuel costs. However, the operating profits of the airline's subsidiaries fell by nearly 40 per cent to SDollars 93m, largely as a result of losses at its SilkAir regional airline subsidiary, airport duty-free activities, and its investment subsidiary being hit by the international downturn in both equity and bond markets. SIA group net profits rose 17.7 per cent in the first half to SDollars 461m, while the airline's net earnings improved 31.7 per cent to SDollars 438m. Half-year group revenues rose 7 per cent to SDollars 3.248bn while airline turnover increased by 7.8 per cent to SDollars 2.937bn. Although the airline carried 10.4 per cent more traffic in the first half, the overall yield fell 2.5 per cent entirely due to the strength of the Singapore dollar. Dr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, said revenue yields would continue to remain under pressure because of increased competition in both the intercontinental and Asian markets. Although the worst was now over and some light was finally appearing at the end of the tunnel, Dr Cheong warned it would not be 'entirely smooth sailing from here on'. Asian carriers have also been losing their distinct cost advantage over airlines from more developed parts of the world because salaries, rents and other lower costs in Asia were either catching up or had already overtaken the levels in Europe or North America, Dr Cheong said. SIA's expenditure rose 2.8 per cent in the first half to SDollars 2.552bn due to higher costs of aircraft maintenance, overhaul, handling, landing and parking, depreciation and staff, although these costs were to some extent offset by lower fuel costs.</p>

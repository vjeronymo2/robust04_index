			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Ruehe Makes Concessions to </F> the FDP Regarding Military Service"]    [Text] Bonn -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian  Democratic Union) is apparently prepared to accept Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] proposals to make the basic  military service more flexible. In the future, it is to take  nine to 13 months. This is shown by the answers to a catalogue  of questions about his conceptual guidelines, which Ruehe passed  on to the FDP for tomorrow's session of the coalition and the  government.    It mentions a range of 10 to 23 months. Since Ruehe's model  grants one month of leave to the conscripts performing basic  military service, however, one can start from a net figure of  nine months.    Ruehe's answer is as follows: "In order to make the young  men flexible in planning their professional life in connection  with military service, they are to be offered the possibility of  serving voluntarily for a longer period than the minimum."    Moreover, the defense minister advocates that the  alternative  national service time of 15 months be left unchanged. The  reason is that two months of standby readiness are added to the  compact basic military service of 10 months minus one month of  leave. The basic military service for the crisis-reaction  forces is at least 12 months anyway.    According to Ruehe, the peacetime strength of the armed  forces is to be 340,000 men. Although the minister concedes an  increase to 370,000 men to the FDP at any time, the Bundeswehr's  infrastructure, according to Ruehe's information, will be  designed for 340,000 men in the future: "The structures of the  armed forces will be cut to a peacetime strength of 340,000.  The reduction of the volume will also be reflected by a  reduction of the organizational elements, so that the objective  of cost reduction will be achieved." The minister makes the  need for a new debate on the closing or reduction of bases quite  plain: "It is clear that the consequences for the deployment  will only be ascertained in detail in the course of the planning  process, and decisions will be made afterward and only be  implemented in the following years. Here, the deployment in all  FRG regions will have to be taken into account."</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDS CHARGE COULD DELAY VOTE ON TOWER INDEFINITELY  </P> <P> The FBI has received a new allegation of misconduct against Defense  Secretary-designate John Tower and has extended its investigation of the  troubled nominee, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee said  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) said the White House agreed that the charge should  be checked by the FBI. Warner indicated that Tower's confirmation proceedings  would be delayed indefinitely.  </P> <P> Warner would not comment on the specifics of the new allegation, but  Administration sources said that it related to campaign funds Tower may have  received from a defense contractor when he was a senator. He said that the  allegation should be investigated by FBI agents "in an orderly way, at their  own pace."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the second-ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. J.  James Exon of Nebraska, said Tuesday evening that he now opposes the Tower  nomination. And Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the committee, has indicated  privately to some Democratic colleagues on the panel that he also is leaning  against the nomination, in part because of the seriousness of the charges  against the former Texas senator and in part out of anger at the way the White  House has handled the matter.  </P> <P> However, an aide said Tuesday night that Nunn has made no public statement  opposing Tower and would not make up his mind about the nomination until he has  read the final FBI investigative report.  </P> <P> "I really came to that decision (to oppose Tower) tonight after, or about, the  time that the FBI report was delayed and after the shenanigans of today," Exon  told the Associated Press.  </P> <P> Earlier, Exon had told The Times that he was "concerned that John Tower at one  time, years or months ago, had a serious problem with alcohol. All during the  investigation the question has been on many of our minds of whether that was  still the case or has he corrected that problem."  </P> <P> Warner's announcement was made only hours after President Bush and top aides  had met at the White House with Warner, Nunn and Tower to discuss the  nomination.  </P> <P> Administration sources said it will be difficult to resolve the new allegation  quickly. They said there are questions about whether the report has been  distorted by personal animosity against the nominee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Serious Questions'  </P> <P> One Democratic panel member, after being briefed by an FBI agent in his office  late Monday, said that he was left with "serious questions" about whether Tower  in fact has conquered his admitted alcohol problems, as Tower asserted before  the committee last week.  </P> <P> As partisan infighting grows in the Armed Services Committee and new  allegations surface almost daily, Tower's confirmation appears seriously  jeopardized. It now appears that no vote on the nomination will be taken this  week, and the Senate will not be in session next week.  </P> <P> The delay could leave the President without his key adviser on military matters  and critical budget questions for nearly four weeks after the inauguration.  </P> <P> Bush said Tuesday that he stands behind Tower, and Tower himself has given no  thought to asking that his nomination be withdrawn, according to aides.  </P> <P> At the White House, Bush met with Tower, Nunn and Warner for about 45 minutes  Tuesday afternoon -- a meeting requested by the committee chairman, according  to Warner.  </P> <P> Bush stressed to Nunn that he supports Tower and wants to see him confirmed  quickly.  </P> <P> "He's the guy I want for the job," Bush was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> Nunn told Bush and his senior staff members that he had "concerns" about the  Tower nomination but did not flatly say he was opposed to it. He was "not that  black and white about it," said a senior aide familiar with the discussion.  </P> <P> A senior White House official, expressing annoyance at the latest delay in the  protracted Tower confirmation, complained: "The problem is that this is a  never-ending thing. You can always get new accusations. Are we going to have  this guy die the death of a thousand cuts or are we going to get a decision?"  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, a number of Republican senators, after hearing a  preliminary briefing on Tower, declared the charges against him "groundless"  and called for a quick confirmation vote.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on the question of Tower's relations with the defense industry --  another key issue raised in his confirmation hearings -- it was learned that  the FBI has obtained a document in which Tower acknowledged that, while working  as a defense consultant in the summer of 1987, he advocated increased purchases  of the MX missile.  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration planned to deploy an additional 50 such missiles, but  Tower said he believed that an additional 100 missiles would be needed.  </P> <P> At the time, Tower represented Rockwell International Inc., which was involved  in the production of the MX, under a $120,000-a-year contract signed in July,  1986. He signed the contract soon after he stopped serving as a principal  strategic arms negotiator in Geneva.  </P> <P> Tower said in the document that, regardless of whether he was associated with  Rockwell, he would have considered the additional missiles necessary as part of  the nation's strategic deterrent. As a senator, Tower had been a consistent  supporter of the MX.  </P> <P> If confirmed as secretary of defense, Tower could face decisions on future MX  purchases, and on the continuing controversy over its basing mode.  </P> <P> Staff writers Paul Houston, Melissa Healy and David Lauter contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

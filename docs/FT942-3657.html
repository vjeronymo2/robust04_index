			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Appeal considered after spoiling tactic costs seat The most justifiably disappointed candidate in southern England yesterday was Mr Adrian Sanders, who stood for the Liberal Democrats in Devon and East Plymouth. He failed to defeat the defending Tory candidate by only 700 votes. Meanwhile, a Literal Democrat won no fewer than 10,200. The Liberal Democrats believe the Literal Democrat cost them the seat and an appeal to the electoral court is being considered. 'It was a spoiling tactic,' said Mr Nick Rijke, the party's campaign manager. 'On polling day we had people ringing up to say they had made a dreadful mistake.' Elsewhere, the party's ambitions were frustrated in all but two seats by the strength of Labour's performance. In Devon and East Plymouth, for example, Labour polled over 47,000 votes. While the Liberal Democrats apparently gained most in the south from the steep fall in the Green vote, compared with 1989, the party gained less from tactical voting than was expected. 'Despite massive attempts by the Liberal Democrats right across the south of England to squeeze our vote, it just didn't happen,' said Mr Graham Manuel, Labour's regional organiser. 'Their tactic of saying voting Labour is a wasted vote just didn't work.' He believed the message about tactical voting became dissipated by the large size of European constituencies. Publicly, the Liberal Democrats hoped to win only up to three seats. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, hailed as a breakthrough their success in gaining their first European seats with big majorities - Cornwall and West Plymouth, and Somerset and North Devon. 'We are now the clear challengers in the Tory stronghold of the south and south-west,' he said. Privately, his party had hoped to extend gains beyond its own natural territory and into Tory heartlands. Yet in the Cotswolds constituency, it was Labour which cut the 25,000 majority of Lord Plumb, the defending Tory, to 4,200. Labour's vote also went up in the North Wiltshire and Bath constituency, a Liberal Democrat target. Dr Caroline Jackson, the defending Tory, held the seat with a much reduced majority of less than 9,000. In the Dorset and East Devon seat, the Conservatives fended off the Liberal Democrats by only 2,200 votes, with Labour polling nearly 35,000. Labour did well in Bristol, where Mr Ian White retained the party's only seat in the region. Mr White, who campaigned hard for the European social chapter, trebled his majority to nearly 30,000. He saw Labour's performance as a consolidation of its support, rather than a shift by anti-Tory voters who now saw Labour rather than the Liberal Democrats as the social democratic alternative.

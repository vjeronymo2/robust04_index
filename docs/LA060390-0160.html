			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> * Riddled Redbirds: The St. Louis Cardinal lineup that Manager Whitey Herzog  likes to call an undisciplined collection of ping hitters had produced two or  fewer runs in 19 of 47 games through Thursday, and three or fewer in 27 games.  "We're just pathetic offensively," Herzog said. Among the most pathetic: Milt  Thompson, with eight hits in his last 61 at-bats, and Jose Oquendo, 10 for his  last 62. "Jose looks like he never played before," Herzog said. "Milt, too.  It's a joke, but they're not the only ones. We're 12th in the league in  average, 12th in runs scored, 12th in home runs and 10th in doubles. It tells  you something when you can't even get a double."  </P> <P> * Magrane's Migraine: The inoffensive Cardinals have made it tough on  left-hander Joe Magrane to work out of a rut in which he has won two of his  last 17 starts. Magrane, 18-9 with a 2.81 earned-run average last year, is 2-8,  the Cardinals having scored 15 runs in his eight defeats. Wednesday night, he  lost to the Houston Astros, 2-1, despite allowing only one earned run in 7 1/3  innings.  </P> <P> * Blew Brew: The Milwaukee Brewers led the American League with 155 errors last  year and are back at it, having made 55 in 44 games, which projects to a  club-record 204. The 1985 Dodgers are the only team to have won a division  title while finishing last in the league in fielding, but anything is possible  in the AL East. The Cleveland Indians, for example, went 11-13 against Western  Division opponents and picked up 1 1/2 games in the standings.  </P> <P> * Lumbering Lumberman: At 38 and carrying 235 pounds on knees that give the  impression of collapsing with every stride, Dave Parker had driven in 28 runs  for the Brewers through Thursday, delivering more triples, three, and as many  stolen bases, two, as home runs. Parker had one triple in his previous three  seasons and no steals in his two seasons with the Oakland A's.  </P> <P> Relapse of the Year: Lonnie Smith was the National League's comeback player of  the year with the Atlanta Braves in 1989 but he is now only platooning with  Oddibe McDowell in left field. Smith began a weekend series at San Diego  Thursday with a .228 batting average, one home run, 12 runs batted in and  almost as many strikeouts, 25, as hits, 27, in 118 at-bats. The league leader  in on-base percentage in 1989, his 1990 on-base percentage of .308 was only  eighth-best among Atlanta position players.  </P> <P> Braves II: Atlanta finished May with a 13-14 record, blowing a shot at its  first winning month since May 1987 by losing to the San Diego Padres, 2-1,  Thursday night. Only two of the current Braves, Dale Murphy and Andres Thomas,  were with the team when it had that last winning month, and only seven of the  current Braves were in the majors at that time.

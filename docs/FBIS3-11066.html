This information was released by Economic  Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch. Shortly before leaving for  Washington on 12 March, where he will prepare the final  agreement between Brazil and the IMF, he reported that the  surplus is the figure that was agreed upon with the mission that  visited the country two weeks ago. After meeting Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso on 16 March, IMF managing  director Michel Camdessus should give the green light of  approval for the Brazilian program, even before the IMF board  makes a formal announcement. Camdessus should immediately notify  the U.S. Treasury. Fristch expects that this will make the  Treasury issue the bonds that will guarantee the foreign debt  negotiations with foreign commercial banks, which will be  concluded in April. Fristch said the primary surplus will be  "strictly complied with" because the figures are "consistent and  credible."    The surplus, he said, will be obtained thanks to the fiscal  effort that reduced spending and capital costs, and increased  revenues thanks to the fight against tax evasion. According to  Fritsch, the program for the recovery of public utility rates  was essential for arriving at this surplus of $20.07 billion  because this recovery represented a significant improvement in  the financial performance of state-run companies.    The program that Brazil will submit to the IMF presupposes  that there will be currency stability, despite the fact that  Fristch did not say when this stability will be accomplished.  Fristch also referred to the evolution of inflation, exchange  rates, interest, and spending that is burdened by interest. The  surplus, he said, can become the basic source of funds for  paying the interest owed by the government and for possible  currency reserve increases.</p>

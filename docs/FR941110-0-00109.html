We arrived at this conclusion for several reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on public comments and further consideration on our part, we believe that the notion of perfect compliance, as discussed in the proposed rule, is an impractical and, perhaps, unrealistic standard for providers or prospective providers to meet. This is because in lieu of approximately 15 statutory requirements with which facilities had to comply before OBRA '87, the Act now sets forth more than 100 requirements that facilities have to meet in order to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. In fact, in 1992 only 7.3 percent of all nursing homes surveyed were deficiency-free. Under a regulatory system defined by condition and standard level requirements, such as the system in place for many years, we found that almost all facilities that were experiencing only minor problems did retain program eligibility since the system allowed for some noncompliance at the standard level. That is no longer the case. By vastly increasing the number of statutory requirements that facilities have to meet in order to meet the statutory definition of a SNF or NF, and by directing the Department to do away with its former hierarchy of requirements, the Congress made it far more difficult for facilities to meet prerequisites for program participation. As discussed above, however, we do not believe that the Congress intended to write into law a set of requirements that would eliminate almost all providers from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, we have drawn upon the principles enunciated by the Institute of Medicine in its study of nursing home regulation that helped spawn nursing home reform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A benchmark of the IoM study was its conclusion that the focus of nursing home regulation should be on resident outcomes and not procedural requirements that do not always accurately measure whether quality care is being rendered. Sections 1819 and 1919 of the Act, and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR Part 483, as well as our survey process, reflect this focus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the Act sets forth many examples of requirements which, if violated by a facility, would not necessarily expose a resident to the potential for anything more than minimal harm, much less actual harm. For example, &sect;1919(b)(3)(C) requires that a facility conduct a resident assessment for each individual no later than 14 days after admission. If a facility were to conduct almost all of its assessments in compliance with this requirement, but failed in the case of only one resident who was assessed on the 15th day after admission, a very narrow reading of the statute would compel a conclusion that the facility was out of compliance and thereby failed to meet the statutory definition of a nursing facility under &sect;1919(a) of the Act. This kind of approach to nursing home regulation, as we alluded to above, would be unduly harsh and impractical where the facility's failure did not expose the resident to any harm. Indeed, it may be the case that the facility prepared an exemplary assessment for the one resident for whom it acted untimely. The same type of analysis could be made for violations of the requirement at &sect;1919(c)(2)(B) regarding the requirement to be given at least 30 days in advance notice of a resident's transfer. Where in a given case, a facility gives 29 days advance notice, the question might better be, was there a potential for minimal harm as a result of this infraction rather than conclude that the Act was violated and expose the facility to one or more remedies, even where the resident experienced no more than the potential for minimal harm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

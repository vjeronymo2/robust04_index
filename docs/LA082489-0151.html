			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S HIRING HEATS UP COLLEGE BOARD RACE  </P> <P> The Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees campaign has barely started,  and already a dispute over the recent hiring of a college president threatens  to dominate the battle of two incumbents for re-election.  </P> <P> One board member has questioned whether incumbents Hilda Solis and Isabelle  Gonthier paid attention to what area residents wanted when they voted to hire  Alex Sanchez, a former vice president at the University of New Mexico in  Albuquerque, as college president.  </P> <P> "When I was talking to our community, the constituents said it would be nice if  we could have someone who knows our community," board member Ralph Pacheco  said. "I listened to my community."  </P> <P> The two, however, defend their decision, saying they chose Sanchez because he  was the best person for the job.  </P> <P> Solis said that Pacheco's comments are unwarranted and that she fears the race  will be marred by mudslinging and back-stabbing, with the disagreement over  Sanchez at the center of debate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Distasteful Situation'  </P> <P> "It is a distasteful situation," Solis said.  </P> <P> Eight people in addition to Solis and Gonthier are also running in the Nov. 7  election. Five of the candidates are vying for a seat being vacated by Marilee  Morgan, who is retiring after 14 years on the board. Solis, board president,  has two challengers. Gonthier, a two-term member, has one.  </P> <P> The dispute over Sanchez started last spring when Solis, Gonthier and Morgan  found themselves at odds with Pacheco and one other board member.  </P> <P> The three wanted to hire Sanchez, but Pacheco and Bill E. Hernandez favored Los  Angeles Community College District administrator Frank Alderete.  </P> <P> According to Pacheco, the two thought that Alderete was a better choice for the  heavily Latino college because he grew up in California and understood the  Latino community.  </P> <P> Sanchez, on the other hand, was a native of New Mexico and would need to learn  the area, Pacheco said.  </P> <P> The trustees voted 3 to 2 to hire Sanchez, who was described as an excellent  administrator.  </P> <P> "Alex Sanchez was by far the best candidate," Solis said. "That was the  overriding reason for hiring him.  </P> <P> "It's not a personal decision," she said. "In my mind it was a decision that  was best for the community."  </P> <P> The three board members also felt that Sanchez could serve as a "healer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lot of Integrity'  </P> <P> Morgan said at the time that Sanchez was "someone with a great deal of  community outreach, a lot of integrity and sincerity."  </P> <P> The two incumbents said they want to put the dispute behind them and deal with  other issues.  </P> <P> Negotiations with the college's teachers also could become a campaign issue.  </P> <P> The teachers' contract expired June 30, and although administrators have been  talking with union representatives to draw up a new agreement, nothing has been  completed. Sanchez said he hopes agreement can be reached in early September,  when both sides will meet formally.  </P> <P> Pacheco said the incumbents' performance during the negotiations will be  closely watched. "I'm optimistic that we will come to an agreement (with  teachers), but someone is going to have to give."  </P> <P> The negotiations "will test my colleagues' leadership," he added.  </P> <P> The following people have filed papers to run in the Rio Hondo Community  College Board of Trustees election:  </P> <P> Area 1: David Flores, Hilda Solis (incumbent) and Elizabeth Van Note.  </P> <P> Area 3: Isabelle Gonthier (incumbent) and Ceci Medina.  </P> <P> Area 5: Clair Buchholz, Louis Edward Caldera, Denos (Gus) Carras, Herb Griffith  and Barbara Stone.  </P></p>

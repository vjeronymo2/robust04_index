			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Tuesday renewed a call for contesting the next general  election for the House of Representatives under a new electoral  system constructed after years of political reform efforts.    "The last resort the premier can use when facing off with  parliament is the right to dissolve (the lower house) and I  won't throw this away," Hata said in a television interview.    But Hata, who has governed with minority support since late  April, said the public will be disillusioned if the next general  poll is contested under the current multiseat system and the  nation's years of political reform efforts are foiled.    An election under the existing system, which is soon to be  replaced by a new system combining single-seat constituencies  with proportional representation, "is not unimaginable," the  premier said. "(But) the next election should be contested under  the system of single-seat voting districts combined with  proportional representation," Hata said.    Although the Diet legislated in January a package of  electoral reform bills for the lower house, the additional  passage of a yet- to-be-formulated bill that redraws the  electoral map is required to allow the next election to be  lawfully contested under the new system.    The primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is  poised to file a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet  after the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national budget clears the  Diet on Thursday. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), a former  member of the ruling coalition and now the second largest  opposition force, has also threatened to bring down the Hata  government in a no-confidence vote.    The premier said he will continue efforts to bring the SDP  back into the fold, because in the last government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the SDP and other coalition  partners, including Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  managed to resolve differences over a host of key policy issues.    Hata also said he will welcome those who break away from the  LDP and join forces with the coalition if they are determined to  push for national reforms.    On the economic front, the premier spoke of the need to  increase indirect taxes so as not only to continue large-scale  income and residential tax cuts in 1995 and beyond but also to  secure revenue for future national reform programs.    Hata expressed hope that the tension on the Korean peninsula  will be defused after the United States and North Korea resume  high-level talks on Pyongyang's alleged push for nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- The "new suspicions" that  prompted Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to announce his  decision to resign concern "shady loans" made using 60 million  yen of Hosokawa's own personal funds, informed sources said  Friday [8 April].    The allegedly illegal loans were made by a person close to  the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to whom Hosokawa lent the  60 million yen, the sources said.    The person in turn lent the money from Hosokawa to other  people in a manner that may have violated a law governing the  legal qualifications for making such loans, they told Kyodo News  Service.    "There is the likelihood that the Hosokawa side entrusted  the  60 million yen to a person well versed in financial asset  management who was close to former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka  and then the person made the shady loans using the money," a  source said.    Hosokawa told a news conference Friday at which he made a  bombshell announcement of his intention to resign, "A new  problem has come to light. New suspicions have emerged that my  political office entrusted a certain person with managing my  personal financial means, raking in profits for a few years  since 1981."    "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some  illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked  for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would  definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said.    However, he declined to elaborate further on the specifics  of  the new suspicions, saying the investigation by his political  office was still under way.    The sources said Hosokawa and two of his relatives obtained  "some 400 million yen" from the 1982 sale of the Tekigaiso  estate of the wife of Hosokawa's grandfather, former Prime  Minister Fumimaro Konoe.    Hosokawa and the two relatives, including his younger  brother, Tadateru Konoe, decided to sell part of the Konoe  estate in March 1982 after the three inherited the estate  following the death of their grandmother Chiyoko Konoe in  September 1980, they said.    Hosokawa received some 202 million yen as his portion of the  400 million yen sale, the sources said.    After paying inheritance taxes, Hosokawa received 186  million  yen and placed it in a personal savings account.    Hosokawa then lent 64 million yen out of the money to one of  his political funds-raising organizations, while setting aside  the remaining 100 million yen as reserve funds from which he  planned to pay the income tax on the profits from the land sale,  they said.    However, Hosokawa spent 77 million yen out of the 100  million  yen to purchase a condominium in Tokyo's Moto-azabu [district]  in July 1982, they said.    After Hosokawa received 100 million yen from the Sagawa  Kyubin trucking group firm in late 1982, he made up the 77  million yen in order to return his tax payment reserve fund to  the original 100 million yen level, they said.    In March 1983, Hosokawa paid some 40 million yen in income  taxes on the sale of the estate and turned the remaining 60  million yen over to the person close to Tanaka in order to  profit from the person's asset management, the sources said.    "I think Prime Minister Hosokawa developed anxieties that  the  financial management of his personal funds by this person might  have violated the law regarding the qualifications of persons  allowed to lend money to others," one of the sources said.    In 1982, Hosokawa was a member of the Tanaka faction in the  House of Councillors. The following year, with Tanaka's  backing, Hosokawa ran a successful campaign to become governor  in Kumamoto Prefecture.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Inland Revenue union wins deal The main union in the Inland Revenue has won agreement for a path-breaking agreement with the US computer company EDS as part of the contracting out of the Revenue's computer operations. About 1,600 members of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation have voted by three to one to accept the deal with EDS which guarantees their existing conditions of employment. The union is particularly pleased it has a recognition deal as EDS is known in the US as a non-union company. About 1,000 staff will transfer to EDS on July 1, with another 800 staff moving over after 18 months.</p>

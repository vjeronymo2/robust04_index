			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with MTI Director General Karoly Alexa by Miklos </F> Vegh; place and date not given: "Party-Neutral National  Institution"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Vegh] Few people would  question the validity of the proposition that information is  power. It is by no means an accident that the print and  electronic media are constantly in the crossfire of party  politics. Meanwhile the MTI [Hungarian News Agency] has remained  unhurt.    [Alexa] It would be far-fetched to draw a direct parallel  between the missions of newspapers, radio, and television on the  one hand and the MTI on the other. Their functions in the  transmission of news are quite different. We, for instance, have  no direct contact with our readers. Here, in the case of news,  the decisions are practically forced ones. We are not the only  news service in the market, and it would not be in our best  business interest to let the truth content of our information be  compromised and our credibility damaged. Our more likely dilemma  is whether the necessarily variegated minor or major news  stories flowing in to us cover the whole truth; whether the  fragmentary events that thrust themselves into the forefront of  attention obscure our view of the national, regional or local  processes. But I wish to emphasize that we merely supply  information to those who use them "in sharp focus," one way or  another.    Far be it from me to claim that the people working here do  not and cannot form personal opinions. But specifically these  conflict-ridden days are the time when my directive became  effective, the one that spells out what occasions, affairs, and  forms in connection with the election campaign are incompatible  with the duties of our employees. We cannot afford to let any  political party accuse us of bias or prejudice. This directive  is in accord with the Public Employees Law, yet it also has  generated some resentment within our walls, because it clashes  with personal interest. But I refuse to make any concessions on  this issue... In the spirit of this same party-neutral attitude,  we held a conference with the political parties about what the  MTI will do as its duty, what we will offer to do voluntarily,  and what we will not do under any circumstances, regardless of  whatever pressure. This conference has been successful and "no  complaints will be accepted" after this agreement. We will  safeguard and strengthen the independence of this institution;  in the interest of objective and trustworthy reporting, we will  not yield to any blackmail.    [Vegh] Our interview is turning inevitably toward the coming  elections, in which the governing coalition that orchestrated  the change of political systems will draw up a balance sheet of  its performance. Our approaching national holiday on 15 March,  which is also Hungarian Press Day, might become yet another  casualty of the partisan skirmishes that are already plagued by  moral and political boorishness and falsehoods.    [Alexa] I must admit to having received numerous invitations  from many places to speak that day, but I have turned them down.  I do not find any such direct analogy with the change of our  fortune in 1848 as I did in March 1989. To be more exact, I feel  that the most appropriate way of celebrating the anniversary  these days would be with diligent work rather than with pompous  speeches. There certainly is less need for personal sacrifices.  After all, awareness of our numerous losses is also decisive  when preparing the balance sheet of the past four years. Here I  am referring primarily to the death of Prime Minister Jozsef  Antall. It is symbolically intertwined also with my own fortune,  because I seem to be his last appointment to high state office.  Indeed, when I received my nomination, the inkspots next to his  signature seemed to suggest that this had been practically the  last pen stroke he ever made. I was already in this chair when I  learned of his death. I found it extremely disturbing that this  historical loss suddenly became an item of daily news that had  to be processed.    At the same time I am observing with hope how the country's  fortunes are developing, and I sincerely want to see the country  preserve and strengthen its ability to function. Let more and  more people realize that what is happening in Hungary is their  common undertaking; and let no one labor under the delusion that  the various functionaries rallying around different banners are  about to attack him. Let everyone bear in mind that here we are  now jointly writing the history that will become our children's  and grandchildren's history lesson that will lend itself to  accurate assessment. If we wish to avoid disappointment for  ourselves and posterity, we must do our work with less bluster  and in closer mutual understanding. In this respect it gladdens  me to see that the governing coalition is standing behind Peter  Boross with fewer convulsions, less anxiety, and more  self-assurance than previously. Practically every party has been  disturbed by the extremists in its own ranks, to such an extent  that even the opposition has been forced to purge its own  ranks--the moderates are the ones now in control.    Regarding the Hungarian media in conjunction with all this,  I  am obliged to establish that they are being exposed to ever  greater political pressure. All sorts of groups are striving to  win the media over, to annex them, to convert them into their  own organs. Day by day, this is threatening freedom of the press  in that stage of its evolution where journalists do not yet  realize what freedom of the press actually means. It does not  mean their ability to say anything in the same organ, rather  their ability to say the same thing anywhere they find a forum.  That is also the lesson of the "revolts" about the  public-service media.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Birkby turns in threefold gain to Pounds 3.3m Birkby, the space management and hire purchase company, announced pre-tax profits up threefold to Pounds 3.3m for the year to March 31, and said that all divisions were experiencing record sales for the first 13 weeks of the year. The company completed the Pounds 58.7m purchase of In-Shops in March, and management said that occupancy levels had already improved from 78 per cent to 82 per cent on In Shops' retail management portfolio. In addition, Mr Bill Cran, chief executive, said In-Shops should achieve administrative cost savings of Pounds 1.4m a year, of which up to Pounds 1m would come through during the current year. Following the acquisition, Birkby has emerged as a Pounds 118m capitalised company focusing on the provision of premises, credit and services for small businesses or retailers. Turnover for the year increased 26 per cent to Pounds 14.7m, aided by contributions from Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle leasing company acquired in July, and In Shops. The space management operations saw occupancy rise to 94 per cent, and pre-tax profit from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 809,000. Every 1 per cent increase in occupancy from In Shops means another Pounds 260,000 of income. The vehicle hire business, which started with the rationale of offering services to tenants, contributed Pounds 1.8m, of which about Pounds 1.6m came from Hill Hire. Profits were held back by a Pounds 525,000 loss - primarily the write-off of goodwill - on the sale of businesses from Finlan, which was taken over by Birkby in August 1992. Birkby's gearing has fallen from 46 per cent to 41 per cent. Earnings per share improved from 11.1p to 11.8p. A recommended final dividend of 4.8p makes a total 6p, an increase of 70 per cent. COMMENT Birkby has delivered all its promises so far, and the company is promising a lot more. It has carried the costs of the In Shops acquisition, and has already improved earnings potential. With full year contributions from In Shops and Hill Hire this year, profits could reach Pounds 8.6m, putting the shares on a p/e of 15. It is a cyclical business with little asset backing, and the outlook could change from a likely increase in competition and rental pressure on leased properties. But Birkby has found a good formula and the current rating seems justified.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard is directed to reconcile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for safe access routes with the needs of all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable uses of the area involved, and has the experience in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the areas of vessel traffic management, navigation, and ship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling. Also, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration (NOAA) has been directed by the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commerce (DOC) to identify and designate as national marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctuaries areas of the marine environment and implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinated plans for the protection and management of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. Finally, marine vessels operating in or near an IMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved TSS (traffic separation scheme) are subject to Rule 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sea. EPA is working with all three groups to ensure that ships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking to move further offshore can travel freely and safely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing two different discount strategies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage ships to move off Ventura's coast. The two methods are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed because it is difficult to quantify the appropriate fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, EPA does not know the impact of any fee on shippers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, EPA cannot quantify the exact benefits of moving further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Ventura. Finally, EPA cannot compare effects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discounting on emissions reductions for Los Angeles and Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on the fee most likely to move shippers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offshore of Ventura while still maintaining an incentive to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low emission ships in the area. As described above, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor the fee structure and change it to achieve the intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air quality benefits. The first option is a discount of 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent from the fee otherwise applicable to any ship (before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hotelling discount is applied) for ships staying 70 miles from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shore and outside the Ventura Air Basin (under this option a 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent fee is applied to ships in the low emission category).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second option would restrict any discounts to those ships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which avoided the Ventura Air Basin. Thus even a ship in the low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission category would pay the highest fee if it entered the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura Air Basin (under this option a 0 percent fee would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to ships in the low emission category). This option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also offer a 50 percent reduction to ships which avoided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basin. Under both options, any ship in the low fee category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which cold ironed and stayed out of the Ventura Air Basin would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay no fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also considering the option of requiring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping move outside of the air basin when not berthing or at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> port. To the extent that no fee structure is fully achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its goals, such a requirement may be necessary. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on this option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Other Non-Air Base Military Installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on the feasibility and desirability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing a similar emission control strategy for military  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bases in the FIP areas with non-aircraft mobile sources of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, such as the Navy's construction base at Port Hueneme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (with the exception of military vessels due to national security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns as described for military aircraft), which is similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that proposed for military air bases. These bases could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the proposed military air base control program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section III.D.4.e.(2)(c) simply by expanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of covered facilities to include all sources operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Department of Defense in the control areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Impact of the Economic Incentive Programs Rule on Fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Programs in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fee programs contained in today's proposal will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacted by the rules and procedures established in EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economic Incentives Program (EIP) Rulemaking (NPRM_58 FR 11110,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 23, 1993; NFRM due March 15, 1994). The EIP includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency's guidance on fee programs and the requirements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be met in order for them to be approvable as a SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is EPA's intention that the FIP abide by these guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions. The EIP, as applied to the FIP, requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reductions credited to an economic incentive program be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surplus to the reductions required by, and credited to, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan provisions to avoid double counting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions; quantifiable; enforceable at both the State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal levels; consistent with SIP attainment and RFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrations; and permanent within the timeframe specified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program. These provisions address primarily the case of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic incentive program in which emission sources are allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to generate and trade emission reduction credits to show  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with emission targets. The proposed FIP does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain such a credits trading program. In addition, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly relevant to the fee programs in the proposed FIP, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvable emissions fee program must contain a provision that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounts for the uncertainties inherent in such programs, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> auditing procedure, and reconciliation procedures; and must also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain an implementation schedule and administrative procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of these requirements is summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

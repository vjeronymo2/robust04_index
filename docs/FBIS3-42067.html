Kim temporarily returned to Seoul last week to brief the  government on recent developments in Russia and to coordinate  Seoul's policy toward Moscow.    The Paris Club will provide a rough guideline on repayment  schedule for South Korea, Kim told a press conference, and an  inter-ministerial discussion with Finance and Trade, Industry  and Resources Ministries will find various alternatives.    Seoul promised 3 billion U.S. dollars in financial aid to  the  former communist country but delivered only 1.47 billion dollars  and suspended the rest at the collapse of the Soviet Union.    Seoul has received a list of arms Russia offered for joint  development and production, another alternative to loan  repayment, but the government will need prudent review before  making any decision, said Kim.    On North Korea-Russia relations, the envoy said Moscow  proposed vice minister-level talks to North Korea from this year  but is yet to receive a reply.    ``North Korea and Russia are gradually restoring their  relations of dialogue,'' he told reporters.    Moscow has not abandoned human rights issue with Pyongyang  and is determined to insert the rights clause for the workers in  a new agreement on operating North Korean lumber yard, he said.    President Boris Yeltsin said he wants his South Korean  counterpart Kim Yong-sam to make certain to visit Russia this  year, and the two countries will consult on this issue, he said.</p>

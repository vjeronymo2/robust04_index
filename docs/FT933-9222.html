			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Palestinians widen peace wrangling DIVIDED Palestinian leaders last night were thrashing out fundamental differences over how to handle peace negotiations with Israel for a third straight night. The talks were widened yesterday to include more officials, who flew into Tunis for the 'serious and decisive' discussions. The Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation said the talks now involved a majority of the negotiating delegation with Israel and most of the PLO's executive committee. It said the talks were aiming at healing a severe rupture in Palestinian ranks and hammering out an agreed negotiating strategy. PLO officials and a member of the negotiating team confirmed that three top peace negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories had offered to resign at a meeting in Tunis on Sunday night. Palestinian officials said the resignation threat by Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mr Saeb Erekat, had disturbed PLO leader Yassir Arafat and shaken Palestinian leaders inside and outside the territories. Most Palestinians believe the three negotiators are using the resignation threat in a power play to force Mr Arafat to strengthen their role in the negotiating process. The delegates feel they must be consulted more in the future rather than being treated as go-betweens delivering messages from Mr Arafat to the Israelis and the US. But last night's talks also focussed on divisions over whether progress with Israel can be made without direct PLO involvement and without immediate commencement of talks on a final, rather than an interim, settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Also due for discussion were calls by Palestinians in the occupied territories for fundamental reforms of the bureaucratic and authoritarian PLO. Palestinian officials said the three negotiators felt upset about the way Mr Arafat had undermined their position last week by presenting a slightly more moderate position paper to the US through the Egyptian president without adequate prior consultation. In the PLO document, which lays the framework for an interim five-year period of Palestinian self-rule, Mr Arafat appears to take a more flexible position on how to deal with the sensitive issue of Arab versus Jewish claims over control of Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem during the interim phase. Some Palestinians suspect Mr Arafat's more moderate position was made to curry favour with Egypt and the US, which backs a postponement of discussing who should control East Jerusalem until talks on a final settlement, due to begin three years into the interim phase. They say the moderate position taken by the PLO also reflects the way the PLO leadership in exile has lost touch with the situation in the territories and is increasingly eager to strike a deal. Palestinian negotiators from the territories believe their agreement to such a concession to Israel would be political suicide, given the growing strength of extremists and Islamic fundamentalists inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The three Palestinian negotiators are also frustrated at what Mr Husseini has called being a 'mailman' for Mr Arafat rather than a full partner in the negotiating strategy. Many Palestinians wonder whether Mr Arafat, who is concerned about a possible alternative Palestinian leadership during an interim phase, is committed to the process or is trying to ensure continuing deadlock as a way of forcing the US and Israel to open a direct dialogue with the PLO. Palestinians from the territories support the inclusion of the PLO in the process but believe that democratic reforms in the liberation movement must be implemented quickly. Another issue due to be discussed last night was the so-called 'Gaza First' option - a proposal to hand over full power to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip quickly and before a final settlement in the West Bank.</p>

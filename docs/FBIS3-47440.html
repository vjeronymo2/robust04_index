Kim had lunch with former Presidents No, Chon Tu-hwan and  Choe Kyu-ha at Chongwadae [presidential office] on Monday, and  explained the policy of his government.    No said he was sorry his people had burdened Kim and blamed  his own "lack of virtue" for their wrongdoings.    Kim did not respond in detail.    "The president's unchangeable firm belief is that there  cannot be exceptions, according to the principle of equity, in  dealing with those who are on trial for their irregularities and  obviously violated the law," a member of the presidential staff  said. "The cases of former government officials will be dealt  with in strict fairness under the law and according to the  principle of justice without sanctuary."</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Insider dealing in UK gilts alleged THE BANK of England has received reports of alleged insider dealing in the gilts market before Thursday's announcement of the Treasury's Pounds 7.27bn foreign currency funding. The allegations of trading based on advanced knowledge of the announcement centre on one of the four UK clearing banks and two foreign banks. Gilt prices rose more than two points on Thursday after the announcement. The currency programme could make up as much as 25 per cent of this year's public sector borrowing requirement, reducing supply in the gilts market. The banks involved in the initial part of the programme, a DM10bn syndicated facility, had been in talks with the Bank for a week ahead of the announcement. However, any insider knowledge may be hard to prove unless purchases of gilts before the announcement were unusually large. 'If a formal complaint is made to the Bank of England we will, of course, investigate it very thoroughly,' a Bank official said last night.</p>

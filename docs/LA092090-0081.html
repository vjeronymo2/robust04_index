			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVIST TEACHER DEVELOPS PLAN TO CONSERVE ENERGY, WATER AT SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: LARRY BRIM WORKED WITH THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER  TO DEVELOP A HANDBOOK THAT INSTRUCTORS AND STUDENTS CAN USE.  </P> <P> In the late 1960s, Larry Brim was inspired by news stories about a mysterious  environmental activist in northern Illinois who for years dumped dead fish in  the offices of industries that polluted the Fox River.  </P> <P> Brim, a science teacher at Irving Junior High in Atwater Village, still holds  the activist, who was never identified, in high regard. And while his methods  may not be as radical, Brim has designed a curriculum for Los Angeles schools  that he hopes is just as successful in sparking passion about conservation.  </P> <P> Through a privately funded fellowship, Brim worked this summer with the Los  Angeles Department of Water and Power to develop a handbook for schools on  saving water and energy.  </P> <P> The book offers 11 lessons on conservation that teachers can use in their  science and math courses, and tells how instructors can request speakers and  plan field trips to enhance the curriculum.  </P> <P> It also encourages art and writing contests and student assemblies, plays and  debates about conservation. And its main feature, according to Brim, is a  series of checklists that students can use to audit water and energy use at  their schools.  </P> <P> If administrators cooperate, students can learn to read meters, test school  pipes and sinks for leaks, survey campus landscaping and design programs for  recycling -- all in an effort to make schools more efficient and  energy-conscious.  </P> <P> "The idea is for schools to save water and energy. A lot of times schools are  saving, but up to now there hasn't been a systematic way" to conserve, Brim  said.  </P> <P> Brim, 44, spent more than six weeks at the DWP's Hope Street headquarters,  learning about low-energy lighting, meter reading and low-flow shower heads,  and teaching utility officials how water conservation can best be taught to  students and administrators.  </P> <P> He was one of 35 fellows of the Industry Initiatives for Science and Math  Education, which places teachers in businesses or industries as interns who  then implement what they learned in their classrooms. The program is funded by  the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a group that recruits private sector  funds for public education projects.  </P> <P> "We're in a crisis mode and the fourth year of a drought," Walter Zeisl,  supervisor of educational services for the DWP, said of the fellowship program.  "This is a year that we've got to have a special emphasis on conservation,  especially in the schools."  </P> <P> Developing multidisciplinary courses is nothing new to Brim, a science teacher  with a master's degree in history and a passion for philosophy. After serving  as a Peace Corps volunteer in Liberia in the late 1960s, he returned to the  West African country in 1976 as a science curriculum specialist.  </P> <P> Ten years later, Brim won a small grant to develop a course that uses art to  teach the history of science. Today, another grant is helping Brim create a  lesson that will blend philosophy, ecology and science. In that course,  students will study the trials of Socrates, Galileo and John Scopes, and will  write and produce a scenario in which earth is put on trial for committing  "crimes," such as earthquakes, against man.  </P> <P> "I'm interested in the big questions, such as, 'What is man's role in nature?'  " Brim said. "But it's a real challenge to interest students in those. What you  can interest them in is things that affect them immediately and directly. If  they learn to read meters at school, they can read them at home, and perhaps  save their families some money."  </P> <P> The DWP will distribute in October several copies of the handbook to all public  and private schools in Los Angeles, and Brim said he already has scheduled  student field trips to DWP facilities and begun incorporating ecology lessons  into his science curriculum.  </P> <P> But getting teachers and administrators interested in the handbook may be  another challenge, he said.  </P> <P> The book suggests that a staff member be appointed at each school to oversee  the use of an energy conservation curriculum. But Brim acknowledged that most  teachers may not have time to assume that role or develop special classroom  projects on conservation.  </P> <P> So he is counting on financial incentives, among other things, to spark  interest. The Los Angeles Unified School District's own Energy Incentive  Program gives money to schools that reduce their water, gas and electricity use  by at least 10%. And the DWP will provide water bottles and decal stickers to  public and private schools that use Brim's handbook.  </P> <P> "This can be helpful to save the environment," Brim said. "My feeling is that  we can do something, and this is one small step."  </P></p>

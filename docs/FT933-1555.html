			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone There is something perverse about a mobile phone which is designed to be used at home. That seems to be the logic of Vodafone's new MetroDigital service which has been launched to rival Mercury's One-2-One. Vodafone is inviting users to nominate a home cell - some of which in London seem barely bigger than a broom cupboard - and calls within the home cell will be much cheaper than those made outside. By limiting the usefulness of the system's mobility Vodafone is trying both to tackle the cheapness and appeal of One-2-One while protecting the very high profitability of its national analogue network. Its offer, however, lacks the simplicity and marketing appeal of One-2-One's headline-grabbing launch. Consumers already bemused by the technology may thus shy away from this overly fussy idea. Perhaps that is part of the idea. Vodafone's main interest must be in the pan-European Euro-Digital system, on which MetroDigital is piggy-backed. To the extent that MetroDigital muddies the waters on pricing perception and spoils the impact of One-2-One it will help Vodafone's cause. Consumers may, however, be deterred by Vodafone's use of third party salesmen while One-2-One is sold directly by Mercury. Yet if the initial enthusiastic response to One-2-One is any guide, there is a large potential market out there. Whether Vodafone can capture enough of that to offset the erosion of its excessive margins on the existing analogue network is more doubtful.</p>

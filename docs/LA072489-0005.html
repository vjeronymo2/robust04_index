			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BOMBER FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, TODAY;  </P> <P> B-2 WILL UPDATE OUR STRATEGIC TRIAD -- AND THAT'S THE BARGAIN  </P> <P> The B-2 stealth bomber has now made its first flight -- a major step in the  complicated process of weapons-system acquisition. Because of the long time  from conception to reality of a new system, especially true when nuclear  capability is involved, many opinions are offered as to the potential value of  the system. This is now the case with the B-2. For that reason, I want to  review the facts of why the B-2 is necessary for the nation.  </P> <P> For more than 30 years, the nation has depended on a triad of strategic forces  -- a mix of manned bombers and land- and sea-based missiles. This robust  posture confounds any potential attacker and provides the United States with a  wide range of options and capability. Each part of the triad offers distinct  and complementary advantages. (See accompanying chart.)  </P> <P> Of the three elements of the triad, the bomber provides the most potent and  unique combination of range, heavy payload, accuracy and mix of weapons. Most  important, the crew in the cockpit makes the bomber a wide-ranging, recallable  and reusable system of enormous flexibility.  </P> <P> Why, then, the B-2? Under secret development for over 10 years, the stealth  bomber continues a program of strategic modernization that has been  "blueprinted" across both Republican and Democratic Administrations. Each leg  of the triad, in order to be more effective or reliable, has been improved. For  the bomber force, the B-2 is a sophisticated approach made possible by a  technologically advanced America. The B-2 provides all the desirable qualities  of a manned and penetrating bomber well into the 21st Century.  </P> <P> The B-2 is compatible with strategic arms limitation initiatives that seem  achievable in the 1990s. Both sides recognize that fast-flying ballistic  missiles are the most destabilizing weapons and, therefore, both sides seek  maximum restrictions on their numbers. On the other hand, each side understands  the stabilizing, non-first-strike nature of the penetrating bomber.  </P> <P> Yet our current bomber force is, on average, a quarter of a century old and  being retired rapidly. Of the 372 aircraft remaining, 48 FB-111s are slated for  transfer to the tactical air forces and 61 B-52s are dedicated to a  conventional role. (Fourteen of these aircraft will phase out of service this  year.) Most disturbing is the fact that a large number of B-52s, most with  air-launched cruise missile capability, are expected to go to the boneyard over  the next several years. The few B-52s remaining will move from a penetrating  role to a standoff mission (or a conventional role), leaving only the B-1 to  penetrate in the mid-to late-'90s. With the addition of at least 132 B-2s, the  synergism of the triad will be maintained and the highly developed and  expensive Soviet air defense network will be much less effective.  </P> <P> For a deterrent force of this value, the B-2 investment will necessarily be  substantial. However, "sticker shock" assertions require analysis. There are  useful methods to fairly portray the B-2's affordability. For example, with  respect to cost per potential warhead delivered, the B-2 force is about equal  to the B-1 force and actually less than some modernized ballistic-missile  systems.  </P> <P> In relation to the just acquired B-1, the B-2 cost is about 25% greater: That's  money well spent to buy an enduring and unique nuclear and conventional  capability.  </P> <P> On balance, we should spend for defense only what we must to ensure our  security. If we prudently invest and create strategic leverage in our favor,  that's good. The nuclear and conventional combat capability of our strategic  bomber force provides us with such leverage. Long-range bomber striking power  -- the ability to reach anywhere in the world in a few hours -- is integral to  future security. With its low observable characteristics and modern bomber  capabilities of intercontinental range, the B-2 can respond with a full  spectrum of retaliatory capability. It can deal with terrorist acts or global  conflict.  </P> <P> I need a warplane whose performance, reliability and maintainability will meet  the demanding needs validated over a decade of development and experience.  Continued prudence will be essential to manage the pace of manufacturing,  testing and deployment of this bomber. The B-2 is too important to be driven by  artificial timeliness or unrealistic goals. It will be in the employ of the  nation for many years.  </P> <P> With the rollout of the B-2 last November, and now its first flight, a major  milestone in aviation history has taken place. In retrospect, the first flight  of the B-2 will be viewed as a revolutionary moment as important as the  transition from propeller-driven to jet aircraft. We will learn much along the  way as we work with this exciting new bomber.  </P> <P> Let us now reap the benefits of long years of effort, expense and bipartisan  support. The B-2 is here and it makes eminently good sense for our nation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPARISON OF STRATEGIC WEAPONS  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.98IN:2.11IN:2.66IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>

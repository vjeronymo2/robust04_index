			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: Alvin Ailey Dance Company - Ballet AFTER 30 years Revelations is still there. When we first saw the Alvin Ailey Dance Company in the Sixties, Revelations won our hearts. Ailey's response to the spirituals which are his musical text, to the radiant faith and urgent doubts of black religious experience, had - and still has - a stunning directness. The arms raised to the sky in supplication or joy; the sense of delight combined with reverence in the scenes of baptism, as white-clad figures wade through the waters; the contrast, as the work ends, between an awareness of sin and the gospel fervour of a congregation of women with their floppy hats, palm fans and long yellow dresses, are unerringly aimed at our emotions, and unerringly touch them. It is dance reaching out to its public on the most basic, and most artful, terms. But for all its stylistic polish and theatrical astuteness - every cliche brightly burnished - it speaks profoundly about black America's faith. And it remains central to what Ailey sought in his American Dance Theatre, in giving the broadest expression to popular dance and a people's identity. Returned to London after 17 years, with a new generation of dancers (and with Ailey's star, Judith Jamison, as director) the company knows it is still loved here. It responded in its opening programme, which I saw on Wednesday at the Coliseum, with that open-hearted, physically eager manner we have always associated with Ailey's artists. How good to see Dudley Williams, the company's senior principal, masterly as ever in his control of 'I want to be ready' in Revelations, his body tautly responsive to the song's plea for redemption. How good, too, to find three men - Dwight Roden, Desmond Richardson, Troy Powell - able to fly with the best through 'Sinner Man' in this same work, movement given a whip-lash sharpness and speed. Technically, the company looks fine, frank in its delight in performing Revelations. Would that the other pieces in this first programme offered the dancers any sort of artistic challenge, other than that of selling them to a receptive audience. Donald McKayle's District Storyville, which dates from 1962, purports to deal with the emergence of jazz from New Orleans' bordellos and funeral music. It amounts to a sequence of scenes that are no more than garish post-cards. Mourners strut; tarts flaunt; a bed serves as a trampoline for lovers, and we see a few desultory bumps and grinds, those hallowed gyrations of burlesque strippers. It is superficial, superficially busy, and, I would have thought, far too patronising in its pursuit of quaintness. Everyone works very hard, not least the London Gala Orchestra which has a high old time with a raucous score. Marilyn Banks, as one of the soiled doves in the bordello, has the smile and the zippy grace of Josephine Baker, and is adorable. The remaining piece is Donald Byrd's recent Dance at the Gym. Four girls and four boys meet,and finally unite, to a tiresome and clanking accompaniment. The movement proposes an artificial sexiness, and the dancers are trapped in unenterprising routines that have little dramatic or emotional power; not even the Ailey dancers' skills can make it seem anything more than an expense of spirit in a waste of shame. Happily, there is Revelations to follow, and the company thereby reasserts its identity. The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre is at the London Coliseum, (071) 240 5248, until August 1. Programme changes on Monday July 27.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Predrag Lucic, FERAL TRIBUNE deputy editor, </F> by Stevica Susa; place and date not given: "Mobilization in  FERAL TRIBUNE"]    [Text] Two days ago, the Croatian police conscripted Viktor  Ivancic, editor in chief of the satirical newspaper FERAL  TRIBUNE. Because of its sharp and uncompromising language, the  FERAL TRIBUNE is becoming ever more popular in Croatia and  Slovenia. It is also a thorn in the side of the Croatian regime  because of its critical and oppositional views. Predrag Lucic,  the FERAL TRIBUNE deputy editor, in an interview with DELO,  stated the motivation for drafting Ivancic and explained the  position of the independent media in Croatia.    [Susa] Can you confirm the press agency report that Viktor  Ivancic, the FERAL TRIBUNE chief editor, is now in the Croatian  Army's Dracevac barracks in Split?    [Lucic] The above-mentioned press agency report is  unfortunately true. Viktor Ivancic is in the Dracevac barracks  now. He was brought there by the military police in accordance  with a draft order of 31 December 1993. His call-up creates a  precedent in Croatian public life. It is the first time that an  editor of a publication was conscripted to be sent to the  battlefield. I visited Viktor in the barracks this morning. The  uniform suits him beautifully. I think that the Croatian Army  has now gained a great deal and has the possibility of winning  the war in Bosnia. Instead of the FERAL's slogan "Viva Ludez"  [craziness], Viktor is now proudly proclaiming "Viva Tudjman."    [Susa] Ivancic was born in Sarajevo; according to some  sources, Croats born in Bosnia are being drafted now.    [Lucic] This is true. The Helsinki Watch Committee has  documented many such incidents. The Croatian Government has many  reasons for drafting Ivancic. Viktor is born in Sarajevo. He has  been living in Croatia since 1971 and is a Croatian citizen. I  think that he was drafted to remove him from his position, which  is not only immoral but also illegal. According to a Croatian  law, an editor of a publication cannot be replaced if such  replacement is not registered with the proper ministry. Of  course, we have not done that.    [Susa] Will the drafting of Ivancic have a major impact on  the publishing and editorial policy of the FERAL TRIBUNE?    [Lucic] Most texts for the FERAL TRIBUNE are prepared by the  group Viva Ludez group, which is composed of Viktor Ivancic,  Boris Dezulovic, and myself. Teamwork is now impossible. I think  that a long absence by Viktor Ivancic could mean that the paper  would cease publication. However, the next issue is ready to be  printed, and it will certainly be distributed.    [Susa] Will you write about the drafting of your editor in  the next issue?    [Lucic] Of course. Right now I am working on an article  about  the conscription of Gojko Susak, Croatian defense minister, who  is, by the way, a Croatian citizen although born in Siroki  Brijeg in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Feral will publicly demand that he  be demobilized and allowed to do his job, in other words, the  government should not interfere with the autonomous editorial  policy of the Defense Ministry.    [Susa] Since FERAL is very critical of the government, it is  considered state enemy number one by some Croatian state media.  Do you approve of this?    [Lucic] I think that since Ivancic has been drafted, we  should no longer be considered a state enemy. Apparently, FERAL  employees are the key people who will finish the war in Bosnia  to Croatia's benefit. From this moment on, we are thinking only  about the war. I am joking. We have always been against  interfering in the internal affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  it seems that we are paying for it now. FERAL has followed a  long and thorny path, from winning Croatia's highest  journalistic award to becoming an enemy of the state. However, I  do think that this is normal, considering who is in power today.  If you are half-way normal, you have to oppose them. FERAL will  remain, and despite everything, respond to the authorities in  its own style. We will see who will outlast whom.    [Susa] Do you approve of FERAL being sold together with the  Belgrade VREME in Ljubljana kiosks?    [Lucic] Not as much as before. In my view, they have lost  credibility since they published Arkan's advertisement. FERAL  would never publish a party's advertisement for any money.  However, VREME is still, without doubt, by far the best Serbian  paper. After all, its editor, Petar Lukovic, writes regularly  for FERAL.    [Susa] What would you wish for FERAL in the new year?    [Lucic] Fewer of our staff being drafted and more good and  witty texts, more moderate than mostly cloudy weather. My  message to Slovenes: "Long live Janez Jansa!"</p>

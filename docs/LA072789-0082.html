			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SOCIETY CRUMBLING' AMID FEAR AND BLOODSHED IN SRI LANKA  </P> <P> The gruesome remains smoldered outside the tea shop for more than 12 hours  before finally being removed by police. It was the body of a young man with a  gasoline-soaked truck tire bound to his chest and set ablaze.  </P> <P> The flaming body was dumped along Sri Lanka's main coastal road for all to see,  as a message from the nation's security forces, the old man who runs the tea  shop explained, adding that to give his name would be to risk his life.  </P> <P> The message: Don't fight us, or you will be next.  </P> <P> It was not the only such message along the palm-lined road this week. A few  miles to the north, three similarly bound bodies also smoldered in the summer  sun, symbols of the violence that is driving this Indian Ocean island nation to  economic and political ruin.  </P> <P> As Sri Lanka faces a deepening confrontation with India in a desperate effort  to put down an ethnic insurgency in the island's northern region, an even  bloodier counterinsurgency continues to consume the government in the south.  </P> <P> In the last six weeks alone, at least 1,500 people have been shot, beheaded or  tortured to death. An estimated 10,000 have been jailed since President  Ranasinghe Premadasa declared a state of emergency last month to crack down on  the leftist counterinsurgency.  </P> <P> "Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there is this fear psychosis," a Sri  Lankan diplomat said. "A tiny rumor paralyzes Colombo (the capital) for an  entire day or more. And everywhere, you hear the same thing: 'There is no  future here.' "  </P> <P> In the words of another diplomat: "The country really is falling apart. It's a  society that's crumbling."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lines at Embassies  </P> <P> Soldiers carrying automatic rifles are seen everywhere on city streets, country  roads and village lanes. Lines of people trying to get out of the country form  daily at the U.S. and European embassies, and the visa seekers tell horror  stories of being wounded or threatened.  </P> <P> The most immediate crisis in a nation once so idyllic that Mark Twain dubbed it  "Serendip" is in the north, where the six-year-old war with armed members of  Sri Lanka's Tamil minority has divided the island in two.  </P> <P> Premadasa, in a fit of anger and frustration, last month demanded that India  withdraw its 50,000 troops from the northern third of the island. They  constitute a "peacekeeping force" that Premadasa's predecessor allowed into Sri  Lanka in a desperate effort to end the Tamil struggle for a separate homeland.  </P> <P> Premadasa set this Saturday as the deadline for the withdrawal, which he  believes is crucial to putting down the potentially more devastating  counterinsurgency by the majority Sinhalese in the south -- a guerrilla war  that has been fueled in part by India's military presence in the north.  </P> <P> Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has flatly refused to pull out. Gandhi, who  is facing an election this year and hopes to win the support of the 60 million  Tamils in India, insists that if the troops withdraw, Sri Lanka's  Sinhalese-dominated security forces will slaughter the island's Tamils. Many  analysts here agree.  </P> <P> Although the controversy has bolstered charges that India is acting  increasingly like a regional bully, Premadasa has been criticized by diplomats,  Sri Lankan analysts and his own party leaders for acting rashly and hinting at  war.  </P> <P> Few analysts in Sri Lanka believe that war is possible between the two  mismatched countries. India has the fourth-largest army in the world, and Sri  Lanka's combined military forces are smaller than India's peacekeeping  contingent.  </P> <P> But diplomats and many Sri Lankan officials said Premadasa's stubborn stance  illustrates a streak of irrationality that is helping drive his country into  chaos.  </P> <P> Indian officials insist that Premadasa, who emphasizes his grass-roots origins  and Buddhist beliefs, has gone mad.  </P> <P> Citing recent speeches in which Premadasa pledged to publicly immolate himself  in an effort to save his nation, one senior Indian official said: "It's more  than odd. It's crazy. We can't help but come to the conclusion that the man is  touched. And no one accepts the fact that Premadasa is in control. The  (Sinhalese insurgents) are more in control than he is."  </P> <P> On that point, it seems, nearly everyone in Colombo agrees -- on that and the  fact that the Sinhalese insurgency by the leftist People's Liberation Front  that began in the south will continue to be Sri Lanka's most critical issue  regardless of the outcome of this week's conflict.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Isolated From Society  </P> <P> Some of Premadasa's Cabinet ministers say privately that he has become isolated  from every major element in Sri Lankan society, including members of both  ethnic groups, his own party members and senior military commanders.  </P> <P> Even Buddhist monks, traditionally the conscience of Sri Lankan society, have  turned on Premadasa in large numbers. More than 5,000 of them took to the  streets Monday, carrying signs attacking the government and pledging to fight  alongside the Sinhalese rebels. The Sinhalese are predominantly Buddhist; the  Tamils are Hindu.  </P> <P> Clearly, the principal beneficiary of the political vacuum has been the  People's Liberation Front, a highly secretive movement that is structured along  Marxist lines but is a populist insurgency that uses fear as a method of  control.  </P> <P> In the south, where the Sinhalese rebel movement began, it is the front that  imposes curfews, adjudicates disputes, punishes criminal offenders, taxes  businesses and, in general, is the government.  </P> <P> With such dramatic growth of what the Sri Lankans now call their  "sub-government," the Sri Lankan economy -- once so promising that analysts  expected this to become another Singapore -- is now a disaster area.  Unemployment is nearing 40% in the south and 50% in the north.  </P> <P> But it is in the area of human rights that the desperation of Premadasa's  policies can be seen most starkly -- instances such as the body burnings that  have become so commonplace in recent months. On the average, diplomats and Sri  Lankan officials say, there are 40 political killings a day, many of them  carried out by government security forces.  </P> <P> Kalutara, a 45-minute drive south of the capital, is believed to be on the  cutting edge of the People's Liberation Front's steady march toward Colombo.  </P> <P> At the tea shop where the body smoldered, the old shopkeeper summed up the  nation's reaction to the deepening turmoil.  </P> <P> "It is fear," he said, nodding toward where the corpse lay. "Fear of both  sides, all sides. We cannot speak. We cannot even pick up such a thing and give  it a decent burial. If you pick it up today, it will be you tomorrow."  </P> <P> At the local police station, the deputy superintendent said his officers had no  choice but to leave bodies at the roadside.  </P> <P> "We are a poor country," he said, "and we lack the facilities."  </P> <P> When asked who had burned the bodies, he smiled and shrugged, looking away from  the half-dozen truck tires stacked beside two large gasoline drums a few feet  from the front door of his police station.  </P></p>

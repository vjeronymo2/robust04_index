			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Russians defend the rouble with a flood of US dollars Russia's central bank made its most forceful intervention in the history of Moscow's infant currency exchange yesterday when it flooded the market with US dollars to counteract a sharp fall in the rouble. The central bank's action appeared at odds with recent government moves to lower interest rates and extend credits in response to lobbying from cash-strapped companies. Russian officials suggested a rift in monetary policy might be developing between different government departments. A cut in the three-month refinancing rate from 150 to 130 per cent on Monday unsettled the rouble, raising concern about further monetary loosening at a time when the government's fiscal position is coming under strain. Increased government spending and a softening of its position on credits to industrial enterprises and farms have also raised inflation worries. The central bank, which has been trying to cultivate a reputation as guardian of the rouble, succeeded in stabilising the currency yesterday. In turnover of Dollars 313m (Pounds 202m) - twice the previous record trading level in Moscow's currency market - the rouble rose slightly on the day to end 10 roubles higher at 2,161 roubles to the US dollar. Over the past month, however, the rouble has fallen 6 per cent. Economists were divided about the merits of the interest rate cuts. Some suggested that the cut in the refinancing rate - the seventh this year - simply brought it into line with other interest rates. 'We are moving from an extremely high real interest rate to just a very high one,' one western economist said. 'Real interest rates remain at about 4 per cent a month.' But others argued the trend was risky. 'Given the future outlook and the fiscal slippage, more prudence would have been useful,' another economist said. The difficulty faced by Russia's foreign debtors - chiefly former Socialist countries - in servicing their Dollars 147bn debts may further complicate the government's fiscal difficulties. Mr Oleg Davydov, foreign trade minister, said Russia's debtors were paying only Dollars 2bn a year compared to their obligations of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn. Rouble tidal wave, Page 2</p>

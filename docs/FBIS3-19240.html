			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India and Britain have signed an agreement on  promotion and protection of investments. The agreement was  signed by the Indian High Commissioner, Dr. L.M. Singhvi, and  the British foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, in the presence  of the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and his British  counterpart, Mr. John Major in London. Our official  correspondent, P.J.S. Trehan reports that Britain is the first  country with which India signs such an agreement. The 10-year  agreement aims at creating conditions conducive for investment  in each other's country and is designed to increase investors  confidence. Three other Memoranda of Understanding -- MOU --  have also been signed. The MOU's were signed between the  private companies of both the countries in power generation,  telecommunications, and electrical transformers.    During his talks with Mr. John Major yesterday, Mr. Rao said  that India is very much interested in the resumption of the  political process in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the fear of  the gun instigated from across the border is continuing in the  valley. Mr. Rao recalled that the ground work for starting a  political process in the state has already been initiated. Mr.  Major, on his part, laid stress on the desirability of a  dialogue between India and Pakistan. In his reply, Mr. Rao said  New Delhi is always in favor of such a dialogue. On Mr. Major's  inquiry about the confidence- building measures with Pakistan,  Mr. Rao drew his attention to the six concrete proposals put  forth by India in January last. The two prime minister endorsed  the continuation of the Indo-British Partnership Intiative --  IBPI. Presenting the initiative to the two prime ministers, the  cochairman, Dr. J.J. Irani of India and Mr. Robert Evans of  Britain described the initiative as a great success.    Addressing the Indian community at the Guild Hall last  evening, Mr. Narasimha Rao said if the external factor is  removed from Jammu and Kashmir, normalcy can be restored, the  political process started, and economic activity revived in a  very short time. He regretted that the valley has been a victim  of proxy war from across the border. He said we live in a world  in which mastery over technique of disinformation creates the  possibility of more massive disinformation. It should,  therefore, not come as a surprise to us that made victims of  terrorism organized and financed from across the border, should,  sometime, find ourselves subjected to unwarranted criticism, Mr.  Rao added. [sentence as heard] He said it is strange that the  world should worry about the human rights of the terrorists who,  massacre innocent people or use religious places for political  ends, and not of those who are being forced out of their homes,  attacked, and terrorized. Mr. Rao expressed surprise that a  country on the verge of being declared a terrorist state should  lustily proclaim that it would not have discussions with India  until the human rights record improved. Mr. Rao reiterated that  India stands for peace all over the world. Our democracy  remains not only intact, but also a vibrant and proven force  overcoming all kinds of disasters and manmade tragedies.    On the third day of his visit, Mr. Narasimha Rao will call  on  Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace this morning. He will also  hold talks with the Secretary of State for Foreign and  Commonwealth affairs, Mr. Douglas Hurd. The Commonwealth  secretary general, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, is also scheduled to  call on the prime minister.</p>

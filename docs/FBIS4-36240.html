			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elimelekh Ram from Washington] </F>   [Excerpt] The economic talks between Israel and Jordan  will be transferred to the Middle East. This was decided at the  end of another round of talks in Washington. It was also  decided that a border survey will be performed by joint Israeli  and Jordanian teams. Elimelekh Ram reports from the U.S.  capital:    [Begin recording] [Ram] The fact that Major General 'Uzi  Dayan, head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Planing Branch,  took part in the talks which were mainly economic, attests to  the security aspect of the decisions made -- whether the issue  in question is planning a road that would link Israel and Jordan  or whether it was the establishment of joint projects in areas  that could be sensitive from a security point of view. Dr.  Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation, sums up the  current round of talks:    [Rubinstein] This was a good round of contacts on both the  tripartite level of Israel, Jordan, and the United States --  which mainly focused on economic issues such as trade, finance,  and projects -- as well as on the level of the additional talks  we held with Jordan -- which focused on issues such as security,  borders, water, and the like.    [Ram] The atmosphere at the talks was most optimistic.  There is a Jordanian readiness to make progress in the  negotiations. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: German retailer ahead 7% Kaufhof Holding, the German retailer, yesterday reported 1993 profits of DM240m (Dollars 145.5m), up 7 per cent from DM222m the year before. The company also forecast steady earnings for the current year. Kaufhof is set to take a stake of between 50 and 70 per cent in Horten, a smaller department store chain. This would increase group turnover to around DM28bn, comparable to that of Karstadt, Germany's biggest retailer. Final details of the deal will be announced in about three weeks after negotiations are completed. Turnover in the first four months of this year rose 8 per cent, to DM7.6bn. Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive, predicted retail sales would pick up throughout the year as Germany pulled out of its worst recession. The dividend will be raised by DM1.5 to DM13.50 for ordinary shares, and by the same amount, to DM14.50, for preferential shares. In 1993, turnover rose to DM23.1bn, up 12.7 per cent from DM20.5bn the year before. The rise was driven mainly by a 33 per cent increase in turnover at Media Markt, Vobis and Saturn, the specialist stores which the group plans to expand. European sales leapt 54 per cent to DM4.3bn following the consolidation of Kuoni, the tourist agency in which Kaufhof holds a 50.1 per cent stake. Total foreign sales rose to 19 per cent of group turnover. Mr Odewald said the group would invest DM900m in the coming year and increase its retail outlets by 120 to 1,235.</p>

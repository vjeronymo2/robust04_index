			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS;  </P> <P> LEUZINGER READY TO GIVE FOES A SAMPLE OF A HEALTHY LINEUP  </P> <P> Heading into Bay League play, Leuzinger High football Coach Steve Carnes says  his team is right where he wanted it to be at the halfway point.  </P> <P> "Looking back, I expected us to be 3-2 and I wanted to be healthy," he said. "I  think we're both. I know we're 3-2."  </P> <P> More importantly, the Olympians have no significant injuries for the first time  since early last season. All of Leuzinger's best players will be suited up  Friday night for a league opener at Culver City (3-2).  </P> <P> That includes senior tailback B-Jon Sample.  </P> <P> When last seen carrying a football, Sample was making a cut against Santa  Monica when his knee gave way. It came in the final league game of 1989. The  injury robbed the Olympians of their leading rusher for the playoffs and put  Sample's football career in jeopardy.  </P> <P> He underwent surgery in April and there were doubts if he would ever play  again, at least at Leuzinger. His name was not included in the program.  </P> <P> "He kept saying he was going to play, but I didn't think he was going to play,"  Carnes said. "All of a sudden, here he is."  </P> <P> Sample was cleared to play last week by doctors and will see duty for the first  time Friday night. He has practiced for several weeks and looked good in a  scrimmage Tuesday, Carnes said.  </P> <P> "B-Jon won't start, but he's going to get in there quite a bit," Carnes said.  "He gives us really good quickness at tailback."  </P> <P> Before his injury last year, Sample had established himself as one of the  area's most explosive backs. He rushed for 924 yards and eight touchdowns on  104 carries, an average of 8.9 yards per carry. Of the returning backs in the  area, only Robert Coulter of Rolling Hills rushed for more yards last season.  </P> <P> Sample's return allows Carnes to move Marvin Johnson, Leuzinger's leading  rusher with 450 yards and seven touchdowns, from tailback to fullback, where  the coach feels he is more effective.  </P> <P> Another key player returning to the lineup for Leuzinger is senior Manny  Gonzalez. The all-area linebacker missed four games after suffering a broken  hand in the team's opener against Bishop Montgomery.  </P> <P> With Gonzalez, who also plays fullback, Sample, Johnson and Manny's brother and  tailback Charlie Gonzalez, the Olympians have four quality running backs  entering their most important games.  </P> <P> By sharing the load, Carnes hopes to give Johnson and the Gonzalezes more time  to play defense.  </P> <P> "I'm looking to get our best 11 people on defense," he said. "I don't think  we've done that up to now."  </P> <P> Following are three coaches' views of the Bay, Ocean and Pioneer league  football races, which begin this week:  </P> <P> Carnes, on the Bay League: "Obviously Hawthorne is the favorite. They're the  team to beat. Santa Monica is always good. The league is tough again. If you  have a letdown, you'll get beat.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Coach Gary Kimbrell, on the Ocean League: "The league is pretty  tough all the way down the line. I wasn't overly impressed with Redondo in the  summer, but you don't see their big kids. Geez, they're playing really tough on  defense and they have a balanced offense. Mira Costa looks physical. I picked  Palos Verdes as the best team to begin with. And there's Morningside. You have  to be ready every week."  </P> <P> West Torrance Co-Coach Mark Knox, on the Pioneer League: "I think it's going to  be real close. North is coming on. Poor South has lost some real close ones.  They're a couple of points away from having a real good season. I think you  might have a little bit of a break against Centennial, but all of the Torrance  schools match up across the league pretty good."  </P> <P> Our predictions:  </P> <P> Bay League -- 1. Hawthorne; 2. Leuzinger; 3. Santa Monica; 4. Beverly Hills; 5.  Culver City; 6. Inglewood.  </P> <P> Ocean League -- 1. Rolling Hills; 2. Redondo; 3. Palos Verdes; 4. Morningside;  5. Mira Costa.  </P> <P> Pioneer League -- 1. West Torrance; 2. Torrance; 3. South; 4. North; 5.  Centennial.  </P> <P> Knox, the West co-coach, said he will be looking for an improved effort from  the offensive line when the Warriors (4-1) face South (1-4) in an Ocean League  opener Friday night at West.  </P> <P> West was held to a season-low 139 yards rushing last week in a 9-7 victory over  Redondo. Knox said the line, which had been playing well to that point, was  partly to blame for the poor production.  </P> <P> "I really don't think we blocked very well," he said. "It was probably the most  disappointing game for the offensive line. You have to give Redondo credit;  they did a good job. But I think we have to be a little more intense. We were  taking things for granted."  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Roger Hendrix, a 6-foot-6 forward for Rolling Hills, has given an oral  commitment to play basketball for Utah State. He averaged 24 points and nine  rebounds last season. . . . Robin Ortgiesen of Mira Costa was named to the  all-tournament team last weekend at the San Marcos Invitational girls'  volleyball tournament at UC Santa Barbara. Corona del Mar won the team title to  solidify its No. 1 ranking in the CIF-Southern Section 5-A Division coaches'  poll. Mira Costa slipped from fourth to seventh. . . . Agoura and Palos Verdes,  the nation's second- and third-ranked girls' cross-country teams by Harrier  magazine, met Saturday at the Kenny Staub Invitational at Crescenta Valley  Park, with Agoura defeating the defending state Division I champions for the  second time this season, 19-38. . . . Israel Pose of Torrance turned in the  best time Saturday at the Fountain Valley-Huntington Beach cross-country meet.  Pose covered the three-mile course at Central Park in Fountain Valley in 15  minutes, 21 seconds to win the Division II individual title. . . . Three South  Bay teams are ranked in the Southern Section 4-A Division girls' tennis top 10  -- Palos Verdes (No. 1), Miraleste (No. 5) and Rolling Hills (No. 6).  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Brussels at the touch of a button Keeping up with the myriad reports, memos, speeches and other documents that pour out of Brussels and European capitals can be a nightmare. But for those who need access to European Union and UK government policy announcements, Context, a UK company, has launched a new service in its series of CD-Rom products called Justis Official Press Releases. It combines the EU's Rapid database of documents and communiques (from 1985) on economic, trade, science and technology and other sectors with the Hermes database of more than 35,000 UK government press releases. It costs Pounds 587.50 a year and is updated quarterly. News released between updates is available from an on-line computer link. Context: UK, 071 2677055</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 8 (CNA) -- The National Press Council  of the Republic of China [ROC] Friday [8 April] pleaded for  world attention to Mainland China's callous handling of a recent  travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists died.    The council also asked two major world press organizations  --  the International Press Institute and the Freedom Forum -- to  join Taiwan in condemning Beijing's human rights violations.    The council said in its letters to the two organizations  that  Chinese communist authorities have continued to withhold  information on the cause of the disaster and refused to give  Taiwan reporters access to the incident site.    The 24 Taiwan tourists, along with six mainland crew members  and two guides, were burned to death inside the lower cabin of a  cruise ship that was ferrying them across Qiandao (Thousand  Island) Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31.    "While the victims' relatives are depressed and anxious to  know the truth about the disaster, mainland authorities have  blacked out news coverage of the accident," the council said.    It added that mainland authorities have even performed  autopsies on the bodies without consulting relatives of the  victims, and restricted the movement of the grieving relatives  who rushed to the mainland after the disaster.    Moreover, mainland officials have barred the relatives from  taking photographs of the victims' bodies as well as barred  Taiwan reporters from visiting the shed where the boat is being  kept.    A TV reporter from Taiwan was even temporarily detained and  other TV reporters have reportedly been harassed over their news  coverage.    "The rights of free access to news and the public's right to  know have been disregarded by mainland authorities," the council  said. "Mainland officials' inhumanity in handling the disaster  and flagrant violation of press freedom should be condemned by  the international community," it added.    In its letters, the council also condemned Beijing for  sentencing Xi Yang, a Chinese reporter for the Hong Kong  newspaper MING PAO, to 12 years in jail on charges of stealing  state financial secrets.    The council said Xi's conviction cannot be deemed a judicial  judgment since Beijing authorities have so far not given  evidence to prove Xi had been doing anything apart from normal  news gathering. Xi was detained on Sept. 27, 1993 and formally  arrested 10 days later. He faced a secret trial and has been  denied contact with his family and friends since his detention.    "The conviction is a flagrant violation of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, which Mainland China has signed,"  the council noted.</p>

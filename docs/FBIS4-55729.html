			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The </F> Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Ian Mather in Skopje;  date not given: "The Nation Nobody Will Listen To"]    [Text] President Kiro Gligorov heads Europe's most  beleaguered state. The road to his country from Greece tells  the story. It is a super-highway built as the main opening to  the Aegean by Tito's Yugoslavia. Today, you have the road to  yourself.    Since Greece imposed its unilateral embargo against the  "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" over its claim to use  the name of Macedonia, the fledgling state has been cut off from  Thessaloniki, the main port for its trade.    As I approached the Macedonian border the eerie silence was  shattered by rifle shots. Could this be it, I wondered -- the  start of the next widely-predicted Balkan war in which the  Macedonian state's predatory neighbours, Albania, Bulgaria,  Serbia and Greece, and even Nato itself, are likely to become  embroiled? In the event it turned out to be a Macedonian border  guard whiling away the time by using a metal advertisement as  target practice.    Apart from that, the only sound on a sunny afternoon was the  swishing of the wings of house martins which had built their  nests in the eaves of the huge Customs shed. In the two hours I  waited for transport at the border only one vehicle, a Danish  refrigerated truck, appeared.    Yet, as President Gligorov pointed out in an interview in  his  Skopje office, this is one of the European Union's [EU] borders.  Greece is a member of the EU, and in the single market uniform  rules are supposed to apply at all the EU's borders.    He is a quietly spoken grey-haired man in a brown suit. The  large new blood-red flag behind him with its gold Sun of  Vergina, which is such a red rag to Greece, seems  inappropriately flamboyant for such an apparently unassuming man.    Yet Gligorov's voice rises in passion as he outlines the  desperate risks his country now faces. Much of his anger is  reserved for the EU, which he believes has yet another  potentially disastrous failure in the former Yugoslavia on its  hands.    From his point of view it is all the more galling because  Greece is an EU member, and should therefore be held accountable  for its action by the other members, or suffer the consequences.  When Greece unilaterally imposed a blockade on Macedonia on 14  February following U.S. recognition of the state, an outraged  European Commission took Athens to the European Court. Since  then, nothing has happened.    Gligorov said: "This is the first major infringement of the  Maastricht treaty: the border between Macedonia and Greece is  not only a national border but a border with the European Union.  If this precedent is tolerated, it will have consequences for  the future of the Union."    But legal action alone is not enough he says. "More  efficient measures could be taken to force Greece to lift the  embargo. The EU has the means and mechanisms. Since it  allocates a large amount of funds to support Greece it would be  logical to expect it to withdraw some of those funds."    Neither is he satisfied with the European Court's handling  of  the case. The reason for the delay, he believes, is that the  court is waiting for the end of the Greek presidency of the EU  on 30 June before making a pronouncement, so as to avoid  censuring an EU country while it holds the presidency.    It is normal for legal processes to take a long time, I  suggested. "True," he replied. "But we were first told by the  EU that they expected a concrete decision in two to three weeks.  It has now been three months. If by the end of June a  temporary decision is reached on lifting the embargo then we  will be all right. However, if the court then decides to  undertake a full legal process it could take two years or more.    "Then if the embargo caused the destabilisation of this  region, what use would it be to us if we were to receive  compensation or some other help later on?" He said that he had  been told informally that the court would make its position  known soon after the end of June. "But if the court process is  prolonged we will have a situation in which the EW can wash its  hands and say it did all it could in this matter."    With industries being forced to close and living standards  plummetting, the burden which ordinary people have to bear is  heavy, he said.    "There is a great danger of a rise in social tension, and  the  continuation of the present situation with Greece could feed the  appetites of our other neighbours," he added. "This situation  does not contribute to the stability and peace of the region."    The row with Greece is over four points: the name Macedonia,  which Greece claims as its own; the flag with the Sun of  Vergina, the emblem of Philip of Macedonia, Alexander the  Great's father; the Macedonian constitution, which Greece says  betrays expansionist aims; and what Greece considers to be  anti-Greek propaganda.    Mediation efforts by Cyrus Vance for the UN, and by the US  special envoy, Matthew Nimetz, have so far got nowhere.  Gligorov said: "We are convinced that no settlement can be  reached unless there is a willingness by both sides to make  compromises. I believe the embargo cannot be linked with this  process, and should be lifted immediately. Without the lifting  of the embargo we will not sign any settlement."    If there is no settlement, one unexpected result of the  Greek  embargo could be the construction of a combined east-west rail  and road corridor linking Albania to Turkey, and traversing  Macedonia and Bulgaria.    Paradoxically, the new project would isolate Greece. The  so-called "east-west corridor" has been placed at the top of the  European agenda for new communications since Greece declared its  embargo.    Then there are the international sanctions against Serbia,  with whom Macedonia conducted 57 per cent of its trade. The  Sanctions Committee of the UN visited Skopje to assess the  damages of the previous two years and came up with the figure of  over $3 billion. On top of this has come the Greek embargo.    "So far we have succeeded in maintaining our peace and  stability. But, and I say this with great regret, despite all  the sympathy and the moral support we have been getting from the  EU, we have received no substantial financial support which  would enable us to be more calm until the situation improves."    And how much had his country received from the EU since the  current Greek embargo began? "Nothing," he replied. It was the  only word he uttered in English.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> HOME-HEIGHT CURBS REJECTED BY PLANNERS  </P> <P> The San Clemente Planning Commission has voted to reject a proposal that would  have placed restrictions on making single-story homes two or more stories.  </P> <P> The commissioners agreed in a 3-0 vote with one abstention that a proposed  25-foot height limit for all houses in San Clemente would be too difficult to  enforce because of the city's hilly terrain.  </P> <P> "Uniformity is impossible," Commissioner Hal Joseph said. "You can't write an  ordinance to treat San Clemente as one universe. It is too different in  topography and in the kinds of neighborhoods it has."  </P> <P> The request to study the proposed law was generated by the City Council in  response to complaints that the city has inconsistent methods of calculating  home heights. The council will review the Planning Commission recommendation at  its Dec. 20 meeting.  </P> <P> Several property owners complained that the proposed home-height ordinance  would lower property values by limiting what could be built on a parcel. They  also said that it would be unfair to those who owned hillside property, because  a three-story home could be built on a slope but could rise only 25 feet above  street level.  </P> <P> The commission urged residents of neighborhoods where one-story homes are  preferred to place limits on second-story additions by using homeowners'  association regulations, or by using land-associated laws known as "covenants,  codes and restrictions."  </P> <P> City Atty. Jeff Goldfarb said that under existing laws, a group of residents  could petition the council at any time to create a special zone that would  prevent second-story additions in their neighborhoods.

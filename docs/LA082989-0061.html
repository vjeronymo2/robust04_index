			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BABY-SITTER FACES MURDER TRIAL IN TODDLER'S DEATH  </P> <P> A Van Nuys baby-sitter on Monday was ordered held for trial on a charge of  murdering an 18-month-old girl who experts said was scalded with water, beaten  and then shaken to death.  </P> <P> Nova M. Thompson, 34, who has two children of her own and is pregnant, also was  ordered to stand trial on a charge of felony child abuse in the June 9 death of  Jasmine Lynn Sanders.  </P> <P> At the conclusion of a three-day preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal  Court, Judge Michael S. Luros rejected a defense argument that the death could  have been accidental.  </P> <P> He described as "very, very credible" testimony by Thompson's 4-year-old  daughter, Carlaina Johnson, that her mother scalded the little girl and threw  her into a bathtub.  </P> <P> Although Luros said the testimony of multiple injuries convinced him the death  was a case of first- degree murder, which requires premeditation, Deputy Dist.  Atty. Leslie Kenyon said, "Realistically, I think it will end up as second-  degree murder."  </P> <P> If convicted of first-degree murder, Thompson could be imprisoned for life,  while the maximum term for second-degree murder is 15 years to life.  </P> <P> Thompson, who has been in jail since the girl's death, is being held in lieu of  $400,000 bail. She is to be arraigned in Superior Court on Sept. 11.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Yordanova commentary: "President Must Look Crisis in </F> Eye"]    [Text] For a week now Bulgaria has been on the operating  table. The picture of the illness is clear, for the symptoms  have appeared repeatedly during the year since Berov's cabinet  assumed office. The crisis erupted this week.    Bulgaria does not have a budget. Only a few days after the  National Budget Bill was adopted, the national currency was  devalued almost 25 percent. Increasing the basic interest rate  will help to block the economy completely.    In a few days time we will know whether Bulgaria will  receive  a stand-by credit. Experts are convinced that, against the  background of the crisis, there is little chance of reaching an  agreement with the international finance institutions.  Apparently, our state currency reserves are back at the level  of 8 November 1991. In April the price of electricity and  heating will increase. The Khan Kubrat vessel reaches Serbia  with a full cargo, and returns empty....    At the moment no one in Bulgaria is responsible for all  this.    [Deputy Prime Ministers] Matinchev and Karabashev quarrel  publicly. Lukanov says that the government is wonderful, and  forgets about the promised cabinet changes. At their plenum the  Socialists declare that they are relying on Berov. They are  relying on a sick man who has undergone surgery to strengthen a  state that is currently under the scalpel of an economic and  political crisis. Ludzhev, Tomov, and the rest seek escape in  the memories of 1990-91. Everyone tries to escape the present.    According to Article 108 of the Constitution the prime  minister alone is responsible for the actions of the government.  Each of the ministers is responsible for his own actions and  not for the cabinet as a whole.    A long time ago the Union of Democratic forces called the  Berov cabinet the government of irresponsibility. Today this  definition applies to the entire state.    The head of state observes the political crisis from Paris,  from above, or from the sidelines. In a normal state with such  an abnormal situation the president would be holding urgent  talks with the political forces. If Bulgaria wants to be a  democratic state, then urgent institutional measures to solve  the situation must be adopted. Appeals to the people and Sunday  radio interviews are hardly a serious means of saving a state  that is lying on the operating table.    President Zhelev should look the crisis in the eye.</p>

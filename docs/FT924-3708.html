			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Sport: Pressures that push horses to breaking point - Equestrian sports THE equine establishment is caught in a squeeze between the need to attract television, and consequent sponsorship, to its expensive sport and the humanitarian pressures from groups such as the League Against Cruel Sports which fear horses are being driven to cruel and unrealistic performance levels. In the spring, the Badminton horse trials were a scene of muddy carnage. Three horses died at different fences after rain turned the cross-country course into a gooey brown skidpan. It was a bigger death toll than in the previous 13 years combined. In a generation, Badminton has changed from the province of amateur riders astride game, talented hunters to a focal point of international sport. The difficulty of the course has increased to match the competitors' skill. Badminton's unwanted headlines were followed by those during Wembley's annual Horse of the Year show in October. Sir Arkay, ridden by Swiss competitor Jurg Friedli, slithered out of control down a controversially steep 12 ft ramp. A rear leg snapped beneath the distraught horse, which had to be destroyed. The show was without a television contract for the second year running and the organisers faced pressure to make it more visually dramatic. But one woman who took her children said: 'That bank was just like an ice rink and the gradient was unbelievable. My daughter said no horse could get down it (in fact, two did make it before Sir Arkay) and she was physically sick when the accident happened.' When the Olympia Horse Show, an annual pre-Christmas treat for thousands of Londoners, opens on December 16, you can be sure the organisers will have taken no chances with dangerous jumps or obstacles. Yet, that plays into the hands of those who say the sport has become processional and overly-technical; a sport for aficionados rather than a mass audience. At the Barcelona Olympics, the most terrifying jump on the three-day event course was 'The cottage.' Blyth Tait, a New Zealand rider, described it as 'leaping on to the roof of a small house, then down on to the top of the garage before jumping into the fish pond.' Naturally, there were a great many television and press cameras present in case of a spectacular disaster  -whether life- or medal-threatening. The most intriguing comment came from a Dutch show-jumping coach: 'If there is a big accident and a horse is killed, then the Military (as they call three-day eventing throughout the Continent) is finished forever. The animal rights people already say it is too dangerous and many riders agree with them. Even show-jumping now has its critics. That is why dressage is so popular in Germany and the Netherlands.' Fortune smiled that day, helped by the many riders who sacrificed crucial seconds by opting for the safer, longer route, and there were no fatalities. Yet, when a Russian horse collapsed with heat exhaustion, it was treated with great secrecy by an enormous medical team, as if it were a US president having a heart attack. Clearly, officialdom had said that, with equestrian events already on the International Olympic Committee's hit list, there must be no casualties. After the Sir Arkay catastrophe, it came as no surprise to learn that the LACS were preparing a dossier on the incident with a view to bringing a private action. As the hunting fraternity has learned over the past decade, the LACS are affluent, professional, and prefer cases they can win. The gist of the league's argument is that unnecessary and unwarranted pain was inflicted and that someone should pay the price with a humiliating court appearance and subsequent punishment. Horse are no longer simply large pampered pets. They are expensive and occasionally, disposable sporting vehicles as reports from the US demonstrate. A two-year Federal Bureau of Investigation enquiry into one Tommy Burns ended when Burns and an accomplice were caught breaking a horse's leg with a crowbar. Burns confessed to killing, at the instigation of the owners, show jumpers and racehorses worth millions of dollars. His fees ranged from Dollars 5,000 to Dollars 35,000. In 1986, a US tax reform eliminated high-performance horses as a depreciable asset. Suddenly, all those Santa Barbara cosmetic surgeons no longer wanted a barn full of temperamental show-jumpers. Mysterious deaths of expensive horses began to rise. According to Sports Illustrated magazine, Burns was a well-known figure on the US show-jumping circuit, where he was nicknamed 'the Sandman.' He usually killed horses by electrocution, which left little trace. The horses were assumed to have died of colic. Most of the insurance claims were paid by Lloyd's of London. Money lies at the bottom of this whole phenomenon. Sponsorships are large but hard to find. Only the top-performing horses and riders are able to attract the funds to stay in the sport. But show-jumping can be lucrative. John Whitaker rode Milton, sponsored by the Henderson financial services group, to winnings of Pounds 1m. 'Sponsorships are directly related to a rise in abuses. There is more at stake,' said a vet with links to the International Equestrian Federation. In every professional sport, players drive themselves and their equipment to ever more extreme levels of training, performance and effort in pursuit of the huge rewards at the peaks of international competition. Where the equipment consists of boats, cars and bicycles, all well and good. But the public might not yet be ready for horses to be harnessed to the same treadmill.</p>

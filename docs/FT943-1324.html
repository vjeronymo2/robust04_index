			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (3): In the hunt for a sporting venue - The hunting, shooting and fishing properties on the market Autumn is the high season in field sports. Pheasant and woodcock are shortly to be in the firing line; grouse and snipe have been fair game since the glorious twelfth of August, and the shooting season for partridge, wild geese and duck opened on September 1. The grouse in Scotland have been a little disappointing, but salmon are doing well. And now that the harvest is in, cub-hunting has begun - training of the cub hounds to work as a pack and culling the weaker cub foxes. They are all expensive sports but, if you travel almost all the way to John O'Groats, the northern tip of the British mainland, you can buy an estate of 44,000 acres for less than the price of a house in Kensington, west London. The Forsinard and Bighouse estate, in the bogland 'flow' country of Sutherland, offers virtually every kind of field sport, plus a 4,300-acre farm, 15-bedroom hotel, railway station, a sand and gravel quarry, and an extraordinary variety of wildlife. The price? Strutt &amp; Parker in Edinburgh is asking for offers over Pounds 1.35m. And no parking problems. The natural home for hunting folk is Leicestershire, where six packs - revered names such as Belvoir, Cottesmore, Fernie, Pytchley and Quorn - converge on Market Harborough. It is special because much of the rolling country is still pasture, which keeps the old pattern of small fields divided by hedges. As the hedges were not grubbed up 20 years ago, jumping over them offers more thrills - and spills - per mile than in the rest of the country where they were removed (with government grants). And Leicestershire has fewer barbed wire fences. An ideal hunting box (house for hunting) with an immaculate stable yard with eight loose boxes is Ravenhead, at Ingarsby, near Leicester in Quorn hunting country. Strutt &amp; Parker in Market Harborough offers it for Pounds 450,000. Also in Quorn country (for Friday meets) is Inkerman Lodge at Hungarton near Melton Mowbray, which has 60 acres of grassland and costs Pounds 425,000 from Savills in Stamford. In Cottesmore country, Strutt &amp; Parker offers Alstoe Farm at Burley-on-the-Hill in Rutland for Pounds 290,000. An alternative is to make some income from hunting, by taking the lease of Kirby House Stables near Belvoir Castle, which used to be the Belvoir hunt kennels. The yard, with 49 loose boxes (21 let), three cottages and paddocks, yields a net income of Pounds 6,000, but could manage a further Pounds 15,000 from letting the remainder. The price for the lease, with 10 years left, is Pounds 100,000 from equestrian property specialist Christopher Stephenson. In the Cotswolds, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Oxford is selling Copse Hill Court at Upper Slaughter, a house converted from a 19th century stable block but still with five loose boxes and nine acres in Heythrop country. The price is Pounds 575,000. Two other Heythrop houses from KFR are Evenlode Place (Pounds 900,000) and Downs Lodge near Shipton-under-Wychwood (Pounds 545,000). Another hunting paradise is Ireland, where it has always been a cross-class pursuit. If you want to go out with the Wexford, Kilmokea at Great Island, Co Wexford, has 14 loose boxes, an indoor arena and 19 acres of farmland. But any buyer must also be a gardener, to maintain a famous garden of seven acres. The guide price from Jackson Stops &amp; McCabe is IPounds 400,000, but it would be essential to be sure of the outgoings before taking it on. For shooting and fishing, combined perhaps with deer stalking, the ideal is an estate in Scotland. 'Demand far outstrips supply,' William Jackson, of KFR in Edinburgh reports. Besides Forsinard and Bighouse in the north, Strutt &amp; Parker offers Carnoch in the west near Fort William (where the railway station is the link with Glasgow and London). Offers over Pounds 300,000 (down from Pounds 375,000) will buy a house, a hill farm, 4,355 acres with deer stalking and rough shooting, and the whole Carnoch river system - which is always a good buy as it is easier to improve the fishing as you want it. For the romantic, the same agent offers the Island of Inchfad in Loch Lomond for Pounds 550,000 (or in one-eighth shares of Pounds 90,000), for duck shooting and as a base for fishing salmon, trout and powan - the loch's own freshwater herring. It is 120 acres and has four cottages. The Upper North Wark fishing beat on the Tweed (with a four-year average of 122 salmon) costs Pounds 700,000 (again Strutt &amp; Parker). Or buy a specified week in perpetuity on the Beauly river near Inverness from Pounds 11,000 plus VAT per rod per week on the Upper Beauly (126 salmon last year) or Pounds 25,000 on the Lower Beauly (1,065 salmon last year), from KFR. Fishing in the English West Country is far cheaper. Strutt &amp; Parker in Exeter is selling a beat on the Taw in north Devon (20-year average: 23 salmon and 42 sea trout) for Pounds 175,000. A cottage is Pounds 75,000 extra. Stags offers Feld House near Chulmleigh with 11 acres and a mile of fishing on the Little Dart, a tributary of the Taw, for Pounds 230,000. And in glorious, unspoilt country in the west of Ireland a complete salmon river system is available. The Ballisodare fishery in Co Sligo, covering four rivers, belonged for a long time to the Cooper family (as the Cooper Act 1837 ordained). They managed a superb fishery in the last century, which is now for sale with the netting rights in Ballisodare bay which means being able to control the fish returning to the rivers. The present owners have run it for pleasure, but the new owner could make it more commercial. In recent years the average catch on rod and line has been 1,200, with 800 more netted. The minimum price is IPounds 500,000 from Hamilton Osborne King or KFR in London. Finally, for shooting on the Pennines, consider the Scargill estate of 4,222 acres (with sporting rights over a further 922 acres) in Teesdale. Besides grouse (20-year average: 393 brace), it offers pheasant and duck, and six let farms producing Pounds 23,338 a year - to set against the price of Pounds 1.35m from Murray or Savills in York.

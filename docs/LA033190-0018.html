			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS OVER LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> Headlines read: "Gorbachev Demands Lithuanians Surrender Personal Guns." Why  would he do such a thing? Maybe he doesn't trust honest, law-abiding citizens  to be free.  </P> <P> And in the United States, certain politicians demand Americans surrender  private guns (a little at a time: handguns, "assault" guns, semi-automatics,  etc). Don't they trust honest, law-abiding citizens either? Wake up, America.  If you don't protect each of your freedoms, you could lose them all.  </P> <P> PAUL MYERBERG  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Sport: Heat is on for Olympics - Equestrianism Winter in Newmarket. A freezing wind scalps East Anglia. On the gallops, breath from racehorses frosts and curls away. But indoors, guests are loosening their ties and the windows are running with condensation. It is 30'C (86'F), with 80 per cent humidity. We are in the Deep South. Costly climate control equipment is reproducing the conditions found in mid-summer in Atlanta, where the 1996 Olympics will be held. At the equine performance centre of the Animal Health Trust, an event horse wearing an oxygen mask in debilitating heat is becoming acclimatised to a canter on a massive treadmill. Eventing is addressing the problems of running a physically demanding Olympic event in a harsher climate than ever before. The sport knows it is being watched closely by the animal rights movement, which opposes the very notion of taking horses to Georgia at that time of year. Some top riders share their doubts, including US horseman Bruce Davidson who has been quoted as saying that no international three-day event should ever take place there. Politically, though, eventing cannot simply duck the Atlanta Olympics. Equestrianism is one of a handful of elite and expensive sports that Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, and other top officials would like to see eliminated from the summer games. 'If the horse sports were dropped now, they would probably never get back into the Olympics,' says Dr David Marlin, head of the Newmarket research project. He hopes during 1994 to find out just what happens to the physiology of a horse under the gruelling demands of three-day eventing. 'After the 1992 Barcelona games, it was clear that we didn't know what happened when horses exercised under adverse conditions - indeed, even what the phrase meant in equine terms.' In Barcelona, one event horse did collapse from heat exhaustion, although it was revived (and there was some evidence that its fitness training in Russia had been inadequate). In any case, it seems likely that dressage horses standing about in the midday sun may have suffered more than competitors blasting around a six-mile cross-country course. What is certain is that reporters from countries such as the Netherlands and Germany, where eventing is a moral issue to match fox-hunting in Britain, were out in force. Cameras were at every difficult fence, awaiting a catastrophe. 'In Atlanta, we could have in excess of 86 degrees and 80 per cent humidity,' says Marlin. 'At present, no one knows whether horses can cope with that, or how long they might take to acclimatise. We need some hard facts before the sport can say whether the location is acceptable or not.' The study began last season with detailed monitoring programmes on horses taking part in the Blair Castle and Burghley three-day events. Marlin's team recorded body weight, heart rate, rectal temperature and blood chemistry at every stage of the competitions. The next stage has been training event horses to use the treadmill so they can replicate in laboratory conditions the demands of a full competition. Four event horses owned by the British army are being used initially for this. 'In about three days you can train them to walk, trot, canter and gallop,' says Marlin. 'They adapt much faster than humans beings tested in a gym, in my experience.' He understands the wariness of those who might be shocked to see a horse wearing a face mask on a treadmill, but points out: 'Any rider will tell you about the difficulty of making a horse do something he doesn't want to. You're talking about 550 pounds of bone and muscle here. It's not dangerous to the animals. We're not trying to induce heat exhaustion. If they can do only half the test, then that is it. We can see when things are starting to go wrong - which you can't when you're out on the cross-country course.' The attention to detail in the laboratory is so complete that there is even a huge fan several feet ahead of the horse's treadmill position; this simulates the air flow over the body at different speeds. The Pounds 40,000 project has been financed by equal grants from the International Equestrian Federation and the International League for the Protection of Horses. The next stage will be in the spring when the horses are moved to an air-conditioned stable block where they will live for months in the conditions of mid-summer Atlanta. This should provide evidence of how well acclimatisation helps competition horses - rather like athletes training at altitude before the Mexico City games. As a scientist, though, isn't Marlin affected by the fact that everyone involved in the sport wants his research to show that eventing can happen at Atlanta? After all, a 'no' vote from Newmarket could kill equestrianism as an Olympic sport. Marlin disagrees: 'Our only concern is the welfare of the horses. If we come to the conclusion that three-day eventing isn't possible in Atlanta conditions, we're going to come out and say so. 'This research has implications that stretch a long way past the 1996 Olympics. In the future, I believe we'll be offering a Bupa-style checkup for the competition horse.'</p>

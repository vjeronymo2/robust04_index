According to a DPA  inquiry on Wednesday [6 April], in January and February 1994 31  Kurds were forcibly sent back to their homeland from Lower  Saxony; 24 were deported on the basis of the asylum law and  seven on the basis of the aliens' law. The other laender said  regarding this problem that deportations are listed not  according to ethnic groups but according to citizenship.  [passage omitted]</p>

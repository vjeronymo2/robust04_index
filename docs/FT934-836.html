			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls 2.7 per cent as profits are taken Share prices lost further ground on selling by arbitrageurs and dealers, and the Nikkei average closed moderately lower in spite of buying by investment trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index shed 88.81 to 17,315.43 after moving between 17,158.32 and 17,484.35. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 1.52 to 1,445.73, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 3.34 at 1,195.57. Selling was done in small lots, due to speculation that the government will announce an emergency stimulus package this week. However, political uncertainty was heightened by reports that a group of lawyers was accusing Mr Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the Japan Renewal Party, of accepting illegal donations from a construction company. Volume came to 221m shares, against 235m. Trading grew thinner during the afternoon session as investors retreated to the sidelines. Declines led advances by 676 to 326, with 163 issues unchanged. Institutional investors were seen realising gains on their holdings ahead of the year-end book closing. Dealers who had failed to sell on Monday were also seen making small-lot sales. Hanwa, the steel trader known for the extensive financial investments that it made during the 1980s, dropped Y82 to Y650. The issue declined in spite of the company's denials of rumours that banks had stopped financial aid. Nippon Steel, the most active stock of the day, softened Y1 to Y296 amid selling by foreign investors. Nittoc Construction, which is alleged to have given Mr Ozawa financial contributions, retreated Y20 to Y1,080. Retailers were lower on deepening fears of the spread of discounting. Ito-Yokado receded Y50 to Y5,410, FamilyMart lost Y130 to Y6,720 and Chujitsuya declined Y80 to Y1,660. Bank shares, which had plunged during Monday on index-linked selling, recovered some ground. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,860 and Fuji Bank gained Y10 to Y1,900. Nomura Securities also rose Y20 to Y1,840. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y3,000 to Y748,000 on profit-taking, but East Japan Railway put on Y8,000 at Y429,000 thanks to the government's announcement that it would list only one of the remaining six regional railway companies next year. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 136.12 to 19,212.92 in volume of 104m shares. Turnover surged on trading by investors who sold shares to realise profits and bought the stocks immediately afterwards to maintain their portfolios. Roundup Sharply divergent performances were seen in Pacific Rim markets. Bombay was closed for the sixth straight day amid signs that the brokers' strike could continue until the new year. HONG KONG fell 2.7 per cent on a wave of profit-taking after recent rises. The Hang Seng index lost 290.50 to 10,524.28 as US institutions joined in the selling during the afternoon. Turnover was down slightly to HKDollars 8.84bn from Monday's HKDollars 8.89bn. Utilities were among the biggest losers, with China Light slipping HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 51 and HK Electric relinquishing HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 25.80. AUSTRALIA was dragged down by a fall in News Corp and an absence of offshore interest. The All Ordinaries index closed 9.1 off at 2,067.0. A 33-cent, or 3.3 per cent, fall to ADollars 9.67 in News Corp was attributed to worries about a deal that will see a US subsidiary pay around Dollars 1.1bn for the broadcasting rights to four seasons of National Conference Football games. NEW ZEALAND was marked 1.3 per cent lower as buyers deserted before the Christmas holidays and the market continued to feel the weight of recent new issues and placements. The NZSE-40 Capital index shed 26.27 to 2,046.97. MANILA rose by more than 100 points for the second straight day before profit-taking clipped the rise, but the market still closed at a record high, bolstered by PLDT. The Manila composite index finished 27.48 ahead at 2,836.28 after an intraday peak of 2,927.98. SEOUL climbed 2.0 per cent after news that the market stabilisation fund would delay the liquidation of its stock portfolio. The composite index added 17.16 to 865.79 in volume of 38.14m shares. KARACHI posted another record high close amid active year end trading by foreign funds and local institutions. The KSE 100-index ended 18.49 higher at 2,062.39. KUALA LUMPUR saw some bargain hunting and renewed speculative buying with gains led by tin and plantation stocks. However, falls in some index-linked stocks dragged the composite index down 1.47 to 1,096.61. Telekom fell 30 cents to MDollars 19.40. TAIWAN closed higher on late foreign buying of industrial blue chips with low price-earnings ratios. The weighted index rose 41.85 to 5,245.87 in active turnover of TDollars 55.24bn. SINGAPORE eased as retail investors continued to stay sidelined following tighter trading conditions imposed by several broking houses. The Straits Times Industrials index edged 0.59 lower to 2,276.89 after trading to an intra-day high of 2,290.83.</p>

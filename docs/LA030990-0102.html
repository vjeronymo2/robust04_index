			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA'S BUBBLE TO BURST?;  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10: OTHER COACHES SAY BRUINS NEED A GOOD SHOWING TO REACH NCAA  TOURNAMENT, BUT HARRICK DISAGREES.  </P> <P> UCLA's hopes of securing an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament could be  greatly affected today when the Bruins play Oregon in the quarterfinals of the  Pacific 10 Conference tournament at Arizona State's University Activity Center.  </P> <P> A loss would send the Bruins home with an 18-10 record -- and possibly without  a bid.  </P> <P> "They need to come through the first round and maybe even the second round,"  Arizona Coach Lute Olson said of the Bruins, who ended the regular season by  losing six of 10 games. "They're definitely a team that's on the bubble."  </P> <P> UCLA finished fourth in the Pac-10, dropping six of its last nine conference  games after ending the first half of the conference race tied for the lead.  </P> <P> The Bruins defeated both Arizona and Oregon State, the Pac-10 co-champions, in  January at Pauley Pavilion but lost to those teams last month on the road. They  beat California at Berkeley in January -- their only victory on the road  against a winning team -- but lost to the Golden Bears last month in Westwood.  </P> <P> In fact, since Jan. 24, when they beat Oregon State, 94-80, the Bruins have  beaten only one winning team -- DePaul, which is 17-14. And in the second half  of the conference race, UCLA beat only Arizona State, Washington and Washington  State, which were seeded eighth, ninth and 10th in the Pac-10 tournament.  </P> <P> Their five-game losing streak last month was their longest in 42 years, and  they lost at Pauley Pavilion for the first time to both Stanford and Cal.  </P> <P> They were 4-6 against the top six teams in the Pac-10.  </P> <P> "UCLA could be in jeopardy," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "I hate to  say that because I think they deserve to go, but they're such a visible program  -- everybody watches them so closely, with their national TV games and so forth  -- that some of their recent struggles might hurt them.  </P> <P> "They're going to need to show some improvement -- maybe get to the final (this  weekend). They would have to beat Oregon State (in the semifinals) and make a  good showing against Arizona (in the final). They lost five straight games.  They won their last two, but against the (bottom two) teams in our conference  -- and they did not dominate them."  </P> <P> UCLA defeated Washington State, 96-89, and Washington, 74-61, in its last two  games.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the Bruins lost to Oregon, 105-99, at Eugene, Ore., giving up  more points than they had ever allowed a conference opponent in regulation  time.  </P> <P> Sophomore guard Terrell Brandon scored a season-high 31 points, junior guard  Kevin Mixon scored a season-high 25 points and forward Keith Reynolds scored 24  points for the Ducks, who made a season-high 65% of their shots.  </P> <P> "We were in their face a lot of times," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said afterward,  "but they just shot the ball awfully well."  </P> <P> When Harrick's comment was relayed to a Bruin player, however, the player  laughed, indicating that UCLA's effort was less than total.  </P> <P> Coach Don Monson of Oregon expects to see a more intense Bruin team today at  the 1 p.m. (PST) tip-off.  </P> <P> "They know pretty much that they can't get beat by Oregon and still go to the  NCAAs," said Monson, whose Ducks are 15-12 and hoping to land a bid to the  National Invitation Tournament. "They will be focused and coming at us with  both barrels."  </P> <P> Actually, the Bruins believe that when the pairings for the NCAA tournament are  announced Sunday at 3:30 p.m., PST, their name will be called, regardless of  what happens this weekend.  </P> <P> "I think 18-10 would be good enough to get us in," Harrick said. "We're the  only team in our conference that beat Arizona and Oregon State. Every team we  lost to, except USC, will play in a postseason tournament."  </P> <P> UCLA defeated one team that has already earned a berth in the NCAA tournament  -- East Tennessee State -- and beat three others that are expected to land bids  -- Arizona, Oregon State and Cal.  </P> <P> Also, Harrick said, the selection committee will take into account that UCLA's  nose-dive last month coincided with forward Trevor Wilson's wrist injury, which  seems to have healed.  </P> <P> "Maybe the reason we lost some games we shouldn't have is because we had a guy  hurt and he's back playing now," Harrick said.  </P> <P> Actually, Wilson didn't miss any games. But after averaging 19.1 points and 9.1  rebounds in UCLA's first 17 games, he has averaged 13.2 points and 8.7 rebounds  since spraining his right wrist against USC on Feb. 1, and has made only 21 of  60 free throws.  </P> <P> In UCLA's past three games, however, Wilson has taken 38 rebounds. "With the  way my wrist is now," Wilson said, "I can play pretty much the same kind of  basketball I played earlier. It's just a matter of getting back into the flow  of things."  </P> <P> The pain, he said, is limited.  </P> <P> Not limited are the Bruins' chances of making the NCAA tournament, Wilson said.  </P> <P> "I don't feel any pressure whatsoever," said Wilson when asked if today's game  represented a do-or-die situation for the Bruins. "I feel very confident that  we'll win. And with the talent we have, and if we play right, we should win the  whole thing."  </P> <P> If they did that, of course, they would take the decision out of the hands of  the selection committee.  </P> <P> The Bruins would earn the automatic berth that goes to the Pac-10 tournament  champion.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SWEDISH GUITARIST SOLLSCHER MAKES WEST COAST DEBUT  </P> <P> When guitarist Goran Sollscher made his West Coast debut Wednesday night at  Ambassador Auditorium, it was hard to determine if his brief but carefully  selected program may have been too distant and cerebral.  </P> <P> The steady, bespectacled Swede commands a cool approach to his craft that  stresses a seldom faltering accuracy and a certain understated quality that  nakedly allows each composition to stand on its own.  </P> <P> But although he ostensibly relishes each morsel of music he makes, it is a  private enjoyment that doesn't always reach the listener with the same degree  of warmth.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the clarity and lucidity of his phrasing and interpretation blend  with striking intelligence. What is missing in tenderness is supplanted by a  sturdy architecture that never succumbs to bombast or needless ornamentation.  </P> <P> His impressive use of an 11-string guitar added a provocative touch to his own  transcription of Bach's Sonata No. 3 for solo violin. Resisting some of the  showy devices of more reknowned guitarists -- such as vibrato or flashy use of  extended techniques -- Sollscher painstakingly placed every note, giving the  music well-focused integrity.  </P> <P> On the common six-string instrument, a conservative, neoclassic work by Swedish  composer Dag Wiren -- "Liten serenade" (1964) -- offered a pleasant  alternative, but makes few demands on the player or listener. The music dances  modestly in an innocuous tonal language without substantially communicating or  exploring.  </P> <P> Granados' "Danza espanola" No. 5 tested a more invigorating side to Sollscher's  playing that succeeded on a virtuosic level, but stylistically needed a more  genuine Spanish flavor. Falla's "Homenaje a Claude Debussy" provided a softer,  less active study that also proved more routine than idiomatic. Ponce's more  ambitious "Sonatina meridional" similarly proceeded adequately and seamlessly.  The scanty but appreciative audience summoned two encores. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Comalco lifts interim pay-out COMALCO, the Australian integrated aluminium producer, has raised its interim dividend from 2 cents to 3 cents a share after overcoming lower prices to record a marginal earnings increase in the six months ended June. Operating profit rose from ADollars 15m to ADollars 15.7m (USDollars 10.5m) on a 10.4 per cent revenue lift to ADollars 1.09bn. But the result was transformed by abnormal items and a superannuation fund adjustment which boosted earnings available to shareholders from ADollars 8.5m to ADollars 50.3m. Directors said the average London Metal Exchange three month price for aluminium was USDollars 1,182 per tonne for the reporting period, compared with an average of USDollars 1,296 per tonne previously. 'This first-alf average price is the lowest for any half-year period since the LME high grade three month contract began in June, 1987,' they said.</p>

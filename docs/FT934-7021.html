			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Israel and Egypt plan gas pipeline and power grid link Egypt and Israel have exchanged letters of understanding to begin detailed work on linking the two countries' national power grids and build a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) pipeline to supply Israel with Egyptian gas. Both projects mark an early step in what Israel hopes will be a massive peace dividend in Middle Eastern regional integration. Mr Moshe Shahal, Israel's energy minister, said at the weekend that he had negotiated the deals with Egypt's energy and oil ministers, with the approval of President Hosni Mubarak. Israeli officials said experts from the state-owned electricity corporation would visit Egypt next week to begin a study with Egyptian counterparts on how best to link the electricity grids, which could be 'done at once'. The study will be financed by the European Union. Mr Shahal said the linking of regional electricity systems could save Israel Dollars 200m and Egypt Dollars 78m by eliminating the need for parallel power lines. Israel also hopes to include Jordan, Turkey and Syria in a regional power grid as soon as there is a more comprehensive Mideast peace agreement. Under the potential gas supply deal, Mr Shahal said a pipeline would be built from the Egyptian Nile Delta to Israel, passing through the Gaza Strip, which could also be supplied with Egyptian gas. Israel hopes to agree a supply contract under which Egypt would pipe up to 2m tonnes of natural gas annually for 25 years, mainly to Israeli power plants. The Dollars 1bn project may be funded in part by the EU. An international energy company, approved by both Egyptian and Israeli Energy Ministries, will undertake a study. Egypt has said it has insufficient natural gas to export, but potential discoveries might provide the necessary reserves. Mr Shahal also said that, in future, payments by Israel for petroleum supplied by Egypt would be made through an Israeli commercial bank rather than a European bank. The minister said the two countries had also discussed co-operation in petrochemicals and joint oil searches.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FANS CAN'T TAKE TOO MUCH MAS OF THIS  </P> <P> Boxing, if you can call it that after the Roberto Duran-"Surgery" Ray Leonard  meeting in Las Vegas, has pushed professional wrestling into second place as a  spectacle. It now is featuring ancient retired ex-boxing rivals pumped up like  giant Macy parade balloons for the biggest public ripoff in sports.  </P> <P> It isn't a sport that it once was but has become Grade C entertainment with  pre-fight dialogue like warmed-over toast.  </P> <P> What a gullible public.  </P> <P> There are two suggestions to cure the ills of the "fight" game:  </P> <P> 1. Have a giant, legal lottery, since these fights are held in either Las Vegas  or Atlantic City. A numbered ticket is issued to everyone who pays an admission  for the live performance or for the poor souls who purchase the high-price  video coverage, so-called "live." A drawing is held at the beginning of the  first round. The person with the winning number gets half the gate gross. The  loser of the fight gets, say, 2% over expenses.  </P> <P> 2. If that won't do, then I want to be the promoter of the next  multimillion-dollar bout to be staged at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium or the  Coliseum in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> I propose to have as the two heavyweights in the ring, George Burns and Bob  Hope. It would put the whole boxing mess in correct perspective.  </P> <P> NICK J. PODGURSKI, San Diego  </P></p>

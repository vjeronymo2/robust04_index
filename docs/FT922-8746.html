			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Accounting change highlighted MORE companies are adopting the controversial practice of not depreciating fixed assets such as buildings, an analysis by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based accounts monitoring service, indicated yesterday. It said that 22 per cent of a sample of 630 companies showed in their latest annual accounts evidence of assets that were not depreciated. The practice appears to be taken for granted by water companies, which do not depreciate infrastructure assets such as water mains, sewers, pipelines and reservoirs. Other companies with the same approach include many in the leisure and brewing sectors. Accounting standard SSAP 12 stipulates that a charge for depreciation should be shown in the profit-and-loss account for assets with a finite economic life - including for buildings. However, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the policing arm of the UK's new accounting standards regime, appeared to endorse the practice of non-depreciation on certain assets when it cleared Forte, the hotels group, of breaching that standard in February. The water companies argue that they are required to maintain their infrastructure in perpetuity and that therefore the assets do not have a finite life. Almost 20 per cent of companies do not disclose reasons for not depreciating their assets. Company Reporting, 68 Dundas St, Edinburgh EH3 6QZ. Annual subscription Pounds 315.</p>

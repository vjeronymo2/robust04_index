			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] Following a charge implying the existence of  appalling deals between federal agents and drug traffickers, the  residents of the Indian communities in Juarez Valley have chosen  to remain silent because of their fear.    "This is a very critical matter that is being treated  superficially.... I refuse to say anything": That comment was  made by the Zaragoza community commissioner, Porfirio Silva,  who, six months ago, publicly charged that "in the region it was  easier to obtain a kilo of marijuana than one of tortillas."    The movement of drugs (claimed in the accusation as  occurring  in most of the 17 Indian communities comprising the valley) is  an activity not confirmed thus far by any evidence gathered by  Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents during their raids in that  area.    In its crackdown on the drug traffic, the department has not  managed to seize marijuana or cocaine shipments after several  raids reported to have taken place since July.    Those negative statistics represent a strong motivation for  the community residents, from Zaragoza to Guadalupe, not to opt  for making any new charges regarding such activity.    However, State Judicial Police [PJE] officials and municipal  employees operating in those municipalities have also been  remiss in issuing any further reports.    For example, the state agents have not repeated their  intervention in any operation, nor reported any unusual movement  on trails or in settlements since August, when one of their  fellow officers was captured by PJF members.    "Since then, there has never been any kind of cooperation;  and, besides, we represent an agency dealing with common crimes.  We have devoted ourselves to that alone," declared the PJE  commander in Guadalupe, Octavio Frescas.    The federal police arrested one of his agents in August,  accusing him of having protected the landing of a small plane  presumably loaded with drugs: something that could never be  proven. [passage omitted]    According to the town hall secretary, Eduardo Ramos,  Guadalupe, regarded for years as one of the municipalities used  by drug traffickers for landing their planes, is, nevertheless,  a safe place now.    "It is so peaceful here that we do not even know the federal  police," he remarked. [passage omitted]    The commissioner of the Juarez Reforma Indian community,  Jesus Olivo, who resides in the village of Caseta, a site  notorious for drug trafficking, even asserted: "Movements of  that type have never occurred here."    Another community representative, Antonio Flores, from San  Isidro, also claimed that the drug traffic in the region "is a  thing of the past," although he was among those who witnessed,  and did not deny, the public charge submitted to Mayor Francisco  Villareal.    Described by Silva as a region "serving as a springboard for  drugs," Juarez Valley was explored by PJF agents weeks later,  after the mayor had met with the PGR [Attorney General of the  Republic] representative, Teresa Jardi Alonso, according to  reports issued at the time.    The agents' invasion was announced in August by the  assistant  representative of the Attorney General's Office, Samuel  Terrazas. However, no results have been reported from the  maneuvers to date.    At the PJE office in Guadalupe, Commander Frescas indicated  that, throughout their tours, countless trails and settlements  "known in their entirety only to the natives" were detected.    He added: "There are very long and varied trails, but it  cannot be claimed that they are being used by `narcos.'"    According to the residents themselves, the PGR helicopter  flights have been intensified in that area during the past few  days. Nevertheless, there has been no report to date of the  discovery of landing strips, trails, or drug seizures involving  considerable volumes of drugs.</p>

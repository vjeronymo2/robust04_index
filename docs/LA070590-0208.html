			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> THE CROSS-FIRE OF IDEAS;  </P> <P> GEORGE STONE'S COMPLEX INSTALLATION IS SHOT THROUGH WITH HARMONIOUS AND WARRING  NOTIONS  </P> <P> Who's double-crossed by "DOUBLE CROSS," George Stone's installation at the  Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza satellite? It's hard to say, exactly. But  the piece -- much more complex than it may appear at first sight -- is riddled  with the cross-fire of harmonious and warring ideas.  </P> <P> In the first room of the installation -- the full name of which is "DOUBLE  CROSS: 1 (picture) 1,000 (words)" -- a cruciform plexiglass case holds rows of  blank books, their pages blown by a phalanx of small, whirring fans. There also  is a large color photograph of a flame.  </P> <P> The second room, partitioned into a cross shape, is dark except for a set of  moving spotlights that pause on one or more of the words inscribed on the walls  in neat floor-to-ceiling rows.  </P> <P> Stone, a Los Angeles artist, has supplied himself with some heavyweight  symbolic devices -- the cross shape, the flame, the light in the darkness and  the books. Clearly he expects a lot of them.  </P> <P> One thought that comes to mind: The Middle Ages once were known as the Dark  Ages, when the church kept the "flame" of knowledge alight in monasteries.  </P> <P> But the image of the flame also suggests the mass torching of books by zealous  censors during periods of conservative backlash. In the United States today,  the impetus for censorship comes largely from the religious right.  </P> <P> The actions of preserving and destroying the written word -- God's or not --  can both be related to Christianity; thus, the relevance of the double symbol  of the cross in the installation.  </P> <P> But, unless the cliched title phrase is simply a ruse to throw us off, Stone  also seems to be saying that we've come to value the word too much and the  image too little. This argument seems to be relevant primarily to contemporary  art, in which texts have assumed a starring role formerly claimed only by  images, and critical commentary has become a necessary guide to understanding  the work. Possibly Stone views this state of affairs as "double-crossing" the  viewer.  </P> <P> If that's so, it's ironic that his own art relies so heavily on the role of  interpretation -- and on the display of words almost as objects in their own  right. An overload of heavily charged symbolism gives the piece a certain  intellectual fuzziness. Still, Stone's piece is nothing if not teasingly  provocative. And it certainly is refreshing to accuse an artist of packing his  work with too many ideas. Too often, the problem is the opposite.  </P> <P> What: "DOUBLE CROSS: 1 (picture) 1,000 (words)," an installation by George  Stone.  </P> <P> When: Sundays through Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays  till 9 p.m.; Saturdays from 10 to 5, through Sept. 2.  </P> <P> Where: The Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza satellite, 3333 Bristol St.,  Suite 1000, Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Take the Bristol Street entrance from the San Diego Freeway.

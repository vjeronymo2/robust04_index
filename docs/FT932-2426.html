			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Renault and Volvo in talks on merger INTENSIVE talks are under way between Renault, the state-owned French car and truck maker, and Volvo of Sweden on turning their three-year-old alliance into a merger, it emerged yesterday. The negotiations have been accelerated by the new French government's privatisation policy and the resolution earlier this month of an 18-month dispute between Volvo and the Swedish government over the future of Procordia, a drugs and food group jointly controlled by Volvo and the state. The companies and the French finance ministry yesterday refused public comment on a report in Liberation, the French newspaper, that the French finance and industry ministries had given their agreement in principle to the structure of a merger. But a Renault spokesman said: 'We have always said we want to work ever closer with Volvo, with a possible merger one day.' According to Liberation, Renault and Volvo would form a joint holding company, which in turn would take 55 per cent of a publicly quoted Renault-Volvo manufacturing company. The rest of the latter joint company's equity would be held directly by AB Volvo and a new company, Renault Investissement. At present, Renault holds 8 per cent of Volvo and Volvo has 20 per cent of Renault, and both companies have cross-holdings in their respective car and truck divisions. Renault's refusal yesterday to comment on the report was in marked contrast to its repeated denials of reports from Italy that it was preparing to take a 40 per cent stake in Fiat. Renault is on the list of 21 companies which the Balladur government plans to privatise but is unlikely to be the first to be sold. A finance ministry official said this week that the question of Renault's capital structure had to be settled.</p>

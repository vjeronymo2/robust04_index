			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WORLD OF SHOCK AND AFTERSHOCK;  </P> <P> RUSSIA: EMBOLDENED EXPRESSION  </P> <P> For Americans in Moscow the unmarked office of Anatoli Belyayev is an important  stop, up a flight of dark stairs, down a quiet corridor. Americans go there  because Belyayev is part of the revolutionary changes in the Soviet Union. In  April he came to California and, while he was in Palo Alto, Moscow  conservatives tried to close him down.  </P> <P> Belyayev is a round, gruff, crusty editor in chief. If you are bright he likes  you; if you are not, he folds his arms across his big stomach and says, "I  don't know."  </P> <P> Belyayev's monthly journal, Twentieth Century and Peace, was once known as a  propaganda rag, an arm of the Peace Committee that had blasted the United  States for 40 years. But Belyayev has been changing all that, collecting a  group of brilliant writers on the cutting edge of the democratic movement: Len  Karpinsky has been more insightful about the failures of socialism than many  Western observers. Yuri F. Karyakin has been insistent on the need for a global  vision not dependent on weapons. Alex Adamovich has been hammering on  Chernobyl, Stalin, conscription and war.  </P> <P> Circulation has climbed, last year jumping from a modest 50,000 to 120,000.  </P> <P> In January, 1989, Belyayev printed Alexander Solzhenitsyn's "Live Not by Lies,"  the first Solzhenitsyn published legally in the Soviet Union since the early  '70s. Although legal, it upset the Peace Committee. In February the committee's  leadership told the editor to start submitting material for advance approval.  </P> <P> Belyayev, a stubborn man, said, "We don't know any military secrets," assuming  that as the only legal basis for censorship. There the matter rested until  April, when he came to the United States for a meeting on human rights  sponsored by the Beyond War Foundation.  </P> <P> While he was gone, the Peace Committee chose to suppress the May issue of  Twentieth Century and Peace. It was the sort of rejection calculated to send a  message: too far out; other publications beware.  </P> <P> Belyayev was in our house on Sunday when he heard the news. He immediately  called Moscow. When he got off the phone he said, "I will not panic. They do  not know that I know. And they do not know that I am making calls. I can do  this as well from here as from Moscow."  </P> <P> Then followed days of phone calls. After each one, Belyayev sat down, drank tea  and told a little more of the 1989 March-April political turmoil in Moscow. His  story illuminates a patchwork of events, events so significant that another  visitor, who helped engineer the March election victories in Leningrad, said:  "If you haven't been to the Soviet Union since the elections, you have never  been here. Everything has changed."  </P> <P> In the March 25 balloting for the Congress of Deputies, the Communist Party was  humiliated. The party label itself was sufficient to sink a candidate.  </P> <P> Those defeats sent a wave of apprehension all the way up to the Central  Committee, atop the power structure. Rapid responses followed, some bloody,  some threatening:  </P> <P> April 8. The conservatives make a dramatic move. A decree issued by the  Presidium of the Supreme Soviet calls for imprisonment of up to 10 years for  public advocacy of change "by methods contrary to the U.S.S.R. constitution."  There is also a provision of three years' imprisonment for public insult or  defaming "of the Soviet state or government institutions and their officials."  </P> <P> "Public insult" is hard to define. Since no one knew what would be an "insult,"  prosecutors could have a field day. The new decree causes dramatic alarm among  glasnost proponents.  </P> <P> Is the "decree" law? No one knows for sure. In the hierarchical Soviet system a  high-up source is treated as authoritative. All you have to know is how high  up. The Supreme Soviet is very high indeed.  </P> <P> April 9. Georgian nationalists demonstrating in the capital city of Tbilisi are  precipitously attacked by soldiers wielding sharpened shovels and using gas; 20  people, including women and children, are killed. Moscow intellectuals are  outraged, charging that no local Tbilisi authorities could have given orders to  kill. All fingers point to Kremlin conservatives exaggerating the dangers of  disorder and, in the process, undermining Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika  and glasnost.  </P> <P>  April 14. The Ministry of Internal Affairs (KGB) announces that crime in the  country has jumped by 31.2% in the first three months of 1989 and calls for  "decisive measures to restore order."  </P> <P> April 16. The same ministry announces that it has found "explosive devices" at  two Moscow subway stations. Progressives react with disbelief.  </P> <P> April 20. Conservatives push further. The Politburo announces that there will  soon be a new law to increase media responsibility. There will also be a law on  informal associations, to create "a flexible legal watchdog mechanism." The  measures appear directed at two of the most important forces behind  democratization.  </P> <P> April 21. The Peace Committee informs Belyayev's Moscow deputy that the May  issue will be suppressed. Within that issue is an important article examining  Solidarity in Poland from the workers' point of view. The April 20 proposed law  seems to be in immediate effect.  </P> <P> The law also affects an informal group, the Moscow Tribunal, which includes  intellectuals such as Andrei Sakharov, Adamovich and Karyakin. Together with a  popular group called the Democratic Union, they have been planning a  demonstration in Pushkin Square for April 22.  </P> <P> April 21. Pravda denounces the Democratic Union. The stage is set. If these  groups lose nerve the conservative tide will continue rising. Perhaps worse, if  demonstrators go ahead and authorities overreact, there could be a repeat of  the Georgia bloodshed in Moscow.  </P> <P> That night the highly prestigious Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences  addresses a letter to the Central Committee calling for the prosecution of the  people "who made the order from Moscow to do the military violence in Georgia."  This is a strong, almost unheard of call for action by prestigious people  against prestigious people. One year earlier a conservative letter in a  newspaper had been enough to quiet the perestroika crowd for three weeks. Not  anymore.  </P> <P> April 22. The Pushkin Square rally proceeds peacefully, without incident.  </P> <P> April 23. Belyayev, in Palo Alto, learns of the suppression of his issue.  Quietly he vows a countercampaign: "We will not only publish in May," he says  with a wry smile, "we will go now for a complete reorganization of the Peace  Committee."  </P> <P> Belyayev opponents may think the editor is too far away to act. In fact, with  the improbable help of AT&amp;T, the editor conducts his campaign from  California. Three members of his editorial board are newly elected to the  Congress of Deputies: Yuri S. Afanasiev, Adamovich and Karyakin. Belyayev  rallies them and their new-found influence: They agree on a protest to the  Central Committee where the real conservative power resides.  </P> <P> April 24. Belyayev continues calling. Unbeknown to him, but perhaps partly  because of his efforts, Gorbachev is about to act against the same target.  </P> <P> April 25. Gorbachev engineers a breathtaking sweep, ousting 110 members of the  old-guard members from the Central Committee. The "dead souls," as progressives  call them, are suddenly gone. Belyayev leans back on a couch in a Palo Alto  living room: "We can have tea, now. All bad news is smashed by the results of  this meeting."  </P> <P> April 26. Belyayev calls to learn that his magazine has been allowed to go to  press "with only minor changes." Belyayev takes a day off, visits a San Jose  flea market to buy toys for his grandchildren.  </P> <P> So the second Soviet revolution lurches forward. One observer suggested that  "the conservatives lost as soon as the telephone was invented."  </P> <P> But nothing is that easy. "In a state without property," observes Fyodor  Burlatsky, chairman of the Soviet Human Rights Commission, "the bureaucracy are  the nobility. They have the power." Giving up that power requires a struggle,  one permission or regulation at a time. The success of glasnost may depend upon  the people's patience. If the people lose patience, there could be a repeat of  the Chinese experience. But if they persist -- as they have so far -- the quiet  revolution may continue.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a parliamentary session Tuesday, Tatar President  Mintimer Shaymiyev spoke in favor of the government's  anti-crisis program and against its resignation.    "If until now the government has succeeded in easing the  situation by half-measures, then radical steps are needed now  necessitated by the Russian leadership's tougher line for  keeping down inflation which puts the question of surviving  before enterprises," he said.    Shaymiyev added that Tatarstan needed a long-term economic  program which would be developed with the participation of  foreign experts by this autumn. "While now the government should  be allowed to implement its proposals which will give it a  possibility to survive," he said.    In his opinion, the government should in the first place  support the oil-extracting industry as lowering volumes were the  main reason for a 30-percent production drop in the republic.    Among other top-priority measures to stabilize the economic  situation, Shaymiyev indicated regulating the movement of  capital, forming independent credit resources, refusing  expensive credits of the Central Bank of Russia, promoting the  circulation of bills of exchange inside Tatarstan, developing a  program to support entrepreneurship and forming the market of  real estate.    Shayiyev pointed out that the power-sharing treaty between  Russia and Tatarstan was instrumental in solving existing  differences rather than in completely removing them. During  Boris Yeltsin's recent visit to Kazan, the republic had managed  to draw Russia in such major federal projects as the renovation  of KamAZ, the construction of a car-making plant in Yelabuga and  an oil-processing plant in Nizhnekamsk as well as a number of  military conversion programs, he said.</p>

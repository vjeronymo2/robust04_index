			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold falls 14% to Pounds 3.7m BARR &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust reported pre-tax profits down 14 per cent, from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 3.7m for 1992 as recession took its toll on the group's travel, motor and fuel distribution activities. Profits were reduced to Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 1.99m) on the core motor distribution side, and fell to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 3.7m) at the leisure and holidays division. Fuel distribution was in the red for the first time. Turnover of this Leeds-based company slipped to Pounds 227m (Pounds 229m). The group's borrowings doubled to Pounds 20.2m and gearing rose to 74 per cent (32.4 per cent) at year end after a change in accounting policy to conform with FRED 4. The main effect was to bring the group's interest in four hotels, and their associated debt, on to its balance sheet. Prospects had improved for the motor distribution, said Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, but widespread discounting of holiday prices would affect the group even more deeply this year. The results for 1993 were unlikely to improve much he said. An unchanged final dividend of 7p is proposed for a maintained 10p total which is payable from reduced earnings per share of 19.1p against 20.7p.</p>

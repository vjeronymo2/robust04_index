Soviet abortions in 1988 totaled nearly 7 million,  Meditsinskaya Gazeta reported. "These monstrous statistics are difficult to  believe," it said, adding that illegal abortions performed outside hospitals  are not even counted in that total. The weekly Moscow News reported in January  that 90% of all first pregnancies in the Soviet Union end in abortion and that  hundreds of women die each year as a result.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF DOUBLE LOYALTIES;  </P> <P> CHURCH: BISHOPS ARE NOT ALWAYS SILENT ON SECULAR MATTERS. WHEN THE ISSUE IS  OTHER THAN ABORTION, CRITICS MAY BE MORE TOLERANT OF THEIR INTERCESSION.  </P> <P> The New York Times is among the editorialists who are heaving their dismay over  Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego. He is the churchman who has advised one of  his parishioners that she could no longer receive Communion. On what authority  had he acted against Lucy Killea? (She is an assemblywoman and candidate for  the state Senate.) The bishop cited Canon 915 of the Code of Canon Law, which  gives a bishop the right to deny Communion to those who "obstinately persist in  manifest grave sin."  </P> <P> Well, why hadn't other bishops taken similar action? "I was confronted with a  particular case that the other bishops have not. I don't believe any other  politician in the country has so flagrantly and blatantly and persistently  taken a stand for abortion as Mrs. Killea has done."  </P> <P> Now, it is sometimes wisecracked about the Catholic Church that the reason it  continues to have its special hold on people is because there's a there there.  Well, that is true, but it isn't so that there is a monolith there. The Pope  has the final say on some matters, but bishops are very powerful satraps, and  they are capable of reacting differently to the same canon.  </P> <P> Maher's point -- that Killea is unique in the vociferousness of her espousal of  a practice the church condemns as a mortal sin -- isn't self-evident. Observers  frequently point to Gov. Mario Cuomo and to Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and Daniel  Patrick Moynihan as examples of Catholics who can be said to flout their faith,  to the extent that they vote for or countenance public financing of abortion.  But perhaps on the sinful scale, their voices do not reach the Richter scale of  Killea.  </P> <P> Certainly what the bishop did will prove unpopular, and Americans being as  Americans are, his move will almost certainly guarantee Killea's victory in the  current California race on which depends the question whether the state Senate  will be pro- or anti-abortion, since it is tied at the moment. This is so  because many non-Catholics will also vote for her in sympathy for what they  view as persecution or as religious trespass; and indeed there are Catholics  who will vote for her as a means of expressing their resentment of the bishop's  intercession in what they deem to be a question of exclusively secular concern.  </P> <P> Maher has not received any support from other bishops. Granted that the  presumption is against cross-commentary on action taken in other dioceses, but  abortion is a burning issue, and very recently the Catholic bishops met and  reinforced their opposition to abortion, reiterating that it is a grave sin.  Indeed, to submit to an abortion is an offense that brings automatic  excommunication.  </P> <P> Now the bishops are not always silent, nor are editorialists always shocked  when they exercise clerical muscle in secular matters. Archbishop Joseph Rummel  of New Orleans excommunicated a few members of his flock back in 1962 for  attempting to hinder the racial desegregation of schools.  </P> <P> On the present occasion, the New York Times writes that "Bishop Maher threatens  the truce of tolerance by which Americans maintain civility and enlarge  religious liberty." There was no equivalent denunciation of Archbishop Rummel,  but then there was something of a consensus by the literati in favor of racial  integration. The clergy in South Africa who have called for civil disobedience,  in violation of South African law, are widely celebrated and win Nobel prizes  and MacArthur Foundation awards.  </P> <P> The question that people really ask themselves is: Do I agree with the moral  position taken by this clergyman? If the answer is yes, then they manage to  reconcile church and state. If the answer is no, then we hear from the New York  Times that "to force religious discipline on public officials risks destroying  the fragile accommodations that Americans of all faiths and no faith have built  with the bricks of the Constitution and the mortar of tolerance."  </P> <P> That would be a shame -- to see Catholic politicians boycotted by the  electorate -- the paper continues. Because that would deprive the nation of  "Catholics who wish to bring their moral outlook to bear on many more subjects  than abortion." It's hard to think, offhand, just what a "Catholic" moral  outlook distinctively is, and very hard to suppose it can lie between the  sheets with People for the American Way. Gay rights? prayer in the schools? no  commerce on Sundays? One wonders just which Catholic moral insight the New York  Times wishes to see preserved.  </P> <P> And then, of course, the largest question of all. Those who talk feverishly  about the danger of double loyalties should remind themselves that if you don't  have divided loyalties on some questions, you might end up in Nuremberg,  hanging by the neck until you're quite dead.  </P></p>

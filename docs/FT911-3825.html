			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Pickens considers sale of Koito stake TEXAS CORPORATE raider Mr T. Boone Pickens is considering selling his 26.4 per cent stake in Koito Manufacturing, the Japanese motor parts manufacturer which has repeatedly spurned his advances. A spokesman for Mr Pickens yesterday told the Associated Press news agency that the disposal of the Koito shares, currently worth about Dollars 850m, is among several options being considered by the Dallas-based financier. 'We're not in any rush, but it's one of the things we're looking at,' the spokesman said. However, he denied Japanese reports that Mr Pickens has already sold his shares back to Mr Kitaro Watanabe, the Japanese speculator who secretly financed the purchases with a loan secured by the shares. A Koito spokesman said in New York yesterday that the Japanese company had no 'direct information' on the reports of Mr Pickens' retreat, but that 'we would certainly not be surprised by such a turn of events'. Mr Pickens has had several well-publicised run-ins with Koito, which has refused to give him any representation on its board and has consistently accused him of being a front for Mr Watanabe's efforts at short-term speculation. The market price of Koito shares has halved since Mr Pickens made his initial investment two years ago through his privately-held holding company Boone Co. Besides Koito's unremitting hostility, Mr Pickens' willingness to put his shares up for sale may be influenced by the financial difficulties of Mesa Limited Partnership, the large US natural gas producer of which Mr Pickens is the general partner and in which he has a 4.5 per cent stake. One New York analyst also suggested yesterday that Mr Pickens may see his continued involvement with Koito as a hurdle to his apparent ambitions to run for election as governor of Texas.</p>

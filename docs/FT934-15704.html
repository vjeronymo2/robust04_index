			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Rights and famine - The Dublin Theatre Festival THE undisputed star of the Dublin Theatre Festival's first week is the Royal Shakespeare Company's magnificent production of The Winter's Tale directed by Adrian Noble. Its combination of verve and opulence and the sheer excellence of the acting had audiences gasping with wonder. Dublin's Gate Theatre has imported Karel Reisz to direct Niamh Cusack in A Doll's House while the Abbey's artistic director Garry Hynes has chosen to mark the end of her term there by directing Tom Murphy's 1968 play, Famine. Both provide long evenings of serious theatre but fail to generate the excitement that was around last summer when new plays by Brian Friel and Billy Roche were staged. It seems a rather unfestive festival, almost jinxed. A new play by Joe O'Byrne has been withdrawn at the last minute, as has a one-man show by Dubliner Mannix Flynn; the only big excitement left in the second week is Rough Magic's production of The Way of the World in 1930s costume; and as I write this I am told of the death of Cyril Cusack whose daughter plays the lead in A Doll's House. Karel Reisz has come to theatre direction from a long and distinguished cinema career (Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Morgan - a Suitable Case for Treatment, etc) - his work shows the stamp of maturity in its precision and its lack of gimmickry. Reisz realises that A Doll's House is not about divorce or the rights of women, but about the romantic notion of self fulfilment, and consequently the final scene in which Norah leaves her husband and children to 'find herself' remains as moving if not quite as shocking as in 1879. Assheton Gorton's set is a stuffy, over-decorated, predominantly brown bourgeois apartment with doll's house-like cut out ornaments among its plaster work. Rupert Murray's atmospheric lighting works in conjunction with the set's unusual perspective to change mood and highlight the drama. It is generally the child-wife Norah who gains all the attention and sympathy, but here equal weight must be given to her husband, Torvald, impeccably played by Ian McElhinney. Torvald is not portrayed as an unfeeling monster, but as a kind, affectionate and almost fun-loving husband. True, he can also be bossy, insensitive and pompous, but these are not the reasons why Norah is leaving: it is the conventions of society that she is rebelling against rather than her husband who just happens to embody these restrictions. When Torvald realises he is being rejected you feel positively sorry for him. The tragedy is as much Torvald's as Norah's. Niamh Cusack looks the right age for Norah - late 20s, say. Her rather stagey mannerisms seem at odds with such a realistic play, and even apparently impulsive movements appear carefully choreographed. She can certainly hold an audience, but I missed the depths of angst which a more intellectual (and almost inevitably older) actress could bring to the part. Susan FitzGerald is wonderfully self-assure as the friend, Mrs Linde, and Timothy Walker's Krogstad is slightly seedy as well as sinister. My only reservation about this highly accomplished evening is the decision to play the three acts with two intervals. In fact, the Gate's production ran for only a quarter of an hour longer than the Abbey's Famine, which had only the one interval. There is a school of thought which believes that Famine is a neglected classic. It does not seem particularly neglected to me, having had two previous productions in Dublin and one in Galway, neither does it seem in any sense a classic. Famine is written in a series of 12 scenes set in the village of Glanconnor in 1846, the second year that the potato crop failed. It charts the effect of hunger on a group of villagers. Some take up the only relief offered by the landlord, a ticket to Canada. One man kills two policemen, hoping to start an uprising. Others die or are dying. The chief problem with the play is its schematic form. Peasants, priests and landlords all represent particular reactions to events but never emerge as real characters. It is more like watching a very violent pageant than a play. I hoped that Garry Hynes would do something new with it, but alas, no. The set by Frank Conway, consists of a tumbled down stone circle which occupies most of the stage and confines the actors to the centre or the wings to no good purpose. They sometimes rant so hard that they become inaudible. The lighting, which fails to illuminate the relevant faces, does not help. For once here is a play which demands historical accuracy and instead we are given pointless anachronisms - cigarettes, barbed wire. The degradation and suffering of the famine's victims, the misguided government policy and the consequent impotence of the landlords are clearly shown here, but they are not made into theatre. We need a play about the famine, but this is not the one.</p>

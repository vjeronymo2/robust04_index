			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Waiting for the clouds to lift The most important date in the economic calendar for President George Bush is arguably July 30. On that red letter day, the Commerce Department releases its first estimate of gross domestic product in the second quarter. If the growth rate is 3 per cent or more, Mr Bush will be able to claim an economic renaissance when he addresses the party faithful at the Republican convention in August. The Bush presidential campaign could then acquire an unstoppable momentum. Several forecasters believe this nightmare for the Democrats is rapidly becoming a sure bet. Growth will be depressed in the current quarter by corporate destocking. But industrial production should be growing at an annual rate of 5-6 per cent within a few months, says Mr Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, the forecasting group. He thinks that will put downward pressure on the politically sensitive unemployment rate. His economic model of voter behaviour suggests Mr Bush will win 52-53 per cent of the vote in November - a comfortable victory. A surge in optimism about the economy has been spurred mainly by a surprisingly strong rise in consumption spending since Christmas and a recovery of confidence in the residential housing market, which has benefited from the Federal Reserve's cheap money policy. Even if retail sales dip in March, strong gains since the new year point to consumption growth at an annual rate of 5 per cent or more in the first quarter. Reports hinting at a broader-based recovery include a sharp rise in the official indices of leading and coincident indicators and a surge in the Purchasing Managers' Index, usually a reliable guide to the outlook for the manufacturing sector. Many economists, however, are viewing the figures with a jaundiced eye. Last week, 100 leading academic economists - led by Nobel laureates Mr Robert Solow of MIT and Mr James Tobin of Yale - sent an open letter to Mr Bush pleading for urgent action to stimulate the economy. Their main recommendation is that federal government borrow an extra Dollars 50bn (about 1 per cent of GDP) to finance higher investment spending by states and local governments. The group also advocates further interest rate cuts and tax incentives for capital formation. Mr Michael Boskin, the White House chief economist, swiftly rejected the plea for additional borrowing. Speaking in Washington, however, he was only fractionally more optimistic about the economy than the 100 critics. He welcomed the recovery of retail sales and claimed the economy's improvement was set to continue. But he refused to declare the recession over. His reticence was partly politically motivated: nothing could be more damaging for the Bush administration than to raise economic hopes a second time, only to have to concede that the recovery is again a mirage. Judging from the disappointing March employment report, Mr Boskin was wise to play down expectations. Non-farm employment rose 19,000, less than half the increase Wall Street expected and a derisory gain in an economy with nearly 109m non-agricultural jobs. The Labour Department also revised down February's figures to show an increase of only 107,000 compared with 164,000 previously. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.3 per cent, a six-year high. The jobs data admittedly lag the cycle: companies respond to higher demand first by drawing down inventories and then by increasing overtime. They take on permanent workers only when a sustained rise in production is expected. Even allowing for lags, however, the employment figures are unusually discouraging. There were no more jobs in March than in May of last year, despite three quarters of slow GDP growth. In a normal recovery, the monthly increase in employment would now be running at about 300,000. The poor jobs outlook suggests consumer confidence will rise only gradually and raises doubts about the sustainability of the recovery in retail spending, which partly reflected a decline in savings from already depressed levels. There are other mildly worrying signs. The surge in monetary growth at the beginning of the year has already tailed off with M2, the targeted measure of broad money, now growing at an annual rate of only 3 per cent, just above the bottom of its target range. The deteriorating outlook for Japan and parts of Europe may also sharply reduce the growth of US exports, a crucial prop in recent quarters. The important question is not whether a recovery of sorts is under way but whether the economy is yet capable of breaking out of its 1990s prison of sluggish growth. Remarkably, the economy has not grown at an annual rate of more than 1.9 per cent in any quarter since Mr Bush assumed power early in 1989. Mr Paul Mastroiddi, US economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, argues that most analysts are trying to make recent economic data fit a traditional cyclical pattern. The dip associated with the Gulf war was one side of a 'V'; economists thus keep hoping that a serious recovery will eventually kick in. This may happen. It may even happen in time for the Republican convention. But it is equally possible that the legacy of the 1980s - high personal and corporate debts, huge public sector deficits and low savings rates - will keep the economy sluggish for several more quarters.</p>

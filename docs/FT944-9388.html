			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Republicans threaten to strip DC of voting rights The new Republican leadership in Congress is threatening to take away the limited voting rights in the House of Representatives enjoyed by the District of Columbia and to downgrade the status of the congressional committee responsible for the nation's capital. Mrs Eleanor Holmes Norton, the DC delegate, emerged from a meeting with Mr Newt Gingrich, certain to be the next Speaker of the House, promising to fight his proposals. But the return of Mr Marion Barry as Washington's mayor after a four-year hiatus combined with Republican control of the legislature threatens the city, already in a deep budgetary crisis, with the probability of an extremely unsympathetic reception on Capitol Hill. Under current procedure Mrs Norton, first elected in 1990, may serve on House committees, address the floor of the chamber and vote when the House sits as 'a committee of the whole'. But her votes on actual legislation are not recorded. The nation's capital has no representation in the Senate. Mr Gingrich reportedly told her that he intended to take away the limited voting privilege and deprive her of the right to speak when the House considered the District's affairs. Mrs Norton received some support for her stand yesterday from Congresswoman Connie Morella, the moderate Republican representing the wealthy Maryland suburb immediately north of the city. She agreed that it would be unfair to reduce the District, whose citizens pay federal income taxes, to the status of the four offshore protectorates - Puerto Rico, Guam, the American Virgin Islands and American Samoa.</p>

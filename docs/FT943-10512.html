			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Placing values AromaScan at Pounds 27m AromaScan, the developer of an 'electronic nose' - a new technology to detect odours - yesterday announced a placing price of 100p to raise Pounds 12m from its forthcoming flo-tation. Although the placing was originally expected to value the company at about Pounds 35m, yesterday's pricing gave it a market capitalisation of Pounds 27m. Mr Fred Worth, finance and operations director, said he was delighted with the value put on the company and described earlier estimates as an 'inexact science'. After expenses, the placing of 12m new ordinary shares will leave the company with Pounds 11.2m to invest in a new plant and develop industrial applications for the technology. The electronic nose system, pioneered and developed at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist), relies on a large library of polymers to identify smells and produce digital print-outs. Mr Worth said the company was negotiating joint venture arrangements with a number of international groups which are keen to exploit the technology in areas such as air management, purification systems and wound dress-ings. Existing shareholders have agreed to retain their stakes for at least two years following the placing, handled by NM Rothschild with Peel Hunt acting as broker. Meanwhile, Neotronics Technology - AromaScan's main rival - yesterday announced a new marketing initiative to promote its own electronic nose to potential joint venture partners and new clients. The maker of gas analysis equipment said it was setting up a new subsidiary  -Neotronics Scientific - which will develop and sell its equipment around the world. Mr Stephen Collins, a former international marketing manager at Fisons, is to join the group later this month and will be targeting some 800 companies which have expressed an interest in the system.</p>

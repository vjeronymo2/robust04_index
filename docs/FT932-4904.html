			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Observer: Foreign elite David Heathcoat-Amory's arrival as the new minister for Europe today consolidates the hold of Old Etonians on positions of power in the Foreign Office. Observer cannot remember the last time that four out of six FO ministers all went to Eton. Doubtless, having OEs at the FO is jolly good for keeping up appearances on the international stage, but it is hard to imagine Lady Thatcher permitting Britain's international relations to fall into the hands of a similar cabal when she was running the show. However, all is not lost. Old Etonian Douglas Hurd has long been rumoured to want to step down as foreign secretary before the end of this parliament which should give John Major a chance to promote a grammar school boy to chief flag-waver.</p>

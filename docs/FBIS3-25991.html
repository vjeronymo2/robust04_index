			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Qinghai has scored noticeable anticorruption  results since last September when various areas and units across  the province started conscientiously relaying and implementing  the spirit of the anticorruption instructions given by the CPC  Central Committee and the Qinghai Provincial CPC Committee,  mobilizing and guiding the broad masses of people at all levels  across the province to combat corruption, and creating a strong  anticorruption momentum in the whole province with the result  that the broad masses of people and cadres in Qinghai now have  enhanced confidence in the on-going anticorruption struggle.    Statistics shows that the provincial discipline inspection  commission and supervision department received reports on some  679 corruption cases from the masses in the period between late  August and late November last year. Some 84.8 percent of the  province's cadres at provincial department or bureau level and  some 97 percent of the province's cadres at county or provincial  department section level conducted anticorruption  self-examination in the same period with the result that some  cadres voluntarily handed over credit cards, coupons, and  souvenirs given to them as gifts, admitted such past wrongdoings  as enjoying above-standard reception and free meals during  inspection tours of grass-roots units, accepting special local  products given by grass-roots cadres on Lunar New Year Festival,  and so on, and put forth measures of straightening out those  malpractices. Their correct approach was appreciated by the  broad masses of cadres and people.    Qinghai's anticorruption success is also proven by the fact  that the province has made much headway in investigating and  handling corruption cases. According to incomplete statistics,  in 1993, discipline inspection and supervision departments in  the province placed on file for investigation and prosecution  some 514 corruption cases, of which some 402 cases were wound  up, with the result that a total of 154 party members who had  violated discipline were penalized, of whom 64 were expelled  from the party. One was a cadre at provincial department level  and 13 were cadres at county or provincial department section  level. A total of 59 cadres were disciplined in accordance with  the relevant administrative rules, of whom five were cadres at  county or provincial department section level. Moreover, the  province also investigated and straightened out those  malpractices that had caused strong resentment among the masses  with the result that some 601 economic entities run by party or  government organs at the county level were screened, of which 22  were abolished or ordered to suspend operation, six were ordered  to become enterprises, and 11 were ordered to be leased to other  units. The provincial authorities are presently studying ways  and means of severing ties between those remaining economic  entities on the one hand and the party or government organs at  county or provincial department section levels on the other.</p>

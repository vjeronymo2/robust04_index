			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC will back Russia's Gatt application THE European Community will back Russia's planned application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which could be lodged as early as next month, a senior EC official said yesterday, Frances Williams writes. The official did not expect the application to run into opposition from Gatt members, though he foresaw hard bargaining on terms of entry. Russian membership remains some way off. Even in straightforward cases, negotiations rarely take less than a year. 'They clearly are trying to move towards a market economy system and an appropriate trade regime, but equally clearly they have not by any means got there yet,' he said. Gatt members would have to judge whether Russia could be accommodated as an ordinary market economy or whether, 'in a transitional phase', it would have to have a specially tailored protocol of accession. The US said in April it would back Russian membership of Gatt. Russia has had observer status since May 1990 and has subsequently become an observer on five of Gatt's voluntary codes of fair trade practice, including those on standards and anti-dumping. Thirteen other former Soviet republics are also Gatt observers, traditionally a first step to membership. The EC official said he expected Russia's Gatt application to give a boost to bilateral negotiations between Brussels and Moscow on a so-called 'partnership' accord.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / People: Another Barr leaves the ring The Aerostructures Hamble shambles has claimed another victim - Brian Barr, son of the former chief executive, who yesterday resigned as a director. Barr, 31, made almost Pounds 600,000 from the June flotation of the Southampton-based aircraft parts-maker. He was the production director responsible for the performance of the factory where Harrier parts were made, and where the company's problems began. At the time of the second profits warning in October he was moved from the production to the engineering side of the company. His father, Andrew Barr, who made Pounds 1.75m from the flotation, took early retirement. The father and son team moved to Aerostructures from the Rover cars group. They were keen to introduce Rover-style lean manufacturing techniques to the aircraft industry. A week ago Aerostructures ended its search for a new chief executive by appointing Christopher West, who has been acting as a consultant since leaving Westland Helicopters in 1992. Yesterday the group announced the appointment of Hugh Curran, 41, as director with responsibility for manufacturing. Curran, now operations director at BTR-Westinghouse Brakes, was formerly with Shorts in Belfast. Both he and West will take up their duties at the beginning of next month. David Ring, acting chief executive at Aerostructures, says the group is not abandoning the introduction of techniques learned in the motor industry. 'We are making sure we have the latest and most appropriate technologies - many of which come from the motor industry. However, the aircraft industry is still a craft industry in many ways.' Shares in Aerostructures, floated at 120p, fell to 24p in October but have since recovered to 31p.</p>

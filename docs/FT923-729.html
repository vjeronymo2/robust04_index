			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Financial restructuring at Fitch BRAND TRUST, a company controlled by two French former advertising agency executives and Sir Terence Conran, founder of the Habitat group and retired chairman of Storehouse, plans to provide Pounds 2.5m in new capital for Fitch, the lossmaking design consultant, in return for a 60 per cent equity stake in the restructured group. The capital injection is part of a financial reconstruction. Share trading in Fitch, which ran into problems partly because of high interest costs on property-related borrowings, was suspended in July at 41p pending the outcome of talks with its bankers on a refinancing package. Brand Trust is controlled by Mr Jean-Francois Bentz, former head of design at Roux, Seguela, Cayzac et Goudard (RSCG), one of the largest French advertising groups, and Mr Bernard Roux, former RSCG president. Brand Trust and Sir Terence will pay 11.7p per share for a total of 21.35m new shares. Brand Trust will have 35 per cent of the enlarged share capital and Sir Terence 25 per cent. Existing ordinary shareholders will see their stake diluted from 86.85 per cent to 18.9 per cent, while convertible preference shareholders, who currently would hold 13.15 per cent of the equity on conversion, will have their stock converted on enhanced terms into an 11.1 per cent equity stake. If Fitch's existing shareholders agree the restructuring at an extraordinary meeting on October 19, Mr Bentz will become its European chief executive, and Mr Roux and Sir Terence will join the board as non-executive directors. As part of the financial reconstruction Fitch's principal banker, National Westminster, has agreed to restructure its borrowings. The company has also reached agreement with its landlords and will sell Fitch Benoy, an architectural practice based in Newark, to its managing director, Mr Fitch said yesterday. Separately, Fitch reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 675,000), including Pounds 1.72m (Pounds 752,000) in exceptional charges, for the six months to June 30. Losses per share were 31.9p (14.2p).</p>

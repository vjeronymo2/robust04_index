			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Iberia Yesterday's chaos on the planes in Spain was nothing compared with the crisis that would grip the European Commission if it allowed Iberia to be refinanced yet again by its state owners. Other airlines would cry foul since the requested Pta130bn (Pounds 634.14m) in refinancing would break Iberia's undertaking not to seek state aid until 1996. Iberia's management has masterminded a strategy which generated losses of Pta120bn since 1992 - the same amount as the state bail-out in that year. While Iberia's absolute costs have been kept low, revenues have stalled. The airline has been caught between the Spanish recession, low yields caused by the high proportion of holiday traffic on its routes, and the absence of international transit passengers. Its efforts to remedy this by expanding into Latin America have proved unprofitable. Iberia must raise capital without begging from the state. It could sell and lease-back its aircraft, dispose of its European subsidiaries to companies such as BA or Lufthansa and cut costs still further. If that is not enough, the group could dismantle its Latin American operations. Iberia would be without an intercontinental strategy but it could easily merge with another airline. That might seem a big blow to Spanish pride, but it would be better than continuing large cash injections from the taxpayer.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Shares in US machine tool maker tumble 24% Shares in Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine tool manufacturer, fell 24 per cent yesterday when the company announced it expected 1994 earnings per share to be some 20 per cent below Wall Street forecasts. It blamed the shortfall in part on competitive industry pricing, which resulted from Europe's soft machine tools market. The stock, which is quoted on the Nasdaq market, closed at Dollars 15 3/4 , down Dollars 5 on the day. The company said it expected second-quarter earnings per share to be flat or slightly above the 20 cents earned in the first quarter, while for the full year earnings were likely to be 20 per cent below the Dollars 1.35 to Dollars 1.45 being forecast by analysts. The company had earnings per share of 34 cents in the second quarter of last year with Dollars 1.31 in 1993 as a whole. Mr Joseph Coppola, chairman, said a number of contracts booked in prior periods had proved more costly than anticipated. In addition, competitive pressures meant that 1994 gross margins, which the company had anticipated to be around 24-25 per cent, should instead be in the 22-23 per cent range - even though the group expected continued growth in quarterly bookings compared with last year. The soft market for machine tools in Europe had meant lower bookings for the company's operations there and also affected worldwide pricing: competitors suffering sharp order declines overseas were bidding aggressively for contracts in the US, creating more intense pricing pressure. Furthermore, the company's automation technology group, which makes highly engineered machine tools and cellular systems, had suffered weaker than expected bookings because US purchasers remained cautious about the economy. On the positive side, its domestic automotive business remained strong.</p>

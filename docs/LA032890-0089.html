			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP IS TARGET IN TV COUNTERATTACK  </P> <P> The TV ad opens with California gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein in a  bold red suit, looking directly into the camera and challenging her Democratic  opponent, John K. Van de Kamp, to run a positive campaign.  </P> <P> But just in case he doesn't get the point, Feinstein's image is suddenly  replaced by a 1950 photograph of Richard M. Nixon, who Feinstein says "smeared"  his U.S. Senate opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas.  </P> <P> As the battle of the TV ads continues to push the California governor's race  away from a discussion of the issues, Feinstein's advisers have come up with a  surprising -- and maybe risky -- answer to a commercial Van de Kamp is running  that attacks her record as mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988.  </P> <P> Her campaign advisers William Carrick and Hank Morris offered Feinstein  possible avenues of counterattack. But they said she rejected this tactic for  now and chose to capitalize on her front-runner status and try to focus  attention on the tone of the Democratic gubernatorial primary election.  </P> <P> The result is the 30-second remember-Nixon spot that the campaign started  producing Monday by filming Feinstein in Los Angeles and finished Tuesday in a  New York studio.  </P> <P> "I remember when Richard Nixon smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and distorted  (the) record. And we all remember the 1988 (presidential) campaign," Feinstein  says in her commercial challenge. The first reference was to a very nasty  California U.S. Senate race in 1950, in which Nixon won his only statewide  election in part by accusing Douglas of being a communist sympathizer.  </P> <P> Copies of the new commercial were shipped to TV stations throughout California  on Tuesday night and will begin airing in various markets tonight.  </P> <P> "This is a high-risk strategy because the usual response to an attack like Van  de Kamp's is a counterattack," Carrick said.  </P> <P> Morris added: "We all know the public is tired of negative ads, but the fact is  they almost always work."  </P> <P> The consultants admit that Feinstein may be uniquely positioned to try to pull  off this latest tactic because she is a woman candidate who was sometimes  called "Goody Two Shoes" when she was mayor.  </P> <P> She sought to back up that approach Tuesday with a speech to business and civic  leaders in Los Angeles. She declared, "Let's make 1990 the year when we break  with the past and put negative politics behind us. Unfortunately, it takes two  to make a positive campaign."  </P> <P> But the Van de Kamp campaign said the linking of Van de Kamp to the memory of  Nixon was as down and dirty as anything seen so far in this campaign. And more,  Van de Kamp aides said this was not the first time she had tried to link an  opponent to a reviled politician. They produced a San Francisco Examiner news  clipping from her 1979 race for mayor of San Francisco in which she likened an  opponent to a racist politician.  </P> <P> The opponent was Quentin Kopp, now a state senator. The article said that  brochures Feinstein sent out contained testimonials from black leaders and this  headline: "The Real Quentin Kopp-George Wallace Returns." (Wallace was governor  of Alabama and one of the foremost segregationists of the 1950s and 1960s).  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Van de Kamp has his own problems with his latest TV ad. Lawyers for  the San Francisco Chronicle Publishing Co. said they sued him in federal court  Tuesday for trademark infringement because the spot Van de Kamp is now running  uses the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper's name four times as it cites  articles to back up its charges that Feinstein left the city in debt and dumped  sewage in San Francisco Bay.  </P> <P> Officials of the Chronicle Publishing Co. saw their trademark in a photograph  taken from the Van de Kamp ad that was published in the Los Angeles Times last  week along with an analysis of some of the Van de Kamp charges against  Feinstein.  </P> <P> The Van de Kamp campaign agreed to remove the Chronicle Page 1 nameplate from  its ad, but Chronicle general counsel Ron Ingram said Tuesday that the type  used in the remake of the Van de Kamp ad still infringed on the Chronicle  trademark.  </P> <P> "It still makes it appear that we are sponsoring the attack on Dianne  Feinstein," Ingram said.  </P> <P> Despite the independent challenges to Van de Kamp's ad, Carrick and Morris  believe that the attacks have hurt Feinstein, who soared ahead of Van de Kamp  and the presumptive Republican gubernatorial nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, in  a Los Angeles Times poll taken last month.  </P> <P> The new Feinstein commercial begins with Feinstein citing a Van de Kamp  quotation from some months ago in which he said he thought the public was tired  of negative campaigns. "Weeks ago, John Van de Kamp said people are tired of  negative campaigns," Feinstein says as she looks into the camera. "I don't know  about John, but I really believe that. I still remember when Richard Nixon  smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and distorted her record. And we all remember the  1988 campaign. We Californians are trend-setters. So let's make 1990 the year  we put negative politics behind us."  </P> <P> But does this strategy mean that Feinstein can go through the entire Democratic  primary without running a harsh ad about Van de Kamp?  </P> <P> "That's what Dianne would like, but we aren't making any promises," Carrick  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Governor. Whose ad? Democratic candidate and former San Francisco  Mayor Dianne Feinstein. Target of ad: Her opponent in the primary election,  current Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp.  </P> <P>  What the ad says, with an analysis by Times political writer Keith Love.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ad: "Weeks ago John Van de Kamp said people are tired of negative campaigns. I  don't know about John, but I really believe that."  </P> <P> Analysis: Feinstein is referring to a statement Van de Kamp made last year at a  fund raiser: "People are tired of negative campaigns, tired of negative  candidates."  </P> <P> Ad: "I still remember when Richard Nixon smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and  distorted her record. And we all remember the 1988 campaign. "  </P> <P> Analysis: Feinstein is referring to a particularly nasty U.S. Senate race in  1950 in California, in which Nixon won his only statewide campaign in part by  accusing Douglas of being soft on communism. The reference to the 1988  presidential campaign derives from widespread criticism of President George  Bush and, later, Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis for some of their harsh  TV commercials.  </P> <P> Ad: ". . . let's make 1990 the year we put negative politics behind us. . . .  Mr. Van de Kamp, it takes two to make a positive campaign."  </P> <P> Analysis: Feinstein is sure to face criticism for, in effect, comparing Atty.  Gen. Van de Kamp to Richard M. Nixon, who resigned his presidency in August,  1974, during the Watergate scandal.  </P> <P> Times political writer John Balzar in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

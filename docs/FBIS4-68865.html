			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Musafirova under the rubric "Cast of </F> Characters": "Let the Acting Prime Minister Be a Lesson to  Others]    [Text] The press media knew rather little about Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy last year. He is the fattest deputy of the Ukrainian  Supreme Soviet. Smokes a lot. Looks rather gloomy. He used to  work in Donetsk as the manager of two right-flank coal mines. He  was there for 22 years plus 15 more; therefore, he has the right  to tell anyone where to go and how far. He addresses his  audience as "Dear Comrades." His political views are in full  agreement with his age and position.    His arrival in the Cabinet of Ministers was preceded by a  powerful wave of rumors. Zvyahilskyy's career in the government  was linked to the onset ("he instigated it!") of the miners'  strike in the fall of 1993, as well as to its more or less  successful ending ("he bought them off, he buttered them up!")  The chair of the first deputy prime minister in Kiev, which he  occupied after a brief term as mayor of Donetsk, was rumored to  have strong legs. It was alleged that certain forces faced the  president with a choice: Either Zvyahilskyy gets nearer to  power, or else...    The next stage, his move into the office of Leonid Kuchma  with all his belongings, was described by oral folklore in a  style even more picturesque. It seems that Leonid Makarovich  summoned Yukhym Leonidovich into his room and said: There is an  opinion that you have to work as a Kuchma. But the latter was in  no hurry to thank him for the confidence and he answered  pensively: "I am rich, you see. My family is well-off; my  children, grandchildren, and grandchildren's children will all  have enough. But if the people of Ukraine are pleading..."  Nobody tried to disprove the rumors because Zvyahilskyy did not  grant any interviews or hold any press conferences. Ever. As a  matter of principle. (Not quite, however. Quite recently the  weekly ROSSIYA prepared a whole package of positively tinted  materials in which a conversation with the acting prime minister  took central place.)    A note of distinction. The Ukrainian press media would  normally start to lambaste previous prime ministers somewhere  halfway through their fruitful activity. First, there would be  voluminous interviews "with hopes for the best," and only by the  time of the final curtain would they openly say the same thing  about each of them: "What a bastard--he has ruined it all!"    The years of training proved useful--they started to strip  the acting minister down right away. Democratic publications  started to find heaps of documents showing that Yukhym  Leonidovich had something to do with some dubious crude oil  deals. Using the opposition from the economy reformers' camp as  the mouthpiece, the "moderate" were baring the totally  unscientific essence of all measures taken by the government.  For instance, the closing of the Interbank currency exchange or  their stubborn refusal to free fixed dollar rates. The "petty  Nazi" publications were insulted by the mere fact of an "alien"  appearing at the very height of government power. The upset led  them to poetry where Ukraine was up for a rhymed sale to the  masons of the world by "Zvyahilskyy Fima, Soros, and Birshteyn."    This was why the appearance of Yukhym Zvyahilskyy before the  UNIAN information agency, which invited a horde of people with  dictaphones and TV cameras for the occasion, became a sensation  in itself: "The sphinx" has spoken!    It soon became clear that Yukhym Leonidovich was a rather  mediocre orator. He was also conspicuously uptight in an  environment to which he was unaccustomed and he must have  secretly cursed his counselor-aide with his impenetrable smile  who had undertaken the task of creating his image. What the hell  for, let me ask you?    Zvyahilskyy saddled his nose with a helpful pair glasses  and,  without any emotion, read his introductory statement which  anybody else would have read to the accompaniment of a brass  band. He was reporting on an elementary plan that was drafted  six months before without any creative thought or economic  imagination. To stop hyperinflation, to stop the unchecked flow  of Ukraine-produced industrial goods out of the republic, to  ensure hard currency returns from exports, "to squeeze" due  taxes into the budget, to stop the energy crisis, to prevent a  food crisis... A hard administrative hand was choking the thin  little neck of the market economy. All this meant that nothing  good could come out of this. However...    Inflation (married name "superhyperinflation") stood at 91  percent last December, but for some reason dropped down to 19.2  percent in January, 12.6 percent in February, and 5.7 percent in  March, and showed a further tendency toward decline. These data  were provided by the unemotional Ministry of Statistics, which  would have been just as happy to please the ex-leaders...    The prices of most essential foods have practically not  grown  in the last six months. (The majority of people who have not  gotten any wages since January could not care less, anyway.) But  then they did not freeze (people, not prices) in winter as  predicted, either at home or at work. Energy sources were  somehow obtained. For the same reason, the spring sowing  campaign, traditionally run on emotions, has already been  competed for all practical purposes, according to Zvyahilskyy.  Quietly and without losses. Producers were given direct loans  for fuel, spares, and chemicals, contracts were signed for state  purchases, the price of bread was set at 1,290,000 karbovantsi  per tonne, and so far the villages have managed to survive  without upheavals.    Zvyahilskyy closed the Interbank currency exchange, sort of  outside of the plan but with all his heart. "Nobody will learn  now how much currency was sold there in two years and to which  enterprises--this is my official statement." The exchange was  replaced by the Committee on Tenders, subordinate to the  government. Now it is issuing special-purpose and controlled  sums and yes, it is doing so according to the managerial  principle "I give to whoever I find necessary." It issued 2.9  billion Russian rubles to prepare nuclear power stations for  winter, $500,000 to purchase rubber, 1.5 billion rubles to  purchase coalmining equipment.    The acting prime minister was just as strict with the  dollar,  showing no reaction to the criticism of progressive economists.  The "greenbacks" remained tied down by fixed rates. "They are  forgetting that Ukraine imports 69.8 percent of its energy  sources. If we free the rates, energy prices will skyrocket,  followed by food and rent costs. The people will have no  understanding for their government."    After that came the news of the season. In the nearest  future  the government and the National bank of Ukraine will prohibit  any circulation of foreign currency on its territory. Like  Russia did. This will be the artillery onslaught before the  introduction of hryvnya.    His glasses were already lying on the side, together with  his  notes, his image, and the nasty word "macroeconomics." He  bluntly refused to talk about his opinion of Kuchma, Kravchuk,  or his leanings in the presidential campaign and politics in  general. "I am an industrialist." But at the same time he  described with gusto his recent meeting with the Crimean prime  minister, "Comrade Saburov," which ended constructively for both  of them, and he also mentioned his scheduled trip to Simferopol  to "Comrade Meshkov."    The "political industrialist" seemed to have used the only  way to work he really knew, his 37 years of experience managing  coal mines. Namely, he did not bother his superiors by worrying  about which superstructure, "socialist" or "capitalist," would  grow on his basis: The bosses know better. He assigned reliable  people to the localities, not necessarily in top positions. He  did not criticize the "top brass" (as a blessing, now he has  very few of those) and he ignored all criticism from below and  from aside. He did not ask for anything, including additional  powers, because he knew he himself could get all he needed. It  turned out that Ukraine, as one big mine which was well-worked,  explosive, and stoked up by strike committees, could still  produce coal. It could even rise in its steep downfall. The  practical intellect of Zvyahilskyy caught this moment and used  it. "The board of honors" did not interest him.    The headline of this article is flawed, from a grammatical  point of view. According to the rules, it ought to be replaced.    In theory, it would be nice and prestigious to have a prime  minister with the brains and looks of Lanovyy. With the charm  and political instinct of Kuchma. With the progressive  tendencies and ability to work of Pynzenyk. This would be an  ideal sample! Top quality. Good enough for an exhibition.    But this one is good for work...</p>

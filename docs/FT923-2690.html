			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market Report A rapid afternoon rally in the dollar caused some irregular price movements in BASE METALS on the LME after their generally firmer trend in the morning. The ERM realignment and German interest rate cut reduced upward pressure on European interest rates and raised hopes of economic recovery. But a simultaneous strengthening of the dollar made prices more expensive in local currency terms and buyers, at present, did not appear to be willing to chase. Dealers noted a copper strike threat in Poland and Alcan's potlines reopening, but currency was the main focus of attention. TIN moved sharply ahead as short covering triggered buy stops in a thin market. But unless there is a matching gain in Kuala Lumpur, prices could struggle to maintain these levels today. In Chicago SOYABEANS were trading sharply higher in late afternoon trading on commission house and fund buying as fears of frost supported the market. New York COTTON futures were higher on uncertainty over how much of Pakistan's crop will be lost to widespread flooding. PRECIOUS METALS remained steady in Europe as prices continued to consolidate after Monday's sharp gains. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rockets From Honeycomb"] </F>   [Text] The honeycombed rocket launcher, that was used as  an airborne weapon until now, has recently been modified, and is  successfully being used in land battles on many fronts in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The army of the republic of Srpska can  boast more than two years of war experience, and during that  time the effectiveness of many kinds of weapons has been  actually tested in battles, while many weapons have been  modified and adjusted to meet some practical demands. Although  the military textbooks strictly proscribe the use of certain  weapons, experience has shown that innovations are always  welcome.    A photograph taken by REUTER news agency several days ago at  Serbian positions near Brcko shows four of these honeycombed  rocket launchers (normally used as an airborne weapon) installed  on a truck, and used for shelling targets on the ground. This  mobile rocket launcher of middle-ranging destructive power, the  modified version, contains 48 shells in one charge.    This rocket launcher has the greatest effect if it is used  in  combination with other standard artillery weapons and rocket  systems, in fighting across wide front lines, where the distance  from the enemy is relatively short. Its range is only several  kilometers, but the effect is great because a great number of  rockets disperse over a wide area over a rather short period of  time. The rockets are neither guided, nor self-guided, but this  does not diminish their effect in any case, because of their  wide dispersion. Compared with other similar weapons, the  destructive effect of the honeycombed launcher approximates to  that of the Osa rocket launcher, but the difference is that its  one charge contains 48 times the number of rockets in a charge  of the Osa.    The honeycombed launcher's firing system is electrically  activated, and it is possible to activate several launchers  linked together on the same platform at the same time. The  recharging is done relatively simply and quickly, but in order  to achieve that at least four gunners are necessary.    In the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] the honeycombed  rocket launcher was a part of the equipment of almost all  fighter aircraft: the Jastreb, the Galeb, the Super Galeb, the  Orao, and the MiG-29. It was also installed in MI-8 transport  helicopters. These launchers were also used against ground  targets. In the storehouses of the JNA in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina a great quantity of such launchers were  deposited, and in the course of time they have been modified  quite successfully, and are now being used for fighting on the  ground. At the beginning the launchers were manufactured in the  former Soviet Union, but it was quite a long time ago that the  manufacture was taken over by Yugoslav arms factories.</p>

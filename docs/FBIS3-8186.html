Although, on the one hand, it wants to  open up this structure, it is, on the other, concerned that this  step could complicate its operation.    This statement was made by Ch. F. Nothomb, chairman of the  Belgian Parliament's Chamber of Representatives, in response to  a question from his Czech counterpart, M. Uhde (Civic Democratic  Party), concerning the prospects for the development of the  security structures. Nothomb added that the Western European  Union is an excellent base for "the eventuality that has not yet  arisen. Only after its shortcomings have been eliminated can  the issue of its expansion come onto the agenda." The chairman  of the Chamber of Representatives, in this context, asked M.  Uhde whether the trend toward incorporation into European  structures is the stance of the government majority alone or  whether it is also the view held by the opposition. Uhde  declared that this is the majority opinion, with the exception  of part of the opposition.    On Wednesday [23 February], during his official two-day  visit  to Belgium, the chairman of the Czech Parliament also met other  deputies and senators. The two sides exchanged information on  the functioning of a constitutional system. Deputies from the  Benelux Interparliamentary Council, during their meeting with  the Czech parliamentary delegation, expressed their confusion  about the Czech Republic's attitude toward Visegrad. They  commented on the fact that, while Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia  support cooperation within the Visegrad Group, the stance of the  Czech Republic is somewhat reserved. The Czech Parliament  representatives said in response to this that our country has  nothing against bilateral agreements; nevertheless, it is not  enthusiastic about the formation of broad structures.</p>

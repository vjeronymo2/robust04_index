			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Sport: Lions face extinction - Rugby Union BY THE time you have read this you will be one up on me, you will know the score because the first Test against the All Blacks will be over. I wish I could be more confident about the British and Irish Lions but leaving aside my own prejudice that the whole idea of the Lions concept is an anachronism, the selection of first Gavin Hastings as captain, and then the old lags from England did not give me much confidence. The English have this odd notion that a captain is the first name on the cards, and then he invites his team to join him in representing his country. But in the current regime of manager, team coach and specialist coaches, a captain is more and more obsolete. Hastings' experience of captaincy has demonstrated that under pressure he has a tendency to go into his shell and see the game only in terms of his own performance. Will Carling is the most experienced captain. His record makes him the most successful England captain this century but while he is a brilliant player, he could not captain his way out of a tactical paper bag. He does not seem mentally or physically fit. He played only 14 club games this season and on the Lions tour he has struggled to complete a game. Furthermore, his abject performance as both captain and player against France, Wales and Ireland suggest that his star is on the wane. Had the Lions selectors chosen the side first and then the captain, it would have been a close thing between the maverick Stuart Barnes and the irrepressible Dean Richards. I sense that Carling does not want to be in New Zealand. He is a loner. He is also Geoff Cooke's boy. Cooke was allegedly the only one to vote for Carling as tour captain. Cooke's future as manager of the England team, though written in stone until the World Cup in South Africa, still depends largely on how his protege performs in the next Five Nations Championships. England have, in Jeremy Guscott, the finest centre in the world. He can kick equally well off both feet (and, even nonchalantly drops goals with whichever foot he fancies at the time); who has pace with overdrive and who is secure in defence but who yet may never realise his true ability. The fault lies with Carling and, until Barnes replaced him this season, Rob Andrew. They are instinctively defensive players and prefer to play a tight restricting game. This Lions tour may be the last of its kind, truncated as it is to 13 games as compared to the Lions in New Zealand of 1950 (23 games), 1966 (25), 1971 (24), 1977 (25) and 198, (18). The threat comes from the world cups of 1995, 1999 and 2003 and, the possibility that a grand prix circuit might be arranged, if not by the rugby unions of the senior international countries, then by the senior players. Money has been a constant talking point among the players. The New Zealand RFU has announced the All Black Club plan which will, whatever way you look at, provide the players with a salary of more than Pounds 30,000 a year to stop them playing for profit overseas. In New Zealand, that bedrock of rugby union, all is not well. John Kirwan chose to play in Italy, returning to New Zealand too late to be considered for the first test. Kirwan, unlike David Campese of Australia, who at least has Italian parentage, was not there just to visit friends. He had a contract to play rugby. Rugby union in New Zealand is under threat from rugby league and soccer. Hence the announcement this week of the players' funds. Shamateurism is breaking out all over. Of course, the International Rugby Football Board could complain but it is toothless and happy to turn a blind eye so that its power base is not further undermined. Money was one of the problems on the first Lions tour in 1888 run by Andrew Stoddart and Bob Seddon. Stoddart played cricket for England in Australia and along with Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury thought a rugby tour there would be welcomed. After Seddon's death sculling on the Hunter River in New South Wales, Stoddart went on to captain the Lions, and later, England and the formative Barbarians. He was the first and last player to captain his country in cricket and rugby. He approached the Rugby Football Union for permission for such a tour. The RFU gave its blessings provided the amateur regulations were enforced. One of the 22 players chosen, A J Stuart of Dewsbury was banned from joining the leaving party because he had made a deal with an outfitters to kit himself out. Another player was apparently sent home when he was caught discussing his chances of becoming a professional as an Australian Rules player. This seemed harsh. To raise tour funds and to the chagrin of the RFU, the Lions played 19 exhibition matches of Australian Rules in Victoria, winning nine. It cannot have been coincidental that the next Lions tour, to South Africa in 1891, was completely underwritten by Cecil Rhodes, prime minister of the Cape.</p>

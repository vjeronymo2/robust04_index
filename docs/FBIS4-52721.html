			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["They Are Digging Their Own Grave" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ruling  quarters are trying to install a legal and institutional  mechanism for overseas aggression which the preceding successive  cabinets dared not do and to gratify at any cost their desire to  invade Korea again in reliance on it.    Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a press  conference on May 10 that Japan was examining "emergency  legislative arrangements" for a counteraction of the  "self-defence forces [SDF]" to a possible "emergency situation"  on the Korean peninsula.    The "emergency legislative arrangements" examined by the  present cabinet are aimed at laying a legal foundation for  sending "SDF" forces to the Korean peninsula any moment and  paving the way for a legal comeback to Korea. In talking about  a possible "emergency situation" on the Korean peninsula, they  want a propaganda effect to build up public opinion favoring  "emergency legislative arrangements" by fostering the  consciousness of crisis among the people.    Truth to tell, the Japanese reactionaries are watching for a  chance to invade Korea, having made legal, ideological and  military preparations.    In crying over the "nuclear threat" of the DPRK and  connecting it with the "security" of Japan, they are trying to  invent a pretext for reinvasion.    If Japan dare embark upon reinvasion, it will be digging its  own grave.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI sells part of defence side to French Thorn EMI, the rental and music group, said yesterday it had agreed in principle to sell part of its defence activities to Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group. The deal, while not unexpected, amounts to a significant step in the consolidation of the European defence industry, where pressure to merge has been growing because of falling defence procurement budgets. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Turnover of the activities sold, which include missile-fusing systems and electro-optics, was about Pounds 80m last year. Some 1,100 people work in the division affected, which is based at Hayes in Middlesex. Thomson-CSF is already a strong player in electro-optics, while the Thorn unit it is now acquiring expects to do lucrative work providing thermal imaging and infra-red systems for the European Fighter Aircraft. The deal leaves out Thorn's defence electronics activity in three other centres - Crawley, Wells and Rugeley - whose combined sales were about Pounds 110m last year. However a company spokesman said it was still hoped to dispose of those businesses. 'As it is our strategy to concentrate on the music and rental sectors, we will continuing to looking new homes for the remaining defence electronics businesses,' he said. The Crawley unit provides electronic support systems such as radar and jamming devices for ships and aircraft, and analysts said the British government would look carefully at any deal which let this business fall into foreign hands. MoD officials have said they have no objection to foreign interests taking equity stakes and earning dividends from British defence companies.</p>

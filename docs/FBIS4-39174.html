			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Larisa Klyuchnikova -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 6 June -- Commonwealth Executive Secretary  Ivan Korotchenya received CSCE Secretary General Wilhelm  Hoeynck, who arrived in Minsk at Korotchenya 's invitation on  Sunday [5 June], at the CIS headquarters today. A productive  conversation about common CIS and CSCE problems took place. The  "hot" spots in particular were discussed.    Wilhelm Hoeynck noted that in his view the current concept  of  peacemaking should be amended slightly. For example, he thinks  that the concept should reflect the need for the parties in a  conflict to agree to the introduction of UN forces and to the  conditions for cooperation between observers and the  peacekeeping forces; and the procedure for withdrawing troops  from the conflict zone should be set out.    I. Korotchenya and W. Hoeynck were in mutual understanding  on  the issue of strengthing links between the CSCE and CIS working  bodies and joining efforts in peacemaking activities. The CSCE  secretary general was also interested in the CIS situation,  prospects, and integrationary policies. Detailed answers were  given to these questions.</p>

These exempt compounds have been determined to have negligible photochemical reactivity. For purposes of determining compliance with this section, VOC will be measured by test methods given in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Specific provisions.

The VOC content will be determined according to the methodology provided in paragraph (f) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If EPA determines that a report does not affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the methodology in paragraph (f) of this section, EPA may assign the pesticide a VOC content value equal to the highest VOC content reported for any pesticide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Establish VOC limit.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon compilation of the data received pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, EPA will determine a pesticide VOC limit based on the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) EPA will establish a base-year inventory for each registered pesticide. This inventory will be based on the amount of each pesticide used in the affected area. These amounts will be based on data from the 1990 pesticide use report (PUR) and the inerts database, which are both maintained by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), unless EPA determines that another year or years of PUR data or other information provides a more appropriate basis for the inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) EPA will rank all registered pesticides according to their VOC content as determined by the data submitted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The pesticide with the largest VOC content will be ranked ``1''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET THE CONTRAS FIND A HAVEN REBUILDING PEACE IN NICARAGUA, NOT LIVING IN THE  U.S.  </P> <P> In the wake of the Central American presidents' plan for demobilizing the  Nicaraguan resistance, three Contra commanders were granted political asylum in  the United States and four more requested it. The speed with which the  applications were filed and approved points to the possibility of a serious and  misguided policy change -- that those Contras who do not trust the Sandinista  regime will be given haven here as refugees.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has never suggested a refugee program for the Contra  forces, but the pressures that could lead there are beginning to build.  </P> <P> Much of the Contra organization feels betrayed by the Honduras accords, which  call for demobilization and repatriation of their military force by December.  The Contras feel doubly stung by the agreement of the opposition inside  Nicaragua to settle the cause at next February's elections. U.S. conservatives  are fuming about perfidy in the State Department and the inevitability of  rigged elections. Miami's sizable Nicaraguan community, in part the product of  Ronald Reagan's generous asylum policy, is a natural magnet.  </P> <P> The refugee option has always hovered about the edges of the Nicaraguan debate,  the presumed fallback if the day of reckoning ever came. It flows from the  causes of Cuba and Vietnam, where we similarly empowered surrogate armies. When  they were defeated, we mounted aggressive refugee resettlement programs for  them and their families. A substantial portion of the Cuban and South  Vietnamese populations at the time are now in this country, a refugee flow that  has had serious policy implications.  </P> <P> The fact that Cuba and Vietnam have been among the slowest nations in the  communist world to change is not unrelated to this exodus. Unwittingly, and  with the best intentions, our refugee policy has provided a means for these  nations to export the critical mass of people most likely to challenge the  system from within and spark political and economic reform.  </P> <P> This is exactly what we don't want in Nicaragua. If it has not been clear  before, the Central American presidents' agreement, along with the one between  the Sandinistas and domestic opposition parties, sends an unequivocal message:  The Sandinistas will not be eliminated outright. The battlefield is now  politics.  </P> <P> Our policy must be to promote political pluralism and the right to free speech,  press and elections. Because the resistance encompasses the very people most  likely to fight for these conditions, repatriation of the Contras is crucial.  Offering the option of coming here would remove a potential source of internal  pressure, making it easier for the Sandinistas to maintain their closed system.  </P> <P> The reference point should not be Cuba and Vietnam. It should be Poland.  </P> <P> When Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed martial law eight years ago, a surge of  refugees seemed inevitable. Although many Poles wished to leave and expected  that the United States would welcome them, we did not establish a special  program. In fact, we rejected many applicants, despite sustained pressure from  the Polish-American and other political constituencies to open our arms.  </P> <P> In the intervening years, the Solidarity movement grew, until its strength  finally cracked 40 years of Communist domination. Is it conceivable that this  would have happened if we had offered an alternative future in this country to  large numbers of Poles who opposed Communist rule? No, because these stunning  changes could not have occurred without a sizable, committed internal  opposition pushing for change.  </P> <P> This is not to say that we should press all those who oppose dictatorships to  remain in their countries and fight for change. The Castro regime imprisoned  and tortured its enemies; the North Vietnamese sentenced theirs to brutal  re-education camps and, often, to death. Our first duty should always be to  protect life and safety, particularly for those who fought loyally for our  ideas, regardless of the longer-term geopolitical implications.  </P> <P> But where there is some middle ground, some assurance that basic human rights  will be observed, our policy should be to resist and discourage the refugee  option.  </P> <P> Nicaragua offers such a middle ground. The agreement it signed provides that  demobilization and repatriation be carried out under the auspices of an  international verification commission formed by the United Nations and the  Organization of American States. The commission's duties include "monitoring  the full exercise of the fundamental rights and freedoms of those repatriated.  . . . " Its mandate extends to establishing offices and follow-up visits, so  people can report noncompliance.  </P> <P> This mechanism is unique and rather extraordinary. It provides a sound basis  for the United States and most of the Contra troops and their families -- an  estimated 50,000 people -- to have confidence that they can safely return to  Nicaragua if the agreement's protections are upheld. The refugee-status  fallback would be required, then, only in cases where unusual circumstances  pertain.  </P> <P> But the Contras and their leaders will need to be convinced. In this and other  respects, we retain considerable influence if we throw our weight behind the  presidents' agreement and become a partner in making it work. Crucial to that  is the Contras' return to their homeland and contributing to its future,  politically and economically.  </P> <P> If there's any doubt as to the wisdom of rejecting the refugee option, remember  Poland.  </P></p>

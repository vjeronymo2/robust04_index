			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Gothic preserved - The case for sympathetic building and restoration It often seems to me that architecture is sometimes taken much too seriously. Sides are taken and battle lines are drawn in a fashion that often looks ridiculous to anyone outside the profession. Do you really care whether or not a design is modern, post-modern, gothic or classical? What matters is whether or not the design is good. One of the subjects that currently arouses ire and passion in equal doses in the breasts of architects is the future of the damaged wing of Windsor Castle. That esteemed organ, Country Life, which now seems to be all set under its new editorial team to become the journal of imagination when it comes to architectural and environmental issues, has just launched an important international competition for designs for the rebuilding of the fire-damaged areas of Windsor Castle. The reason for mentioning this in this column is principally because it is open to anyone - artists, interior designers, 'and anyone else who feels qualified to comment'. This sounds a brilliant idea because there are many of us who have maintained for a long time that architects do not necessarily have the monopoly of architectural ideas. The other reason why the Windsor competition could be very important (although impossible to judge) is that it may concentrate minds on the debate about the appropriate way to treat historic buildings. The only problem with this competition is the nature of the jury. For some reason, presumably to excite international interest, Country Life seems to have lost its traditional nerve and gone for trendy names on its jury - as well as some deadbeat modernists who are known to be deeply prejudiced against history itself. But far be it from a mere architecture critic to put anyone off entering a competition because of the composition of the jury. After all, this competition does deal with a fascinating and important architectural problem. The key thing to remember is that it is open to anyone. The competition brief is available from Country Life Windsor Castle Competition, Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 2EH. Telephone: 0344 890080. There is an entry fee of Pounds 10 and a very modest prize of Pounds 1000. The closing date is June 10. The Architecture Foundation is another ginger group that is keen to get on the Windsor Castle bandwagon. It has commissioned several practising architects, mainly but not entirely of a modernist persuasion, to come up with a new design for the interior of the damaged St. George's Hall. These will be exhibited shortly at the Architecture Foundation and published in a forthcoming book about Windsor Castle by Dr Mark Girouard. When it comes to architectural tradition there always has been a comparatively unsung group of architects and craftsmen in England quietly working away building and designing things that are usually ignored by the architectural press. What these unsung heroes generally achieve is very happy clients and plenty of work. They are free of the vagaries of fashion and mercifully outside the intense and often meaningless international debate. One of these architects is Roderick Gradidge, who has recently completed an ingenious scheme for St. Edmund's College, Cambridge. The college is situated on Mount Pleasant - the part of Cambridge that marks the commencement of the line of new colleges that proceed to the west of the city. It was founded as St. Edmund's House by the 15th Duke of Norfolk in 1896 as a residence for Roman Catholic clergy studying for degrees. Since 1965 the college has been an approved graduate college and now has some 150 students from 30 countries. The early gabled red brick, turn of the century buildings are without any particular distinction and to unify and extend them was a not inconsiderable challenge for the architect. For a long time Gradidge has taken a pioneering interest in the history of Edwardian architecture - his work at the National Portrait Gallery in London and his more recent restoration of the Guildhall at Northampton shows a knowledgeable enthusiasm for Edwardian and Gothic interiors. At Cambridge Gradidge had little opportunity to provide decorative interiors. Instead he has designed a striking brick tower some six storeys high to mark the entrance to the college. At the top of this tower is the Okinaga Room, named after the benefactor (Dr S. Okinaga the President of Teikyo University, Japan). This is the highest room in Cambridge and has remarkable views over the whole city. The style of the tower has been described by the architect as 'streamlined Tudor'. It is built of buff brick with a slate roof and has some well carved heraldry in the brickwork (by Richard Kindersley). The tower has succeeded in centering the plan of the college, giving it a prominent entrance and literally raising its profile in Cambridge. Gradidge worked throughout the scheme with the Charter Partnership. Shades of Tudor and Gothic revivals are clearly in the air with attention focused on the fate of the unrepaired Albert Memorial in London's Kensington Gardens, which is now a neglected victim of government parsimony. There is an argument for putting Albert into a glass case but a public appeal for funds looks more likely. That will be a real test of the national enthusiasm for the Gothic - and the recent news that passengers from the Channel Tunnel trains are now going to arrive at St. Pancras gives Railway Gothic a sudden international dimension. I would like to see architect Michael Hopkins put in charge of the replanning of the station, as he has the rare skill of understanding and adding to the past without any hint of nostalgia or pastiche. He would also provide ample evidence to our visitors from Europe that although we love the Gothic we are not totally smothered by Gothic gloom. Next year's exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum devoted to the life and work of Pugin will show once and for all how Gothic architecture and design can marry structural ingenuity with colour and decoration in a way that many contemporary architects still find difficult to contemplate, let alone achieve.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. LAWMAKERS SEE BIG CHALLENGE IN REBUILDING;  </P> <P> FOREIGN AID: PART OF THE ASSISTANCE BUDGET MAY NEED TO BE REALLOCATED TO GIVE  PANAMA HIGHER PRIORITY.  </P> <P> Members of Congress on Thursday hailed the apprehension of Manuel A. Noriega as  a key victory in the war against drugs, but they cautioned that the United  States now faces an even tougher challenge in rebuilding Panama's shattered  government and crippled economy.  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that part of next year's foreign  aid budget -- already stretched thin by commitments to Egypt, Israel and  Eastern Europe -- may need to be reallocated to give Panama a higher priority.  </P> <P> Asked if he was suggesting a reduction in assistance to Israel and Egypt, the  two largest single recipients of U.S. aid, Dole replied, "I am suggesting that  we only have so much."  </P> <P> Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who returned  Wednesday from a 36-hour visit to Panama, said the country will require  "hundreds of millions of dollars" in assistance over the long run -- a  commitment that he suggested the United States could not meet alone.  </P> <P> "No one should think that the key to (Panama's) economic recovery will be U.S.  aid, although that will be part of it," Nunn said.  </P> <P> Asked if he had discussed Panama's aid expectations with the new government of  President Guillermo Endara, Nunn replied:  </P> <P> "We did not get any dollar amount from the Endara government, but they made it  plain they are expecting American aid. They made it plain they have big  economic problems. But they also made it plain they are going to ask other  nations, not just us."  </P> <P> At the request of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), a bipartisan  delegation of key House committee members led by Majority Leader Richard A.  Gephardt (D-Mo.) left for Panama on Thursday to discuss future economic and  political needs with U.S. and Panamanian officials.  </P> <P> "These meetings will help us answer key questions . . . including the length of  the U.S. military occupation, the means available to us to support the  democratization of Panama (and) the requirements for U.S. private and public  sector assistance to rebuild the Panamanian economy," Gephardt told reporters  before the delegation's departure from Andrews Air Force Base outside  Washington.  </P> <P> Dole, noting that Bush's military intervention to oust Noriega enjoyed "broad  bipartisan support," said that the White House "had not put a dollar figure on  aid to Panama yet."  </P> <P> But he added that both the Bush Administration and Congress, which recovenes  Jan. 23, will need to "take a look at reallocating some of our priorities in  foreign assistance . . . to address economic problems in Panama as well as in  Poland."  </P> <P> The minority leader suggested that one way around the politically thorny  question of what to cut would be to give the Administration "more flexibility"  in allocating foreign aid by earmarking less of it in Congress.  </P> <P> Some lawmakers indicated that the responsibility the United States assumed for  Panama when it invaded last month may now be greater and more complex than many  at first had assumed.  </P> <P> Noting that Noriega and his military aides controlled virtually every important  aspect of Panamanian life, Nunn said, "It is hard for people in this country to  understand the pervasiveness of Noriega and the Panama Defense Forces."  </P> <P> Panama, Nunn said, is entering "a nation-building phase" in which Washington  will need to help Endara create a democratic government, reform a mismanaged  economy and clean up the widespread corruption of the Noriega regime.  </P> <P> Despite these reservations, senators and congress members were unanimous in  offering bipartisan praise for the Administration's handling of the Panama  crisis.  </P> <P> "I commend President Bush and all U.S. officials who played a role in making  certain that Noriega was brought to the U.S.," said Senate Majority Leader  George J. Mitchell (D-Me.).  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called Noriega's apprehension a "triumph for  justice," while Rep. Jim Courter (R-N.J.) said that it sends a message "to the  narco-terrorists and drug kingpins of the Third World . . . (that) the United  States will not allow criminals who poison our children sanctuary anywhere in  the world."  </P> <P> Mitchell and other Democrats added that it now is important to lower U.S.  military visibility in Panama and remove the rest of its combat troops as  quickly as possible.  </P> <P> Nunn said that disengagement is crucial to the Endara government's efforts to  establish its own credibility and legitimacy. He called for a two-phase  replacement of U.S. combat forces over the next few weeks -- first by military  personnel trained in civilian management and later by State Department and  civilian experts.  </P> <P> The risk of maintaining a high U.S. profile in Panama, Nunn said, is that as  time goes on, Panamanians who now blame their economic problems on Noriega "are  going to start blaming them on the United States" if there is no visible  progress in solving them.  </P></p>

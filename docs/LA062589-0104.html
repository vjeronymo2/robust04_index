			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THREAT TO EXISTENCE OF SHARE OUR SELVES  </P> <P> The Irvine Task Force for the Homeless, along with many other concerned  citizens in this area, is appalled at the threat to the existence of the most  outstanding care-giving organizations in Orange County. Share Our Selves (SOS)  has been widely acclaimed throughout the state and is the oldest established  charity in the county. We hope that you will support our plea to the mayor of  Costa Mesa and to members of his council to withstand the pressure to cancel  the lease of SOS.  </P> <P> SYLVIA EASTON, Chairman  </P> <P> Irvine Task Force for the Homeless  </P></p>

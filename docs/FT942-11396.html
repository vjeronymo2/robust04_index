			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (26): Germany: wary of global work Ironically, given Germany's world economic status, its consultants remain wary about bidding for contracts backed by international development agencies, such as the World Bank. They argue such institutions use unfamiliar working practices, many of them Anglo-American. Some German consultants concede that their Dutch and Danish counterparts play a more important role internationally, while others admit that having to submit bids in English - often the working language of European Union institutions and international agencies - makes them reluctant to seek international work. Some even say they steer clear of funding organisations such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), because of what one consultant describes as a culture 'heavily dominated by Anglo-Americans'. Another agency which often tends not to find favour with German consultancies is the Asian Development (ADB). The latter's curricula vitae requirements, for example, tend to be longer and more complex than many German consultants usually provide. The ADB will generally require a document running to about 15 pages for its tenders, a procedure which baffles German consultants who usually present their case in two or three pages. Such apparently mundane German complaints often cloak more important factors, including a possible lack of political support when it comes to competing against, for example, French companies working closely with government agencies and embassies. Overall, they add up to a picture of German consultants apprehensive about treading the international consultants' catwalk. However, another reason for German consultants' low profile with the development agencies is that many receive substantial amounts of work through the Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit. This is a government-owned body which hands out consultancy work generated by bilateral deals signed between Germany and other countries, according to Peter von Oy, a spokesman for the Association of Independent Consulting Engineering Companies (VUBI). Also, many companies have shifted their focus to eastern Germany, where the fall of communism has generated large amounts of lucrative German or private contracts. However, international business represents a mere 2 per cent of turnover for eastern German companies, most of whom comprise the left-overs of planning divisions of former state-owned 'combines', whose international experience, if any, was mainly limited to work in other Comecon countries. One area where German consultants feel they do have significant a presence is in eastern Europe and the CIS, where funding is provided by the EU's Phare and Tacis technical assistance programmes respectively. While much of the consultancy work in Poland, the Czech Republic and the more developed areas of eastern Europe is already privately financed, German companies have also won bids for Tacis projects, including a recent energy conservation study in the Urals. But overall the international presence remains relatively limited. Mr von Oy says that VUBI is trying to raise the profile of German firms by organising, among other things, a workshop with the World Bank and the EBRD in June, to examine prospects for improving co-operation with German consultants.</p>

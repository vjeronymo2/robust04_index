			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Optimism fades on HK-listed China groups When companies turn in profit rises of between 33 per cent and 278 per cent, it seems churlish to find fault. But the surge in net earnings at the interim stage reported by the 10 China enterprises listed in Hong Kong has dampened the optimism that had led to a rally in the share prices before the announcements. Excluding Qingling Motors, the light-truck assembler which floated last month and has not reported, only two of China's H shares performed markedly better than market expectations - Yizheng Chemical and Shanghai Petrochemical, whose net profits respectively rose 278 per cent to Yn460.6m (Dollars 53.84m) and 35 per cent to Yn772.8m in the first six months of the year. The two chemicals companies produce commodities which are in short supply (and therefore strong demand) and have big client bases, unlike the machinery companies. They revealed strong balance sheets and an easing of triangular debt, which has been choking profits at the state enterprises since the resurgence of the mainland's austerity drive last year. As credit lines tightened, so companies found their customers' ability to pay for goods deteriorated. This in turn hurt the first company, which found itself unable to pay off its creditors - hence, triangular debt. Yizheng, China's biggest producer of polyesters, saw its performance enhanced by the global shortage of cotton after poor harvests. According to the company, it had orders for 567,000 tonnes of polyester in the first half - approaching double its production capacity, which stands at 304,480 tonnes. But there is a big question mark over the sustainability of both companies' performances, which have been helped by state subsidies which guarantee both the supply and price of important raw materials. The companies benefit from rising costs on the sales side, while being protected on the supply side. Mr Lawrence Ang, associate director with SBCI Finance Asia, says it is becoming increasingly likely that the state will review its subsidy policy, especially in the case of state-owned companies which are now in effect in the hands of foreigners and therefore cannot justify financial protection. Removal of the subsidies would slash profit margins. 'When these subsidies will be removed is the big uncertainty. Yizheng never says when it might be lifted, but when Shanghai Petrochemical listed last year the directors said the state would guarantee the supply of crude oil, but only in terms of volume, not price,' Mr Ang says. Economic data emerging from China since July suggest the country is in no position to relax the credit tightening measures. Inflation continues to rise, standing at 23 per cent (34 per cent in the cities), while fixed-asset investment surged 73 per cent over the year to July. An unofficial meeting of China's leaders last month agreed to continue the austerity programme throughout the second half. While the programme has hit the performance of most of the companies, only Tsingtao Brewery - the pioneering H share - was hit by the unification of China's exchange rates last January. A winning card in the company's listing prospectus was its strong foreign exchange earnings. However, this has swung in the opposite direction as foreign exchange receipts dried up in the wake of the unification, while imported raw materials still have to be paid for in hard currency. Tsingtao previously received payment for some 30 per cent of sales in foreign exchange, due mainly to domestic sales at foreigners' outlets such as hotels. The company was able to stipulate payment in US dollars or Foreign Exchange Certificates, the now-defunct currency designated for foreigners. As it is no longer allowed to do this, it has moved to having a net foreign exchange expenditure of around Dollars 3m. The brewery group is now looking to expand its export markets in a bid to soften the blow, but in the meantime its new vulnerability to foreign exchange fluctuations - unseen so far, but a devaluation is forecast for late this year or during 1995 - stands to hamper earnings. Machinery and steel companies dominated the most disappointing results, with Maanshan Iron and Steel - the biggest H share company by market capitalisation - leading the pack. Maanshan suffered from the decline in steel prices in China - a reaction to Russian dumping - and earnings slid 30 per cent to Yn590.6m from the revised 1993 interim figure of Yn835.4m. Mr Brian Leung, an analyst with W. I. Carr (Far East), reckons that while steel prices are likely to remain weak in the second half, rising production capacity and growing or flat demand for products should help profits. However, the triangular debt problem will remain a big issue - the company is now estimated to have accounts receivable of Yn2bn, compared with Yn1.2bn six months ago. The debt problem will also continue to rear its head at Beiren Printing Machinery, where profits jumped 33 per cent to Yn55.5m from Yn41m, and Kunming Machinery, up 155 per cent to Yn15.89m from Yn6.2m. In a bid to stave off debts Kunming cut sales, and saw turnover slump 55 per cent to Yn18.67m from Yn42.19m. Mr Leung estimates that just one-third of the group's profits were generated by core businesses, the rest coming from a Yn5.7m tax write-back and interest income from the proceeds of its dual share offering in China and Hong Kong. Kunming spent a mere one-quarter of the Yn390m raised and creamed interest off the remainder, investing just a fraction of the figure quoted in its listing prospectus on new machinery and tools. The outlook for all the H-share companies in the second half is not promising, although some analysts are recommending the chemical companies and, for relative value, Dongfang Electric, whose conservative accounting policy means that 70 per cent of whole-year profits are booked in the second half.  ---------------------------------------------------------- China's Hong Kong listed companies (Yn m)  ----------------------------------------------------------                                1994    1994 year      1995                               interim   forecast  forecast  ---------------------------------------------------------- Beiren Printing                  56        121       170 Dongfang Electric                26         95       111 Guangzhou Shipyard              142        168       121 Kunming Machine Tool             16         38        56 Luoyang Glass                   127        242       260 Maanshan Iron &amp; Steel           591      1,427     1,841 Shanghai Petrochemical          773      1,336     1,491 Tianjin Bohai                    72        142       163 Tsingtao Brewery                102        283       405 Yizheng Chemical                461        932     1,036  ---------------------------------------------------------- Source: WI Carr (Far East)  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

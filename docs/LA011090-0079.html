			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS SIGN JOHNNIE JOHNSON  </P> <P> The Rams reached into their golden oldies pile Tuesday and plucked out a hit  from the 1980s, safety Johnnie Johnson, who agreed to terms on a two-game  contract.  </P> <P> What? Why? How?  </P> <P> Johnson, 33, was left unprotected by the Rams after the 1988 season and signed  as a Plan B free agent with the Seattle Seahawks, who released him after two  games this season.  </P> <P> A starter at safety for most of the last decade, and one of the more popular  Rams of his era, Johnson was a logical short-term solution to what has become a  desperate situation in the secondary, where the Rams are losing the battle of  attrition.  </P> <P> The team already is without safety Anthony Newman, who has an elbow injury, and  cornerback Clifford Hicks, who has a knee problem.  </P> <P> Two more defenders, starting free safety Vincent Newsome and reserve cornerback  Darryl Henley, were knocked from Sunday's playoff win over the New York Giants.  </P> <P> The Rams are listing Newsome, who sprained an ankle, as questionable for this  week's NFC title game against San Francisco, although Henley, with a shoulder  sprain, now appears probable.  </P> <P> Need a safety? Whom do you call? The Rams dialed Johnson, retired and selling  real estate in Westminster for his company, ERA All-Pro.  </P> <P> "At least he's well rested," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "Our biggest problem  is that he sells real estate, and he has an open house Sunday."  </P> <P> Johnson said he was planning to show a house that day, but there's a Super Bowl  at stake. Johnson was a first-round pick in 1980, the spring after the Rams'  one and only Super Bowl appearance.  </P> <P> As careers go, Johnson said he still had some loose ends to tie up.  </P> <P> "The year before I got here, the Rams got to the Super Bowl," he said. "If  they'd have gone the year after I left, I don't know if that would have settled  with me."  </P> <P> Johnson's role against the 49ers will be strictly as a reserve. Robinson said  he probably wouldn't allow Johnson to practice this week, for fear of  stretching dormant muscles.  </P> <P> Johnson has always been slight of build, and doesn't appear an ounce over his  playing weight of 183 pounds. Of course, putting on a helmet and chasing Jerry  Rice after selling houses for four-months is another story.  </P> <P> Johnson sells real estate; Rice devours it.  </P> <P> "I can't play a large number of plays," he said. "But you can play one game on  adrenaline alone."  </P> <P> Tuesday's news wasn't a complete surprise. The Rams and Johnson had maintained  contact since his release by the Seahawks on Sept. 19. Johnson started the  first two games for Seattle this season, but admitted his aging knees couldn't  take the pounding on the Kingdome's artificial surface.  </P> <P> The Rams were interested in signing Johnson before the New England game Dec.  24, he said, but the teams couldn't work out the compensation details involving  Johnson's Seattle contract.  </P> <P> Johnson said those problems have been resolved, and he is ready to become a Ram  again.  </P> <P> "It's an opportunity to play for the ring," he said. "In 10 years, I never got  that opportunity. I came close in '85, and here it is again."  </P> <P> Johnson said that he nearly signed with the 49ers, after their strong safety,  Jeff Fuller, was seriously injured Oct. 22 against New England. The 49ers  elected instead to activate cornerback Tim McKyer, who was serving a three-game  suspension for disciplinary reasons.  </P> <P> Johnson's heart, obviously, remains with the Rams. He said his real estate  business has boomed with the success of the Rams this season.  </P> <P> "I get calls every day," Johnson said. "Some people still think I'm playing for  the Rams."  </P> <P> Johnson did that for nine seasons, finishing up his first tour of duty with 21  interceptions. He led the Rams with four interceptions in 1988, but his age was  a liability, so the Rams left him unprotected last Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Johnson wasn't bitter about the Rams' decision at the time, and seemed excited  about the opportunity to make some late-career money in the open market. He  signed with Seattle in March.  </P> <P> Johnson was expected to sign his contract late Tuesday night or Wednesday  morning. The Rams issued him a playbook for this week's game.  </P> <P> The remaining decisions are minor, such as what uniform number Johnson will  wear. His old issue, No. 20, was given to rookie Darryl Henley.  </P> <P> "That's something Darryl and I can work out tomorrow," Johnson said.  </P> <P> John the prophet: Robinson's postgame speech to his team after their 30-27 loss  to the 49ers on Dec. 11 should be made available on cassette.  </P> <P> Robinson predicted after a heart-breaking loss at Anaheim Stadium that his team  would win four consecutive games and meet San Francisco for the NFC  championship. Apparently, it stirred young minds and souls.  </P> <P> "It was very valuable," quarterback Jim Everett said. "We've got a lot of young  guys on this team that look to his leadership, his guiding word. And it came  true."  </P> <P> Robinson said it was more than a case of pulling a speech from an old coaching  catalogue.  </P> <P> "Why couldn't we win four in a row?" he said. "It's for the non-participants to  doubt. The person that proposes to do something can't afford to doubt, or be  cynical. What the hell? You've got to be willing to say, 'We're going to do  it.' Otherwise, you give yourself no chance."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The Rams are 3-8 in championship games, dating back to a 1945 loss when the  franchise still played in Cleveland. The Rams lost NFC title games in 1974,  '75, '76, '78 and '85. They won their only NFC championship in 1979, when they  defeated Tampa Bay, 9-0. . . . The Rams are 7-3 in road games this season. Joe  Montana is 8-0 as a starter at Anaheim Stadium. So who's complaining about road  trips? "It doesn't make a difference," Ram quarterback Jim Everett said.  "Candlestick is fine. If you look at the statistics, let's play it there."  </P> <P> So you think Everett's all milquetoast and noncontroversial? Tuesday, he  contemplated life as a Houston Oiler, the team that drafted him in the first  round in 1986. "I thank God that I didn't have a chance to be coached by Jerry  Glanville," he said. "They've got great talent in Houston. I never believed  they had great coaching." The Rams acquired Everett from Houston in September  of 1986. . . . The Rams have released Paul Butcher, acquired last week for  special teams duty against New York. John Robinson said Butcher could be  re-signed later this week.  </P> <P> LeRoy Irvin rises again Dept: Robinson said the 10-year veteran cornerback  played his best game of the season against the Giants. . . . Fatigue factor,  Round 4. Robinson said he felt fine Tuesday. As goes Robinson, so go the Rams.  "I am the consultant," he said. "We've just said we're not going to be tired.  It's inconvenient for us to be tired." What about Monday? "I was beat,"  Robinson said. "I didn't sleep well Sunday night. I saw a lot of (Jerry) Rice  in my sleep."  </P></p>

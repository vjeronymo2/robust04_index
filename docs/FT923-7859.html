			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Green writing is on the wall For the environmentally conscious, Novamont of Italy has developed a biodegradable 'green' ball-point pen. Made from a new 'natural' thermo-plastic which is produced entirely from corn starch, the pen when discarded will completely disintegrate after 12 months. Available in the UK from Raimart Pens, the Green Pen is appropriately coloured in yellow and green. It looks much like any plastic pen but has a slightly softer, warm feel in the hand. The pen uses standard ink-refills, which are not biodegradable, but prolong the life of the product. In addition to inscribed versions of the pen for promotional uses, Raimart is offering a retail version by mail order, Pounds 4.99 for a pack of four including post and packing. Raimart Pens: UK, 071 263 6401.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Review of national grid payments ordered PROFESSOR STEPHEN Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday ordered a review of the way the national grid pays for electricity from some power stations. His announcement came in a report stating that customers are not adequately protected by the present system. The report about constrained-on plant - extra generating plant required only infrequently to boost supplies with electricity charged at premium rates - identifies possible cost-cutting measures. They include greater investment in the network to reduce shortages in supplies, the introduction of voluntary demand-reduction schemes by industry, and a possible change in the pattern of ownership of generating plant. Prof Littlechild also accepts the recommendation of the Commons energy committee that he should consider by 1995 at the latest whether the leading generators should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'Their prices and profits will be relevant in making this decision and in the timing of it,' he writes in the report. The share price of PowerGen fell 6p to 280p and National Power was down 4p at 269p. The regulator is unhappy about the way some generating stations, the constrained-on plants, are allowed to charge high rates in return for stabilising supplies. They operate outside the normal power bidding system and can be much more profitable when required. The report, which follows an Offer report last December on electricity pool prices, says payments for constrained-on plants in 1991-92 amounted to more than Pounds 200m, an increase of more than 70 per cent on the previous year. The report focuses on 14 National Power and PowerGen stations that each received payments of Pounds 10m or more. Five - Fawley and Didcot for National Power, Ferrybridge B, Hams Hall and Castle Donington for PowerGen - received more than Pounds 30m each. Most of the stations were older and less fuel-efficient coal-fired plants, although the report finds that some large, modern oil-fired plants had also bid high prices when transmission constraints were active and there was a sharp demand for electricity. Prof Littlechild says of the present system: 'It does not provide adequate protection for customers. 'In a competitive market, customers should not have to rely on generators adopting self-imposed codes of conduct to limit their bidding.' National Power said its policy was to recover each station's costs plus a reasonable contribution to overheads and profits. 'We have adopted a clear and consistent policy not to exploit our position with regard to our constrained-on plant,' it said. Report on Constrained-on Plant.

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage activity boosts Nikkei as Topix eases ARBITRAGE-related buying led by the futures markets boosted equities to intraday highs in late trading, but overall share prices ended mixed amid choppy activity, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 142.46 higher at a session peak of 20,675.84, after a low of 20,394.14, while the broader Topix Index of all first section issues lost 3.07 to close at 1,589.73. Volume was estimated at 620m shares, down from 830.2m, as advances outpaced declines by 590 to 457 with 144 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.16 to 1,254.86. Traders said that the Topix is more representative of current market sentiment, and they doubt that the Nikkei's strength will last. An analyst at a Japanese brokerage said that investors are waiting for stocks to consolidate before they enter the market more aggressively. Speculative dealers targeted non-ferrous metal stocks on reports of violence and rioting in South Africa, together with the subsequent strengthening of gold prices. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the day's most active issue, rose Y82 to Y972 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting by Y26 to Y532. Sega, the video game and entertainment company, rose Y340 to Y10,100 on reports that it will co-operate with American cable television companies to deliver video game software to the US. Foreign and domestic institutional investors remained subdued, awaiting the outcome of the G7 meeting here. So far Russian reform has been a primary focus of the G7 meeting. Foreign exchange-rate stability gave a boost to Nikon, which ended Y35 higher at Y1,030, while Canon rose Y10 to Y1,540. Nissan Diesel ended at Y520, up Y80, the maximum high for the day, on reports that the manufacturer and Ibiden, a Japanese chemical company, had made progress in developing a filter to cut nitrogen oxide emissions for diesel engined vehicles. NTT dropped Y20,000 lower to Y1.02m. The financial sector also suffered losses across the board. Mitsubishi Bank declined Y50 to Y2,490, Daiwa Bank lost Y50 to Y1,100 and the brokerage house, Nikko Securities, slipped Y40 to Y1,040. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 25.59 to 22,178.69 in volume of 27.1m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets put in mostly strong performances with a number of markets at or near record highs. HONG KONG, however, turned lower as profits were taken after Wednesday's record-breaking rally, and the Hang Seng index ended 57.70 lower at 6,732.04 in turnover of HKDollars 5.68bn. HSBC Holdings continued to top the most active list, falling 50 cents to HKDollars 73. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 22.79 to a record close of 1,731.40 in turnover which was also at an all-time high of SDollars 765.31m. The surge in volume was attributed to demand by fund managers who are currently underweight in Singapore. TAIWAN saw late demand for bank shares pull the market to a sharply higher close. The weighted index rose 119.64 or 2.61 per cent to 4,695.49 although turnover remained thin at TDollars 31.7bn. Small investors took a lead from institutions which began buying financial stocks in the last trading hour. MANILA closed at an all-time high amid heavy buying of oils, on expectations that drilling projects off Palawan, south-west of Manila, will yield positive results. Foreign buying helped the composite index 4.4 higher to 1,583.25, surpassing the previous all-time high of 1,580.95 set on June 11. SEOUL picked up from an easier start after an aggressive, across-the-board late buying spree. The composite index, which lost 7.69 points during the morning, ended 11.84 higher at 716.76. BOMBAY moved ahead as it returned to work after Wednesday's holiday. The BSE index rose 66.28 to 2,293.12 as the nervousness which had gripped the market since last week's announcement of a credit policy subsided. BANGKOK benefited from strong institutional buying of banking and finance shares and the SET index rose 11.84 or 1.37 per cent to 874.55. AUSTRALIA edged lower after Wednesday's surge and the All Ordinaries index shed 0.3 at 1704.1.</p>

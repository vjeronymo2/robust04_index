			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jian (7559 1017)] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- The UN Security  Council adopted a resolution today to empower UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to set up a UN Mozambique Action  (UNMA) special police detachment, with the number of the members  of the detachment limited to 1,144.    According to Butrus-Ghali's suggestion, this special police  detachment will begin work as part of the UNMA. In  Butrus-Ghali's opinion, there is a need for the UNMA to take  measures to help the Mozambican police improve their ability to  protect civilians and their property, and to supervise law  enforcement by the Mozambican police.    the Mozambican Government and the Mozambique National  Resistance signed the "Mozambique comprehensive peace agreement"  in October 1992 in Rome, Italy, and agreed to hold general  elections this October. Regrouping and disbanding the two  factions' troops to create conditions for holding general  elections and the election preparatory work are under way in  earnest.    Butrus-Ghali held that establishing a special police  detachment to supervise law enforcement by the Mozambican police  will help build voter confidence and prevent irregularities.    Li Zhaoxing, China's permanent representative to the United  Nations, spoke prior to putting the resolution to a vote. He  said that the international community, including the United  Nations, should continue to try its best to help the Mozambican  people realize the goal of holding the general elections as  scheduled so as to help Mozambique return to the path of  rebuilding its homeland and restoring its economy.</p>

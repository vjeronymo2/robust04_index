ZDF [German TV Two], one of the biggest European  broadcasting stations, had concluded a cooperation agreement  with the Iranian state television, IRIB, in 1991. Now the  people in Mainz had to learn from French judicial circles that  their partners are said to be involved in the state terrorism of  the mullahs.    "We are shocked," said Petra Zilken from the ZDF department  for international affairs, "we have to think thoroughly about  further cooperation."    The serious accusation is made in a charge that was filed by  the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Paris and has been  secret so far. The file sent to the Elysee Palace deals with  the murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar.  Three men killed the politician, who had escaped to French  exile, by numerous knife thrusts on 6 August 1991.    Before the end of this year, the presumable perpetrators are  to be brought to trial in Paris.    After several dozen assassination attempts in Europe, among  them the assassination of exiled Iranians in the Berlin  "Mykonos" restaurant, it has now become known for the first  time: Iran regularly used its television correspondents to  provide the logistics for the killers. According to the French  investigators, in this way they organized papers, apartments,  and cars. Their advantage: Because of their cooperation with  big European televisions stations, they enjoy hospitality in  many places and can move unhindered everywhere.    In the case of Bakhtiar's murder, the wirepuller was in the  Rue de Liege 27: Mas'ud Hendi, 45, Paris bureau chief of the  Persian television station, IRIB, and nephew of Ayatollah  Khomeyni. Hendi procured the visas for the two Iranian agents  who have to stand trial for Bakhtiar's murder. Hendi himself is  also detained.    A document of the French prosecutors shows that the Iranian  Ministry for Telecommunications, partner of ZDF and other  television stations, is doing the preliminary work for the  assassination commands.    The Swiss television station, SRG, which only concluded an  agreement with the Iranians in November 1993, reacted  immediately. "Until the accusations are clarified, our agreement  will be suspended," said Oswald Sigg, spokesman of the SRG  executive board.    Tehran's answer came promptly. Last Thursday [20 January],  Rudolf Weiersmueller, Swiss ambassador to Iran, was called to  the Foreign Ministry. He had to receive a sharp protest note  from the mullahs -- a further leg in the controversy between  Switzerland and Iran, which has been smoldering for some time.    The Alpine republic has an international arrest warrant for  Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 39, and Ahmad Taheri, 32. Together with  others, they are said to have executed former UN diplomat Kazem  Rajavi in his Geneva exile in April 1990.    The wanted persons were imprisoned in France. In the event  of their extradition, which had been demanded by Switzerland,  Tehran threatened a "fireworks of bombs" toward French mediator  Jean Charles Marchiani. With success: The presumable  terrorists were permitted to leave unmolested for Iran.    The German Federal Government was also well out of it  because, before their trip to France, the presumed murderers had  traveled from Frankfurt to Aachen -- watched by German security  authorities.    On 17 November 1992, the Swiss police briefed the Federal  Office of Criminal Investigation: "Ahmad Taheri and Sharif  Esfahani, who were arrested in Paris, are suspects in the RAJAVI  murder case."    The French received the decisive tipoff for the arrest from  their German colleagues.</p>

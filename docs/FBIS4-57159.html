			<p>BFN     [Text] Federal Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim has  said there is no Army intervention in the Federal Police because  the military are not fulfilling the functions of federal  policemen, like controlling and issuing passports.    Civil Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves said government  action is not against the strike, but against disorder and  indiscipline. Hargreaves added that their demand for salary  parity with those of civil policemen is illegal.</p>

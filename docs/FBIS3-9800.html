The  proportion of respondents satisfied with the parties in  parliament is 25 percent.    The poll also asked whether people would have supported the  referendum which former Premier Vladimir Meciar intended to hold  on the validity of the parliamentary mandate of deputies who  left the party they were elected for. Twelve percent felt  "maverick" deputies should lose their seats.    Eighty-two percent said they believed a deputy should vote  according to his own conscience rather than be obliged to follow  the party line.    When asked if deputies should vote in the interests of their  party, 52 percent said yes and 40 percent said no. Comparing  answers to the last two questions it follows that some 41  percent of respondents agree with both statements together,  indicating, according to SUSR, voters were not well informed  about the debate surrounding deputies' mandates.</p>

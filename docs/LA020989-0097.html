			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN, WILSON LEAD PARTIES IN GOVERNOR POLL  </P> <P> The California political grapevine crackled Wednesday with word of a new poll  that reportedly shows former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein leading the  1990 Democratic gubernatorial field, five points ahead of two veteran state  officeholders, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy.  </P> <P> According to reports circulating widely among political observers, the new  California Poll, to be published today, shows Feinstein was the first choice of  27% of the Democrats who were read a list of names often mentioned as potential  gubernatorial candidates.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp and McCarthy were next with 22% each and Controller Gray Davis was  the choice of 7%.  </P> <P> On the Republican side, it apparently was a blowout for U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson,  who is expected to announce his plans to seek the governorship in the next few  weeks.  </P> <P> Wilson was the first choice of 47% of the Republicans. Baseball Commissioner  Peter V. Ueberroth, who has indicated that he might be interested in running if  Wilson does not, was the choice of 19%.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who has already formed an exploratory  committee for governor, was third with 8%. Next were state Sen. Bill Campbell  of Hacienda Heights with 5%, former Rep. Dan Lungren of Long Beach with 3% and  state Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim with 1%.  </P> <P> The California Poll, conducted by Mervin Field of San Francisco, is the first  independent survey in what is expected to be a lively governor's race.  </P> <P> Through a spokesman, Van de Kamp pronounced himself satisfied with the poll  results.  </P> <P> "The three contenders are all running evenly, which we expected," the attorney  general said. He excluded Davis from the ranks of the contenders because of a  single-digit finish.  </P> <P> As for Feinstein, Van de Kamp noted that she had fallen slightly and that he  had picked up slightly since a similar four-way sampling a year ago. "That's a  good trend," he said.  </P> <P> Political professionals said Wednesday that they do not lend too much credence  to a poll taken 22 months before the election. But they said the numbers are a  factor in this early stage as potential candidates make plans to raise money  and hire consultants.  </P> <P> "It's a big, wide, wonderful world," said media consultant Kam Kuwata of Santa  Monica, an adviser to Davis. "The race is wide open, there is no real  front-runner and there's a little bit in the poll for each candidate to be  happy about."  </P> <P> The fact that Van de Kamp did not finish first gives comfort to Davis and  others who have been insisting that the attorney general will not have the  Democratic nomination locked up despite his methodical gathering of  contributions and party support.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp is the only Democrat who has said he will definitely seek the  governorship. He has said he will not seek reelection as attorney general and  has formed an exploratory committee for governor. He already has about $1  million in his campaign coffers.  </P> <P> Davis has about $750,000 he could use to seek reelection as controller or to  seek the governorship. He said he will decide soon which job he wants.  </P> <P> Feinstein's lead in the early poll is expected to increase the likelihood that  she will convert her current exploratory committee into a full-fledged  candidacy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor for 10 Years  </P> <P> She was mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988 and could not run again under  city law. Since leaving office she has been working on a book and sizing up her  future in politics.  </P> <P> Feinstein was seriously considered as a running mate for Walter F. Mondale, the  1984 Democratic presidential candidate, and was the "host" mayor for Mondale's  1984 Democratic National Convention.  </P> <P> The publicity she got then and the fact that she has been the mayor of one of  California's leading cities probably account for her standing in the new poll,  according to political professionals.  </P> <P> On the Republican side, the popularity of Wilson in his party was evident in  the answers to another question asked in the California Poll.  </P> <P> When respondents were asked, yes or no, if they were "inclined" to vote for  Wilson, 78% said yes and 14% said no.  </P> <P> The news was not so good for Ueberroth. Forty percent of the Republicans said  they would be inclined to vote for him while 41% said no.  </P> <P> That probably reflects the fact that Ueberroth, while winning high marks as  baseball commissioner and as president of the organization that staged the 1984  Olympics in Los Angeles, has not run for public office and would be an unknown  quantity for some Republican activists.  </P></p>

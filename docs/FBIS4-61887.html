			<p>BFN     [Text] On May 11 at about 5:00 in the morning, after  artillery preparations the Azerbaijani troops backed by armored  vehicles started an attack in the Mardakert Region of  Nagorno-Karabakh towards the populated center of Seisulan.    The Nagorno-Karabakh defense army's press service said the  attack had been resisted and the Azerbaijani troops had  retreated to their earlier positions.    The Karabakh defense positions on the eastern section of the  front were subjected to artillery fire. Hostilities continue in  the region.    However, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reported on  continuing military actions in the northern and northeastern  zone of the Karabakh conflict (the Azerbaijani regions of Agdam  and Geranboi). Baku said the Armenian formations kept trying to  break through the Azerbaijani positions.</p>

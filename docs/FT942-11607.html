			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Poisoning claims near settlement More than 150 people who claim their health was affected in Britain's biggest water poisoning incident are close to a cash settlement. Their claims for damages stemming from the Camelford water affair were adjourned at Truro Crown Court yesterday. Mr John Hendy QC, representing 10 people chosen to make test claims against South West Water Services, told Mr Justice Wright: 'The parties are speaking to each other. Some progress has been made and it is likely more progress will be made with an adjournment.' The case was expected to last three weeks before moving to London but a cash settlement is now likely to be offered to the 159 claimants. The case comes six years after 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate was poured into the wrong tank at the Lowermoor treatment works near Camelford, Cornwall.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 11  January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item.    Last night Central Bank President Evenor Taboada disclosed  Nicaragua closed 1993 with a deficit of more than $50 million in  its international reserves. Taboada reported the country's  current total gross reserves amount to approximately $100  million -- in other words, $50 million less than what is  necessary to have a financially acceptable economy.    In addition, the Central Bank president conceded the  government sold 74,476 troy ounces of solid gold, which resulted  in $28.255 million in revenues. Taboada described as "completely  baseless," however, Ramiro Gurdian's, Higher Council of Private  Enterprise president, remarks, who said such a transaction was  proof the government "is broke." He also rejected Gurdian's  remarks that the gold was sold to pay debts to creditors.  Taboada added the country still has 13,000 troy ounces,  equivalent to 20 percent of Nicaragua's average annual  production. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 4 Jan 94 pp 1, 8)    According to Central Bank figures, the alarming unemployment  rate grew by approximately six points thereby affecting 71.3  percent of the labor population in Nicaragua. Some 275,000  individuals in an economically active population of  approximately 1.4 million do not have jobs. In addition, 707,000  are underemployed as they hold no formal jobs. The report  attributes the unemployment increase to the incorporation of  68,120 people into the so-called economically active population,  as well as to a 0.72 percent drop in the country's economic  activity. In Nicaragua, 70 percent of its 4 million people live  in poverty. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1651 GMT 4 Jan 94)    In 1993, Nicaragua registered the highest inflation rate in  Central America. Prices for goods and services increased 19.25  percent in 1993. According to official figures, the cost of  living in other Central American countries went up an average of  11 percent, with Costa Rica having the lowest figure with an  annual increase of 9.05 percent.    A Central Bank report revealed that housing, transportation,  and communications were the areas with the highest price  increases. The government had estimated the year would close  with an inflation rate of less than 10 percent. Also, the  Central Bank added currency devaluation was 25.83 percent in  1993, and the price of the basic basket went up by 17.61.    Nicaraguan economic activity was characterized by recession,  a significant lack of liquidity in enterprises, high interest  rates, and a large reduction in internal demand levels. The  Central Bank admitted the measures implemented in early 1993,  when a 20-percent devaluation was applied followed by an annual  5-percent drop, "has unfortunately had a negative effect" on  economic activity. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1822 GMT 6  Jan 94)    Danish Foreign Cooperation Minister Helle Degn announced  Denmark will grant Nicaragua $100 million in aid during the  1994-98 period. In addition, Denmark will open an embassy in  Managua this year. On the second day of her official visit to  Nicaragua, Degn informed President Violeta Chamorro of this  decision in the presence of her Nicaraguan counterpart Erwin  Kruger, with whom she signed a mutual cooperation protocol.

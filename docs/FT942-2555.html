			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Recs The other regional electricity companies are set to follow Eastern Electricity down the share buy-back route. This week London and SWALEC said they would seek authority to buy back up to 10 per cent of their equity. Southern and SWEB also plan to ask shareholders for permission. The recs are unlikely to act until Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, finalises price caps for their distribution businesses in August. But it is hard to see the price regime being so tough that their scope to restructure their balance sheet vanishes. At worst, their current cash inflow could turn into a modest cash outflow. But, given the starting point of low or zero gearing, there would still be an opportunity to buy back equity. For shareholders, there are three main benefits. First, it should boost shareholder returns. Second, there would be less danger that rec managements would embark on foolish diversifications if they were no longer flush with cash. The record to date has been, at best, patchy. Third, it would be better to have the cash out now than risk dividend controls or punitive regulation under a future Labour government. For all Mr Tony Blair's talk about creating a 'dynamic market economy', that must be a possibility. Managers have an incentive to buy back shares too. If they do not, they will attract predators when the government's golden shares expire next year.</p>

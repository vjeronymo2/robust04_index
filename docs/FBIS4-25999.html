			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- PRC Premier Li Peng on  11 June sent to the 30th summit of the Organization of African  Unity [OAU] a message warmly congratulating the OAU on its 30th  summit. The full text of the message follows:    To the OAU summit:    On the occasion of triumphant convocation of the 30th OAU  summit, I hereby extend to it my warm congratulations on behalf  of the Chinese Government and people.    The birth of new South Africa with Nelson Mandela as its  president, and its attendance at the current summit as the 53d  OAU member signify the inspiring great victory accomplished by  the OAU and all African people in the political field, showing  the further strengthening of unity and solidarity on the African  continent. The admission of new South Africa to the OAU has  added a new vitality to the African people in their efforts to  seek a better future under the banner of the OAU, and has also  ushered in a new epoch in the history of the OAU. We  wholeheartedly wish the African people constant, new successes  in their struggle to defend national independence and  sovereignty, safeguard Africa's solidarity and unity, and  improve living conditions.    We are glad to learn that the African Economic Community  Treaty has officially become effective. The acceleration of  Africa's economic integration is of great significance to  African people's revitalization of the African economy through a  collective self-reliance. It shows the firm will and  determination of African countries and people to become united  and make themselves stronger in an unfavorable international  environment. The Chinese Government and people greatly admire  their will and determination and wholeheartedly hope that the  African people's collective efforts in the economic field will  succeed.    With the changing international situation, it has become  more  and more important to maintain political stability in African  countries so as to facilitate their economic development.  Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in Rwanda in  particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the  economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the  international community. We firmly support the OAU in its  efforts to mediate in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain  political and social stability in African countries.    A profound friendship has been forged between China and  African nations during long, common struggles. Under the  present complex international situation, we should even more  sympathize with and support each other, and make joint efforts  to strengthen Sino-African solidarity and cooperation. The  Chinese Government and people treasure very much the  Sino-African friendship. To strengthen friendship and  cooperation with Africa has always been an important part of the  foreign policy of the Chinese Government no matter how  international situation changes.    I am convinced that the current summit will certainly  achieve  its desired results and triumphantly accomplish the lofty  missions assigned by African nations and people.    I wish the summit a complete success!    [Signed] Li Peng, premier of the State Council of the  People's Republic of China    [Dated] 11 June 1994, Beijing.</p>

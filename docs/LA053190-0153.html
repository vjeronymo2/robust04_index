			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH FIGHT SPAWNS CULTURAL CLASHES;  </P> <P> HISTORY: LANDMARK STATUS IS BEING SOUGHT FOR SITES OF LITTLE SIGNIFICANCE IN AN  EFFORT TO PREVENT DEVELOPMENT, CRITICS SAY.  </P> <P> Few would deny that there is a peaceful beauty to Fryman Canyon, a wooded  ravine in Studio City where large trees and colorful wildflowers flourish in  the midst of the urban jungle that is Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But can acres of land virtually untouched by humans -- land where no historical  events of note took place -- be considered culturally significant, worthy of  city landmark status?  </P> <P> Recently, the city's Cultural Heritage Commission said yes, it could, and  recommended that half of the 63-acre Fryman Canyon parcel be designated as a  cultural monument.  </P> <P> But listen to the man who wrote the law giving the commission its powers: "It  seems to me that they are interfering in private property without sound  historical basis," said Ken Ross, 80, who in 1962 was head of the Municipal Art  Department and helped author the Historic Preservation Ordinance.  </P> <P> Critics say the Fryman Canyon decision illustrates how the city's cultural  monument designation process is being abused as slow-growth activists seek new  weapons in their ongoing battles with developers.  </P> <P> Over the last year, slow-growth groups citywide have nominated several sites  with little apparent cultural significance as landmarks in what detractors call  thinly veiled efforts to stop bulldozers and construction crews.  </P> <P> Such trends do not come as a surprise to Ross, who recalled that tensions  always existed between preservationists and developers. He said the  preservation law was written with the idea that the year's delay would allow  time to find new buyers to protect historic structures.  </P> <P> The first structure to be declared a cultural landmark in Los Angeles was the  Leonis Adobe in Calabasas in 1962, Ross recalled. The adobe was nominated when  its fate was threatened by the landowner's plans to build a Safeway on the  site.  </P> <P> "That was justified. It was one of the last adobes in the valley," said Ross,  who is fond of recalling the days when orange groves graced the Los Angeles  Basin. "It had a great history."  </P> <P> Perhaps the most criticized recent nomination of a site involved a neighborhood  drive to designate as a landmark a Studio City carwash where a developer  planned to build a $15-million mini-mall.  </P> <P> The commission also has seriously pondered designating as a landmark a  25-year-old white-domed theatre-in-the-round at the behest of Woodland Hills  residents who opposed a plan to build apartments on the site. As well, panel  members considered some World War II-vintage hangars at Van Nuys Airport --  nominated by a company trying to renew its lease on the buildings.  </P> <P> In Studio City, the residents and environmentalists who nominated Fryman Canyon  as a potential landmark were most interested in stopping a 26-home development  that landowner Fred Sahadi plans to build there, critics say.  </P> <P> "The people who are anti-growth activists recognize that this is a tool in  their arsenal where they have very little risk of losing," said Douglas R.  Ring, a Century City attorney who has represented developers before the  commission, and is now suing the city over the designation of a Hollywood  building as a landmark.  </P> <P> When a site is named a landmark, it is protected from demolition or alterations  for a year. The nomination process can delay a developer up to two months while  the commission decides whether the property deserves such protection.  </P> <P> "As carwashes and canyons will tell you, it is a process which has been  abused," Ring said. "The rules, the limits as to how far the commission can go,  are truly not well defined."  </P> <P> Detractors of the tactic say using the commission's powers to stall projects is  an attack on property owners' rights to use land as they see fit and undermines  legitimate historic preservation efforts.  </P> <P> "This has become a court of obstruction," said attorney Benjamin Reznik, who  represents Sahadi, who will be able to construct his 26 luxury houses after all  because the commission protected the half of his canyon where he had not  planned construction. "It has become the panic button that people can push at  the last minute."  </P> <P> But commissioners and their staff members say sites may have true historic or  architectural value even if their nominations are prompted by other concerns.  </P> <P> "Just because a tenant files an application, it may look as though the tenant  just doesn't want to move, but it may well be that the building is  significant," said commission staff member Nancy Fernandez.  </P> <P> A two-month delay for a developer is a small price to pay to guarantee that  important sites are not inadvertently destroyed, said commission Chairman  Amarjit Marwah.  </P> <P> Jay Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit  historical preservation organization, said many people seek landmark status for  buildings when they feel they have no other recourse to stop rampant  construction in their neighborhoods. Rounds predicted the number of such  applications will soar as development pressure in Southern California mounts.  </P> <P> "Development issues are coming face to face with legitimate environmental  issues and there are not enough mechanisms for looking at the overall quality  of the neighborhood," Rounds said. "I don't blame people for seizing whatever  mechanisms they can find."  </P> <P> Though commissioners generally do "a credible job of screening out things that  are inappropriate," he said, such applications take a toll on the already  overtaxed commission staff and resources.  </P> <P> Two years ago, commissioners spent considerable effort on an application  brought by members of the First Southern Baptist Church of Hollywood, who  sought landmark status for their 1923 building. Their request followed the  disclosure that that the block was being considered as a potential Metro Rail  site.  </P> <P> Church Pastor Gary Tibbs said he hoped that landmark status for the building,  which once housed the first Conservative Jewish synagogue in Hollywood, would  save the entire block from being razed.  </P> <P> "We were exploring all of our options and we thought that if the commission  landmarked the buildings then they wouldn't be able to destroy the block,"  Tibbs said.  </P> <P> But Tibbs withdrew the nomination after learning that landmark designation  could not save the former synagogue building -- much less the block -- from  destruction, but could prevent the church from making any alterations to it.  </P> <P> "They could still demolish the building even if the culture commission is  protecting it, but if they landmark the building, you don't have any control  over it," Tibbs said. "We didn't want the commission to tell us what to do with  it."  </P> <P> Members of both the development and preservation community agree that changes  could help the commission to function more effectively. Architects, for  example, say the commission needs more stringent guidelines to help the panel  determine what meets the standard of a significant site.  </P> <P> "They need to clearly define what a cultural heritage building is, and what  saving it does for the community," said architectural historian Jerry Viniegra.  </P></p>

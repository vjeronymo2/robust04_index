			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Aviation stocks suffer THE SHOCK caused by the withdrawal of GPA's global share offer sent tremors through the aerospace sector, leading to falls in British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce. At the day's worst, BAe was down 28 as confidence in the aviation industry received a sharp knock. Some dealers also talked of the possible effects of the GPA move on its orders for Airbus aircraft. GPA is one of Airbus's biggest customers and BAe holds 20 per cent of the Airbus equity. Sentiment was further weakened by fears of bad news when the BAe chairman met UK analysts yesterday evening in Berlin. Bargain hunters helped the shares come off the bottom and they ended 16 down at 277p on 3.6m turnover. Rolls-Royce was also affected by the news from GPA but it was speculation, later proved unfounded, regarding problems at an important customer of Rolls-Royce which caused the increased turnover and fall in share price. Volume rose to 13m as the shares retreated 8 to 161p. Profit-taking after the recent rise in the shares was also said to have been a factor. Gloom at ICI A gloomy progress meeting at ICI prompted a number of securities houses to cut their forecasts for the group and led to a sharp fall in the share price. The stock was further affected by the continuing overhang of the stake sold by Hanson. The shares closed a net 36 lower at 1235p. Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said the previous consensus forecast for 1992 profits had been Pounds 955m, and he was cutting back to Pounds 875m from around the Pounds 900m mark. One ICI broker was widely believed to have cut his estimate to Pounds 830m from Pounds 900m. Analysts said ICI highlighted the disappointing performance of Agrichemicals and the flat progress of the industrial chemicals arm. Mr Lambert added: 'They are saying nothing particularly different from anyone else in the industry, but they had shown a glimmer of hope at the end of the first quarter and, formally, they have gone more cautious than they were.' The shares were also overshadowed by the 2.8 per cent stake that Goldman Sachs bought from Hanson for 1400p a share in early May. The US investment bank is still thought to have at least 10m of the shares on its book. Ladbroke supported Best performer in the leisure sector yesterday was Ladbroke, which put on 2 to 208p as Hoare Govett and County NatWest both turned buyers. The shares had been under pressure for several weeks following a series of downgrades, with analysts focusing on the group's property portfolio, particularly in the US. According to Ms Lisa Gordon at County, Ladbroke is now trading at close to a 10-year relative low, and 'in a market looking for decent yields the company promises a safe 7.6 per cent based on a 6 per cent increase in dividend this year'. Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare agrees and, while retaining reservations about the property exposure, believes Ladbroke will generate sufficient revenue to raise its dividend. Rumours of a downgrade in Forte by its broker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, persisted in spite of the house's firm denial. It was said that UBS was now at the bottom of the market range. The shares receded 5 to 209p. A number of big Footsie stocks saw heavy trading yesterday as a rumour went round the market that the Kuwait Investment Office was lightening its portfolio. There was also talk that depressed marketmakers were cutting both their losses and books after a grim week. A block of 9m British Gas shares traded at 184 1/2 p was behind a heavy overall turnover of 23m for the stock, which fell 5 1/2 to 247p. Royal Bank of Scotland saw a line of 9m shares dealt each way at 185p and closed 9 off at 186p. Hanson, enlivened by a block of 6m shares sold into the market, slipped 5 1/2 to 209 1/2 p with 21m traded. Flotation worries and a profits forecast cut hit Lasmo, which fell 10 to 199p. Analysts had generally expected the oil exploration company to announce the pricing for the flotation of its North American assets acquired when it bought Ultramar. The announcement was expected on Wednesday, but its non-appearance combined with the withdrawal of the GPA float created market concern. Also, Strauss Turnbull revised its 1992 forecast to a loss of Pounds 27m from a previously estimated deficit of Pounds 4m. Wellcome, expected to raise about Pounds 4bn through a heavy share flotation this summer, was also hurt by the GPA news. The shares fell 25 to 919p. However, analysts remained convinced that the flotation was secure. A 10 per cent dividend rise and profits towards the top of market expectations failed to prevent water company Severn Trent declining 7 to 375p. Regional electricity supplier Manweb eased 2 to 342p after announcing a 61 per cent increase in profits, in line with forecasts. A block of around 9m shares in United Biscuits was reported to have stuck in the market. United, hit by a profits downgrading earlier this week, lost 5 1/2 to 362p as 2.1m shares were traded. Hillsdown was off 5 at 159p after a substantial placing resulted in turnover of 28m shares. Bass managed to gain a penny to 604p as shares in the leading brewing and drinks groups generally weakened. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew refused to comment on suggestions that the securities house had recommended a switch into Bass and out of Whitbread 'A', down 10 at 434p. Mr Andrew Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, advised investors overweight in Allied-Lyons to switch into Grand Metropolitan, but added that he is only making such a recommendation after Allied's recent rise and has not changed his advice on the stock from a hold. Allied slipped 18 to 644p, while GrandMet lost 6 to 475p but performed better than most leading shares in the sector. Guinness, 10 cheaper at 573p, was depressed by a profits downgrading from Kleinwort. Tyne Tees Television jumped 34 to 263p following a Pounds 30m agreed bid from Yorkshire TV, which fell 7 to 169p. Speculation in the French media that a takeover for Eurotunnel was in the pipeline helped lift the shares 8 to 345p. Shares in TI, which recently took over aerospace and information technology company Dowty Group, were affected by the GPA announcement and fell 14 to 353p. Also affected by the same sentiment was British Airways, 7 lighter at 263p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (17).

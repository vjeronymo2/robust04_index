			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / People: Deutsche Bank - keeping a watching brief Looking out from Metallgesellschaft's headquarters on Reuterweg in the centre of Frankfurt, chief executive Heinz Schimmelbusch has a clear view of the steel-blue towers of the Deutsche Bank, writes David Waller. He has a habit of pointing up at its skyscrapers and explaining to lunch-guests that up there somewhere his lords and masters are keeping an eye on him. In fact, Schimmelbusch is being watched over by Deutsche Bank - a major shareholder in Metallgesellschaft, Germany's 20th biggest company  - but not literally. It was in the office of Ronaldo Schmitz, a management board director at the bank and chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, that Schimmelbusch, a ruddy-faced Austrian nicknamed 'the Rasputin of Reuterweg', together with his finance director and another senior director, met Schmitz at 8 am on December 3. Cap-in-hand, Schimmelbusch, Germany's 1991 Manager of the Year, asked for new lines of credit to cover a potential liquidity crisis arising from cash payouts linked to futures contracts taken out in the US. Details of the talks leaked and on the following Monday Metallgesellschaft's share price fell by 12 per cent. Metallgesellschaft and Deutsche both insist that the liquidity problems are temporary and technical in nature - but it seems that contacts between Schmitz and Schimmelbusch are set to become more frequent in the weeks ahead as the bankers are kept abreast of developments. On the face of it, the two men have a great deal in common: they are both young by the standards of top German businessmen (Schmitz is 55, Schimmelbusch, 49) and both have an extremely international outlook, speaking fluent English with a north American twang. They are both outsiders in Frankfurt: Schimmelbusch because he is Austrian, Schmitz, less because he was born in Brazil than because he joined the board of Deutsche Bank direct from industry. This was in 1990 after 23 years with BASF. Temperamentally, however, they are worlds apart; though both are highly intelligent, Schmitz is an ice-cold and calculating finance man who is head of the bank's corporate finance activities, whereas Schimmelbusch is an impulsive and impassioned talker, direct to the point of being uncouth.</p>

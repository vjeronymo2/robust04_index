Vieira, who focused on  children's issues to win her first news Emmys, tied with ABC's Tom Jarriel, who  received four Emmys for his work as a correspondent on ABC's "20/20." "West  57th" was the big winner among news series, with seven awards from the National  Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. PBS, with 18 awards, won more Emmys  overall than any of the three commercial networks. CBS took 16, with 8 for ABC  and 5 for NBC. Emmys for prime-time programming will be handed out Sunday  evening at the Pasadena Civic, with Fox Broadcasting televising the ceremonies.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

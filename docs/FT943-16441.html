			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Nigerians upbeat against off-form Italy Today's second-round clash between Italy and Nigeria pits the old against the new. The winners of the game at Foxboro stadium near Boston take on Spain in the quarter-finals. Italy, three-time World Cup winners, have struggled to reach the second round. Their leading playmaker, Roberto Baggio, hasn't scored in eight games and has been bitterly criticized for his performance. The Nigerian team, making their debut in the World Cup finals, boosted their popularity and chances by winning Group D, ahead of Argentina and Bulgaria. Italy finished third in Group E with one win, one draw and one loss, scoring two goals and allowing two. The Nigerian 'Super Eagles', who have picked up the banner of African soccer from Cameroon's 'Indomitable Lions', beat both Bulgaria and Greece and lost 2-1 to Argentina. They play a fast, physical game, with a sometimes suspect defence that is compensated for by a swift counter-attack led by Rashidi Yekini and Daniel Amokachi. Dino Baggio, who scored Italy's winning goal against Norway, was dropped from the lineup yesterday with a light left thigh strain and replaced in mid-field by Roberto Donadoni.</p>

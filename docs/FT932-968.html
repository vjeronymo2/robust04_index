			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: TI venture to take lead in aircraft landing gear TI, the specialist engineering group, yesterday said it is to set up a joint venture between its Dowty aerospace division and Messier-Bugatti of France, in what would become the world's largest aircraft landing gear manufacturer. The combined business would have annual sales of about Pounds 270m and would account for more than a third of the world's medium and heavy landing gear market, ahead of US rivals, Menasco and Cleveland Pneumatic. The move is the latest example of European consolidation within the aerospace industry. The venture will help TI and Messier to reshuffle production more efficiently between its plants which are mostly operating well below capacity. Mr Tony Edwards, head of the Dowty aerospace division, said the joint venture would create the only global landing gear maker, with plant in the US, the UK and France. 'It is time for consolidation,' Mr Edwards said. 'Half of this joint venture is a better business prospect than going it alone.' Over the past two years aircraft production rates had fallen by 30-40 per cent. A key element of the joint venture would be to shift some production to Dowty's new Montreal facility which is working at about 40 per cent of capacity. The new venture will be called Messier-Dowty and TI will have management control, supplying the chairman, the chief executive and the finance director. Mr Jean-Paul Bechat, chairman and chief executive of Messier-Bugatti, a subsidiary of Snecma, the state-owned aero-engine group, welcomed the collaboration. 'The venture will not resolve all the aerospace problems,' he said. 'The joint venture offers good possibilities in the medium and long-term future and is not a measure for the six months to come.' 'Dowty was a potential world leader at the time of the takeover (by TI last year)', said Mr Edwards. 'We realised at the time that we would need to bring something else together to be world leaders.' Mr Edwards said projections of aerospace orders made at the time of the Dowty takeover last year were still being met for 1993-94. But for the next year, current projections were 10 per cent lower than its original assumptions because of delayed recovery in aircraft orders and Dowty had been forced to accelerate its restructuring programme. There will be a delay of a couple of months before the new joint venture company is incorporated. Messier and TI first crossed paths in 1937 when engineers from the French company were given hangar space by the then Mr George Dowty. Dowty then produced landing gear actuation equipment under license before Rotol, a joint venture of Rolls Royce and Bristol bought British Messier in 1949. Ten years later Dowty bought out Rotol.</p>

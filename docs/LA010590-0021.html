			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERALD BUILDING  </P> <P> I was delighted to note in "Only in L.A." (Metro, Dec. 22) that the decorative  lobby of the defunct Herald Examiner is coming into its own as an available  movie set.  </P> <P> The building was the work of architect Julia Morgan, who was commissioned to  design the sumptuous headquarters by William Randolph Hearst himself. It was  her first extensive project for Hearst, resulting in a close collaboration that  lasted for well over a quarter of a century and culminated in the Hearst  Castle. Long before women's lib, Morgan was a pioneering professional, a  dedicated architect whose life and achievements are discussed in a stunning new  book, "Julia Morgan, Architect," by Sara Holmes Boutelle.  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

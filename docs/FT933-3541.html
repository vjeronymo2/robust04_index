			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Belgium and Portugal shave rates THE central banks of Belgium and Portugal slightly reduced their short-term interest rates yesterday, following the Bundesbank's cut in its internationally sensitive discount rate last week. However, the French authorities surprised some dealers by keeping their official rates unchanged. Belgium cut its end-of-day interest rate from 12.25 per cent to 12.00 per cent, having last week cut its discount rate by  1/2 a percentage point and its central rate by  1/4 of a percentage point. Portugal reduced its emergency lending rate from 12.375 per cent to 12.25 per cent. Both moves followed the  1/2 percentage point cut in the German discount rate to 6.25 per cent last week. They were accompanied by sharp appreciations of both currencies. The Belgian franc closed at BFr21.23 against a previous BFr21.47 and the escudo at Es101.58 compared with Es102.38. Nevertheless, the Bank of France disappointed market dealers by keeping the intervention rate - which marks the effective floor for all French rates - at 6.75 per cent. This is a 1/2 percentage point above its German counterpart. The decision not to ease surprised some dealers, because the sharp appreciation of the French franc against the D-Mark yesterday would have given the Bank of France a good opportunity. The Bank of France may be concerned by the severe depletion of French currency reserves. Investors have not forgotten, either, that France's attempts to push short-term rates below Germany's early in the summer failed to trigger a rise in the French currency. Aggressive cuts by France may even have contributed to the crisis which forced apart the exchange rate mechanism's bands on August 2.</p>

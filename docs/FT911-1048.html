			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall after 3-year auction disappoints US TREASURIES turned lower yesterday afternoon after a disappointing auction of three-year notes in the first round of the Treasury's Dollars 37bn quarterly refunding. Demand for the three-year notes, which has been fairly strong in recent auctions, was lighter than anticipated, although the average yield of 7.09 per cent with no tail was in line with expectations. The results drove down bond prices across the board ahead of the remaining auctions. Bond prices, which had risen modestly in thin morning trading, lost ground on the release of the auction results. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off  1/4 at 95 15/16 , yielding 8.24 per cent while shorter-dated maturities were about  1/32 lower. The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market when Fed funds were trading at 5 3/4 per cent, in line with the newly perceived target for the rate. Yesterday's three-year note auction was for a record Dollars 13.5bn. Two-year and five-year notes will be auctioned in the next fortnight. THE FIRST new Federal government bond issue in Germany since January met with a good reception yesterday. This helped to stabilise some early weakness in bond prices, which appeared to stem mainly from heavy selling of bond futures for the purpose of hedging holdings of the new paper. The new 10-year bund, which has a coupon of 8 3/8 per cent, has proved easy to absorb so far, according to traders. The German government issued DM3bn at a price of 100.7 through the German bond consortium yesterday, though the price later slipped to 100.2. Bids will be invited at a tender of a further DM5bn today, giving a total new issue of DM8bn. There was some speculation that the government may be forced to raise more money this month through another 'Unity Fund' issue, to help cover the cost of rebuilding east Germany. The previous issue of Unity Fund bonds, carrying a 10-year maturity, was in February. Traders said the market took comfort from a statement made by Mr Norbert Kloten, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, to the effect that the Bundesbank had no intention of raising interest rates at the moment. THE UK government bond market rallied yesterday as traders said political worries had receded after last week's local elections. Traders said that the short end of the gilts market was well supported by hopes of a base rate cut. The market expects to see a fall in the retail price index on May 17 and there is speculation that this could trigger a half percentage point cut in the base rate. At the short end, the Treasury 9 per cent stock due 1993 rose from 99 7/16 at the opening to 99 17/32 by late afternoon. Among the longer-dated stocks, the Treasury 9 per cent due in 2008 moved up half a point from 92 7/32 to 92 23/32 , though it is still some way below the minimum tender price of 94 1/4 . JAPANESE government bond prices slipped in low-volume trading ahead of this week's auction of 20-year JGBs. Traders expect about Y300bn of 20-year JGBs with a coupon of 6.8 per cent to be auctioned either today or Thursday. Although retail interest appears to be lacklustre, traders expect the new issue to be absorbed easily. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 6.655 per cent, closing at 6.68 per cent in Tokyo and traded at around 6.675 per cent in London. See Lex</p>

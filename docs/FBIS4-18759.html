			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Early today, the German Government  set in motion the evacuation of German nationals affected by the  civil war in Rwanda. The Press Office of the Foreign Ministry  stated that, on instructions from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel,  Harald Ganns, the German Government's commissioner for African  policy, has been flown by Bundeswehr aircraft to Bujumbura to  organize the return of Germans arriving there from Rwanda.    The Defense Ministry has provided a 200-seater aircraft. The  Foreign Ministry reported that approximately 180 Germans --  chiefly development aid workers and their families -- are in  Bujumbura. They reached safety in Burundi yesterday from  war-torn Rwanda.    It was stated that Kinkel has issued instructions that other  foreign nationals who had to flee Burundi would be flown out on  the Bundeswehr aircraft if there are any free spaces.</p>

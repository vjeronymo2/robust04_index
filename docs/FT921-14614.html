			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Bonds: EIB deals in dollar, yen sectors arouse controversy NEW Eurobond issues continued to emerge at a brisk pace yesterday, despite a further sell-off in the US Treasury market, with activity concentrated in dollars and yen. The European Investment Bank launched deals in both sectors, both with reduced fees, arousing some controversy among market participants. The EIB launched a Dollars 400m offering of 10-year bonds via IBJ International, structured as a block trade; that is, the full underwriting risk was taken by IBJ, with only a small selling group. The pricing of the issue, at a spread of just 6 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury, took account of the substantial tightening in spreads particularly in supranational names which benefit from tax-exempt status in Italy. The EIB's last dollar offering, a 10-year deal launched before Christmas, has been bid just a couple of basis points above the US Treasury yield. However, dealers point out that there has been a technical short in that bond, partly because of use in the repo market. In the Euroyen market, the European Investment Bank's Y60bn issue of 5 per cent bonds, due 1995, was considered fairly priced, and dealers welcomed a new three-year benchmark. However, the structure of the transaction proved controversial. The deal, arranged by Nikko, consisted of a small co-lead group of underwriters and a selling group. The fees were undisclosed, but according to market sources were cut to 10 basis points, a substantial reduction. Nikko pointed out that despite the reduced fees, all the participants made money on the deal, and added that other houses had proposed similar structures. However, despite the successful placement of the transaction, some houses felt that the reduction of fees was a dangerous precedent. The EIB used a similar structure in the dollar market last year, in an offering arranged by ABN Amro. Also in the yen market was a Y50bn offering of 10-year bonds for the Asian Development Bank which was rather aggressively priced. The two offerings were the first in the sector this year to be targetted at European investors. In the dollar sector, spreads on recent aggressively-priced deals looked set to widen, but were rescued by further declines in the US Treasury market. Austria's 12-year deal launched on Monday and priced yesterday met steady demand and was increased from Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m. A Dollars 300m 15-year offering for KFW International Finance, via Deutsche Bank, was launched yesterday for pricing today. The indicated spread is 43 to 45 basis points above the 10-year Treasury. In the D-Mark sector, the strong performance of a 10-year zero-coupon deal for LKB Finance prompted an increase from DM500m to DM750m. A SFr150m issue of subordinated debt for Commerzbank, swapped into floating rate D-Marks, suffered as a result of over-aggressive pricing, dealers said. SEGA Enterprises, Japan's largest maker of commercially-used game equipment, announced a Dollars 200m convertible bond issue yesterday, writes Sara Webb. The issue attracted some interest as Japanese companies have refrained from issuing international convertible bonds in recent months and have tended to launch debt with warrants. The coupon on the issue will be fixed at between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent on January 23. Nomura International, lead manager for the convertible, opened subscriptions for the issue yesterday.</p>

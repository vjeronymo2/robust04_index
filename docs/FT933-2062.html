			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Renewable energy industry makes sense Sir, The report by Bronwen Maddox ('Answers in the wind', September 15) points clearly to the two reasons for focusing attention on renewable forms of energy. Fossil and nuclear fuels are finite and, as we use them up, we may cause pollution and significant climate change. Ignoring the environmental issues, we shall find that when stocks of conventional fuel have shrunk, the market will set an appropriate price for them and energy management will be taken up enthusiastically. Long before the time when the potential of energy management is exhausted, alternative energy sources will no longer be perceived as expensive. But it is risky to ignore the environmental issues. If we are convinced that global warming is going to bring the tides to inland doorsteps and that man is capable of influencing climatic change of that magnitude, then we are bound to try to exercise that influence. That is why it makes sense to produce some of our electricity from renewable energy now, by supporting the best schemes and giving them the experience of operating in a commercial climate. Then we shall have an established renewable energy industry capable of increasing its production when it has to.

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials from Seoul vernacular press published on 22 March on  the rupture of North-South working-level contacts for the  exchange of special envoys and remarks made by senior North  Korean delegate at the 19 March contact.    The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word editorial entitled: "How Can They Threaten `War'?"  Describing the "venomous remarks" made by the North Korean  delegate during the eighth working-level contact that "Seoul is  not far from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will become a sea  of fire and you cannot survive," as "shuddering," the editorial  reports his remarks disclosed the "true color" of North Korea.  The editorial expresses doubts that North Korea can hardly  become a "dialogue partner" in peacefully resolving the nation's  problems and that "no nation" in the international community  "supports" the North Korean position. Stressing that the  international community cannot have "perseverance" if North  Korea persists in an "unreasonable policy" regarding North-South  relations and the nuclear issue, the editorial notes that our  side is "well aware" of North Korean capabilities and will take  "resolute countermeasures" when North Korea commits an act of  "disturbing" the peace of the world. The editorial urges the  North to ponder "coolly" the consequences of its radical  hard-line steps and to act with discretion. Otherwise, the  "collapse" of the Kim Il-song system and "North Korean-style  socialism" will be "expedited."    CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial  entitled: "We Reprove the Government." Defining the incumbent  government's policies on diplomacy, security, reunification, and  North Korea as a "comprehensive failure," the editorial calls on  the Kim Yong-sam government to keenly realize the current "very  serious situation," and reports that the North side's  "intentional mockery and threat" including the "Seoul in a sea  of fire" remarks made by the North delegate at "official talks"  are the result of the government's "easy-going" policy on North  Korea, which has been implemented for the past one year.  Stressing that the security issue is the greatest national  issue, which will go into "bankruptcy" even by "one error," the  paper urges the government to have "a sense of shame" for the  recent "blow" dealt by North Korea. Describing the current  events as a "grave situation," the editorial criticizes the Kim  Yong-sam government's appointment of "gentlemen," who lack the  sense of reality and "practical experience," to the posts of  handling the North Korean issues and of dealing with North  Korea's strategy of "hiding a bayonet behind a smile."  Assessing the "security-related ministers' conference" as a  meeting of those who failed in working out proper measures  against North Korea by using up all their "cards," the paper  strongly urges that the government should present "appropriate  measures" instead of "prescriptions" made out after the patient  has died.    The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a  1,300-word editorial entitled: "Full-Scale Preparations Should  Be Made for Provocation." Noting that the people are worried  about North Korea's provocative remarks on war, the editorial  stresses that high-level officials in charge of diplomatic and  security affairs should "closely examine" the reason the  situation has "worsened." Pointing out that the "attitude" of  the government's diplomatic, unification, and security teams  toward the North made the people "worry," the editorial  criticizes "the nation-first policy," "national welfare theory"  and "incoherent" diplomacy against North Korea, which invariably  seeks "communization" of the South. The editorial reports that  "opposition" to deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S. Forces in  the ROK, which was expressed by the government claiming that  this would "incite" North Korea, and the policy of separating  the North Korean nuclear issue from "economic cooperation," were  the result of the government's "inconsistent" policy. Stressing  that North Korean military power, sought even amid severe  economic difficulties, is still "enormous," the paper introduces  that "three mechanized corps and tanks corps and two artillery  corps" have been deployed within 80 km from the Military  Demarcation Line.    Noting it is important for the government to further  strengthen its "security and defense posture" and for the people  to heighten "vigilance" against North Korea, the paper urges the  government not to assume a "wavering" attitude toward the North  so the people will "trust" and "follow" the government.    The independent moderate daily MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN  publishes  on page 3 a 1,100-word editorial entitled: "Where is North  Korea Heading?" Expressing concern with the North Korean side's  "radical remarks" on "willingness for war" made during the  working-level contact, the editorial points out that one cannot  understand such remarks with "common sense" and that the North  Korean authorities are likely attempting to "gain time" for  nuclear development. Stressing that "strong countermeasures" are  the only solution to the problem, the paper calls on the  government to strengthen diplomatic efforts to maintain an  "international cooperative system" in the course of dealing with  the North Korean nuclear issue and to prevent the situation from  advancing to an "extreme phase." The editorial maintains that a  "tight defensive system" should be established to cope with the  "reckless challenge" by North Korea.    The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  2,300-word editorial, under the headline, "We Should Resolutely  Respond to the Threat on `Sea of Fire'." Saying that an  "extremely serious situation" has developed following the North  Korean delegate's remarks at the North-South contact, the  editorial urges a reexamination of our own "internal posture" to  cope with this situation. Assessing the purpose of North  Korea's expression of a willingness for war as part of its  "negotiation strategy" to strengthen its own system of rule, to  provoke our "sense of anxiety" and create confusion within our  society, and to "alienate" the ROK, Japan, and the United States  in the "international arena," the paper observes that the  North's actions might have been prompted by our own "weak  points" such as the slackening of security since the  inauguration of the civilian government. Urging the government  to reexamine the nation's overall security posture, the  editorial particularly urges leading figures in society to  encourage the people to "establish" a new outlook on the  nation's security. Stressing that war can be prevented only by  "advance preparations," the paper calls for strengthening  internal unity to cope against any provocation.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word editorial entitled, "We Are Concerned With the  Nation's Security." Noting that, regardless of North or South,  all will be reduced to ashes if a war breaks out on the Korean  peninsula, the editorial expresses "shock" at the North Korean  delegate's remarks on Seoul becoming "a sea of fire," and points  out that North Korea cannot evade the international community's  "spearhead of attack." The paper, however, asks whether we are  "willing and capable" of coping with such "unpredictable acts"  of North Korea and whether we have enough arms to do so. The  paper criticizes our diplomatic team as "too weak" to dissipate  the uneasiness of the people, and as being "naive" and lacking  in clear, firm principles.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  1,300-word editorial under the headline, "Catastrophe in  North-South Dialogue Should Be Avoided." Noting that hasty and  narrow-minded people are worried about the possibility of war,  the editorial writes that the South's "acute reaction" to the  North's "bombshell declaration" on a readiness to answer  dialogue for dialogue and war with war was responsible for the  rupture in North-South talks. The paper then points out that  the nation's "future" was now more likely to be a target of  "bargaining" between big powers.    Opposing an "extreme attitude" against North Korea as  ineffective due to the likelihood of North Korea's further  aggravating military tension in order to appease a public  sentiment that will arise following economic sanctions. The  paper implores the North and the South to agree to a  working-level contact over the telephone as soon as possible and  to resolve this problem through dialogue and discussion, as they  would a "matrimonial quarrel."</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Energy agreement signed British Trade Minister Richard Needham speaking at an energy workshop in Jakarta yesterday, flanked by Indonesia's Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana. The two ministers signed an agreement on technical co-operation in the energy sector. British Gas said it expected to announce a Dollars 350m joint venture next month to build a 400MW power plant in Indonesia. The company is in talks with Bakrie Brothers, a private Indonesian telecommunications and plantations group and has agreed the venture in principle. However, financing has not yet been agreed. British Gas may hold less than 50 per cent of the plant, which will begin construction early next year. The plant will be designed, built and operated under British Gas management. British Gas already has a number of activities in Indonesia, where offers significant potential for power demand is expected to rise 14 per cent a year to 2004.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Soaring short-term interest rate puts pressure on banks A LARGE rise in the cost of borrowing short-term funds yesterday put many of the UK's leading banks under acute financial pressure and raised questions about the Bank of England's handling of its money market operations. A huge shortage of cash in the money market forced interest rates on the cost of borrowing sterling overnight up to 100 per cent. Normally, short-dated rates hover close to the banks' base rates, currently at 8 per cent. Yesterday's developments came at the end of a week when the government appeared to have abandoned its previous economic strategy in favour of a gradual move to lower interest rates in an attempt to boost recovery. In this atmosphere, many people in financial markets have been expecting a further cut in interest rates virtually any day. That made it more difficult for the Bank to alleviate the shortage yesterday via a technical manoeuvre, because such a move might have given the impression that the government was about to ease borrowing conditions earlier than intended. The rise in the overnight cost of borrowing forced banks which were short of liquidity to pay a large premium if they tried to obtain money from other financial institutions. 'There are people in the market making massive losses,' said one discount house dealer yesterday. A clearing bank dealer added that the situation in the market could get worse next week and expressed concern that the Bank was not handling the situation properly. 'The authorities should have offered short-dated funds and sent out a message that no alteration in base rates was intended,' he said. Behind yesterday's events was the huge amount of money drained out of the UK banking system last month when the Bank bought an estimated Pounds 15bn in its unsuccessful effort to prop up sterling. The operation left the market short of cash, and it may take several months to restore the balance. The shortage has become particularly acute in recent days because clearing banks and discount houses are reluctant to borrow money from the Bank at current rates, believing another UK base rate cut is imminent. Commercial bank officials said the rise in money market rates was unlikely to trigger another rise in UK base rates. Instead, the banks will carry the losses as long as the cost of short-term borrowing stays at current levels. Message from the markets, Page 6 Currencies and rates, Page 11 Lex, Page 22</p>

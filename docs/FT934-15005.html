			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Pay gaps threaten to split Russia: Report warns on consequences of widening income differences WIDENING differences in Russian incomes could threaten both the government's reforms and its political legitimacy, according to a report by the Centre for Economic Policy Research. In a paper entitled 'The Distributional Consequences of Russia's Transition', Dr Chris Foyle points to a widening gap both between individuals and between regions of Russia. In being prepared, 'at least in the short term, to sacrifice equity for efficiency', he says, the government risks sacrificing political legitimacy. Further, the weakness of the centre and its apparent inability to impose a fair tax structure, coupled with the growing wealth of some regions and the deepening poverty of others, poses large political risks. 'The local versus federal fiscal tension could result in the fragmentation of the Russian Federation,' he believes. A social safety net with targeted benefits is urgently required for those who have suffered the worst effects of the rapid collapse of the command economy, he says. Since 'the federal government is not in a strong financial position to undertake large scale social programmes', foreign aid should concentrate on that area. Using the scanty data available, Dr Doyle shows that high, medium and low earners, all of whom enjoyed significant income growth during the Gorbachev years from 1985-1991, saw their real monthly incomes plunge by up to half in 1991-1992. Total real household wealth had plunged from Rbs210bn at the end of 1991 (expressed in December 1990 roubles) to Rbs 29.5bn by the end of 1992, a decline of 86 per cent. 'Thus, the impact of price liberalisation was to severely erode household wealth.' Pensioners have suffered particularly badly from the effects of reform. The real purchasing power of pensions more than halved between early 1991 and mid-1992. Those on average pensions have seen some small recovery since. However, those on the lowest pensions remained at a very low subsistence level to the end of last year, with their income at half or less of the official 'physiological minimum', that is, the estimate of the monthly cost of providing a 'healthy diet' plus an extra 20 per cent for other expenses. Dr Doyle argues that the new tax system, heavily based on value added and profits taxes, is as yet unstable and vulnerable to rapid erosion because of inflation. He says the experience of privatisation, where many assets have been sold to citizens exchanging vouchers for shares in companies, will only initially mean wide share ownership. In time, 'as household real incomes and wealth have fallen sharply during the initial stages of the reform programme, it is likely that shares and vouchers will be sold by many. . . . concentration of ownership into a few powerful institutions (new pension funds, conglomerates) is likely to happen'.

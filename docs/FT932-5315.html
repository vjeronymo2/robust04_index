			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / People: Pennell takes on the privatisation of British Coal Whatever problems Christopher Pennell faces as the new head of privatisation at British Coal he will not have to spend much time getting to know his opposite numbers in the Department of Trade and Industry and at Samuel Montagu, British Coal's advisers, Pennell, 45, was educated at Oxford as was Peter Loughead, 42, head of the coal privatisation unit at the DTI. Meanwhile, Pennell did a stint as principal private secretary to former National Coal Board chairman Lord Ezra, as did Peter Jones, 39, who is now on the Samuel Montagu team. Compared with his last job of looking after British Coal's Pounds 1bn-a-year purchasing budget, Pennell's new privatisation unit is very small. Instead of 1,100 staff he will have just five people working with him, although he will be calling on the resources of the rest of the corporation. The two other key British Coal officials are Ian Forrest, 45, and David Merrick, 45. All three men are British Coal veterans, as is Ray Proctor, 48, British Coal's new finance director, who will retain overall responsibility for privatisation at board level. Pennell, who will split his time between his base at Eastwood Hall in Nottingham and British Coal's London headquarters, divides his new job into three sections. The first, and 'most pressing' part is to deal with the 20 collieries that are being closed down and offered for sale. Four collieries have been advertised already and Pennell's team will look after the tendering process. The second part of Pennell's job will be to see whether it is possible to privatise any stand-alone parts of British Coal ahead of full privatisation. But the main part of Pennell's job will be to drive British Coal's side in the government's planned privatisation. The difference here is that it will be the government, and not British Coal, which is the vendor. Unlike other nationalised industries that were privatised, such as British Telecom, Pennell does not think there is much chance that British Coal will be floated on the stock market. He believes it is more likely that it will be privatised through a trade sale of all or parts of the business.</p>

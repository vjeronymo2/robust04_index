			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / N Sea tax changes set for gas review THE IMPACT on gas pipelines of changes in the North Sea tax regime announced in the March Budget is to be reviewed by the government, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said last night. Hinting at another possible concession over the Treasury's controversial amendments to the petroleum revenue tax regime, Mr Dorrell said that he had 'agreed to look again' at a particular anomaly raised by Tory MPs. However Mr Dorrell described the area that would be reviewed as 'narrow' and said the government would not bend on the main parts of the changes which were announced in March. Speaking during the final Commons stage of the Finance Bill, which introduces changes announced in the Budget, Mr Dorrell said North Sea exploration would be undermined if the government was believed to be about to re-open the debate about PRT. The problem over pipelines had been raised by Mr Alan Duncan, Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton. He expressed concern that existing pipelines built with excess capacity, with a view to that capacity being used at a later date, would be unfairly disadvantaged compared with new pipelines. The existing pipeline could be subject to PRT but not the competing new pipelines. Last month the government bowed to pressure from Conservative MPs and extended the short-term help for companies worst hit by the PRT changes.</p>

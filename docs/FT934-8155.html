			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Manchester council attacks truancy figures THE TRUANCY figures released today shed fresh light on the extent of the problem, but there is still controversy about their accuracy. The figures have been fiercely contested by some local authorities. Labour-controlled Manchester is home to the 'worst' school for truancy on education department figures, with more than one in five pupils absent without leave at any one time. But the authority rejected the government's figures, which showed that it suffered the worst truancy in the country with pupils skipping 6.4 per cent of lessons on aver-age. Describing the figures as 'spurious', the authority said Manchester had 24,450 pupils, while the education department's figures implied that it had only 13,333. Criteria could vary between authorities and even from school to school. For example, much parentally condoned absence might be truancy by any reason-able definition, but might still be regarded as authorised absences by some schools. Education department plans to publish figures for authorised absences next year might only emphasise areas badly hit by influenza epidemics. The worst records at primary school level were suffered by the London authorities of Lambeth, Newham, Kensington and Chelsea, and Tower Hamlets, all of which saw 40 per cent or more of pupils play truant at least once. Nationally, pupils who have played truant at some time amount to 12 per cent. Truancy and deprivation correlate closely, as the main table for local education authorities shows. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has said truancy is 'a contributory factor in juvenile crime'. He pointed to Cambridge University research which showed that 48 per cent of young offenders were truants. But a government-funded study by the University of North London showed no definite link with crime, although it suggested that the scale of the problem was even greater than the government's figures showed, with 30.5 per cent of children playing truant at least once in their last two years of compulsory schooling. The North London survey found that the greatest cause was dissatisfaction with lessons, cited by two-thirds of truants. One in five did so played truant to avoid particular lessons, with physical education, games, French, maths and English the most unpopular subjects. Disapproval of parents and teachers was the most powerful control on truants, suggesting that 'school ethos is the critical variable'.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUANCY: INNER CITIES HARDEST HIT  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Percent                                                     Percent   pupils                                                     of half  at least                                                      days    one half                                                     missed     day  -------------------------------------------------------------------- The worst affected schools  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Percent  Percent  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Moston Brook High            Manchester           21.5      50 2  Ducie High School            Manchester           20.9      54 3  Redewood School              Newcastle Upon Tyne  19.0      75 4  Windsor High School          Salford              17.8      66 5  Whalley Range High (Upper)   Whally Range         16.3      72 6  East Leeds High              Leeds                15.8      80 7  Archbishop Michael Ramsey    Camberwell           12.9      82 8  Fairfax Community School     Bradford             12.7      68 9  Gregory Boulevard            Nottingham           11.7      55 10 William Crane Comprehensive  Nottingham           11.7      54 11 Forest Gate Community        London               11.7      40 12 Blakelaw School              Newcastle Upon Tyne  11.4      37 13 Wycliffe Community College   Braunstone           11.3      68 14 Savio High School            Bootle               11.1      38 15 Mary Linwood School          Leicester            11.0      73 16 Stockwell Park School        London               10.8      61 17 Walworth School              London               10.8      78 18 Breckfield Community Group   Liverpool            10.4      68 19 Lilian Baylis School         London               10.3      71 20 William Penn School          London               10.2      73  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Schools are ranked according to the percentage of mornings and afternoons missed.

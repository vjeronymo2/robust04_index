			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOSTRADAMANIA  </P> <P> While it is generally acknowledged that an outsider reviewer's position may not  represent a publication's editorial position, it is also true that a  publication must share some responsibility for the merit or the failures of its  reviews.  </P> <P> Your reviewer, Malcolm Dean, is a believer in, or some kind of devotee of,  astrology, and from that stance dismisses James Randi's "The Mask of  Nostradamus."  </P> <P> Characteristically of astrology's believers, Dean totally fails to address the  substance of Randi's evidence of Nostradamus' fakery or indeed the actual  content of his book.  </P> <P> Finally, at least one reader finds it alarming that one of the nation's largest  daily papers indirectly lends support to belief in astrology, which all  reputable scientific authorities have and continue to dismiss as nonsense. You  would better serve your readers by now having Randi's book reviewed instead of  its serving as a peg for Dean's polemics. Incidentally, Dean's antagonism to  Randi is of long standing, so one questions the propriety of assigning the  review to an avowed opponent.  </P> <P> EDWARD T. CHASE  </P> <P> Senior Editor  </P> <P> Charles Scribner's Sons  </P> <P> NEW YORK CITY  </P></p>

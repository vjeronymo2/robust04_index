			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulundi May 4 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had learnt with great  relief on Wednesday [4 May] afternoon the African National  Congress had withdrawn charges of electoral fraud against his  party. The IFP leader told an impromptu Ulundi press briefing he  would stand by the election results if the other parties did so.    Mr Buthelezi said it was "very mean" of the ANC to have made  a mountain out of a molehill over claimed IFP irregularities in  the voting process. He said he was concerned about the anger  which could have generated.    Mr Buthelezi said he had entered the all-race elections on  the understanding that he would stand by the results.    In spite of reservations about the process "I don't think  there is any possibility of me turning around, rejecting the  results".    He said that would be construed as sour grapes.</p>

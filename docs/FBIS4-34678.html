			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 21  June.    Trade activities between Panama and Taiwan reached  approximately $350 million in 1993, making Panama the second  leading market for Taiwanese exports. Trade between the two  nations is expected to increase to approximately $370 million  this year. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 17 June 94 p 17 A)    Based on the behavior of the leading economic indicators  during the first four months of the year, no significant changes  are expected in the export levels of traditional products  compared to figures obtained in 1993. Nontraditional exports,  which already total $190 million, have experienced an increase  in amount, value, and variety. The export of services for 1994  will experience a 5-percent increase if current figures prevail.  Duty-free zone activities will grow, but not as much as in  1993, and the volume of oil carried by pipeline will decrease as  anticipated. A growth in tourism will remain moderate.  Concerning imports, the collection of tariffs and sales taxes  indicate a 15-percent increase. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA  in Spanish 17 June 94 p 8 A)</p>

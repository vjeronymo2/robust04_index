			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alan Ben-'Ami] </F>   [Excerpts] Both Israeli and British officials have begun  working to have Hamas declared a terrorist organization in  Britain. According to Israeli sources, the Islamic  fundamentalist group is using England as a safe haven for  planning attacks and transferring funds and operational  instructions to its terrorist squads in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    Details of how Hamas operates in Britain -- in some cases  using Islamic social and charitable organizations as a cover for  planning operations, raising or laundering funds, then  transferring money and orders to the territories -- have all  been passed on to the relevant British security authorities.    This is not the first time such information has been passed  on to Britain. More than a year ago, the British authorities  were told that their country was a major base for Hamas leaders,  with direct links to the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam murder squads  here. This followed the arrest of two high-ranking Hamas  operatives, Muhammad Salah and Muhammad Jarrad. [passage  omitted]    Now, according to a well-placed source, in the wake of  increased Hamas terror activity and especially the bomb attacks  in 'Afula and Hadera, the British authorities are more likely to  take action. What is needed, according to the source, is formal  Israeli diplomatic representations to Britain, along the lines  of the diplomatic offensive by Israel and the U.S. to get King  Husayn to crack down on Hamas members and their activities in  Jordan. For the British authorities to act against Hamas under  Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, Israel will have to show  that Hamas engages in terrorist activity and that while Hamas  may not yet be carrying out terror attacks in Britain,  instructions, money, or logistic support for Hamas terror acts  elsewhere is being sent from Britain. This is now believed to  be possible in light of the fact that Hamas has openly and  officially boasted of its terrorist attacks and that detailed  information on the links between Hamas members in Britain and  the territories is now being made available.</p>

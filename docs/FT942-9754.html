			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Better day for sterling Sterling rose on the foreign exchanges yesterday, helped by a better than expected set of trade figures, writes Philip Gawith. The sterling index finished in London at 80.1, up from 79.6 on Wednesday, with the pound closing nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM2.5052 from DM2.4911. It also ended more than a cent firmer against the dollar, at Dollars 1.4994 from Dollars 1.4886. Traders had anticipated a quiet day, with most European markets closed for the Ascension Day holiday, but there was a lot of business in sterling, the dollar and the yen. The dollar survived a weaker than expected set of economic figures, with the market wary of selling against possible central bank intervention. It was also helped by the revival in the US bond market. In Europe, the D-Mark ended weaker against most currencies, closing in London at L956.5 from L957.8 against the Italian lira. The pound was the focus of early activity when a better than expected set of February trade data gave the currency a boost. The headline figure of a trade deficit of Pounds 731m was well below the median forecast of a Pounds 1.1bn deficit. The key figure, however, said Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC, was the fact that the revision to the 1993 UK global trade deficit was much smaller than the market had feared. The deficit was revised up to Pounds 13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn, but this was a far cry from the Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn upward revision expected by some. These figures gave sterling its initial boost, and the later confirmation of the Labour party leader's death gave the currency further momentum. Mr David Barrett, trader at Natwest Markets, said one of the reasons sterling had risen after the trade figures was that the market had been short going into the figures, and short positions had been squeezed. Stop-loss buying when it rose above DM2.50 had also helped. Mr Parsons said there were three reasons why the market had seen Mr Smith's death as being good for the pound. First, 'it takes the Tory party off the front pages. That has to be good for the currency.' Second, the focus would now swing to possible divisions in the Opposition. Finally, his demise meant that a leadership challenge in the Tory party from Mr Michael Heseltine, seen as the most potent challenger to Prime Minister John Major, was now much less likely. Like Mr Smith, Mr Heseltine has also previously had a heart attack. Mr Stephen Yorke, political analyst at Chase Manhattan, raised the prospect that if the Labour party moved quickly enough to appoint a new leader before the June 9 European elections, the combination of a sympathy vote and a honeymoon period could boost its vote significantly. What this would mean for sterling is unclear. Recently there has been market speculation that Mr Major's departure - a possibility, if the Tories do very badly in the elections - would actually be welcomed by the market. On the other hand, Mr Yorke notes: 'If international investors start pricing in a Labour government, then sterling will certainly fall.' The dollar received an initial fillip from the release of inflation, retail sales and jobless data, all weaker than anticipated. These helped the US bond market, and the dollar rallied on its coat-tails, continuing the parallel trading of the two markets evident in recent weeks. This helped to push the dollar to a high for the day of DM1.6740, but it later fell back to close in London at DM1.6708, from DM1.6735 on Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar was little changed at Y104.505 from Y104.470. Mr Barritt said there had been a lot of yen sales, particularly for D-Marks. 'There is a growing perception that the US administration does not want the strong yen to continue,' he said. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6662 and Y104.22. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese prime minister, added his voice yesterday, saying that 'the current rapid currency moves cannot be justified by economic fundamentals'. Although the figures were weaker than expected, Mr Parsons said: 'The market is wary of selling dollars on the back of weak numbers. It is concerned that if you try and take the dollar lower, it could be met by central bank intervention.' Mr Parsons judged that the central banks had done an 'exceptionally good job of changing sentiment'. He would not go so far as to say the dollar's troubles were over, but 'they have at least succeeded in making it a two-way bet. The market is reluctant to open short dollar positions.' In the futures market, the short sterling contracts continued their recovery, with the December contract closing nine basis points firmer at 93.93. The December Euromark contract ended unchanged at 95.24, a recovery of some 30 basis points over the past week from a low of 94.92. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 115m after forecasting a very small shortage of Pounds 150m. The overnight rate moved in the 4 to 5 3/8 per cent range. The German money market was closed.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> AUTHORITIES WARN OF ANOTHER AMNESTY FRAUD  </P> <P> Men describing themselves as government officials are going door-to-door in  Latino neighborhoods of Orange County offering guaranteed seats in non-existent  English and civics classes in exchange for a deposit, authorities said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> In a joint news conference, Gerald G. Johnston, Orange County deputy district  attorney, and Harold Ezell, western region commissioner for the U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service, said they want to alert Latinos to the  fraud. English and civics classes are required for permanent residency status.  </P> <P> They said well-dressed men are passing themselves off as representatives of the  "Department of Education" and telling amnesty applicants that they must put  down deposits ranging from $10 to $50 to reserve seats in the classes.  </P> <P> Johnson said authorities have received seven complaints from residents in  Anaheim, Stanton and Santa Ana who were victimized by the scam. Those  complaints were forwarded to his office Friday by the Orange County Coalition  for Immigration Rights. The victims told authorities that the men spoke with an  Argentine accent, he said.  </P> <P> "It's our suspicion that several hundred people have put down deposits,"  Johnston said. He urged that anyone who has been victimized come forward. "Once  people come forward, we'll have enough information to catch those crooks," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (9): Everyone is aiming to get smart - A look at the way ahead for manufacturers of missiles The Gulf War has coloured thinking in most areas of military doctrine. So much so that the sales pitch now chanted by all arms dealers is that their products were vindicated in Operation Desert Storm. Of those systems which genuinely had their reputations enhanced, stealth technology, while expensive for most nations, was a worthy runner-up. The clear winners, however, were guided weapons. Pictures of precision-guided 'smart' munitions not only impressed the watching taxpayer, they also made an impact on force commanders under pressure to keep casualties at a minimum. Some watchers are now so enthusiastic that they think guided weapons will take over from traditional ordnance. 'The way ahead is definitely with smart weapons,' says Kent Kresa, chairman of Northrop Grumman. 'Given the desire to protect troops, I can't see the US ordering any dumb munitions at all as we develop new technologies.' Yet, while the idea of using guided missiles is popular, the overall pressure on all western defence budgets is still making life tough for missile manufacturers. In the UK there is interest in developing a long-range conventionally armed air-to-ground missile, but it remains to be seen how much funding is available for the project. The US is also keen on advanced technologies and is still pursuing scaled down 'star wars' anti-missile missiles through its theatre ballistic missile defences. Projects such as Lockheed's Theatre High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) missile have received backing and THAAD has a four-year Dollars 689m development contract. Yet, even in the US missile manufacturers are having to adjust as procurement spending falls. As elsewhere in the defence industry, rationalisation and merger are seen to be the way to cope with the downturn. The consolidation seems to be proceeding more smoothly in the US than Europe. In a typical deal aimed at reaping the full benefits of rationalisation, Hughes acquired General Dynamics' missile business, and then consolidated all manufacturing on its own site in Tucson, Arizona, and closed General Dynamics factories in southern California. In the US, Raytheon and Hughes lead the pack while Martin Marietta and Lockheed are still involved as missile manufacturers, but beyond that it is by no means clear how many groupings will survive. Construction of some systems is still split between several companies, increasing overheads. Whether the market can sustain more than two or three mainstream missile makers is questionable. In Europe, the outlines of possible mergers are beginning to become clearer, but progress is still painfully slow. Much collaboration has been on specific programmes, for example the BAe-Aerospatiale-Deutsche Aerospace Trigat anti-tank missile. But such collaborative ventures tend to suffer from many of the disadvantages of high overheads and compromise designs. Still, since missiles contain some of the highest technology under development, countries are reluctant to release control for national security reasons as well as industrial concerns. There are talks about wholesale mergers, some of which have been mooted for a long time. British Aerospace's negotiations with Matra continue unabated, while hints of a merger between Aerospatiale's and Deutsche Aerospace's missile businesses gather pace. In part, these mergers would help cut out duplication in research and development, and would cut down on the high level of cut-throat competition which has hurt profit margins. It may also be a prelude to a grand missile merger of both groups to form a European missile giant which could be capable of developing the kind of ballistic missile defence systems some European countries are starting to covet. It is more difficult to see how the electronics manufacturers for missile systems - companies such as GEC-Marconi in the UK and Thomson in France - fit in to such a grand scheme. It may be that by providing sophisticated specialised equipment, such as sensors, to a range of missile makers worldwide, they can gain sufficient scale to remain viable in their current form. Equally, there may be a horizontal merger between electronics companies to produce a large sub-system supplier. But the idea that GEC-Marconi might take over BAe Dynamics, for example, seems to have faded. Other ways of cutting costs in the hostile environment are also being tried. Efforts are being made in Europe and in the US to cut costs by transferring technologies between missile systems. Unfortunately, adapting equipment from air-to-air missiles for use in ship-to-ship combat is neither as easy nor as obvious as it might appear. The conditions under which the missiles have to operate vary so much that a weapon optimised for conditions on the wing of a Mach-2 fighter may suffer badly when exposed to corrosive sea spray. As with so many areas, decisions on procurement will determine which companies gain the upper hand in mergers, and indeed, which can survive in the missile business. In the UK, there is a need for a long-range stand-off air-to-ground missile based on the Gulf War experience. A new medium-range missile is needed for the Eurofighter, and a short-range anti-armour air-to-ground missile for the Harrier is under consideration. A range of anti-armour and anti-ship weapons are being developed in continental Europe and the US is considering a new short-range air-to-air missile. Unless individual countries are prepared to allow transfer of missile manufacturing abroad, and it remains one of the most sensitive cutting edge technologies around, Europe will continue to pay higher prices for fewer weapons than the US. Rumour suggests that the long-awaited BAe-Matra merger may be announced at Farnborough, as a 50-50 joint venture and a Frenchman in the chair. If it happens, it will not be a moment too soon.</p>

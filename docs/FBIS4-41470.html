			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 26 TASS -- A series of meetings of  representatives of the Russian Government, led by Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and heads of 14 major  transnational corporations opens in the President Hotel today.  It is expected that in the course of a three-day direct  dialogue a permanent consultative council on foreign investments  under the Russian Cabinet of Ministers will be created. It will  be headed by Chernomyrdin. The council is expected to meet no  less than twice a year.    "The main purpose of the economic council, which is being  created for the first time, is to hear attentively the  potential investors," Chernomyrdin said in an ITAR-TASS  interview on the eve of the meeting. "We would like to know what  ways western business people suggest for increasing investments  in Russia, what is hampering their work and how the Russian  Government could help remove the unnecessary barriers on their  way, including in the sphere of taxation."    Chernomyrdin expressed hope that they would manage to pass  over from words to action at the first Moscow meeting in  promoting investments in the Russian economy. The firms we  invited to take part in the meeting are not at all newcomers on  the Russian market, he stressed.    These include the well-known companies Coca Cola, Procter  and  Gamble, BASF, Mars, Ernest and Young, United Technologies,  Citycorp etc. Informal meetings of government officials and  business people will be held today, and the main work will start  on Monday.</p>

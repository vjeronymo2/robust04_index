			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Mexico City, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Police in Mexico  today denied reports that the person presented to the media as  the alleged killer of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo  Colosio is not the same individual originally arrested.    Attorney General Diego Valadez Rios said in a news release  that the person being held, Mario Aburto Martinez, 23,  ``authorized'' prison officials to shave off his moustache,  which he was wearing in the first photographs that were released.    The attorney general, who is in charge of prosecuting  federal  offenses, stressed: ``Let there be no impression that there has  been any kind of switch or some sort of cover up.''    Privately owned television stations have broadcast footage  of  Aburto's arrest. At that time of his arrest, just after he had  shot Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), he was wearing a moustache.    On Friday, authorities presented an individual to the media  they identified as Aburto. The man was behind bullet-proof  glass at the Almoloya High Security Prison in Juarez, Mexico  State, close to the Mexican capital. [passage omitted]</p>

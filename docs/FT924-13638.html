			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strong futures lift Nikkei in technical trade A STRONG futures market lifted share prices, and the Nikkei average rose on arbitrage buying and index-linked purchases by investment trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 188.66 to 17,490.67. The index opened at the day's low of 17,341.32 and rose to the day's high of 17,577.63 in the afternoon. Towards the close, position adjustments by dealers cut some of the gains. Volume rose to 210m shares from 163m. Advances led declines by 672 to 233 with 171 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 10.91 to 1,320.24 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.65 to 1060.11. Analysts said that while share prices seemed to be on a slow upturn, institutional investors were not hurrying to participate. Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said an expected decline of the yen against the dollar would help high-technology issues. 'The current low prices are simply not justified,' she added. Some analysts are now looking for the yen to fall against the dollar, possibly to the Y130 level. High-technology blue chips rose on buying by dealers and foreign investors. Toshiba gained Y5 to Y584 and Sony rose Y10 to Y4,040. NEC, however, fell Y8 to Y707 on small-lot selling. There have been concerns about the company's earnings due to sales of cheaper personal computers by a US computer company. Environmental-theme stocks gained on buying by speculators. Shinagawa Fuel, a fuel dealer which is conducting research into plastic waste recycling, was the most active issue of the day, rising Y43 to Y998. Kubota, a farming equipment and duct pipe maker, also advanced Y13 to Y595. Aids-related issues were firm with Green Cross, the pharmaceutical maker, gaining Y50 to Y1,620 and Sumitomo Chemical Y7 to Y473. Nikken Chemicals, in demand because of its research into a drug to treat Alzheimer's disease, advanced Y10 to Y1,080, a high for the year. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 220.24 to 19,173.38, rising above the 19,000 level for the first time since September 30. Volume however, remained subdued at 7.8m shares against Monday's 6m. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday. HONG KONG closed firmer on follow-through buying from Monday's rise, but brokers said investors were nervous ahead of tomorrow's airport talks. The Hang Seng index touched 5,770 twice before closing 30.53 higher at 5,756.10, in turnover of HKDollars 2.44bn. Property stocks again led the active list, with Sun Hung Kai falling 25 cents to HKDollars 33.25 and Cheung Kong shedding 10 cents to Dollars 21.10. AUSTRALIA was dragged lower by depressed metal prices and BHP's weakness, closing at an 18-month low. The All Ordinaries index lost 6.1 to 1,456.9 in turnover of ADollars 203.95m. BHP shed 14 cents to ADollars 11.42 while Western Mining slipped 15 cents to ADollars 4.15 after warning of flat minerals demand this year. CRA lost 20 cents to ADollars 11.76 on reports that the Papua New Guinea government might renegotiate mining contracts. NEW ZEALAND broke six consecutive days of declines with a 15.61-point rise in the NZSE-40 index to 1,361.17. Turnover was NZDollars 27m. Rises in Telecom and Carter Holt Harvey contributed to the market's recovery, with gains of 4 cents and 7 cents to NZDollars 2.24 and NZDollars 2.37 respectively. MANILA advanced steadily, as rumours that First Philippine Holdings may lift its dividend encouraged sentiment. The composite index rose 6.68 to 1,398.56 in combined turnover of 331m pesos. First Philippine Holdings gained 2.50 pesos to 49.00. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial Index rose 6.28 to 1,332.88 in volume of 41.5m shares, while KUALA LUMPUR's composite index also firmed in quiet trading, up 2.53 at 605.13. BANGKOK finished mixed as the SET index lost 3.03 to 868.68 in turnover of Bt8.50bn, the lowest daily level in a month. Bangkok Land was the most active stock, ending unchanged at Bt132 in turnover of Bt501.4m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Man-na (3769 2581 1226): "Liu </F> Zhongli Says Land Value Added Tax Must Be Levied"]    [Text] Mainland Finance Minister Liu Zhongli yesterday  disclosed for the first time the principles of the land value  added tax [VAT], which feature one and the same tax policy for  investors from outside the borders and domestic investors. Yuan  Zheng, director of the Guangdong Provincial State Land  Department, said that a unified tax rate will deter foreign  businessmen from coming to Guangdong and inland cities to  develop property markets, adding that Guangdong will consider  taking emergency measures.    Liu Zhongli, who is also director of the State General  Administration of Taxation, announced yesterday the three  principles for the land VAT. 1) The land VAT tax shall be  levied and equal treatment will be given to investor outside and  inside the borders. 2) The same tax law shall be applied to all  areas of the mainland. And 3) the government will take opinions  of various localities into consideration and formulate  appropriate detailed regulations and rules for enforcing the law.    In an interview with this reporter through the trunk-line  exchange last night, Yuan Zheng said: "Under Guangdong's land  VAT policy, which was introduced earlier, the tax rate ranges  from 20 to 60 percent. To lower property prices, the Shenzhen  government has raised the rate to 60 or even 100 percent. If  the land VAT is fixed at 50 percent as required by the central  government, it will be a blessing for Shenzhen, because the  national tax rate is lower than the local one. But the 50  percent tax rate will have a fairly big adverse impact on other  areas in the province, especially areas in northern Guangdong,  because the national rate, which is higher than local ones,  means a greater burden for investors and thus prevents them from  investing in the real estate industry in poor areas."    Yuan continue: "As the land VAT will go to local funds, we  hope the central government will listen to our opinion and grant  us greater authority in enforcing the tax law so that we can  implement the law flexibly in accordance with actual conditions.  When the detailed regulations and rules for implementing the  tax law are published, we will take emergency measures after  study."    Asked if the land VAT policy, which treats domestic and  foreign investors alike, will deter foreign businessmen from  investing in Guangdong's real estate industry, Yuan said:  "Guangdong presently gives equal treatment to foreign and  domestic investors in collecting land gain fees, so it is fair  to apply to them the same land VAT rate. For foreign property  developers, the matters uppermost in their minds are local  investment environment and the rate of return on investment  rather than the tax policy. Of course too high a tax rate will  dampen their enthusiasm."    Yuan continued: "Guangdong's real estate industry has  developed rather rapidly, the land VAT policy will probably slow  down the pace. The land of which the service life was  transferred last year totaled 256,000 mu (excluding land  transferred by administrative means), of which 128,000 were for  property development. Last year, foreign businessmen invested  in 577 projects related to property development with a  contracted amount of $14.87 billion. Also last year, land used  by foreign businessmen stood at 68,000 mu, most of which was  developed by businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 1993,  Guangdong's land revenues hit 11 billion yuan, up 17 percent  from the previous year. This year Guangdong will reduce land  for property development by 10 percent and will concentrate  funds and land on 33 major capital construction projects."    Yuan pointed out: "Since Guangdong borders on Hong Kong and  Macao, it has an edge over other provinces in selling houses to  overseas buyers. As Guangdong enjoys a higher economic growth  rate than many other provinces, the coastal cities in Guangdong  will remain superior to other provinces in introducing foreign  funds for property development after the unified land VAT law  comes into effect."</p>

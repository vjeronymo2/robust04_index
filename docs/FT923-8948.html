			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Recall plan urged for danger goods THE Consumers' Association called for the government yesterday to introduce a mechanism for recalling dangerous goods after an elderly widow in Sheffield died when her faulty washer-drier machine burst into flames. Thousands of other householders are at risk from the Candy Turbomatic washing machine, model 38d - but there is no means of contacting them directly. About 42,000 of the faulty machines have been sold in the UK, of which only 6,700 have been recalled to have the fault fixed. Kelco, the distributor of the Italian-made machine, based in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, put advertisements in national newspapers last year warning of the dangers but had only a limited response. Yesterday, the company said a fresh bid to trace owners of the washer-driers would be made next week with more advertisements placed. The Consumers' Association has received 21 complaints about the machine, 12 of which have involved serious fires. Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer affairs minister, said it was 'shocking' that there was no official mechanism to alert people of the danger. He proposed establishment of a national register of addresses of customers who had bought particular products. Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said anyone who had bought one of the machines should telephone freephone 0800 373240 for advice.</p>

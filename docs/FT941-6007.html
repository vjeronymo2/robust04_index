			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Aluminium shines for fund managers - The stock has reflected the commodity's price rise this year Mutual fund managers have taken a shine to North American aluminium stocks as the next, and best, undervalued market in the commodities sector. While copper and gold prices appreciated sharply last year, aluminium lagged, depressed by worldwide overcapacity. This year, however, the price of aluminium is already up 25 per cent, and share prices have been reflecting this advance, although some of the shine is beginning to wear off. Alcoa, the world's largest and lowest-cost aluminium producer, for instance, saw a 10 per cent rise in its share price during February, hitting a 12-month high of Dollars 82, despite reporting a fourth-quarter loss. The share prices of other top producers, including Reynolds Metals and Canada's Alcan, also rose to highs, even though they have not had a profitable quarter in more than a year. Bulls argue that aluminium demand is certain to rise as the US economy strengthens, and that aluminium shares serve as inflation hedges in portfolios heavily weighted to financial instruments. Some analysts, however, have been counselling caution. Much of this year's appreciation in aluminium shares came as investors anticipated the international understanding reached in Brussels in February by the world's biggest aluminium producers. The producing countries agreed to cut worldwide output by at least 1.5m tonnes as they sought to bring aluminium supply and demand back into balance after years of overproduction, a flood of Russian exports, and soaring inventories. While the agreement provides the basis for optimism in an industry in the trough of a five-year recession, many securities analysts believe the run on aluminium stocks has been overdone. Mr J. Clarence Morrison, an analyst for Prudential Securities, recommends clients hold their aluminium shares, but not make new purchases. He is sceptical that the Brussels understanding, which involves voluntary cuts by five big producing regions of the world, will ever be fully implemented. 'Sixty per cent of all the world's aluminium smelters are government or quasi-government controlled,' Mr Morrison says, 'Many are instruments of national policy', which makes real cuts hard to sustain. He says aluminium output cuts have historically turned into a sort of worldwide shell game, with producers in one region boosting production when cuts are announced in another region of the world. Mr Vahid Fathi, senior metals analyst at Kemper Securities, puts it more bluntly. The Brussels understanding 'has the appearance of a cartel, and all cartels cheat at the end of the day', he says. 'I don't believe in all the hoopla,' says Mr Fathi. 'Hedge funds and hot money have been moving into aluminium in the wake of the understanding, but there is very little to justify the price increases.' He points out that Alcoa is currently priced at 160 times earnings. Even assuming the most optimistic circumstances - where aluminium demand strengthened and the US economy improved - Mr Fathi says aluminium shares are overvalued. Assuming the price of aluminium did rise to 85 cents per pound in 1997, from the current 58 cents, Mr Fathi calculates that Alcoa is trading at 20 times projected 1997 earnings. Using the same model, Reynolds' share price, at Dollars 54, is 23 times expected earnings three years from now; Alcan is priced 20 times earnings; and Alumax, recently spun off from the Cyprus/Amax merger, is 25 times earnings. Analysts say that while the fundamentals do not support the aluminium share price increases, fund managers have been so anxious to buy cyclical stocks that they have willingly inflated prices. In aluminium, their influence is magnified because the industry's capitalisation is small, and indeed minute compared with the Dollars 25bn US mutual funds have to invest. Ms Amy Gassman, a metals analysts with Goldman Sachs, says the result will be a very volatile and Opec-like market. 'Prices will rise when we get evidence of supply cuts, and fall when inventory drawdowns are slower than expected,' she says.</p>

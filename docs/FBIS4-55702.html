			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There will be a change of personnel in the  leadership of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] after the  second round because there is a need for new faces in the party.  This will be decided at the party's national convention, Peter  Boross has said at an MDF press briefing. Levente Sukosd  reports:    [Sukosd] There will be no hidden or destroyed papers in the  ministries and government offices. The registered [iktatott]  files are stored and safeguarded and thus will be accessible to  the next government, Prime Minister Peter Boross said. [passage  omitted]    One of the mistakes of the existing government, for example,  was its excessively strict implementation of the bankruptcy law,  the prime minister said, adding: One should not just charge  headlong at the economy. [passage omitted]    The expectations of the electorate are impossible to fulfill  and this will become clear in the near future. All that has  happened was inevitable -- people have been disappointed in  their illusions and now they have new illusions, Prime Minister  Peter Boross said. I am not interested in a position, he said,  but he added that he is willing to continue work within the  party.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'SOPHIE'S PLACE' DELIGHTFUL BUT DEMANDING  </P> <P> Larry Jordan's delightful, confounding and highly demanding 90-minute animated  "Sophie's Place," which Filmforum presents tonight at 8, takes its title from  Istanbul's vast and ancient St. Sophia's Cathedral, now a museum. Jordan states  that the Greek word philosophia means to love wisdom, and the film seems to  express Jordan's pursuit of it. In production for five years, "Sophie's Place"  is a collage of brightly hued cutouts from Victorian prints, and it has the  charm of an old Valentine. Yet its imagery is actually tantalizingly complex,  and the film unfolds like a Dali-esque dream with continually mutating and  repeated motifs of many things, in particular: butterflies; a sad, androgynous  face painted on a quaint balloon, and all manner of phenomena emerging from tea  cups. The entire film is said to be spontaneous, unplanned and unedited. Jordan  will appear in person.

Unjustly neglected among Wyler's fine literary  adaptations, it emerges as a sweeping, period-perfect, ill-fated romance in  which Olivier's successful middle-aged Chicago restaurateur throws his life  away for Jennifer Jones' naive but ambitious country girl. Daringly, Dreiser  suggested that life in a sweatshop could be a worse fate for an unskilled young  girl than being a "fallen woman." Information: (213) 857-6010.  </P> <P> Among the weekend offerings in the UCLA Film Archive's "Cinecitta: Fifty  Years") are Bernardo Bertolucci's 1982 "Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man," which  screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Theater, and Giuseppe Bertolucci's  1985 "Secrets, Secrets," screening Sunday after the 7:30 p.m. presentation of  Nanni Moretti's "The Mass Is Over" (1985).  </P> <P> For its first 90 minutes, the two-hour "Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man" seems like  a conventional TV movie, in which the son of a self-made Parma cheese magnate  (Ugo Tognazzi) and his elegant French wife (Anouk Aimee) is kidnaped. Then,  suddenly, everything falls into place, making clear that what has concerned  Bernardo Bertolucci uppermost is not politics and plot but psychology and human  nature.  </P> <P> Giuseppe Bertolucci's superb, enigmatic "Secrets, Secrets" features seven of  Italy's most vibrant and beautiful actresses from three different generations.  It is at once an observation of mother-daughter relationships and of  camaraderie between very different women. Although warm and expansive in the  Italian tradition, it traces the tragic domino effect of one act of political  terrorism. Bertolucci does not judge the film's terrorists or even seem at all  interested in their motives, but instead presents terrorism as a fact of life  in contemporary Italy.  </P> <P> The film's central figure is the rich, aristocratic Laura (Lina Sastri, who  resembles the young Irene Papas), who not only assassinates a judge in a  deserted Venetian square, but also coolly guns down one of her own followers,  perceiving him a weak link in her gang. We discover the impact of his death  upon his gorgeous, devoted half-sister Rosa (Giulia Boschi) and her mother  (played by an ever-radiant Rosanna Podesta, who once played Helen of Troy).  </P> <P> It's hard to reconcile Laura, the cold-blooded killer, with the charming,  considerate woman she is with her own mother (Lea Massari), with whom she  shares a spacious flat. She is even patient with her mother's self-absorbed  friend (Stefania Sandrelli), who is recovering from a suicide attempt. Only  Laura's childhood nanny (a majestic Alida Valli) senses that Laura is not what  she seems. Yet another mother-daughter combination is that of a judge  (Mariangela Melato) and her small child.  </P> <P> Giuseppe Bertolucci, whose direction of actresses is as masterful as that of  George Cukor, seems as gifted as his older brother Bernardo (with whom he wrote  "1900" and "Luna"). "Secrets, Secrets" may be a commentary upon the effects of  public acts upon private lives, but it is first of all a gallery of luminous  portraits of women.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback as interest rate hopes dwindle - Market Report Disappointing inflation data for last month badly upset the UK stock market yesterday, reversing an initial attempt by London to follow other European bourses in a favourable response to the latest developments in the global interest rate drama. In early trading, the FT-SE Index was 23 points ahead, encouraged by bond market firmness following the overnight statement from the US Federal Reserve and then by a significant easing in repos rates at the Bundesbank tender yesterday morning. But the FT-SE Index closed 46.2 down at a new low for the year of 3,155.3. Both gilt-edged and equities went heavily into reverse at mid-morning on news that the UK retail price index showed a 0.6 per cent gain last month, against market expectations of an increase of only 0.4 per cent. The news was interpreted as a severe blow to the already dwindling hopes for the cut in UK base rates keenly sought by the stock market as a counter influence to the increases in personal and VAT taxes which will hit UK consumers' pockets next month. Successive waves of selling in the stock index futures sector destroyed share prices. Selling pressure increased towards the close as investors weighed the likelihood that the credit tightening indicated on Tuesday by the Federal Reserve will not be the end of the matter. Some London analysts warned that Federal Funds Rate could move to 4 per cent, or even 5 per cent in the near future. During the second half of the session, London effectively separated itself from the other European markets which were buoyed by hopes that their domestic interest rates can be reduced under the lead of the Bundesbank. The UK was seen as closer to the US in terms of economic cycle, with inflation pressure not far away. Nervousness increased as both the stock and futures markets fell through support levels and into what looked dangerously like free fall territory. At least one large London trading house was a heavy seller of the Footsie index future yesterday, and pressures from the derivatives markets were enhanced by a buy programme in equities in early trading. Traders stressed that futures markets are now exerting even greater pressure on the underlying stock market than that seen when share prices were rising. Although the interest largely focused around the Footsie-listed stocks, this afforded little protection to the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed 27.9 off at 3,825.2. Across the full range of the market, trading volume of 714.2m shares was around 5 per cent up on the previous session, when retail, or customer, business in equities returned a total worth of Pounds 1.56bn. The stock market closed in a very subdued mood, with traders expecting equities to remain nervous for the rest of this week, which will bring important money supply data from Germany as well as unemployment claims figures from the US. But the key to the stock market remains the government bond sector, which proved again that it is itself highly nervous, and also capable of outweighing any trends developed in the equity market. Company features also turned less encouraging, with Wellcome falling sharply ahead of the trading statement due today and Glaxo under further pressure. However, Barratt Developments, the housebuilder, joined other companies to have raised dividend payments this week.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS SENDS '60 MINUTES' TO RATINGS WIN  </P> <P> Bad news in the Persian Gulf has been good news for "60 Minutes," which landed  in the top spot in the ratings last week, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The first 14 1/2 minutes of the program were devoted to the Persian Gulf,  including Dan Rather's interview with the Iraqi foreign minister, footage shot  during an earlier piece on Kuwait, some of it previously unshown, and updates  from "60 Minutes" anchors Mike Wallace, Morley Safer and Steve Kroft.  </P> <P> "60 Minutes" has been in second place for the last two weeks.  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had Americans watching more network news than  network entertainment -- the three-network share of the total television pie  was 59% for the three evening news programs, but only 54% for prime-time shows.  </P> <P> ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings was in the No. 1 spot for the  32nd consecutive week with a 9.7 rating and a 21 share.  </P> <P> NBC won the weekly ratings race but boasted only three shows -- "Cheers,"  "Empty Nest" and "Unsolved Mysteries" -- in the top 10, which last week was  actually the top 11 because of a tie for 10th place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP TV SHOWS  </P> <P> Top programs for the week ending Sunday, Aug. 19, according to the A.C.

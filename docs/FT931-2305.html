			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Rating recovery The feeling that interest rates have stopped falling grew stronger this week. Retail sales, building society figures and yesterday's inflation statistics all added to the picture of a frail but gathering recovery. Even the bizarre fall in unemployment and the rise in sterling lent support. The Budget speech also suggested that the government is less panicky about growth, and Mr Lamont looks like a man quietly waiting for something to turn up. With rates stuck at 6 per cent - at least for a while - the gilt market may have to give up some ground. It has been travelling hopefully in the expectation of ever-lower rates, and yields, particularly at short maturities, now look too low. Indeed, if the chancellor seriously intends the banks and building societies to help him fund the Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement he will need a bigger gap between base rates and three-year gilt yields. That leaves equities relying on recovery rather than lower rates for support. Hopes of growth will certainly prop up UK cyclical stocks, and the market as a whole may manage earnings growth of 20 per cent in 1993. High yielding shares with good dividend cover may also benefit, as pension fund managers look for opportunities to claw back the dividend credits they have lost to the chancellor. But companies with large continental businesses look more vulnerable. The downturn there is going to be deep and prolonged, as even the Bundesbank seems grudgingly to concede.</p>

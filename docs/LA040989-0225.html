			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER VACATIONS  </P> <P> Summer, that sweetest of seasons, soon will cast its spell upon the land . . .  while the nagging we know as wanderlust takes its annual toll. Rivers will rush  through gorges and glacial valleys, and breezes will scatter summer's fragrance  . . . apple blossoms and honeysuckle and new-mown hay.  </P> <P> Vacationers will motor to the seashore and mountains and to ranches from  Washington to Wyoming and Maine to Minnesota, where darkness will bring out the  spectacle of a near-for-gotten Milky Way. Others will stroll along towpaths  beside the Delaware and raft down rivers boiling with white water.  </P> <P> Summer is a time for rediscovering rural America with its white-steepled  churches, endless plains and rolling hills. Vacationers will cast for trout and  explore miles of forested land while eagles wheel overhead and the chorus of  crickets rises like the echo from a childhood dream.  </P> <P> Those arriving from the city will find solace in country inns, their prize  being an elusive peace and a turn-of-the-century hospitality reflecting a  former America.  </P> <P> Small-town America. New England villages will come into focus as motorists  cross covered bridges and pass mile after mile of weathered barns scattered  across hills as verdant as rain-fresh Ireland. Summer in America means salmon  rivers rushing headlong into the Pacific . . . concerts on the green . . .  apple orchards and wind-blown grass.  </P> <P> Along the coast the sea will turn white with sails and youngsters will sculpt  sandcastles while sandpipers run with the tide.  </P> <P> Others will be lured to destinations far from these shores: Restless souls will  jet off to fashionable Portofino for an espresso at La Stella and to the  sidewalk cafes of St. Tropez . . . the bazaars of Hong Kong . . . the temples  of Thailand . . . the open reaches of Australia and New Zealand.  </P> <P> It is to the summer traveler that we dedicate our section today.

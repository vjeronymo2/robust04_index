			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 10 SAPA -- A large portion of the  inauguration crowd at the Union Building amphitheatre  spontaneously chanted "Castro, Castro" as the aged Cuban leader  appeared in uniform to join foreign dignitaries. His was one of  the last foreign leaders to take his seat at the foot of the  podium, where President-elect Nelson Mandela was due to be sworn  in minutes later.    Fidel Castro stood erect and without a cap and waved  recognition to the crowd as the chanting spread from one wing of  the amphitheatre to the other.</p>

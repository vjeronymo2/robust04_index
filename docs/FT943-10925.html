			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Xerox advances 50% to Dollars 168m in second quarter Net income at Xerox, the US document processing company, jumped 50 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 168m, or a fully diluted Dollars 1.28 a share. In the same quarter a year ago, earnings were Dollars 112m, or 94 cents a share. The strong second quarter took first-half net income to Dollars 297m, or Dollars 2.31 a share, compared with Dollars 301m, or Dollars 2.61, in 1993. The company said earnings per share growth did not match income growth as the number of shares outstanding rose during the quarter following a public offering of 8.1m shares. An 11 per cent increase in equipment sales to Dollars 1.15bn, and continued productivity improvements were behind the impressive growth in quarterly income, said Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief execu-tive. Productivity has been rising because of a restructuring plan recently implemented by Xerox which aims to reduce the company's worldwide workforce by more than 10,000 by early 1996. The growth in equipment sales, meanwhile, is expected to lead to increased service and supplies revenues.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jerome Monod, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez CEO </F> and president of the European Roundtable of Manufacturers, by  Colette Menguy; place and date not given: "Ambitious Program  Will Create Jobs Immediately"]    [Text] [Menguy] The ERT (European Round Table of  Manufacturers), which you chair, favors the implementation of  the European infrastructure program proposed by the European  Commission in its white paper. What are your motives?    [Monod] As early as 1984, the ERT had drawn the attention of  political and economic circles to the need to give a new start  to infrastructure building in Europe. Today, the ERT is  completing a report on major East-West infrastructures. The  report looks at road, rail, and airport networks, large pipeline  systems, major energy transmission systems, and lists -- without  defining them rigidly on a map -- essential pathways likely to  connect at once the economy, people, and ideas. There will, of  course, be a chapter on telecommunications and electronic  highways between East and West Europe.    [Menguy] So you believe that the time has come to invest in  infrastructure?    [Monod] The times are quite ripe for such new projects. In  the current context, recovery measures taken jointly at the  European level would give a new lease on life to European  economies, which have become too interdependent for a single  country to reap much benefit from isolated measures. This is a  unique opportunity to build infrastructure directed at Central  and East European countries. The best way to accelerate trade  with these countries is to anchor them to the European Union.    [Menguy] How do manufacturers view the program?    [Monod] Manufacturers throughout Europe are very keen on  this program of physical and realized connections, because they  believe it is an essential ingredient for growth. And, above  all, it should create new jobs quickly.    [Menguy] Immediately?    [Monod] Yes. This is because the programs are ready. Out  of the 26 projects listed by the Commission, some can be  initiated without delay, which means that they can create jobs  right away.    [Menguy] Is implementation of this program so slow because  of funding difficulties?    [Monod] Funding is available. The problem is a lack of will  to achieve things at the European level. This is a matter of  national selfishness; everybody is only interested in what  benefits them directly. To be sure, the most widespread notion  is that the program will put pressure on national budgets.    This is both true and untrue. None or very few of these  projects can be achieved without a degree of intervention from  national or European authorities. Funding can be arranged in  many ways, be it through state-guaranteed loans, mixed funding  with the European Investment Bank or the EBRD [European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development], where East Europe is concerned,  or revenue guarantees for concession projects. There is also an  idea put forward by Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's former president:  issuing bonds modeled after the Eurobonds popular in the United  States; such bonds could be guaranteed by the European  Community, but would draw on international investment (from  European countries as well as others). I will also mention the  Eurotunnel experience, a gigantic undertaking which was funded  through more than 100 banks as well as private investors.</p>

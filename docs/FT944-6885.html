			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Direct tax cuts find little favour - Chris Tighe and Stuart Dalby discover few people expecting good news in tomorrow's Budget The chancellor may be heartened to learn that according to a cross-section of people contacted by the Financial Times, the public does not expect much good news in tomorrow's Budget. Mr David Rist, marketing director of the British Shoe Corporation, responsible for the Hush Puppy shoes Mr Kenneth Clarke wears, said consumers remained cautious and were not spending. He said: 'It would be nice if the chancellor could make a gesture which would boost confidence. But I simply cannot see it. Tax cuts are simply not on the agenda.' Mr Paul Handley, finance director of Mansfield Brewery, the beer-drinking chancellor's local brewer, said: 'We are constantly told the economy is coming out of recession but the consumer has still got to come out of the closet. People are still worried about their mortgages, their jobs.' Our interviewees, whose reactions to the Budget we will report on Wednesday, include chief executives, small businessmen, a farmer, a pensioner, a writer and an unemployed man in Britain's worst unemployment blackspot. Most disliked the idea of further cuts in direct taxation, if the price to be paid was increases in indirect tax. Ms Sara Gibb, a Lloyd's Name and administrative secretary of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said: 'I object to the idea of taxation by stealth. We are led to believe that because personal tax bands are changed we are going to be better off. But in fact any gains are offset by huge increases in indirect taxes.' Value added tax on fuel remains particularly unpopular. Mr Richard Woodall, superstore manager at Asda in Norwich, said that the government would be unwise to make any increase in VAT or any other indirect taxes because of consumers' nervousness. Those involved in business were keen to see encouragement for capital investment. Mr Robin Saxby, chief executive of microchip company Advance Risc Machines of Cambridge, favoured lower corporation tax and the return of 100 per cent first-year depreciation allowances for capital spending. Mr Richard Butler, a 44-year-old Tory voter who farms 1,500 acres in Wiltshire, wanted more generous capital allowances on investment in farm buildings and machinery. Mr John Jermine, chairman of Chesterfield mining concern NSM, wanted increased capital allowances for companies. But Mr Jermine, who described himself as a high Tory, did not want any cut in direct taxes. He said: 'I think direct taxes are low enough. We are competitive with other countries. A lot needs to be done in areas like the country's infrastructure.' Others warmed to the theme of cost-saving through greater government efficiency. Mr Bertie Grotian, a former army officer who runs a marquee hiring company, said: 'If you look at the Ministry of Defence there must be one bureaucrat for every soldier. There is plenty of scope for cuts in the inflated bureaucracies.' Ms Leisha Fullich, director of education for the London borough of Lewisham, said: 'I am not saying I favour increases in public spending but something does need to be done about the environment and education.' Employers are interested in the chancellor's National Insurance intentions. Mr Richard Sayer, a Northumberland estate agent who employs eight people, said: 'Any increase in NI contributions would be crushingly bad.' Some, including Mr Sayer, would welcome tax cuts. But Mr Peter Chapman, an unemployed South Shields design engineer and Mr Alastair Fyfe, duty control manager for European Passenger Services, backed tax increases if the money were to be used to support key services, notably the National Health Service. Mr Chapman is a Labour party member, Mr Fyfe a potential Liberal Democrat voter. Mr Grotian, who pays himself Pounds 21,000 a year, employs five full-timers and 10 casuals in the summer, said: 'After taxes and emergency taxes, it is not worth an unemployed person working. He or she is better off on the dole.' Government policy stability was a key concern. Mr Andrew Pimblett, managing director of crane manufacturer Street Cranes, which employs 150 people, would like to see manufacturing helped. 'But I do not want anything short-term. The last thing we need is another boom and bust,' he said. As an exporter he would prefer interest rates not to change. And Mr Sayer warned that any rise could give out the wrong messages. He said: 'The mortgage interest rate isn't so critical as the world thinks. What is far more critical is the way the public interprets any change.' Mr Sayer spoke for many in saying mortgage interest tax relief was no longer a big issue, since its value in real terms had already been whittled down. Any glimmer of hope focused on reduced duties on beer, wine, spirits and tobacco to counter cheap cross-Channel imports. Mr Handley at Mansfield Brewery said he would welcome such a move. But for Mr Michael Watson, a Newcastle tobacconist, no conceivable reduction could close the gap of almost 300 per cent between his prices and those of 'smuggled tobacco' sold in local pubs and clubs. Mr Chapman said: 'What will be needed from this Budget is something to give people encouragement and hope.' But he isn't holding his breath.

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  BACK TO BASICS: FOR FRESH PINEAPPLE CHOOSE PLUMP, FIRM FRUIT WITH SWEET AROMA  </P> <P> When choosing a fresh pineapple, select fruit that's plump and firm with fresh  green leaves in the crown. The pineapple should have a sweet aroma, and no mold  or soft spots.  </P> <P> Shell color is not a good sign of maturity -- some pineapple varieties remain  green even when they are fully ripe. And forget pulling leaves out of the  crown; ease of extraction is not an indication of either ripeness or quality.  </P> <P> Once a pineapple is harvested from the plant, it will not ripen any further. It  will change color, get soft and the leaves will fall out, but these are signs  of old age, not ripeness. The fruit should be used as soon as possible after  purchase but may be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated three to five days.  </P> <P> There are numerous ways to prepare fresh pineapple. The following method is an  easy way of cutting chunks, spears and wedges.  </P> <P> Step 1. Using a long, sharp knife, cut the pineapple in half lengthwise from  the bottom through the crown. Repeat, cutting pineapple into quarters.  </P> <P> Step 2. Trim the strip of hard core from the top of each quarter. Then cut the  fruit away from the shell. A curved pineapple knife is ideal for this step but  a sturdy grapefruit knife or standard serrated knife may be used.  </P> <P> Step 3. Cut the fruit into chunks, wedges or spears. Remove the fruit or use  the shell as a serving container.  </P> <P> A reminder: Fresh pineapple contains the enzyme bromelin, which breaks down  protein. Used in marinades it helps tenderize meats, but it also prevents  gelatin from setting. The enzyme is destroyed by cooking, so canned pineapple  may be used in gelatin salads and desserts.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

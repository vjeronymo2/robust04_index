			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by TANJUG correspondent Savo Jankovic from Knin] </F>   [Text] The first plenary session of the first regular  meeting of the assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK]  concluded this afternoon by electing members of seven  parliamentary committees. The unanimous election of the  commission members was preceded by the consultations held by the  heads of caucuses, where a complete coordination was reached  about the (?composition) of the committees, something that  Assembly Chairman Branko (Vodnjica) stated with pleasure at the  beginning of the afternoon part of the session. Immediately  after the assembly committees were constituted, the first  constitutive sessions of some of them were held while the  remaining committees will do that by tomorrow morning.    The second plenary session is expected in the afternoon,  which will most probably discuss the Krajina negotiatory  platform in the peace process, amendments to which were  initiated by President Milan Martic. By the way, at the morning  part of the session today, Martic presented a report on the  current political and security situation in Krajina. One may  expect the plenary session [tomorrow] to discuss Martic's speech  and there is also the possibility of the government submitting  its report on the same topic. Moreover, the government is  expected to submit a proposal on legal documents or ordinances  regarding Krajina joining the united balance of payments with  the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], monetary  reconstruction, and economic recovery.</p>

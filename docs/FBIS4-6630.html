			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai returned from Malaysia  this evening. Talking to reporters upon his arrival at Don  Muang Airport, he said that his talks with the Malaysian prime  minister on issues of common interest proceeded in a good  atmosphere.    [Begin recording] [Chuan] In brief, I held talks with the  Malaysian prime minister on bilateral cooperation, such as  cooperation in the field of communications linking Thailand and  Malaysia and this region and the issue of the proposed East  Asian Economic Caucus. The Malaysian prime minister explained  details of the proposal. The foreign minister briefed the  Malaysian side on the results of his trip to Burma and the  Malaysian prime minister agreed with Thailand's plan to invite  Burma to attend the upcoming ASEAN ministerial meeting to be  held in Thailand in July. Other miscellaneous issues were also  discussed. The meeting proceeded in a good atmosphere. The  launch of the Malaysian-Thai Joint Authority sets a good example  for other countries to follow.    [Unidentified correspondent] Did Malaysia raise the issue of  Cambodian accusations against Thailand during the meeting?    [Chuan] No, nobody is interested in this issue.    [Unidentified correspondent] So you did not mention anything  about this.    [Chuan] No, we have nothing to talk about. We discussed  only the main issues such as bilateral cooperation. We  emphasized cooperation in the triangle economic development  between Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Private sectors of  the two countries have made progress in this regard. We will  get a clear direction for this project when the Asian  Development Bank completes its study for the project in the next  two or three months. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIGN OF GROWING TIES BETWEEN NATIONS' FORCES;  </P> <P> 3 U.S. WARSHIPS IN SHANGHAI FOR A VISIT  </P> <P> Three U.S. Navy ships sailed into Shanghai for a courtesy call Friday, one day  after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited China's biggest city.  </P> <P> The 18,200-ton command ship Blue Ridge, flying the U.S. and Chinese flags and  with its crew lining the deck, led the way up the Huangpu River, mooring  several hundred yards from the Soviet Consulate.  </P> <P> The 620-foot flagship was accompanied by the guided missile frigates Sterett  and Rodney M. Davis, one of the Navy's newest.  </P> <P> They were welcomed by Nie Kuiju, commander of the Chinese navy's East China Sea  Fleet, a brass band and a naval honor guard.  </P> <P> Western sources said the port call, the second by U.S. warships to China since  the Communist revolution in 1949, was originally scheduled for Thursday,  pointedly timed to coincide with the arrival of the Kremlin leader. But the  visit was delayed to avoid damaging the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years,  the sources said.  </P> <P> "American sailors, I haven't seen American sailors in years," marveled a  70-year-old Shanghai man, nudging his wife to steal a glance as a group of  white-uniformed sailors melted into a sea of Chinese pro-democracy protesters.  </P> <P> U.S. officials called the visit a sign of growing ties between the armed forces  of the two countries, which established diplomatic relations in 1979.  </P> <P> "This marks another step in a continuing series that promotes cooperation  between our two navies," Vice Adm. Henry W. Mauz Jr., commander of the 7th  Fleet, told reporters at a news conference aboard the Blue Ridge.  </P> <P> U.S. warships called on the Chinese port of Qingdao in 1986, and the Chinese  navy paid a visit to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii last month.  </P> <P> The ships passed almost unnoticed by tens of thousands of Chinese students and  workers who poured into the streets along Shanghai's waterfront for the third  consecutive day in a campaign for democracy and political reform.  </P> <P> The Americans have been told to avoid demonstrations, even though they have  been entirely peaceful.  </P> <P> During their three-day visit, the 1,600 sailors and officers will participate  in a series of discussions and exchanges with their Chinese counterparts and  even face off in soccer and basketball.  </P></p>

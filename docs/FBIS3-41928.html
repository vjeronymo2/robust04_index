			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Dec 22 (CTK) -- Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin ``emphatically,'' requested Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec during his visit to Israel last week that the Czech  Republic not supply any nuclear power components to Iran, not  even components considered useful exclusively for peaceful  purposes, Israeli Ambassador to Czech Republic Moshe Yegar told  CTK today.    He added that any deliveries to Iran having to do with  nuclear energy are extraordinarily dangerous.    While in Israel, Zieleniec denied that any Czech exports to  Iran could be used for non-peaceful purposes.    The Israeli Government's request to the Czech Republic is  justified by the ``terrorist'' nature of the contemporary regime  in Iran, the ambassador explained. He said Iran wants to obtain  nuclear weapons ``at any cost,'' and references to allegedly  peaceful uses of nuclear power are only excuses to attain that  goal.    Nuclear potential in Iran would be ``an extraordinary and  alarming danger'' for the entire near east, Yegar warned.    The Czech company Skoda Plzen, which has experience in  building nuclear power plants, admitted last week that its  director had visited Teheran in November allegedly to discuss  ``supplies of parts for a nuclear power plant.''    The American daily THE NEW YORK TIMES reported that  according  to American intelligence services, Iran has engaged in a secret  program for the production of nuclear weapons. The paper said  that Americans fear that Czech civil supplies could help Iran to  obtain nuclear waste, which it could then transform into  plutonium, the main component in nuclear explosives.</p>

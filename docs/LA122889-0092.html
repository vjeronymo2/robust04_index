			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOMOSEXUAL CATHOLICS WHO KEEP THE FAITH AND LIFE STYLE;  </P> <P> RELIGION: WORSHIPERS STRUGGLE TO REMAIN PART OF A CHURCH WHOSE LEADERS DO NOT  CONDONE THEIR ACTIVITIES.  </P> <P> The issue is the Roman Catholic Church's views on homosexuality and AIDS.  </P> <P> On one side is the Church hierarchy. Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony has  banned priests from saying Mass for an organization of gay and lesbian  Catholics, condemned a San Fernando High School health clinic program for gay  teen-agers and declared that chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the  only "morally correct and medically secure way" to prevent the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> On the other side are politically active gay and Lesbian Catholics who  demonstrate against church officialdom, maintaining that they should be  included in church activities and that "safe sex" is medically and morally  sound. This month the issue heated up when an underground group of dissenters  defaced four Los Angeles County churches and distributed posters declaring  Mahony to be a murderer.  </P> <P> Stuck in the middle are the practicing gay and lesbian Catholics who are not  actively protesting and who do not wish to give up their association with the  church.  </P> <P> "At times you feel sort of like an undercover agent," said Rick, who lives in  the Thousand Oaks area and did not, like most of the gay Catholics interviewed  for this article, want his last name to be printed. He attends Mass at his  local church every Sunday.  </P> <P> Rick used to belong to Dignity, a national organization with about 5,000  members that sponsors Masses for gay men and lesbians. Last year, Mahony  followed the lead of church officials in other parts of the country by banning  Dignity from holding services in church facilities. Then, in June, he declared  that priests could not administer Mass to Dignity groups in any venue. Rick's  local chapter of Dignity disbanded.  </P> <P> "I left the church for a while in anger but I found that my life was just  generally miserable," Rick said. "I felt the lack of religion in my life."  </P> <P> Rick tried associating with Protestant groups that welcomed homosexuals, but he  did not find them fulfilling. "I don't want to put down those ministers in any  way," he said, "but it just was not a Catholic organization. That's what I,  personally, needed."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles chapter of Dignity still exists and holds meetings at several  locations, including St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in North Hollywood. Indeed,  the Los Angeles chapter celebrates Mass every Sunday, often with a priest  willing to defy Mahony's directive.  </P> <P> "We know priests who are still willing to come and do Mass for us," said Jack  Stafford, president of the Los Angeles chapter of Dignity, which he said has a  membership of about 200. "And if we can't get one for a particular Sunday, a  para-liturgy is done. It's a Mass without a priest, like what is done in areas  where there are priestless congregations."  </P> <P> But their defiance goes only so far. Stafford said he does not know anyone in  the underground group, which calls itself Greater Religious Responsibility,  that took credit for spattered red paint on four area churches, including St.  Charles Church of North Hollywood, in the early hours of Dec. 3, the first  Sunday of Advent.  </P> <P> "I had never even heard of that group before all this happened," Stafford said.  "I understand why it has come to this. When people feel adamant about an issue  and do not feel they are being effective by expressing themselves in words,  they sometimes turn to the kind of acts that occurred."  </P> <P> While he understands the motivation behind GRR's actions, he vehemently  disagrees with them. "What they did was not effective at all," he said. "It  will not get the church to listen. Just the opposite. It is not going to give  us a positive image.  </P> <P> "I am against all acts of violence, and I consider what they did to be  violence, violence against the church and the community. It was an act of  intolerance, and intolerance just breeds intolerance."  </P> <P> Sandy, a member of a Los Angeles Dignity offshoot called Lesbian Catholics  Together, is more sympathetic to GRR. "This archbishop has done nothing for  lesbians and very little for Catholic women in general," she said. "The biggest  problem is that he is spreading such misinformation. It makes it especially  difficult for young people just coming out."  </P> <P> But Sandy, 47, who lives in North Hollywood, has also chosen to stay in the  church. "We have taught ourselves that we are the church," she said. "It's not  some bureaucratic group of men who make pronouncements. It's people like us. We  consider ourselves cultural Catholics, and it would be hard for us to leave, no  matter how conservative the edicts are."  </P> <P> Lesbian Catholics Together meets once a month in members' homes. Sandy said the  group, which has about 25 active members, can usually find a sympathetic priest  to say Mass.  </P> <P> "It is almost like in the early church when they met in people's homes in  secret," she said with a laugh. "But we find that it is important to get  together. We are a support to each other emotionally and we share our  spirituality."  </P> <P> It's not spirituality but sexuality that disturbs the church when it comes to  homosexuals. In his statement banning priests from celebrating Masses sponsored  by Dignity, Mahony reiterated the official church position that "while . . .  homosexual orientation in itself is not to be regarded as a sinful condition .  . . genital activity by unmarried persons, or by married persons without being  open to procreation, is morally wrong."  </P> <P> "I don't follow the church's edicts in that respect any more than some of the  priests do not," Rick said, angrily. "I have had a monogamous, loving  relationship with a man for eight years and we care about each other in a very  special way."  </P> <P> Rick met the man he lives with at a Dignity mass in Ventura County, before that  group dissolved.  </P> <P> "We go to church together every Sunday now, just like any other couple."  </P> <P> Except that in the church they do not acknowledge to other worshipers that they  are a couple. "I guess that there are some places where you cannot be the  person you want to be," Rick said. "I needed the church and I needed to get on  with my life, so this is what I do. It's unfortunate. You want the church to be  a place of warmth and understanding for everyone."  </P> <P> He does not "confess" to homosexual acts to his priest.  </P> <P> "I tried that once, a long time ago," he said. "It was with an older priest. I  hardly started talking about it and he said, 'You don't want to be doing that.'  Then he absolved me from my sins and I was out of there before I hardly knew  what happened. It was not a good experience."  </P> <P> Sandy and her lover also go to church together on occasion. "We used to live in  Tarzana, and in that parish we were pretty much known as a lesbian couple," she  said. "But where we are now, it hasn't really come up."  </P> <P> Eventually, if the arguments about homosexuality and the church continue to  heat up, she said, she might feel compelled to go more public with her views.  </P> <P> "I think if someone said something I really disagreed with, something I found I  could not just let go, I would speak out. I would have to do something."  </P> <P> In the meantime, Stafford advises patience.  </P> <P> "We can do a lot more from inside the church than those who deface it," he  said. "Our time of acceptance will come. This archbishop and this Pope do not  listen to us a lot, now. But they are not in there forever. There will be  others."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> SENATE CANDIDATES SLUG IT OUT OVER FAIR CAMPAIGN PLEDGE  </P> <P> Dueling Pledges: The titans continue to clash in the fair campaign pledge  arena.  </P> <P> This time, Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) -- who already rejected the  pledge proffered by his opponent in the state Senate race -- has come up with  one of his own.  </P> <P> Naturally, Bader's opponent, Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), promptly rejected  it, saying it doesn't go far enough.  </P> <P> Ayala himself had last week asked Bader to join him in pledging that their  campaign mailers would not refer to each other during the last five weeks  before the election in order to prevent last-minute smears. Bader laughed at  that idea, saying that talking about the other candidate's record is what  campaigns are all about.  </P> <P> Bader then drew up his own campaign code, calling for a prohibition on personal  attacks, a cutoff in campaign mailers the Saturday before the election and a  series of six debates between the candidates. Ayala called Bader's proposal "a  thinly disguised protection of his right to do last-minute hit pieces," and  said he will not sign it.  </P> <P> Will the dazzling one-upmanship continue through the Nov. 6 election? Stay  tuned.  </P> <P> Bedtime for Nymeyer: After going into closed session just after midnight  Monday, the Pomona City Council returned to a near-empty council chamber. Most  of the audience had lost interest in the meeting -- or had given up hope that  the council would ever return -- and wisely went home to bed.  </P> <P> Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer apparently wanted to do the same and departed  before the council voted to adjourn. Another councilman, Tomas Ursua, was  dispatched to retrieve Nymeyer, who was headed for his car, so the meeting  could be officially closed. With Nymeyer present, the council voted unanimously  to adjourn at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> County Them Out: Talk of secession continues to ripple through San Gabriel  Valley cities angered by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's redrawing of  supervisorial district lines.  </P> <P> The rhetoric ran high at Tuesday's meeting of the La Verne City Council. A  sample: Councilman Patrick Gatti called Kenyon's decision "judicial rape."  Mayor Pro Tem Thomas Harvey termed it "arrogant." Mayor Jon Blickenstaff said  it appears to be an attempt to "divide and conquer" the valley.  </P> <P> Council members criticized Kenyon for lumping La Verne with such faraway cities  as Palmdale instead of with nearby cities such as Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> Harvey and Councilman Craig Walters suggested that if district lines cannot be  drawn in a fashion more agreeable to La Verne, the city should consider  withdrawing from Los Angeles County to form a new county with other disgruntled  San Gabriel Valley cities.  </P> <P> Short subject: Latest campaign report filings by Democratic officeholders show  that they gave generously from their campaign funds to help Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown defeat the reapportionment initiatives on the June ballot.  Assembly members Sally Tanner of Baldwin Park and Richard Polanco of Los  Angeles, who also represents part of Pasadena, each gave $20,000 to the effort.  </P> <P> Mike Ward, with contributions from Ben Sullivan and Brad Haugaard  </P></p>

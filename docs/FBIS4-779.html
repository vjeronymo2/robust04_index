			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of about 70 Lebowa state officials have  occupied the officers of the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC] in Pretoria. A spokesman for the Health and Education  Workers' Union, NEHAWU, said that the group would stay there  until the TEC management committee had addressed their  grievances.    The group say the situation in Lebowa has deteriorated since  Minister of Regional and Land Affairs Mr. Andre Fourie took over  the administration duties of the territory. They've asked for  Mr. Fourie to be replaced by a neutral administrator and for  their promotions to come into affect immediately.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Private View: A million-dollar convert from Watergate - Chuck Colson, a former dirty tricks expert, explains what it's like to be born again A LIFE filled with irony and paradox is how Charles W. Colson, the former Watergate convict, describes his career. That is putting it mildly. Prince Philip may not have appreciated the irony when at Buckingham Palace this week, on the very day the Royal bugging controversy re-erupted, he found himself presenting Richard Nixon's dirty-tricks expert with the largest cash prize in the world. 'Chuck' Colson received the Templeton Prize, whose previous winners include Mother Teresa, Billy Graham and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. He got a cheque for Pounds 650,000 - nearly Dollars 1m and bigger than any Nobel award - for advancing the world's understanding of God. For Colson is born again. 'It was 20 years ago this summer that I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ,' he told me in his Claridges suite before going to the palace. The former Special Counsel to the President, known as the hatchet man of the White House, was a scholarship boy, tough-guy marine corps infantry commander and high-earning Washington lawyer who played a prominent part in the intrigues that led to America's biggest political scandal and Nixon's resignation in 1974. 'Colson has the balls of a brass monkey,' was Nixon's approving comment. Colson the hard man does not look as if he has gone soft. He is courteous but briskly efficient, loquacious but somewhat passionless. He talks about Jesus with embarrassing familiarity, like a loyal staffer referring to the boss. Has Charles Colson really changed? Or has blind loyalty to Richard Nixon been transmuted into blind loyalty to Jesus Christ? Washington hooted with laughter when Colson announced at the height of the White House scandal that he had found God. But friends do not doubt his sincerity and his record defies disbelief. His is a butch Christianity. Colson served seven months in Maxwell federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, for obstruction of justice and has been visiting prisons ever since. His foundation, Prison Fellowship, has become a worldwide charity which takes the Gospels to jailbirds and campaigns for better conditions. Crime is the result of a moral vacuum, he said this week, and only religion can provide the morality. Liberals wrongly assumed that people were never depraved, only deprived, while conservatives mistakenly argued that force and fear were the real deterrents. And here is the paradox. Colson was very strictly brought up, a nominal Episcopalian, in the puritanical tradition of Boston. His father, of Swedish descent and his mother, of English, 'called themselves Christians in the same way the vast majority of Americans or Britons do. 'My dad used to tell me: 'Whatever you do, never lie.' If I had any distinction, dubious though it may be of going through Watergate, I was the only one of the major figures never charged with perjury.' But where was the voice of his own conscience? Colson, an acknowledged expert in campaign dirty tricks over many years, replied with the rather technical defence that he had known nothing of the burglary and bugging of the Democratic Party offices at Watergate. Like others, he had been 'backed into' the conspiracy of two or three ringleaders. 'There were a lot of rough, tough, ethically borderline political manoeuvres. But in terms of breaking the law . . . I had done four years of law school at nights, graduated top of my class. I wasn't going to jeopardise that - on pragmatic grounds. 'I take full responsibility for helping create the moral climate in the White House that led to Watergate. But I thought I was too shrewd to have done anything that was legally wrong.' In the end he pleaded guilty to leaking to the press the FBI records on Daniel Ellsberg who was awaiting trial for theft of the Pentagon Papers. 'I had seen the ugliest side of politics since 1952 . . . stealing information . . . dirty tricks. It didn't bother me when Nixon said get the dirt on this guy and give it to the papers.' The voice of conscience was stilled by pride and self-righteousness. 'Almost the better educated you are and the more sensitive you are, the more dangerous you are. This is one of the paradoxes of life. 'In college I studied Kant and the Categorical Imperative. I believed that through a rational process you could arrive at the right ethical judgments. And so when I went to the White House - I had a successful law practice and took a large pay cut - I put everything in a blind trust. I would never see anyone I practised law with. If I received Christmas gifts I would give them to the drivers of my limousine . . . 'I, Chuck Colson, with a puritanical background and with a brilliant education, would never be compromised. No way. But I went to jail: which is why I don't believe Kant's Categorical Imperative is a sound basis for ethics. It assumes that by reason you can control your passions. It ignores the fact that human beings have an infinite capacity for self-justification and self-delusion.' You were up to your neck in it, I said. Was your religious conversion a way of escaping responsibility? 'You don't escape responsibility. I suspect if it had not been for my conversion to Christ I wouldn't have gone to prison. In fact I know I wouldn't have.' (Colson claims the original charge against him would have failed and that he provided the prosecutor with another - the Ellsberg leak  -to which he could plead guilty.) Why, then, was his conversion so sudden? Colson said the doubts had begun even before Watergate. When he left the White House in 1973 he had achieved everything he had set out to achieve. 'I'd done all of these things and I sat one day looking out over the south lawn of the White House feeling a terrible emptiness.' He went to see a friend, Tom Phillips, soon to become president of Raytheon, and was startled by his appearance. 'His desk was clear, he was smiling and relaxed. Fifteen minutes into the conversation I said: 'Tom, you've changed, what's happened to you? He said. 'Yes, I have. I have accepted Jesus Christ and committed my life to him.' 'I nearly fell off the chair because I'd never heard anyone talk that way. I thought: what in the world is this man talking about? So I very nervously changed the subject.' Phillips, it transpired, had been to a Billy Graham rally. Later that year Phillips read to Colson a chapter from CS Lewis's Mere Christianity on the sin of pride. 'I was deeply affected because I recognised my own sin as I never had before. Tom Phillips wanted me to pray with him that night, but I couldn't. I left and went to my automobile in the driveway. Patty (Colson's second wife) and I were heading off on a week's holiday and I couldn't drive out of the driveway because I was crying too hard to get the keys into the ignition. 'I sat there probably for an hour, praying the first honest prayers I had ever prayed in my life. I said: 'If you're true, Jesus, I want to know you.' I never normally showed emotion. I was embarrassed. But I got up next day and felt wonderful.' What did your wife think? 'She was astounded because she is a life-long Roman Catholic and far more religious than I am - was. I think she was terrified at first.' When people laughed at you - some probably still do - you can understand what goes through their minds? 'Sure. If I'd read that story I'd have said that's the biggest con-game, the biggest scam I've ever heard.' When I asked Colson whether 'getting religion' might be a kind of psychological condition, a mid-life crisis exaggerated by stress, he replied that in that case St Paul, St Augustine and John Wesley were merely showing psychological symptoms. It could not explain why he had turned down lucrative offers to spend 20 years working in prisons on a salary of Dollars 59,000 a year. Colson describes himself as a conservative, orthodox, evangelical Baptist, a fundamentalist in the non-pejorative sense of accepting all the basic dogmas of Christianity. Although he says he has given up party political contacts and has attacked the Moral Majority for its political links he is still more at home with the Right than the Left - except where criminal justice is concerned. You're non-political? 'Well, I can't vote, I'm an ex-convict.' But he went on to criticise Bill Clinton for squandering the goodwill of the presidency by raising divisive moral issues during his first 100 days. 'I very much oppose legitimising homosexuality and repealing the abortion restrictions.' Is homosexuality a sin? 'The Bible says it is. I get a little bit angry when people talk about us prejudiced, Bible-pounding people. Not many who criticise me will go and do what I do . . . take AIDs victims who are homosexuals and hold them in my arms and talk to them about Jesus. It's one thing to be offended by a sin. It's another to love the sinner.' Do you believe in the book of Genesis literally? 'I do believe in it literally.' Are you a Creationist? 'Oh, yes, absolutely. Of course I am. Anyone who reads the Bible historically has to be a Creationist.' So you don't believe in Darwin's theory of evolution? 'No, I do not.' Species might have adapted but were separately created, Colson said, and Man was created human, with a soul, not descended from an ape-like ancestor. A lot of people would say for an intelligent man you're being dumb. 'It isn't a question of intelligence, It's a question of prejudice - the idea that because something is modern it has to be more enlightened.' A hundred years ago, he added, universities all over the world had denied the existence of the Hittite Empire because the only reference to it was in the Bible. Do you believe in Original Sin? 'The greatest curse on the 20th century is that we forgot the doctrine of original sin. When you do, you get people like Stalin and Hitler. Utopians say just get rid of the social vices and the goodness of man will come through. But we are born flawed and have to be civilised.' I suggested to Colson that religion was the best career available to him after Watergate. 'Your readers will say: 'Oh, sure, he got in trouble in Watergate, he lost his law practice, he didn't have anything else to do, and went into the religious world. It's not a bad life, you get to stay at Claridges, you can write books, have fame and money and everything else' - though I keep no royalties, no speaking fees, no prizes. 'Since learning I had won the prize I have felt not one moment of exultation. I have felt driven to my knees in gratitude to God for what he has done in my life. 'I guess I can't ask you to believe it or your readers to believe it. But I'm giving you an honest answer.'</p>

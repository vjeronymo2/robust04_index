			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRANK ZAPPA, CAPITALIST ROCKER;  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEURSHIP: ZAPPA GOT TITLE TO HIS MASTER RECORDINGS BY SUING HIS RECORD  COMPANY. NOW HE'S MAKING NON-MUSIC DEALS WITH THE SOVIETS.  </P> <P> Frank Zappa has long been known as a rock 'n' roll iconoclast, an outspoken,  unconventional musician who earned the devotion of a moderate-sized following  with records such as "Freak Out," "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" and "Sheik  Yerbouti." But the former leader of the Mothers of Invention is also a shrewd  businessman. "I don't have anything against making a profit," he said.  </P> <P> Zappa, who turns 49 on Thursday, always did part his hair differently than his  more commercially successful contemporaries. But this year, while middle-aged  rockers such as the Who, Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones were reaffirming  their popularity on high-profile concert tours, Zappa was smart enough to stay  home. He hung up his road gear after he lost $400,000 on his self-financed 1988  tour.  </P> <P> "Everybody got paid but me," he said. Even though the four-month tour of the  United States and Europe was 90% sold out, Zappa said the losses piled up  because of high travel costs and salaries for the 12-piece band. There were 43  people in all, three buses and five trucks. "I had to pay the cost of all the  airplane tickets, all the buses, all the food, all the per diems and salaries,"  Zappa said.  </P> <P> "That sort of dampens one's enthusiasm for going out there and doing it again,"  he said, adding that he's unwilling to accept financial backing from a  corporate sponsor because it would mean hawking products such as beer or soft  drinks.  </P> <P> But Zappa is hardly struggling. Like any other businessman, he's worked at  cutting his overhead and he looks for new business opportunities where he can  find them, some as distant as the Soviet Union. From offices in North Hollywood  and his hilltop Laurel Canyon home, Zappa and his wife of 22 years, Gail, run  several businesses: a record label, a mail-order company, a video company and a  music publishing firm. All the businesses are 100%-owned by Zappa and his wife  and he says they are profitable, although he remains tight-lipped about sales  and earnings.  </P> <P> He owns the lucrative master tapes for many of his recordings, thanks to a  lawsuit he filed against his former record company, Warner Bros. Records, and  he slowly re-releases the old titles on compact discs. Much like an annuity,  the money keeps coming from those re-releases. "My stuff sells year after year  and the income from those sales goes to me," Zappa said.  </P> <P> It was a few years ago that Zappa and his wife decided to cut their overhead.  They had employed managers, lawyers and accountants to run his music  businesses. "After we started reading the contracts, we started to get smart  and figured out maybe we could do it better," Gail Zappa said. "So I fired  everyone and started over."  </P> <P> Since 1985 she has run the business end of things. "He's the artist and puts  the product together. I handle all production aspects of it, the cover art and  packaging. I make all the financial decisions."  </P> <P> And lately, the man who produced "Valley Girl," (the 1982 hit he made with his  daughter, Moon, who immortalized a series of Val-slang phrases such as "Gag me  with a spoon") has turned his sights to international trade and is brokering  joint ventures in the Soviet Union, including a proposed deal to start a  U.S.-Soviet business-oriented television show.  </P> <P> In the fickle world of pop music, Frank Zappa never achieved superstar status,  though he did have a few certifiable hits. According to Billboard magazine,  Zappa's three biggest singles were "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow," which reached  No. 4 on the charts in 1974, "Dancin' Fool," which hit No. 8 in 1979, and, with  Moon, "Valley Girl," No. 12 in 1982. But the recordings were labeled by  Billboard as novelty songs, meaning "it's like the Singing Chipmunks, more or  less tongue in cheek," said Kim Whitburn, a spokeswoman for Billboard's record  research unit.  </P> <P> Zappa, however, concentrates on other numbers. He says artists can make lots  more money by running their own record companies than by collecting royalties  from someone else.  </P> <P> In 1983, Zappa sued Warner Bros. Records, alleging that Warner used  questionable accounting methods to mislead him about royalties due from sales  of his music, a practice he says is still common in the music business. Most  artists don't take the time to closely scrutinize their contracts with record  companies, Zappa said. But he wanted more control over the sales of his  records.  </P> <P> When the suit was settled out of court, ownership of many of the masters  reverted to him. Zappa said he spent about $1.6 million on the suit, but the  steady sales of his old records are very lucrative. "I have albums that were  released 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago that are selling substantial quantities in CD  and cassette," he said.  </P> <P> Warner Bros. executives declined to give figures on past sales of Zappa's  albums, and they remain touchy about the lawsuit. "I'm not going to deal with  any issue relating to Frank Zappa," said a source at the company, who asked  that his name not be used. "If we say he sold 2 million records for us, he  might come back and sue us for royalties." But the source did say Zappa's  records consistently sold hundreds of thousands of units, which "wasn't huge,  but it was substantial."  </P> <P> Zappa releases his new albums on his independent label, Barking Pumpkin  Records, which he started in 1981. "We're taking all the risk a record company  takes," he said. "We have to pay for our own recording, advertising, every  other cost a record company would normally have. On the other hand, all the  profit a record company would normally have is ours now." The records are  distributed through a unit of Capitol Records.  </P> <P> In addition to the record company, Zappa also has a licensing deal with a  Boston company, Rykodisc, which has distributed about two dozen of Zappa's old  albums on CD during the past three years. Don Rose, president of Rykodisc, said  that sales of a few of them have topped 100,000 units, a strong showing  considering the recordings are up to 25 years old and that an album goes "gold"  with sales of 500,000 units.  </P> <P> Though most of Zappa's income comes from the record business, a growing  offshoot is his Barfko-Swill mail order company, which sells Zappa T-shirts,  posters and postcards, as well as records and cassettes. He also runs a music  publishing business, Munchkin Music; Honker Home Video, a company named after  Zappa's nose and which has produced videos such as "The True Story of '200  Motels,' " based on Zappa's film "200 Motels;" and Joe's Garage, a rehearsal  hall rental company.  </P> <P> And after four trips to the Soviet Union in recent few years, Zappa has a  variety of non-music deals he's trying to put together. He's already set up an  agreement for a Chatsworth company to receive amber for jewelry-making from the  Soviets, for which he received a 10% commission.  </P> <P> He is also working on starting a satellite-linked television show that would  feature Soviet and American business and legal experts exchanging ideas and  information. He says the cable channel Financial News Network is interested in  the concept, and he has another working trip to the Soviet Union planned for  January. Other joint U.S.-Soviet deals in the works include the possible  manufacture of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Zappa home, where Frank and Gail live with three of their four children and  where much of their business is run, is large but unpretentious. Wood-paneled  rooms are dark and cluttered, and stacks of tapes line the walls. In one part  of the house is Zappa's studio, where he started installing digital recording  equipment in the early '80s, before the technology became a standard for  recording.  </P> <P> The studio also contains Zappa's beloved Synclavier, a computerized synthesizer  that can be programmed to produce a vast array of sounds.  </P> <P> Zappa was born in Baltimore, but his family moved around a lot because his  father was a civil servant for the military. The Zappas eventually settled in  Lancaster, near Edwards Air Force Base. When he was about 12, Zappa became  interested in drums because he liked "the sounds of things a person could beat  on."  </P> <P> As a teen-ager, while other kids were spending their money on cars, Zappa was  buying records by Igor Stravinsky and avant-garde musicians such as Edgard  Varese. He formed his first band while still in high school. Zappa's first  album was "Freak Out," which he recorded with the Mothers of Invention in 1965.  Since then he has produced more than 50 albums, both with and without the  Mothers.  </P> <P> A few years ago Zappa went on a tour of another kind when he accepted some  dates on the college lecture circuit. Zappa said the $15,000 per lecture he  earned was practically all gravy -- which rattled him a little since he prefers  touring with a band but can't justify the expense. The businessman explained:  "The interesting thing about lecturing is I make more money sitting in a chair  on a stage for 90 minutes than I do playing in a rock band because there's no  overhead."  </P></p>

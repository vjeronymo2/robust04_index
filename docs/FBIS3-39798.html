			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Two days before the expiration of the NATO  ultimatum, the Bosnian Serbs are making more appeasing  statements. [passage omitted]    We know that Russia played an important role in the  diplomatic breakthrough of the last 24 hours. The Moscow  mediation has offered the Serbs an honorable face-saving device.  Alain Juppe has welcomed the prospect of sending Russian  peace-keeping forces to Sarajevo. Interviewed by Harry Sago, the  French foreign minister explained that he was asking for such a  measure:    [Begin Juppe recording] For nearly 10 months I have been  asking the Russians to join us in the field. It is not about  asking the Russian soldiers to be [word indistinct] buffer. It  is about putting contingents from as many countries as possible  under the UN banner, under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  command -- which is led as you know by a French general for the  whole of the former Yugoslavia, by a British general for Bosnia,  and by another French general, General Soubirou for Sarajevo. I  will be pleased if a Russian peace-keeping contingent is  included. We are told it [latest diplomatic breakthrough] is a  Russian victory, I say it is a European victory. We have never  ceased to ask for it. I am happy from the bottom of my heart  because this could be an element that would facilitate the  settlement of the problem. [end recording]</p>

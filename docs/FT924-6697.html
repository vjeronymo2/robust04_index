			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Sweden floats krona after outflow threatens reserves SWEDEN abandoned efforts to peg the krona to the European currency unit yesterday, floating its battered currency after a speculative outflow of capital threatened to wipe out reserves. The decision by the Riksbank, the central bank, followed the failure of attempts during the morning to prop up the currency by raising interest rates. The events - strongly reminiscent of Black Wednesday on September 16 in which Britain pulled sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism  -heightened tensions last night within the ERM. Sweden, although not a member of the ERM, has pegged the krona to the Ecu for 18 months. European finance ministers faced pressure to consider another realignment of the system, as the floating of the krona led to intense buying of the D-Mark which was pushed higher against the dollar and European currencies. There has been growing speculation in recent weeks that several ERM currencies, including the peseta, escudo and punt, might need to be realigned against the D-Mark. The dollar closed nearly 2 pfennigs down in London at DM1.5790 after rising over several weeks. In New York it closed at DM1.5715. The lira, which had appreciated sharply as investors grew more confident about the Italian government's emergency package, fell in London to L859.1 against the D-Mark from a previous L855.1. Later, in US trading, it slid further to L863. The French franc, now regarded as one of the strongest currencies in the ERM, lost 0.7 centimes against the D-Mark in London to FFr3.38. In New York it closed at FFr3.3875. Yesterday the krona fell by some 7.3 per cent against the dollar to SKr6.5325. Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, said the Riksbank's decision represented 'a failure for the national effort which had been made to protect the value of the krona', adding: 'We have done all we could to hold the fixed exchange rate.' The central bank, having weathered the earlier ERM crisis by pushing marginal interbank rates as high as 500 per cent, said similar tactics yesterday were not working. After lifting the marginal rate to 20 per cent from 11.5 per cent, the rate ended the day back at 12.5 per cent. Yesterday's traumas developed as Mr Bildt and Mrs Anne Wibble, his finance minister, rushed out a SKr30bn (Pounds 3bn) crisis package to improve internal competitiveness and calm the markets. But the opposition Social Democrats refused to support it, saying it lacked credibility. This was in contrast to September when all the main political parties agreed on measures to save the krona. The central bank said there had been 'massive speculation against the krona' with an estimated SKr158bn flowing out of Sweden since last Thursday, compared with a SKr80bn outflow in September's currency crisis. Mr Bengt Dennis, the Riksbank governor, said the decision to raise the marginal rate to 20 per cent 'proved insufficient' to stabilise the currency and he concluded: 'In the current circumstances additional increases in interest rates would not create market stability.' He added: 'We could not see the possibility of stopping the outward flow'. The government announced the abolition of 10-year-old restrictions preventing the state borrowing in foreign currency to finance debts. Mr Bildt and Mrs Wibble said there would be some changes in the latest crisis package, likely to come in the budget statement in January. Before then the government will publish a new assessment of prospects.

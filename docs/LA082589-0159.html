			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLAND ASKS RAPID, HEFTY AID FROM U.S.;  </P> <P> MAZOWIECKI IN PLEA TO VISITOR DOLE, SEEKS TO ALLAY MOSCOW'S FEARS  </P> <P> Poland's new prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, appealed today for rapid aid  from the United States to help solve his country's pressing economic problems  and tried to allay fears in Moscow over the historic change in power.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki, formerly a senior adviser to the Solidarity trade union and editor  of its newspaper, made the plea for aid to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of  Kansas during talks in Warsaw one day after he became the first non-Communist  prime minister in Eastern Europe in more than 40 years.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki has said he needs aid from abroad to help tackle runaway inflation,  a $39-billion debt and growing shortages.  </P> <P> "He asked that we carry to (President Bush) that . . . he who helps early helps  twice (as much)," Dole told reporters in the Council of Ministers, the  government's headquarters.  </P> <P> "In other words, this is very important now to keep up the momentum and let the  Polish people see some change," Dole said.  </P> <P> Dole, who arrived in Warsaw with his wife, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford  Dole, after a trip to the Soviet Union, did not specify what aid Mazowiecki  asked for nor say whether Washington intended to give extra money to Poland.  </P> <P> "Obviously we do have a budget deficit at home. Then we will provide aid as we  can, when we can, but there is already a significant program under way," he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush Pledge Recalled  </P> <P> Bush pledged during a visit to Poland in July to provide $119 million in  economic aid. Congress will consider legislation next month that would grant  the aid and several key lawmakers have said they would like to increase the  amount.  </P> <P> Dole said he discussed with Mazowiecki how Polish workers could be affected by  radical economic reforms and said Washington will send a team of experts to  determine urgent needs.  </P> <P> "This transition . . . is obviously going to create difficulties before the  benefits are produced," Dole said.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki also held talks with Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov and sought  to allay concern in Moscow over the change in government.  </P> <P> Soviet sources said Mazowiecki gave assurances that Poland will remain a  reliable ally and will stay in the Warsaw Pact military alliance. He praised  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki's election by Parliament on Thursday shattered the Communist  domination of Eastern Europe.  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (3): Regions demand transitional relief - Rating Revaluation Update / Regional occupiers can expect sharply increased rates bills to hit their doormats on April 1, while London companies will see a saving Most businessmen agree that business rates are fundamentally a good tax  - cheap to collect and a fair reflection of services provided. But that does not mean that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke could expect an easy ride after announcing in the budget what the UBR (Uniform Business Rate) would be set at. Multiply local rental values prevailing in April 1993 by UBR and - presto - that will be the rate payable from April 1 1995. But it is not quite that simple. Uniform Business Rate was first introduced in 1990, based on 1988 rental values. Between then and 1993 recession gripped London, savaging rents by as much as 50 per cent. In most of the regions, by contrast, they continued to rise from a lower base. The result is that regional occupiers can expect sharply increased rates bills to hit their doormats on April 1, while London firms will see a pleasing saving. But that is not the end of the story. When London rates rocketed in 1990 (because 1988 rental values were riding the crest of the boom) tenants in the capital demanded - and won - so-called transitional relief. No rates bill was to leave anyone more than 20 per cent worse off in any year. The regions have now demanded similar transitional arrangements, with the added proviso that this round's winners (the City of London 'fat cats' from a provincial perspective) should also see their windfalls phased in. That has incensed professionals who remember that UBR was introduced to stop local authorities either featherbedding or squeezing local industry by setting a local rate poundage completely out of step with national averages. In the most notorious case, in 1990, Sheffield businesses found themselves paying a UBR of only 34.8p in the Pounds 1 instead of the 399p rate poundage which the local authority had previously set. John Bloor, Weatherall Green &amp; Smith rating partner, insists that transitional relief negates the whole concept of a uniform business rate and introduces a system even more unworkable than the old variable rate poundages. It has certainly sheltered some businesses from what were said to be fair rates for much longer than politicians ever imagined. Selfridges department store in London's Oxford Street is one high profile establishment still not paying the full rates implied in the 1990 revaluation. One further twist to the rating revaluation saga has stuck in businessmen's craws. From time immemorial, businesses have had six months to appeal against a rates notice. Government now proposes to halve the appeal time to three months in England and Wales. In Scotland, the six months rule still prevails. This final piece of fine tuning threatens the entire programme. Businessmen may whinge against the swings-and-roundabouts element in the level of rates payable but transitional relief will probably be sufficient balm. The halving of the appeal period, however, they regard as simply vindictive. There is no evidence, they argue, that the old six-months period made it any more difficult for the Chancellor to collect the rates. Moreover the old arrangements continue to work perfectly well in Scotland. A mutinous groundswell can already be heard with some individuals advocating a form of revenge: businesses are being invited to slap in protective appeals against every assessment on the grounds that they will not have had time to evaluate them in detail. This would swamp the courts which hear appeals and could force a fundamental rethink by a government whose back benchers have already given notice that they will not be slavishly whipped into line. Opposition is likely to mount rapidly between now and the year-end (by when the relevant statutory instruments must be in place) or the first week in January when the government promises to publish the draft rating list (which will contain both estimated 1993 rental values and the UBR.) It may even continue beyond then, if the government shows signs of weakening, honing an edge for Weatheralls conferences in London, Bristol and Leeds between January 24 and February 1 at which Bloor will call for a return to controlled rate poundages.</p>

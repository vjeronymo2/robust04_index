			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLOSURES OF SCHOOLS DOMINATE FOUR RACES;  </P> <P> ELECTION: ELEVEN CANDIDATES SEEK FOUR SEATS ON THE OCEAN VIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT  BOARD OF TRUSTEES. A LACK OF REVENUES HAS STIRRED THE MOST INTEREST.  </P> <P> With two incumbents stepping down and a group of political hopefuls demanding  change, the Ocean View School District Board of Trustees race is likely to be  among the county's liveliest contests in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Eleven candidates are seeking four seats on a school board that has experienced  one of its stormiest years in recent memory, including protests by angry  parents over proposed school closures and demonstrations by teachers over  stalled contract talks.  </P> <P> Two incumbents are seeking reelection: board President Charles Osterlund, who  is seeking another four-year term, and Trustee Carolyn Hunt, who is seeking an  unexpired, two-year term. Board members Elizabeth A. Spurlock and Janet Garrick  decided to step down, largely out of frustration, they said.  </P> <P> The nine challengers in the race have criticized the board as being stagnant,  disjointed and fiscally irresponsible. They offer a diverse range of ideas on  what should be done to quell labor unrest among teachers and how harmony can be  restored to the often-divided board.  </P> <P> The most pressing issue, however, is whether schools should be closed to help  balance the district's budget.  </P> <P> The district is operating at a budget deficit exceeding $1 million, even after  cutting $1.4 million in spending from last year's plan. That crisis compelled  the board in June to consider closing three schools with low enrollment.  </P> <P> An outcry by hundreds of parents persuaded board members Garrick, Hunt and  Marcus to delay closures for at least a year. However, the financial problem  persists, and the new board this spring will again have to wrestle with the  question of whether to close schools in the face of public protest.  </P> <P> Osterlund, who voted against the majority in June, said he will continue to  push for school closures unless other budget alternatives arise. He charged  that the board shirked its responsibility by refusing to close schools last  year.  </P> <P> Among the nine candidates for the four-year seats, Osterlund is joined by  former high school administrator Flint Morrison and bilingual-education  activist Tracy Pellman in favoring school closures to help trim the budget.  </P> <P> James M. Ball, former chairman of the district's budget committee, contends  that financial woes can be remedied without closing any schools.  </P> <P> The other five candidates for the three seats said they would close schools  only under certain circumstances.  </P> <P> Randall J. Clifford, another budget committee member, said school closures  should be considered only to reduce class size or if the money saved by  closures "wouldn't be squandered."  </P> <P> Julie Engquist, district personnel commissioner, said school closures would be  "painful" but added that "my mind is not closed to the possibility."  </P> <P> Lottie Hobbs, who helped lead the parents' drive to keep open Golden View  School, one of the three that had been targeted for closure, is opposed to  closing any schools unless the aim is to improve educational programs.  </P> <P> Carolyn Kanode, who is leading the effort to establish a Huntington Beach  shelter for runaway teen-agers, argues that the board should consider  reconfiguring its combination of K-6 and K-8 schools before closing any sites.  </P> <P> Randy Vanderhook, an organizer in youth sports groups, said he would consider  closing schools "only as a last resort."  </P> <P> In the race for the two-year seat, Steve Buhrig, who served on the board's  advisory committee to consider the school closures, agrees with Osterlund that  school closures may be inevitable to bail the district out of its budget  crisis.  </P> <P> Hunt, Buhrig's opponent for the unexpired term, said she would continue to  explore all means of raising revenue and cutting spending to avoid school  closures.  </P> <P> Hunt, who has served on the board for nine years, said she is seeking  reelection to the unexpired term, rather than a full, four-year term, because  she wants to retire from the board soon. She said she would have stepped down  this year but was afraid that three incumbents leaving the board at one time  might have created massive upheaval.  </P> <P> Another issue facing the district is improvement of bilingual education. Last  year, Ocean View came under scrutiny by the state for being Orange County's  last district to submit an acceptable plan for increasing its number of  bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> That process is now moving forward, but the district is working to desegregate  heavily Latino Oak View School to prevent a clampdown by the state Department  of Education, officials said.  </P> <P> Additionally, candidates will have to address teachers' labor unrest, which  reached new heights during 1989-90. During contract talks, which were stalled  for more than a year, teachers picketed and boycotted extracurricular  activities.  </P> <P> A two-year contract was finally reached in June, but it expires in June, 1991,  so talks between the union and administration will probably heat up again early  next year. The teachers' union has promised to take an active role in the  November election.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT CANDIDATES  </P> <P> These are the candidates running for the Ocean View School District Board of  Trustees in the Nov. 6 election. There are three four-year terms to be filed  plus a two-year opening that will be left when Elizabeth A. Spurlock leaves the  board in November. Incumbent Janet Garrick is not seeking re-election while  incumbent Carolyn Hunt is vying for the two-year seat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> James M.

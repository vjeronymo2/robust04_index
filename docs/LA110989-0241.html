			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOARING FOOD COSTS PUSH UP PRICE INDEX;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: OCTOBER PRICES ARE SURPRISINGLY HIGH, BUT ANALYSTS PREDICT A BREAK IN  INFLATION IN MONTHS AHEAD.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices, pushed up by the steepest increase in food costs in 22  months, rose 0.4% in October, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The increase in the Labor Department's producer price index was markedly  smaller than the 0.9% jump in September but was still surprisingly high to many  economists.  </P> <P> The September and October advances followed rare monthly declines in July and  August.  </P> <P> Prices have been on a roller coaster this year, first surging ahead and then  easing during the summer after food and energy costs moderated.  </P> <P> For the first 10 months of the year, wholesale prices have been rising at an  annual rate of 5.2%, compared with an increase of 4% for all of 1988.  </P> <P> Food costs rose a steep 1.4% in October, following declines in three of the  four previous months. Analysts said the jump in food costs reflected in part  bad weather that affected California and Florida vegetable crops.  </P> <P> Vegetable prices shot up 18.9%. Other big advances in the food category were a  9.5% increase in pork costs, a 5.6% rise in fish prices and a 4.9% increase for  fruit.  </P> <P> The overall 1.4% advance in food costs was the biggest advance since a 1.5%  rise in January, 1988. But analysts said the one-month increase in the volatile  food category was not alarming given the fact that food costs had been falling.  </P> <P> Economists said they continue to believe that slower economic growth will  translate into lower inflationary pressures in the months ahead.  </P> <P> "Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable, we expect  further moderation in prices in 1990," said Stacy Kottman, assistant director  of economic forecasting at Georgia State University.  </P> <P> Energy costs, which had been the driving force behind the September spurt in  the overall index, moderated in October to a slight 0.2% increase, far below  the 6.5% surge in the previous month.  </P> <P> Gasoline prices were up 2.3% after a 10.6% jump in September. The cost of  natural gas dropped by 2.5% while home heating prices fell by 0.5% last month.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices excluding energy and food costs were up a tiny 0.1% in  October. Many analysts consider this figure a better gauge of underlying  inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> New-car prices fell by 1.4% in October at the start of the new model year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel (FDP) [Free Democratic Party] welcomes the NATO ultimatum  to the besiegers of the Bosnian town of Gorazde as "correct and  necessary." The Western community thus demonstrates that it is  not prepared to accept the "Bosnian Serbs' continual violations  of international law," Kinkel said in Bonn today. At the same  time, the Western community said it was not prepared to accept  developments like those in Gorazde in other parts of Bosnia.    It is necessary, "alongside the military measures," to get  the negotiating process into motion again, said Kinkel. The  United Nations, the European Union, the United States, and  Russia were jointly called upon to take a fresh initiative to  get the warring parties to the negotiating table.</p>

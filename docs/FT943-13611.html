			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Weighed under by green tape - Smaller companies may about to get a shock when they fall within the scope of new environmental laws Just as smaller companies might have thought the burden of red tape was to be lifted from their shoulders by a concerned government, the spectre of environmental legislation is looming large on the horizon. Many larger companies are successfully implementing measures brought in by the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, in particular the concept of integrated pollution control (IPC) which covers air, water and waste emissions. But smaller companies have been less affected by the legislation. That is changing. Within the next 18 months, many more of them will fall within the orbit of environmental protection legislation. All the signs are that managers of these companies are confused and frightened by the complexity of the rules and the cost of compliance. Whatever the merits of the legislation, it is introducing new areas of expertise that busy owner-managers must master. Last year the Greater Manchester Business Innovation Centre set up Envirotech with local sponsors and funding from the Department of Trade and Industry and the European Union's Regional Development Fund to offer companies a free environmental audit. The uptake, though improving, has been disappointingly low, says business manager Adele Neale. 'For those companies that know about the legislation the reaction tends to be one of fear and 'what is it going to cost us?',' she says. 'Many smaller companies are adopting a stick the head in the sand attitude.' This fear is not entirely surprising. Take the principle at the heart of the Act, which says companies must adopt the 'best available techniques not entailing excessive cost' - a concept that labours under the clumsy acronym Batneec. This principle is applied by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution when issuing companies with authorisations for certain prescribed industrial processes. Regulations in this area already cover most heavy industries such as mining, power supply and chemicals. Now the inspectorate is drawing up regulations and guidelines, which will be available next May, to include the industries not yet covered. These include paper making, timber treatment, coatings and animal and vegetable matter processes. Many of the companies in these industries are small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The trouble is that the guidelines, being drawn up after consultation with trade organisations, are necessarily vague. Batneec is site-specific, the inspectorate says. What is an 'available technique' at one factory may not be available at another within the same industry. And what does 'excessive cost' mean? While the inspectorate accepts this definition is not clear, it says it is not trying to put companies out of business. According to HMIP, smaller companies need not be too disconsolate. Inspectorate officials say the initial confusion in companies first covered by the IPC was fairly quickly resolved. More generally, while larger industries were initially critical of the Act some of the hostility has subsided. 'Our impression is that by and large big industry has done an excellent job in getting its act together from quite a low start,' says Robin Bidwell, managing director of Environmental Resources Management, a consultancy. Smaller companies are also increasingly likely to find themselves affected by waste management legislation. With some exceptions - in fact no fewer than 43 categories of exception - any company that keeps, treats or disposes of waste will need a licence. Many have already applied for licences. What may not be widely recognised by SMEs is that companies exempt from needing a licence must register that exemption by December or risk paying a fine of up to Pounds 5,000. The welter of legislation has meant a growth market for consultancies. Some, such as ERM, say companies are beginning to realise that the environment need not be a threat but can save money. And as the scope of Integrated Pollution Control has spread, so has interest in BS 7750, the environmental management equivalent of the BS 5750 quality standard. From April next year, companies will also be able to register under the EU's equivalent standard, the eco-management and audit system. The question being raised, however, is why companies already inspected by the pollution inspectorate should go through the additional cost of seeking and maintaining BS 7750. The DTI says there may be additional value in BS 7750. While IPC focuses on processes, BS 7750 is more concerned with ensuring an environmental management system is in place. What is more, the officials say, BS 7750 is better than its quality assurance cousin because it clearly encourages continuous improvement. Nevertheless, the DTI stresses that accreditation is not a badge of quality or greenness, only a management tool to help achieve a corporate goal. While the government may not yet have stopped the spread of environmental red tape, it is at least aware of the problem for SMEs. As one DTI official said. 'In the SME sector there is probably a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about legal requirements. There are no clear channels for communicating our intentions or planned changes.' The DTI and Department of the Environment plan to improve the way they communicate the impact of environmental legislation to smaller companies. Unless they are successful over the next six months or so, some companies are going to have a nasty shock.</p>

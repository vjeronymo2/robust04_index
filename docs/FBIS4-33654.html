			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 8 Jun (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Government  today reiterated its rejection of any unilateral or multilateral  armed intervention by any country in Haiti.    Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said that  Venezuela will not be a party--under any circumstances--to any  armed action in Haiti to oust the military regime. Burelli  reaffirmed Venezuela's willingness to cooperate in solving the  Haitian crisis, mentioning both nations' historical ties.    The Haitian crisis was one of the subjects discussed during  the foreign ministers' meeting held on Monday, taking advantage  of the OAS meeting in Belem de Para (Brazil).    The Venezuelan foreign minister said that Venezuela is one  of  the nations that has made great efforts seeking a solution to  the Haitian problem and for the restoration of ousted  Constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Venezuela, the  United States, France, and Canada are part of the so-called  "Group of Friends" that have sought alternatives for the  political crisis Haiti has experienced since Aristide left power.    Burelli also indicated that Venezuela will only accept a  small group of Haitian refugees, after the Venezuelan Embassy in  the United States has certified their qualifications to be  received by the nation. The Venezuelan foreign minister  indicated that it was necessary "to definitely clear up  speculation," which has arisen on Venezuela's decision to accept  Haitian refugees.    Burelli referred to the letter sent by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher in which he requests Venezuela's  cooperation to receive Haitian refugees. Nevertheless, the  Venezuelan reply to Christopher sums up that "under current  circumstances it has a flow of uninvited immigrants," who have  made even more difficult the conditions "increasing poverty and  aggravating the social order problem," Burelli indicated. "We  would accept a group qualified and certified by our embassy in  Washington," he added.    Burelli also denied some statements published by several  local papers indicating Venezuela was ready to receive several  hundreds of Haitian refugees. He admitted, however, that if  Haitian refugees do arrive, their stay permanence will "only be  temporary," dependent on the solution of problems in Haiti.    The minister finally ruled out the possibility of Venezuela  becoming a Haitian refugee camp.</p>

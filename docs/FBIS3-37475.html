This date,  when, five years ago, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from  Afghanistan was completed, is not marked in the calendar. But  for the people is it a Day of Remembrance, when we remember  those who did not come home. A ceremony was held 14 February in  the Central House of the Russian Army to mark the fifth  anniversary of the withdrawal of the 40th Army from Afghanistan.  It was conducted by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry.    "Whatever society thinks of the Afghan war today," Hero of  the Soviet Union Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation  defense minister, said in his opening speech, "it is clear to  us, the military, that the vast majority of Afgan war veterans,  as soldiers in that undeclared war, displayed true courage and  heroism and loyalty to the military oath and to the homeland.  We are not to blame for the fact that the Army was forced to  pay in blood for the political leaders' mistakes, and pay dearly  -- 13,833 of our fighting comrades died brave deaths in  Afghanistan. May their memory and reputation live forever!"    The ceremony participants observed a minute's silence in  memory of the dead.    "There are around 30,000 commissioned and noncommissioned  officers in the Russian Army at the moment who served in  Afghanistan," Hero of the Soviet Union Colonel General Boris  Gromov, Russian Federation deputy defense minister, stressed in  his report. "The Defense Ministry has done and will continue to  do everything possible to provide social protection for Afghan  war veterans and in particular for the families of the dead and  missing and for invalids."    He noted that, despite financial problems, the Defense  Ministry has just recently given assistance to more than 7,000  families of soldiers killed in the Afghan war and to around  4,600 invalids living in Russia.    The meeting was addressed by Marshal of the Soviet Union  Sergey Sokolov, retired Colonel General Yuriy Tukharinov,  Aviation Colonel General Viktor Kot, and USSR People's Artist  Iosif Kobzon.    Yesterday, 15 February, wreaths were laid on the Grave of  the  Unknown Soldier and at the Perovo memorial to Muscovites killed  in the Afghan War on behalf of the Defense Ministry leadership  and the Committee for Internationalist Soldiers' Affairs under  the Council of Commonwealth States' Heads of Government.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Sentences end the Ambrosiano affair, Part I ITALY'S slow-grinding legal system has crunched forward with this week's verdicts in the long-running Banco Ambrosiano trial. But as reactions to the heavy sentences on the 33 defendants showed, the sparks have only just started flying. Hardest hit among the accused was Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the industrialist best known as chairman of the Olivetti computer group. He was sentenced on Thursday to jail for over six years, for his role in the collapse of the bank formerly run by Mr Roberto Calvi, the financier found hanging under London's Blackfriars Bridge in June 1982. Although he appeared confident at a press conference in Milan yesterday, the verdicts have already hit the image, if not the actual running, of Mr De Benedetti's businesses. However, his aides said the case 'will not bring any change whatever, nor have any effect on the operations of Mr De Benedetti and the companies in his group'. Mr De Benedetti is not alone among prominent figures caught in the Ambrosiano web. The others include Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a financier and close friend of Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italy's caretaker prime minister, and Mrs Anna Bonomi Bolchini, the head of a prominent Milanese industrial family. All were sentenced to heavy jail terms. The longest sentences were reserved for Mr Licio Gelli, former head of the banned P2 masonic lodge, and his assistant in the lodge, Mr Umberto Ortolani, who received terms of 18 1/2 and 19 years. Thursday's verdicts conclude the latest stage in a legal saga which began after the bank's collapse in 1982 with Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 734m) of debts in Italy's biggest post-war banking scandal. After a highly complex, eight-year investigation hearings opened in May 1990. The Ambrosiano shadow fell over Mr De Benedetti himself as a result of his role as deputy chairman of the bank, a position he was invited to take by Mr Calvi in November 1981. Rather than eventually becoming chairman and having the opportunity to clean up the bank, as he says he hoped, Mr De Benedetti stayed on board for just 65 days before stepping down in January 1982. At a crowded press conference in Milan yesterday, he made clear he decided to leave at Mr Calvi's request. 'My feeling is that Calvi hadn't asked permission from whoever he had to, and regretted it soon afterwards; indeed, within three days of my arrival,' he said. Who Mr Calvi's mysterious bosses might have been was not made clear. In 1988, Mr De Benedetti was formally accused by investigating magistrates of extortion, a charge levelled against a number of other bank employees. Although he was acquitted in April 1989, another magistrate called next March for him to be tried along with the other defendants, this time on the new charge of fraudulent bankruptcy. The accusations focused on the financial details of Mr De Benedetti's acquisition of a packet of shares in the bank and another company on taking office, and their subsequent sale on his departure. Yesterday, he repeated his stance that the deals had been entirely above board. His lawyers are appealing against the verdict. Most of the defendants have promised to appeal, and the case could even reach Italy's supreme court after their appeals are heard, meaning the Ambrosiano saga looks set to win a place in the record books for its length, if for nothing else.</p>

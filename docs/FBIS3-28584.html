			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In relation to the U.S.'s lifting the economic  sanctions against Vietnam, Japanese enterprises foresee "the  possibility of entering joint partnerships with U.S. enterprises  and of exporting [products produced in Vietnam] to the United  States, and broader chances for investment." Up to now, many  Japanese enterprises have been cautious about large-scale  investment in Vietnam, but this year saw the start of full-scale  international assistance including that provided by the Japanese  Government which forecast that Japan's activities in Vietnam  will be accelerated.    Vietnam fever among Japanese enterprises has gained  increased  momentum in recent days. Every day more than 1,000 Japanese  visited the JETRO [Japan External Trade Organization] sponsored  "Vietnam Exhibit" which was held in Tokyo in the latter part of  January. In March, a "Japan Industrial Sample Fair" is  scheduled to open in Hanoi, to be participated in by more than  100 Japanese machinery manufacturers. In April, a Keidanren  [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] delegation will  visit Ho Chi Minh City to hold the second Japan-Vietnam joint  economic conference.    Investments by Japanese enterprises started in the late  1980's, centered around such small-scale operations as  manufacturing textiles and home electric appliances. Since last  year, however, heavy and chemical industries started to set up  joint venture plants. Scheduled to be built are a minibus  factory by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, cement plants by Nihon  Cement Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, and a  vinyl chloride plant by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc. is under  consideration.    In addition to these, electrical and automobile  manufacturing  companies are placing emphasis on exports to Vietnam by opening  offices there for sales and service.    The lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will enable Japanese  enterprises which build plants in Vietnam to import parts and  raw materials from the United States or to export their products  to the United States. No restrictions will be imposed in  financing funds and settling accounts in U.S. dollars.  Furthermore, opportunities are available for Japanese to launch  large-scale development of resources and to consolidate social  infrastructure by entering joint partnerships with U.S.  enterprises equipped with technical knowhow, and abounding with  financial resources. The U.S. decision is likely to encourage  activities of Japanese enterprises in Vietnam.    In the development of petroleum resources, three Japanese  firms in partnership with Mobil Corporation of the U.S. have  obtained the rights and interests to submarine oil fields. As  part of Official Development Assistance [ODA], Japan decided to  provide loans in the amount of 52.3 billion yen for eight  projects which aim at improving such social infrastructure as  power plants and railroads. U.S. enterprises are expected to  make bids in international bidding, heightening competition for  Japanese enterprises. Also it is likely that Japanese and U.S.  firms will make joint bids.    Japanese enterprises, taking notice of a Vietnamese  population of 70 million and abundant mineral resources, regard  Vietnam as the most promising market next to China. However,  Vietnam lacked social infrastructure and legal systems, and the  U.S. trade embargo imposed obstacles, both material and moral.  Morihito Kosuda, Nissho Iwai Corporation's representative in  Indochina, set a high value on the U.S. measure "which is highly  effective because Japanese businessmen can rid themselves of the  psychological restraint to refrain from investing." Nissho Iwai  will increase the number of staff members in Vietnam from 11 to  21, and major trading firms plan to follow suit.</p>

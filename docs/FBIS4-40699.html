			<p>BFN     [Text] The criteria for cooperation between NATO and the  Ukrainian Navy would not be discussed before the Black Sea Fleet  is divided between Ukraine and Russia, General Antonio Milani,  deputy commander of the NATO southern flank, told journalists in  Sevastopol where he arrived at the invitation of the Ukrainian  armed force command.    He met with Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander  of the Ukrainian Navy, in the city.    Milani said that his visit to Sevastopol had nothing to do  with the tense situation there and that his party would not meet  with the Crimean leadership.    He emphasized that Ukraine was a sovereign state which had  to  tackle its domestic problems on its own.    Following his meeting with Milani, Bezkorovaynyy told  INTERFAX-Ukraine that his country badly needed cooperation with  NATO in the framework of the Partnership for Peace program  which, he thought, marked the start of reorienting military and  political blocks to the maintenance of peace.    Bezkorovaynyy said that cooperation between the Ukrainian  armed forces and NATO and planning of joint activities at the  initial stage had been discussed in the framework of the program.    He added that exchange of experts who would concentrate on  specific issues in interaction between the Ukrainian Navy and  NATO had been discussed at the meeting.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Brussels seeks faster removal of curbs on telecom services The European Commission is preparing plans to accelerate the liberalisation of the telecommunications market in Europe, including proposals to allow cable television companies to compete with state telecoms monopolies. The deregulation drive reflects the view in Brussels that the timetable for the 12 EU member states to dismantle barriers in the European telecoms market by January 1 1998 is being overtaken by market forces. Acceleration would be selective, but would still amount to a minor revolution, a senior Commission official said, adding: 'Certain people will lose some of their privileges.' According to drafts circulating in Brussels, the proposals fall short of allowing operators to set up alternative voice networks. This is in line with the agreement to delay full liberalisation of telecom services until 1998. Plans to allow cable television networks in Europe to introduce services, such as telebanking or closed user networks, would nevertheless give a fillip to the manufacturing and software sectors. It would also offer an enticing market for British companies which, alone in Europe, have been allowed to operate freely in this sector for the past two years. But a Commission-led push to introduce alternative networks risks running into opposition from state monopoly operators, such as France Telecom and Telefonica of Spain, which view the deadline as sacrosanct. Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, is leading the debate on liberalisation. He is chairing a group of industrialists reporting on how Europe can exploit new information technologies in health, banking and telecoms. The group will submit recommendations to the 12 heads of government at the European summit in Corfu next month. Mr Bangemann is said to be reluctant to scrap the deadline outright because it was based on a 'fragile consensus' between a UK-led liberalising lobby and the traditionalists grouped around France, Spain and Greece. But, along with Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, he believes there are ways of working round the deadline and speeding liberalisation. One EU official said there was a consensus in Brussels that deregulation was inevitable, but the Bangemann group had to recognise political constraints. 'The message must be clear, credible and operational,' he said. Minister protects cable TV from BT, Page 7</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Pounds 200m donation by Sainsbury chief MR David Sainsbury, chairman of supermarket chain J. Sainsbury and one of Britain's richest men, has given shares in the company worth Pounds 200m to the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, a grant-making trust which he set up and has funded since 1967. The donation, from Mr Sainsbury's personal holding, is believed to be by far the largest UK charitable contribution by a private individual in recent times. It was described as 'a staggering sum' by the Charities Aid Foundation, which monitors charity finances. The Gatsby Foundation disbursed about Pounds 15m last year, making it Britain's third largest grant-giving trust measured by spending. Yesterday's donation of 35.6m J. Sainsbury ordinary shares - roughly 2 per cent of the company's equity - will increase its capital to about Pounds 500m. Income from the donation will finance the foundation's existing commitments, the cost of which exceeded its revenues in recent years. Until now, the shortfall was made good by periodic contributions by Mr Sainsbury. The trust, named after F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby - the tragic tale of an ostentatious American parvenu with a mysterious past - finances a wide range of activities close to the 52-year-old Mr Sainsbury's personal interests. They include management and technical education, African development programmes, support for disadvantaged children, economic and business research, healthcare and plant science. The trust is a leading supporter of the Centre for Business Strategy at the London Business School, where Mr Sainsbury is chairman of the board of governors. The trust is the largest of several charitable organisations founded by members of the Sainsbury family, which have total assets of about Pounds 1bn. Three of Mr Sainsbury's cousins helped finance a new wing for the National Gallery in the late 1980s. The Gatsby Foundation says it will retain the shares as an investment. They currently pay an annual dividend of about Pounds 4m. The arrangement will help to maintain effective control of the publicly quoted company by family members, who together control directly and indirectly about 42 per cent of its shares. Mr Sainsbury will remain the wealthiest member of the family with a holding of 312.5m shares after the donation. J. Sainsbury's shares closed yesterday at 563p, up 1p.</p>

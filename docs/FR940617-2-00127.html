			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ORR will consider granting a waiver of the 85% provision if a State meets one of the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of ORR that the dependency rate of refugees who have been in the U.S. 24 months or less is below 55% in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that (a) less than 85% of the State's social service allocation is sufficient to meet all employment-related needs of the State's refugees and (b) there are non-employment-related service needs which are so extreme as to justify an allowance above the basic 15%. Or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C) of the INA, the State submits to the Director a plan (established by or in consultation with local governments) which the Director determines provides for the maximum appropriate provision of employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performance standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refugee social services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are resettling in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly during a refugee's initial years of resettlement, refugee social services should be provided through a refugee-specific service system rather than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served. When planning State refugee services, States are strongly encouraged to take into account the reception and placement (R &amp; P) services provided by local resettlement agencies in order to utilize these resources in the overall program design and to ensure the provision of seamless services to refugees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to provide culturally and linguistically compatible services in as cost-efficient a manner as possible in a time of limited resources, ORR encourages States and counties to promote and give special consideration to the provision of refugee social services through coalitions of refugee service organizations, such as coalitions of MAAs, voluntary resettlement agencies, or a variety of service providers. ORR believes it is essential for refugee-serving organizations to form close partnerships in the provision of services to refugees in order to be able to respond adequately to a changing refugee picture. Coalition-building and consolidation of providers is particularly important in communities with multiple service providers in order to ensure better coordination of services and maximum use of funding for services by minimizing the funds used for multiple administrative overhead costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States should also expect to use funds available under this notice to pay for social services which are provided to refugees who participate in alternative projects. Section 412(e)(7)(A) of the INA provides that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary [of HHS] shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support [social] services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision is generally known as the Wilson/Fish Amendment. The Department has already issued a separate notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with respect to applications for such projects (50 FR 24583, June 11, 1985). The notice on alternative projects does not contain provisions for the allocation of additional social service funds beyond the amounts established in this notice. Therefore a State which may wish to consider carrying out such a project should take note of this in planning its use of social service funds being allocated under the present notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The national budget for the next fiscal year has  been announced. Finance Minister Saifur Rahman presented the  budget for 1994-95 and the supplementary budget for the outgoing  1993-94 in the Jatiya Sangsad [parliament] this afternoon.    The total outlay of the budget for the next fiscal year  divided into revenue and development budgets amounted to 24,637  core taka. The revenue budget shows a surplus of 3,689 crore  taka. Revenue receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated  at 13,637 crore taka; this is about 11 percent higher than the  revised estimate of the current year. Tax revenue will  contribute 10,625 crore taka. Nontax revenue is expected to show  a healthy rise of 25.5 percent over the revised estimate for the  outgoing fiscal year to 3,012 crore taka. Revenue expenditure  for 1994-95 is estimated at 9,948 crore taka, which is 8.7  percent higher than the revised figure for 1993-94.    Allocations to priority sectors such as education, health  and  family welfare, irrigation, and flood control have been  increased significantly. After adjusting for capital and food  accounts, net contribution to the ADP [annual development  program] from the revenue budget is expected to be 3,996 crore  taka. The voluntary separation program will continue in the  next fiscal year, for which 300 crore taka has been provided  for. An ADP of 11,000 crore taka has been proposed for 1994-95;  this is an increase of 14.5 percent over the revised ADP for the  current fiscal year.    Taking into account the projects proposed under the Food for  Work Program outside the ADP, the total public sector investment  will stand at 11,513 crore taka. Thirty-eight percent of the  fiscal year's ADP is estimated to be financed from the country's  own resources. This clearly demonstrates the present  government's success in reducing aid dependency to promote our  cherished goal of a self-reliant Bangladesh.    Pursuing the government's policy of allocating resources to  priority sectors that directly or indirectly contribute to  poverty alleviation and human resources development, the  proposed budget provided larger funds to several sectors. Of  them, education will get 1,556 crore taka, the highest  allocation. It is an increase of nearly 60 percent over the  current fiscal year. Health and family welfare will receive 20  percent increase over 1993-94 of 893 crore taka. Rural  electrification, rural infrastructure, livestock, and fisheries  -- the sectors which can fast contribute to economic growth and  simultaneously alleviate poverty -- will all get higher  allocations compared to the outgoing fiscal year. Social  welfare, women, and youth will also have significant increase.  The budget has provided 183 crore taka for this sector.    The finance minister also placed in parliament the revised  and supplementary budget for the outgoing 1993-94 fiscal year.  In the revised budget, revenue receipts have been estimated at  12,280 crore taka and the revenue expenditure is 9,150 crore  taka. The restraint upon the current expenditure has yielded  higher surplus to finance the ADP. The size of the revised ADP  has been kept at 9,600 crore taka, which is 18 percent higher  than the previous year's revised ADP.    The sectors that received additional allocations in the  revised ADP are education, 275 crore taka; rural infrastructure,  125 crore taka; rural electrification, 100 crore taka; and roads  and highways, 220 crore taka. Besides, an additional amount of  444 crore taka has been provided for the Jamuna Multipurpose  Bridge. It is important to note that domestic resources are  contributing 35.8 percent of the revised ADP, a major step  toward economic self-reliance.    Spelling the main objectives of the budget, the finance  minister said the integral components of the government's  broader strategy for the medium term is to achieve a GDP growth  rate of around 6 percent, to contain inflation and fiscal  deficit, and reduce aid dependence. Other objectives included  enhancing mobilization of domestic savings, investments, and  promoting self- reliance. He said the government plans to raise  the growth rate of GDP to 6-7 percent in the near term while  aiming at a double-digit growth before the turn of the century.  This would require raising the aggregate level of investment  from the present level of 14.5 to 16 percent in the immediate  future, eventually reaching 20 percent of the GDP.    Mr. Saifur Rahman said the cornerstone of the government's  development strategy is to improve the quality and productivity  of public investments with emphasis on social sectors. He said  the BNP [Bangladesh Nationalist Party] government has entered  the fourth year of its term and it is appropriate to take an  objective look at the government's performances during these  three years. The finance minister said growth rate of GDP has  improved; the country is expected to show a modest level of 5  percent growth this year.    Turning to the rural economy, he said a quiet revolution is  under way and it is not only generating economic growth from new  sources but also transforming the composition of production,  consumption, and employment. Mr. Saifur Rahman said housing is  an important growth sector and the House Building Finance  Corporation has been made fully operational to cater to the  needs of the people. It is expected to sanction 500 crore taka  for house building loans next year.    The finance minister announced further incentives for  agricultural growth by reducing the prices of kerosene and  diesel by one taka per liter and furnace oil by about 3,000 taka  per metric ton. The government has further decided to lower the  urea fertilizer price by 350 taka per metric ton.    The finance minister, while giving details of the fiscal  measures proposed in the new budget, said these are primarily  aimed at giving relief to the people as well as infuse dynamism  in the national economy. He said due care has also been taken  to bring about specific structural changes in the taxation  system and make it more scientific to (?cope) with the changing  global economic scenario. Mr. Saifur Rahman proposed reduction  of existing taxes and duties on a large number of essential  items, including edible oil, sugar, cotton, and cotton yarn.  Taxes were reduced on 148 basic raw materials and 1,024  industrial raw materials, hides and skins, crockery, low-lift  pumps, power tillers, medical equipment and appliances, wood and  wood products, TV, locally produced construction material,  scientific instruments, sports gear, bicycles, telephone  equipment, stamp charge on registration of land, and materials  used in dairy farms. He also announced a total abolition of  duties on the import of improved breed of cattle from abroad.    The finance minister has also proposed increase of duties  and  taxes on a few items to help encourage their increased  production in the country. In this connection, he proposed 7.5  percent duty on globe and atlas, 15 percent increase on cut  flower, and 15 percent supplementary duty on gray portland  cement. He also proposed to raise duty on MS [mild steel]  billet from 15 to 30 percent and duty rate on certain tobacco  and tobacco products will also be increased, depending on their  prices. Passengers traveling abroad would be required to pay 50  taka per head in addition to the existing travel tax. However,  all surcharges and levies for Jamuna Bridge have been withdrawn.    The finance minister said the new fiscal measures are in the  line of the present democratic government's commitment to ensure  welfare of the people through the adoption of various pragmatic  measures. The new measures will also go a long way in further  strengthening of the national economy. He said due to the  reduction in taxes and duties in a large number of daily-use  [items], the total loss to the national exchequer will stand at  437 crore taka while the new fiscal measures will fetch only 55  crore taka. The finance minister said the shortfall thus  created will be met through appropriate administrative measures  including intensified drive to realize arrear revenues, curb the  propensity of avoidance and evasion through enforcing the  existing provisions of law, introduction of computer processing  in Dhaka and Chittagong Customs Houses and the income tax  offices.    Mr. Saifur Rahman, giving an account of the present-day  world  economic order, said we will have to complete the reform process  initiated by the present government. We must also build a  political consciousness in favor of these reformative measures  which will help the country achieve self-reliance through  increased mobilization of domestic resources. The finance  minister later introduced the Finance Bill 1994 in an amended  form. The bill envisages enforcement of the government's fiscal  proposals and amends certain laws.    Our parliamentary representatives says President Abdur  Rahman  Biswas, the chief of the Army and the Navy, diplomats, elites,  members of the diplomatic corps, and high civil and military  officials were among those present in the Sangsad during the  presentation of the new budget by the finance minister. The  members of the opposition were, however, absent. The house will  meet again on Sunday next [12 June] at 1630 in the afternoon.</p>

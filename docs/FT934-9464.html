			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar volatile on PPI THE US dollar was buffeted in volatile trade following the release of lower than expected US producer prices, writes Conner Middelmann. Immediately after the announcement that the producer price index fell by 0.2 per cent in October - compared with market forecasts for a rise of 0.2 per cent - the dollar declined   1/2 pfennig as dealers felt that the inflation fears which have recently underpinned the dollar were overdone. But the selling soon fizzled out and the dollar staged a strong recovery in early New York trading as many dealers covered their short positions. It closed in London at DM1.6950 - up from Monday's DM1.6850  - and is expected to test resistance at DM1.70 today. In New York it ended at DM1.6927. 'The move shows that people still want to have dollars and build up positions,' said Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'The weakness after the PPI number was a good opportunity to buy dollars at a lower level.' However, while the long term dollar uptrend is seen intact, some warn there could be a short term retracement. 'The risk of a correction comes from the fact that most of the buying has been by short term speculative accounts,' said Mr Joe Prendergast, chief currency analyst with MMS International, the market analysis service. Today's release of the October US consumer price index - expected to have risen by 0.3 per cent on the month - and Friday's retail sales data are expected to offer more clues to the dollar's direction. The Canadian dollar was pressured by fears of rising federal deficits after a government official was reported to have said that the 1992/93 deficit would total some CDollars 37bn - above the CDollars 35.5bn forecast - and that the deficit for the next fiscal year would rise to some CDollars 39bn to CDollars 40bn, well above the CDollars 32.6bn initially projected. The Bank of Canada was rumoured to be intervening to support the currency, which none the less eased to CDollars 1.3069 against the US currency in late London interbank trading, from CDollars 1.2980 early in the day. Sterling weakened in the afternoon on stop-loss selling by technical traders and ended a relatively uneventful session near its day's lows against the D-Mark and the US dollar. It closed at DM2.4900, down from a previous DM2.4950, and at Dollars 1.4685, after Monday's Dollars 1.4805. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar after the stock market staged another sharp sell-off and the Bank of Japan's rather generous open-market operation caused call money to ease slightly. After closing at Y107.63 in Tokyo, the dollar rose to Y108.15 in late London trading. It finished in New York at Y107.95. The Belgian franc was soft after news that the Belgian trade unions had announced strikes over the country's social plan. It finished against the dollar at around BFr36.20 in London, compared with BFr35.82 on Monday.</p>

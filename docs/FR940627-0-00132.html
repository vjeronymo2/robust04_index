			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ethanol. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Non-baseline ethanol formulations conform with the baseline limits in terms of elemental composition, but contain more than 5 percent by volume of substances other than ethanol and gasoline. Individual groups are defined for each non-ethanol, non-gasoline component, and for each unique combination of such components. The representative of each non-baseline ethanol group will be the group member with the highest concentration (i.e., percent by volume) of the non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Methane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There is only one non-baseline methane group. This group contains all methane formulations conforming with the baseline criteria except that they exceed the allowable limit for non-methane hydrocarbons (i.e., 20 mole percent). The representative for the non-baseline methane group will be the member formulation containing the highest concentration of non-methane hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Propane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Non-baseline propane formulations are those which conform with the baseline criteria except that they exceed the allowable limit for non-propane hydrocarbons (i.e., 20 percent by volume). All non-baseline propane formulations are sorted into a single group. The representative for the non-baseline propane group will be the member formulation containing the highest concentration of non-propane hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Groups within the Atypical Categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Atypical groups within each fuel family are defined according to the distinctive atypical constituent(s). Separate groups are established for any single atypical constituent and any unique combination of atypical constituent(s) which occurs among the products in each category. For example, if a gasoline fuel contains sodium, and no other atypical element, then this atypical fuel will group with other gasoline fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures containing sodium as their only atypical constituent. However, if a gasoline fuel contains sodium and potassium, then this fuel will define a separate group for formulations containing both sodium and potassium. As explained previously, EPA believes that this approach is reasonable because different atypical elements may have distinct toxicological effects. Thus, while similarly composed F/FAs may group together, EPA believes that testing distinct F/FAs separately best effectuates CAA Section 211(e), which states that ``each'' F/FA shall be tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

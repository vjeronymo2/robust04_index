			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Labour warns of slide in spending Public investment will fall dramatically as a result of the first Budget delivered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday. Mr Brown told a post-Budget seminar in London that general government investment would fall by 3 per cent next year and 3.5 per cent in 1995-96. He said a Labour analysis of the Budget Red Book, which outlines tax changes and public spending plans, showed that net public capital expenditure would fall from Pounds 13.5bn this year to Pounds 10.25bn by 1997. 'This means a 25 per cent fall in the value of public investment, one of the biggest cuts we have seen,' he said. Mr Brown said the March Budget, delivered by Mr Norman Lamont, had also failed to live up to its billing as a Budget for investment. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told a party meeting in Edinburgh that the gloss was 'fast fading' from the Budget. 'The truth about the Budget is sinking in and the country is not impressed,' he said. Mr Smith said the Budget - the 'biggest tax hike in history' - was the direct responsibility of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who was earlier chief secretary to the Treasury and chancellor. 'He has held the three jobs which give him immediate responsibility for the catastrophic decline. The buck stops very firmly with him.' In another attack on the Budget Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said Mr Clarke had made 'the clearest declaration imaginable that the Tories are the party of high taxation, just as they are the party of high crime'. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said many of Britain's 10,000 rural post offices were at risk of closure because of a 76 per cent increase in Post Office payments to the government.</p>

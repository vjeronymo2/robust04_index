			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's major political  forces, the anti-communist Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS)  and former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), are  considering their election campaigns before elections are even  scheduled. For more than a year the SDS have been calling on  the cabinet of nonpartisan Professor Lyuben Berov to resign and  insisting on early elections. Three days ago President Zhelyu  Zhelev withdrew his support for the cabinet. The cabinet's  resignation is a variant being considered by the ethnic Turks'  Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) on whose mandate the  incumbent cabinet was formed in late December 1992. At a  closed-door sitting late last week, the Socialists, for their  part, decided to give a last chance to Prof. Berov's cabinet and  granted them a month and a half to take under control the  critical situation of the past couple of weeks. In the  meantime, Prime Minister Berov, now recovering from a cardiac  operation, publicized his plans about structural and personnel  changes in the government.    The government has obviously come to an impasse, SDS leader  Filip Dimitrov told journalists after a sitting of the union's  supreme leadership. According to him, the government is trying  very hard to convince people that the situation is improving.  While the dollar seems to be under control, the prices do not.  The statements of cabinet members sound most strange; they  display a fake optimism and gross indifference to the man in the  street, Filip Dimitrov went on to say. He reiterated the  union's firm belief that the incumbent cabinet should step down.  The SDS leader would not give further details as to the  specific action the union is planning to take, adding only that  it will resort to extraparliamentary means as soon as the  parliamentary ones prove inefficient.    The SDS supreme leadership today also discussed its election  campaign. This issue was high on the agenda of the BSP  Executive Council. Socialists' leader Zhan Videnov told  journalists that disbanding the parliament, which the effective  constitution provides for in case a caretaker cabinet is  appointed, is absurd when the country has embarked on the road  of transition. Amendment of this provision in the constitution  will require a majority of three quarters of the parliamentary  votes.    Filip Dimitrov also said that the SDS leadership has not put  for discussion the BSP proposal for amendment to the  constitution to enable Parliament to sit even after the  formation of a caretaker cabinet. According to the SDS leader,  the fact that the Socialists are trying to launch the prolonged  and complex parliamentary procedure for amending of the  constitution comes to show that they are the ones who fear early  election, not the SDS. The ex-Communists fear elections like  hell, Filip Dimitrov also said.</p>

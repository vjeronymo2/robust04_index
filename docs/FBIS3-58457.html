			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with former neo-Nazi Ingo Hasselbach by </F> Alexandra Foederl-Schmid in Berlin; date not given: "`Anyone Can  Build a Bomb'"]    [Excerpt] Berlin -- Since last year he has been in refuge  from his former friends: Ingo Hasselbach, who used to be a  leading figure among German neo-Nazis, has "quit." The man from  East Berlin was the head of a neo-Nazi squatting action at  Berlin's Weitlingstrasse 122, and he was also briefly the head  of Berlin's National Alternative, a local organization belonging  to the NSDAP-AO [National Socialist German Workers  Party--Foreign Organization] operating from the United States.    Twenty-six-year old Hasselbach now lives abroad. Two months  ago, he was sent a letter bomb, camouflaged as a shipment of  books, at his mother's address. It contained TNT, which did not  explode because a battery had run out. According to police  explosives experts, the bomb could have destroyed three floors  of the house.    Talking to DER STANDARD during a short visit to Germany,  Hasselbach draws parallels between the attack on him and the  series of letter-bomb attacks in Austria. "There is a common  style to them all," he said.    It comes as no surprise to him that "something would happen  after Gottfried Kuessel's conviction [for neo-Nazi activities]."  While Kuessel, the leader of Austria's neo-Nazis, was in prison  already, Hasselbach was still "fully involved in the scene, and  they were talking about actions at that time." [passage omitted]    According to Hasselbach, all active members of the  right-wing  scene are trained in handling explosives. He thinks the five  men arrested in connection with the Austrian letter-bomb attacks  -- of whom he knows Peter Binder, Hans Georg Ley, and Gerd  Endres personally -- have the necessary knowledge to build a  letter bomb: "Building such a bomb, following instructions, is  quite easy. There are instruction booklets available. It is  easy to buy the ingredients, especially for these nitroglycerine  bombs." Building instructions are available from Gerry Lauck's  NSDAP-AO, which operates out of Nebraska, in the United States.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Haider at Squad Meeting </H5>   Hasselbach was a regular guest of Gottfried Kuessel's in  Vienna. He attended training sessions and squad meetings there.  His book Die Abrechnung [Settling of Accounts] says  that "a well-known politician" appeared at one of these meetings  in April 1990. Talking to DER STANDARD, Hasselbach was more  precise: "It was Joerg Haider." He also said there were  "regular contacts" between Kuessel, Walter Ochensberger, and  Haider. "I even had his private phone number at one point.  Haider was particularly enthusiastic about the young people  coming over from the GDR." At a meeting in 1991, Haider  attended only briefly, but he specifically shook hands with the  people from Berlin.    Hasselbach considers the group around Kuessel to be "one of  the toughest in Europe." They are training new recruits  professionally, he said. [passage omitted].</p>

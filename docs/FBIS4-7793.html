			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 5 (TANJUG) -- Two members of the  civilian police and three armoured personnel carries of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) stationed in the former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) on Monday [4 April] twice violated  the territory of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), the Yugoslav  Army said in a statement on Tuesday.    Around noon on Monday, two UNPROFOR civilian policemen and a  local interpreter illegally entered three kilometres into  Yugoslav territory in a motor vehicle, the statement said.    Because of the illegal entry to Yugoslavia, they were taken  to the Slavujevac border post to explain the reasons of their  presence there.    Around 2:30 p.m. on the same day, three UNPROFOR armoured  personnel carriers [APC] illegally entered 300 metres into  Yugoslav territory, the statement said and added that the APCs  returned to their base in FYROM after an energetic action of  Yugoslav border guards.    This is the second time this year that the U.N. peacekeepers  deployed in FYROM have violated Yugoslavia's territorial  integrity.    In mid-January, two U.N. APCs manned with two U.S. and  three Norwegian soldiers illegally penetrated 500 metres deep  into Yugoslavia, also close to the Slavujevac border post.    About 800 U.N. peacekeepers, mainly from the United States,  were deployed last year in FYROM which unilaterally seceded from  the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991, to protect the  newly-formed state from an alleged threat coming from its  northern neighbour Yugoslavia.    The U.N. commander in FYROM said in his reports to the U.N.  secretary-general, however, that no danger is coming from the  north and that the Yugoslav-Macedonian border is calm and stable.    Some opposition parties in FYROM have urged Skopje to deny  hospitality to the U.S. troops "because their presence has  brought nothing good to any nation in the world: They brought  neither peace nor calm, but only the loss of sovereignty, war,  death, drugs and other troubles."</p>

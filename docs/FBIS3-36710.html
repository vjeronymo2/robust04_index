			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Postfactum Radio" feature] </F>   [Text] Today, a session of the Presidium of the Belarusian  Scientific-Industrial Association was held. It is obvious that  the most important issue in its agenda was the issue of the  merger of the Belarusian and Russian financial systems.  Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich delivered a speech  at this session. We are going to broadcast excerpts of his  speech addressing the gist of the protocol of the session of the  Russian-Belarusian commission of experts.    [Begin Kebich recording] Within three months, beginning with  the date of the merger of our monetary systems, the Republic of  Belarus will conduct payments of wages to staff employed in the  state budget sector according to a single wage scale, which is  being used in the Russian Federation. Belarus will finance  measures to ensure the social protection of the population at  the expense of the Republic's budget. However, this does not  mean that social payments will equal similar ones in Russia.  The National Bank of Belarus will allot credits -- at amounts  which were agreed upon with the Russian Finance Ministry and the  Central Bank of Russia -- to the Belarusian Government,  commercial banks of Belarus, and other loan providers. The  National Bank of Belarus can buy hard currency, precious stones,  and other valuables only at the request and at the expense of  the Belarusian Government and other legal bodies, and at the  expense of its own funds and profits. The National Bank of  Belarus buys payment notes, cash, and Russian currency above the  amount which it will receive within the single exchange of money  resulting from the monetary system merger [words indistinct] and  performs noncash transactions [words indistinct]. Correspondent  accounts will only be used for the sake of recording our mutual  accounts. This will differ from the current situation, whereby  these accounts are used to rigidly control (?the accounts), they  will only record trade operations performed between Russian and  Belarus. When the National Bank of Belarus hands back the  Russian payment notes, the Central Bank of Russia will transfer  appropriate sums to corresponding accounts in the National Bank  of Belarus.    The establishment of the exchange rate of the Russian and  Belarusian currencies is based on methods drafted by the Russian  National Committee for Statistics, located in Belarus, and  proceeds from the buying power of the national currencies and  [words indistinct]. The establishment of an exchange rate for  the Russian and Belarusian currencies is closely linked with  other procedures tied with the merger of the monetary systems  and the change of price scales in Belarus, so as not to bring  about, on the one hand, a decrease in net income and savings of  private individuals and legal bodies, and, on the other hand, an  increase in inflation in the newly merged financial system. The  Belarusian side, agreeing in general to the above-mentioned  methods of establishing an exchange rate for the Russian and  Belarusian currencies, proposes to estimate the monetary  resources of the population at a one-to-one rate, including  cash, savings, and deposit accounts.    The parties state that the creation of [words indistinct]  equal conditions for mutual trade, a single mechanism for  formulating free [word indistinct] prices, the distribution of  domestic Russian prices for energy and other recourses on the  territory of Belarus, the lifting of export customs duties on  trade between Russia and Belarus constitute the obligatory  condition for the existence of the single financial system.  Therefore, [words indistinct]. [end recording]    Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has also touched  upon the issue of a political strike which, as you know, is  scheduled to take place on 15 February.    [Begin Kebich recording] The situation is difficult [words  indistinct]. We (?will undertake all the measures to not permit  this strike.) The situation is different in various regions of  Belarus. However, [words indistinct]. The task is to [words  indistinct]. In my opinion, I do not have to agitate for [words  indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARRISH'S PERFORMANCE GIVES OFFENSE A LIFT;  </P> <P> ANGELS: CATCHER RESPONDS TO BLYLEVEN'S CRITICISM WITH THREE HITS, INCLUDING A  HOME RUN AND THREE RUNS BATTED IN.  </P> <P> Although no one admitted it, Bert Blyleven's motivational tactics apparently  hit home with Angel catcher Lance Parrish.  </P> <P> Parrish broke out of a three-for-23 slump Sunday, going three for four with a  home run in the Angels' 8-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Parrish's outburst -- which included a solo homer in the eighth inning, three  runs batted in and two runs scored -- followed some curt comments by Blyleven  after Saturday night's 7-1 loss to the Red Sox.  </P> <P> To put it bluntly, the Angel pitcher said the team's offense "stinks."  </P> <P> It wasn't the most constructive criticism Parrish has heard, but it appeared to  be effective. He and his teammates tagged four Boston pitchers for 12 hits,  tying a season high.  </P> <P> "Regardless of what's been said, I think our offense is coming around and being  aggressive," Parrish said. "I don't care to comment on Bert's comments. It has  been said. It's over and done with.  </P> <P> "It has been frustrating for everyone. But we sat down as a family, and as a  team, and aired it out."  </P> <P> The Angel players and coaches met for 40 minutes before Sunday's game to  discuss Blyleven's comments -- and the offense.  </P> <P> "I think the meeting had a lot to do with it," said right fielder Dante  Bichette, who was one for four Sunday. "I didn't read Bert's comments but I  heard about them at the meeting. It wasn't a big deal to me. I understand that  sometimes people get frustrated.  </P> <P> "Bert knows how to win and I think he saw some things that winning teams don't  do."  </P> <P> Blyleven watched Sunday as the Angel hitters made a winner of starter Chuck  Finley (5-2). Finley gave up eight hits and four runs before being relieved by  Bryan Harvey with one out in the eighth.  </P> <P> "Chuck has more or less been our stopper this year," Parrish said. "I have a  lot of confidence in him. If anyone is capable of turning this around, he is.  </P> <P> "We (the hitters) had to give him some support, though, and it's nice to be  able to do that."  </P> <P> That hasn't always been the case. While the bottom of the batting order has  failed to hit, the Angels have flirted with last place in the American League  West.  </P> <P> Just look at the averages entering Sunday's game:  </P> <P> Parrish, who bats eighth, was hitting .228 with four homers and nine RBIs.  </P> <P> Jack Howell, the No. 9 hitter, was in a one-for-26 slump.  </P> <P> Devon White, who moved from the leadoff position to the lower third of the  order, was batting .189 and had stolen only one base since April 14.  </P> <P> But Sunday, Howell was two for four, including a single that scored Wally  Joyner and Johnny Ray in the sixth and gave the Angels a 5-3 lead. White walked  twice and scored a run.  </P> <P> Besides his homer, Parrish doubled off the center-field wall in the second to  score Joyner and White. Parrish also singled and scored on a base hit by Donnie  Hill in the fifth.  </P> <P> The offensive outburst was timely, Parrish said. They begin an eight-game road  trip Tuesday night at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> "My experience in the past is that one game like this can make a big difference  in the emotional outlook for a club," Parrish said. "We have been on a serious  low, and this might fire us up a little bit.  </P> <P> "I look at today and see that we're capable of swinging the bat aggressively  and getting the clutch hits. And that's an important thing for a team to take  with it on the road."  </P> <P> Parrish's homer was his first at Anaheim Stadium since April 14. Opposing  outfielders have robbed him of four homers in the last two weeks with catches  at the wall.  </P> <P> As a result, Parrish was hesitant to start his home-run trot Sunday when he  knocked Wes Gardner's pitch deep into right field.  </P> <P> "I was looking to see where the outfielders were when I hit it," Parrish said.  "All I could do was make solid contact. I can't do anything about it, whether  it goes over the fence or they catch it. I have to take the same frame of mind  up there each time.  </P> <P> "I felt unfortunate about the way things turned out in the last week, but I  know they (the outfielders) can't catch them all."  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Slim Home Office watches weight: Kenneth Clarke's efficiency drive and how services are coming under increasing pressure from new ways to save public money - Public spending review / Home Office WHEN spending by government departments is presented in the familiar diagram of a sliced-up pie, the Home Office appears as a slimmer's portion. Its inclusion in the first phase of the Whitehall public spending review, alongside far bigger-spending departments, no doubt partly reflects the fact that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, is already trying to think the unthinkable in his department and might welcome the review process to concentrate minds. It also sends a signal that even services as close to the heart of the state as police, prisons and immigration are not immune from questioning and new ideas. When, in the mid 1980s, free-market think tanks started advancing the idea of private prisons, it was treated as eccentric. Britain now has two privately managed prisons and is likely to gain more soon. But will Mr Clarke go further? The government's approach is still cautious - prisons are privately managed rather than privatised, remaining under Home Office ownership. Ministers want the prison department, which becomes an agency operating the Pounds 1.6bn a year service at arm's length from the government in April, to develop performance-related pay and modernise prison management and industrial relations. Introducing competition is as much about shaking up the public sector as moving towards a privately run service. But if private management proves successful the few voices in the Conservative party that argue for all-out privatisation could be encouraged. Few private companies would hope to gain in either profit or prestige from owning some of Britain's appalling, Victorian prisons. But a Pounds 1bn building programme is nearing completion and by the mid 1990s considerable sections of the prison estate might attract the interest of private owners. Mr Clarke will be able to show the review that when it comes to the police - his other big spending area - the drive for better value for money is already a top priority. For the past decade the police came top of the league for public spending increases - the service consumes nearly Pounds 6bn a year in England and Wales and staff costs account for 80 per cent of this. 'Civilianisation' - transferring administration, control and other tasks from police officers to civilians - has saved Pounds 130m and there will be more. Radio communications services will be privatised, with other support activities likely to follow. International experience does not suggest that hiving off entire areas of police responsibility - perhaps establishing a separate traffic agency - would increase cost-effectiveness or operational efficiency. If the spending review produced a determined wave of new radicalism, might the Home Office's array of responsibilities throw up any more 'impossible' ideas - such as private prison management in the 1980s - that could come to fruition in the 1990s? The Adam Smith Institute has pointed to the fire service. The future organisation of fire services - at present a Pounds 1.2bn a year function - will have to be considered by ministers as part of their review of local government. In the US a few localities have privately run fire brigades operating under contract to public authorities. The fire service will not necessarily remain immune from the government's overall policy goal of turning local authorities into contract-awarding and monitoring bodies rather than providers of services. Eight companies bid to run Wolds remand centre on Humberside, the first privately managed prison, even though the British private sector had no previous expertise in prison management. At least as many would be likely to show interest in fire services. The service would also lend itself to local contract-bids from officers and staff or even management buy-outs. If the idea seems far-fetched it should be remembered that, in the early 1980s, almost no local authorities con-tracted out refuse-collection services. The most dramatic opportunity for the Home Office could involve the voluntary sector, where the government is trying to encourage charities to take over delivery of welfare and other services from statutory agencies. The problem is that most voluntary organisations face even greater financial pressures than the government. Proposals to run a generic marketing campaign to increase individual and corporate support for charity collapsed last month - because the Home Office would not contribute Pounds 1.5m to the cost. In this area the Home Office might have to tell Mr Michael Portillo - who heads the review - that it will have to spend now to save later.</p>

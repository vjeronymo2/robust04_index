			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Major to face Lords assault on Europe AN EMBATTLED Mr John Major was last night preparing for a fierce assault on his European policies when the Maastricht bill is introduced into the House of Lords. With disenchantment at the prime minister's leadership threatening to spread through Tory ranks, Lady Thatcher is expected today to spearhead calls for a Maastricht referendum from a distinguished list of Euro-sceptic peers. A record 133 peers have asked to speak in what is certain to be the most highly-charged Lords debate in years. Lady Thatcher's contribution is expected to be followed tomorrow by an equally trenchant attack from Lord Tebbit, the former Tory party chairman. Though the Lords can only delay the measure and though this week's debate is highly unlikely to end in a vote, the publicity it will generate could not have come at a worse time for the prime minister. The bill completed its tortuous Commons passage last month almost exactly a year after receiving its second Commons reading. With pressure mounting for the prime minister to reassert his authority, Labour is planning to take advantage of his current weakness by staging a set-piece debate on government policies on Wednesday to follow hard on the heels of the Maastricht exchanges. The occasion will give Mr John Smith, Labour leader, a rare opportunity to take the prime minister on head-to-head in a full-length Commons debate. Mr Smith is expected to emphasise broken Conservative pledges. As senior Tories attempted to rally round Mr Major, the party's morale was dented further by the results of weekend opinion polls. A survey of 52 constituency party chairmen - normally regarded as an ultra-loyal group - found that more than a quarter of them wanted the prime minister replaced. The poll, conducted by the Sunday Times, showed that a clear majority of constituency chairmen were dissatisfied with the government's performance. Coming after last week's Gallup poll, which showed Mr Major to be the most unpopular prime minister since polling began more than 50 years ago, the survey will reinforce the impression that last month's cabinet reshuffle has failed to lift the cloud hanging over the prime minister. In a further blow, an NOP poll for the Mail on Sunday in the Christchurch constituency showed the Conservatives could be facing a second consecutive by-election defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats. The survey gave the Liberal Democrats, on 53 per cent, a 15-point lead over the Tories, with Labour, backed by just 7 per cent, in distant third place. The result represented a 27 per cent swing from the Conservatives, who will be defending a majority of more than 23,000, to the Liberal Democrats. In last month's Newbury by-election, the Liberal Democrats achieved a swing of 28 per cent in winning by 22,000 votes. Nearly three-quarters of those questioned said that the cabinet reshuffle in which Mr Norman Lamont was replaced as chancellor by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the former home secretary, had made no difference to their voting intentions. Though a date for the Christchurch by-election has yet to be fixed, there are increasing expectations it will be set for mid-July. Meanwhile, with more Lords expected to submit requests to speak in this week's debate ahead of today's midday deadline, anti-Maastricht peers have made representations to the government whips for it to be allowed to continue into a third day. The committee stage of detailed line-by-line consideration will follow later this month. Heseltine challenged over Nadir, Page 6 Clan hatreds divide, Page 12</p>

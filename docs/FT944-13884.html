			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Chinese gear up for huge rise in cars by 2010 China's cars are projected to rise in numbers to 22m by the year 2010, with individual ownership increasing sharply to 60 per cent of all vehicles on the country's roads, against less than 5 per cent at present, an authoritative study says. This predicted increase of car ownership and production in China will clearly have enormous implications for the automotive sector internationally. The study, by a group within the Chinese bureaucracy called the Strategic Development Research Team of China's Family Car, forecast that by 2010 China will build 3.5m cars a year, with two-thirds of them being sold to private motorists. Total production value of the automotive sector will reach Yn420bn (Pounds 31.6bn) a year, with an extra Yn1,052bn being generated by associated industries. The study estimated the automotive sector would be generating Yn80bn annually in tax revenue by 2010 and would have created 15m new jobs. 'Having a family car will signal that a Chinese citizen's life has turned from a moderately well-to-do to a rich one,' the study reported. Publication this week in the Economic Daily of the study coincides with a debate within the Chinese bureaucracy about the desirability of increased private car ownership. Mr He Guangyuan, minister of machinery industry warned this week against the danger of 'old attitudes' to car ownership hindering development. 'If we can't see how necessary it is for car-ownership to become widespread and don't actively support a private car market, it would be hard for car-making to become a pillar industry,' he told the China Business Times newspaper. Rapid development of the automotive sector is meeting opposition from bureaucrats who see car ownership as bourgeois. Sections of government fear China's infrastructure would be unable to cope with so many cars on an over-taxed road system. China recently unveiled a new car industry policy that envisages the establishment of three or four car manufacturing conglomerates by 2000, engaged in the mass production of family sedans. The policy instituted a freeze on new manufacturers entering China until 1996 to enable present operators to build up strength. Volkswagen, in partnership with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, is China's biggest maker of passenger cars. In 1993 it built 100,000 Santanas, a medium-sized family car, out of a total of 234,000 sedans made throughout China, which plans to be producing 1.35m passenger cars a year by 2000, with 90 per cent of the market supplied from local production. Output would rise to 3.5m-4m units by the year 2010. From 1979 to 1993 the number of cars in China grew from 150,000 to 1.4m, of which 50,000 are privately owned. Cars owned by individuals or families will amount to about 20 per cent of total cars on the road in China in 2000. Percentages of individual car ownership would rise to 40 per cent in 2005 and 60 per cent in 2010.</p>

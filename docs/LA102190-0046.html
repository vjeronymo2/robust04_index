			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN UNLIKELY PROTECTOR OF A MUCH-ACCLAIMED SANDINISTA LEGACY;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: EVERYONE EXPECTED NEW PRESIDENT CHAMORRO TO DISMANTLE THE COUNTRY'S  HEALTH SYSTEM. NOW SHE STRIVES TO SAVE IT.  </P> <P> When Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated Sandinista President Daniel Ortega in  Nicaragua's elections last February, many expected her administration to waste  little time in revamping one of the most celebrated of Sandinista legacies --  the country's health system. The new president's party platform had even called  for abolishing it.  </P> <P> But Chamorro's new health minister says he has no intention of dismantling the  system built after the ouster of dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1978. The system  is based on the principle that health is a right of all 3.7 million Nicaraguans  and the responsibility of the government to maintain.  </P> <P> The minister, Dr. Ernesto Salmeron, is a rotund 47-year-old pediatrician who  has become perhaps the most controversial member of Chamorro's Cabinet because  of his determination to preserve what is regarded as one of the most  revolutionary Sandinista reforms.  </P> <P> "There is nothing to change in the health system except its efficiency,"  Salmeron declared in a recent interview.  </P> <P> Chamorro's support for Salmeron has angered the conservative elements of her  coalition party, the National Opposition Union (UNO), as well as physicians who  want to privatize the national health system. Her decision has also created  special problems for the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). For  most of the '80s, the United States backed the Contra forces fighting the  Sandinistas; during the elections, it embraced UNO's reform platform.  </P> <P> After having no presence in Nicaragua for the past eight years, the agency is  now responsible for dispensing the $300 million in economic aid to Nicaragua  that Congress appropriated after Chamorro's victory. According to Janet  Ballentyne, mission director in Managua, $225 million has been spent on  emergency economic recovery and repatriating the Contras and refugees, with  about $11.6 million going to health. The remaining $75 million will be divided  up among education, health, nutrition, agriculture and similar development  enterprises.  </P> <P> For health care, the agency must now grapple with the politics of deciding what  kind of health care to support and to which groups in Nicaragua to give the  money. "The minister of health probably has the most difficult job in a country  full of people with difficult jobs," Ballantyne said.  </P> <P> During its early years, the health system acquired an international reputation  for its achievements in lowering the infant mortality rate, conducting  vaccination programs and promoting prevention services. Assistance came from  dozens of U.S.-based private agencies, which sent manpower, money and medical  resources to Nicaragua. The aid helped prevent a total collapse of the system.  </P> <P> But after eight years of war and an economic blockade, Nicaragua's health  system faces mounting epidemics, hospitals in disrepair, a scarcity of drugs  and supplies, and a ruined economy.  </P> <P> Currently, the health ministry is drawing up a five-year plan, in which AID  will participate, to prioritize the nation's health needs. A major fight is  over whether primary health care -- immunization, nutrition, sanitation and so  on -- or more complex and expensive hospital care -- open-heart surgery and  nuclear medicine -- should receive top priority.  </P> <P> Many physicians, particularly the specialists whose skills require  high-technology surroundings, are pressuring the government to devote a higher  percentage of the health budget to upgrading hospitals and spending more on  curative medicine. Salmeron flatly opposes spending money on exotic hospital  care at the expense of primary care.  </P> <P> "As long as I remain minister of health, that will not happen," he said. "We  have a people with a low cultural level, with no good housing, no water  supplies and electrification. We must provide potable water, good housing,  electrification and education on how to prevent disease. Then we can start with  something better."  </P> <P> To date, nearly all the $11.6 million that AID has awarded for health has been  allocated to private, voluntary organizations uninvolved in Nicaragua during  the Sandinista reign. Only $100,000 -- for an immunization program -- has gone  to the ministry of health for primary care. Nearly $4 million has been given to  private organizations for hospital services.  </P> <P> But Ballantyne predicted that when the five-year plan is ready, it will  emphasize primary care. In that case, AID will support it with "a great deal of  technical and financial expertise."  </P> <P> Ballantyne's promise assumes that Salmeron will be successful at carrying out  his crusade for primary care. Whether he will last long enough to achieve his  goal is uncertain. In the beginning, Salmeron recalled, he was concerned about  his future; now, he feels secure.  </P> <P> Just before the February election, conservative medical leaders of UNO said  they would replace the unified national health system with one similar to the  shamefully inadequate system under Somoza, which favored the wealthy and middle  class.  </P> <P> Salmeron said he thrice turned down Chamorro's offer to become health minister  before accepting it. A deeply religious person, he believes it is his mission  to do "what is best for the poor." Salmeron quit a $4,000-a-month position with  the Pan American Development Foundation to take the $350-a-month ministerial  post.  </P> <P> The health minister appears not to have strong political beliefs. "(T)he  radical group in UNO thinks I am a Sandinista and the radical group among  Sandinistas think I am some kind of counterrevolutionary."  </P> <P> Besides the privatizers in UNO, Salmeron's opponents include conservatives in  the State Department, which consistently has been unsupportive of governments  that rely on public agencies to solve the problems of the poor. When in the  United States to learn more about our health system, Salmeron was  cold-shouldered in Washington by officials of various government agencies from  which he was seeking assistance to revive Nicaragua's health services.  </P> <P> On a visit to Miami, Salmeron said he tried to persuade the hundreds of  Nicaraguan physicians who emigrated there during the 1980s to return home. To  his knowledge, none have done so. "They are taking their time to see how things  are going."  </P> <P> Salmeron also believes that most of the doctors left Nicaragua not because they  disliked the Sandinistas but because they were afraid their children would have  to serve in the military and because "they like money."  </P></p>

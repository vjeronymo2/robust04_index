			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed by "T.L." and "V.D.": "The Future of </F> Macedonia Is in its Integration Into Europe"]    [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  visited Prilep today at the invitation of the dean of the Prilep  Economics Faculty. In the crowded hall of the faculty President  Gligorov talked to the students and businessmen of the town and  the commune about foreign influences and the present situation  in the state. "As a country that has achieved international  legitimacy, as a member of the United Nations, Macedonia, being  an independent state, must build its strategy from the positions  that it takes on political and economic matters." This was the  beginning of President Kiro Gligorov's speech. He then stressed  the central location of our country and that this is why  Macedonia and all the countries surrounding it must strive for  peace in the Balkans.    "In the present situation we are burdened with worries about  the blockades and embargoes, but the moment the borders open we  shall see the real significance of Macedonia's position,"  President Gligorov emphasized. "If we construct good neighborly  relations with the states surrounding us, our state will become  a country of initiatives and economic advantages, and the  potential for our economy will then come to full fruition. We  wish no new divisions in the Balkans because they will keep the  nations in permanent conflict. Our membership in the European  Union is a must. It represents an enormous national market, a  factor in the economic life of the Union's countries. Small  countries always make their living by exchanging goods on big  markets.    Macedonia is an open country -- it has proved this through  its international activities and its efforts with neighboring  and other European and world countries to include itself in the  world's telecommunications system, to become a member of  international institutions, and to construct railroads and roads  to states with which it was not previously connected.    "An end must be put to the war," Gligorov said. "We must  restructure the economic, political, and democratic processes  with a view to coming close to Europe and following the European  norms of development.... The essential privatization process,  which is stagnant in the neighboring countries because of  criminal and mafia activities, with their far-reaching  consequences, must be implemented in our country in a democratic  way through a permanent concern for the individual, even if  democracy is not always ideal."    President Gligorov also spoke about the need for help from  those financial institutions of which Macedonia is a member,  about open borders and the free flow of ideas and goods, about  the census, which is expected to demonstrate the real situation  in the state, although now every kind of statistical  manipulation is emerging from particular interests.    "I am not worried about the present situation because we  have  large horizons open in front of us and every attempt to attack  or endangering Macedonia will be faced by great resistance and  everybody is aware of the consequences that may arise in the  Balkans and generally," President Gligorov said, and continued:  "Others did not think that Macedonia could survive  independently, first of all in the economic sense.  Nevertheless, those ideas did not come about. The most  important thing for us is not to let internal conflicts happen.  We can overcome everything else.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: HIGH TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> GENERAL AUTOMATION PURCHASES RIGHTS TO 2 COMPUTER SYSTEMS  </P> <P> General Automation Inc., an Anaheim-based computer company, said Monday that it  has purchased the rights to sell two lines of computer systems from Motorola  Inc. for $36 million.  </P> <P> Under a multiyear agreement, Motorola Computer Group in Tempe, Ariz., will  manufacture its Delta Series 3000 and Delta Series 8000 computers for General  Automation, which will resell the computers to its own customers.  </P> <P> Leonard Mackenzie, General Automation's president, said the agreement  strengthens a seven-year relationship between the company and Motorola. Under  that deal, General Automation has been building minicomputers based on  Motorola's family of microprocessors.  </P> <P> General Automation will customize the computers by enabling them to run the  company's business software applications based on the Pick and Unix operating  systems, the basic software that controls the execution of programs within a  computer. Unix is a popular, easy-to-use system that can accommodate many users  at one time; Pick is designed for running business software applications.  </P> <P> "We have been extremely pleased with Motorola's products and cooperation,"  Mackenzie said. "Motorola continues to work with us to provide our company a  clear picture of their current and future development programs."  </P> <P> Sherwood King, vice president of sales for General Automation, said the company  will continue to manufacture its own line of computers based on the Pick  operating system.  </P> <P> However, he said the company saw a need to expand its line to include computers  based on the Unix operating system. The easiest way to do that was to purchase  the rights from Motorola, he said.  </P> <P> Warren Blossom, vice president of sales at Motorola's commercial products  division in Cupertino, said General Automation can target customers in Europe  and Asia with the computers purchased from Motorola. He said volume shipping  will begin in January.  </P></p>

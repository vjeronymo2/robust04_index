			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (7): Mrs Mopp gets polished - Cleaning Services the Mrs Mopp of flowered pinafore and crinkled stocking fame - getting someone else to do the dirty work has become a sophisticated multi-billion pound industry. Commercial contract cleaning - sometimes thought of as a Cinderella industry  -has tried on the glass slipper and it fits, to the tune of being worth Pounds 2bn in a private and public sector cleaning market worth Pounds 4.3bn. It also appears to be buttoned up against the chill wind of recession better than most as companies seeking to cut overheads contract out services and it continues to sop up the gravy poured by government's privatisation of the public sector. The major player is Initial Contract Services - a subsidiary of BET - while other big league names include Office Cleaning Services, ISS Servisystem and RCO Support Services. The modest capital outlay involved in setting up as a contract cleaner makes it the perfect breeding ground for the entrepreneur and it is believed there are more than 5,000 small businesses throughout the UK. Not surprisingly the scope of services, like the companies offering them, vary enormously in size and sophistication - from a cleaner armed with a tin of polish and a Hoover to one with the specialist knowledge to clean a hospital operating theatre. At one end of the scale, services would cover a full-time manager and staff on site responsible for everything from dusting light fittings to degreasing the canteen while at the other there will be a couple of cleaners working a few evenings a week. Some companies offer frill or luxury services such as sprucing up telephones and office equipment or doing extra cleaning at weekends - it is in this area that the industry appears to have seen some of the recession's effects as clients prune costs by getting back to basics. However, according to Mr John Hall, director-general of the Cleaning and Support Services Association, whose membership makes up 80 per cent of the industry, the market on the whole is extremely buoyant. Mr Hall says: 'Generally speaking there has been increased performance by between 11 and 15 per cent a year over the past five years.' He attributes this to recession-hit companies cutting costs by putting ancillary services out to tender and what he describes as the pro-active government approach - opening up the public sector to market forces. Compulsory competitive tendering for NHS catering, laundry and domestic services was introduced in 1983 and for local authority services in 1988. Mr Hall estimates that 28 per cent of NHS and 30 per cent of local authority cleaning business is now in the hands of the private sector. Initial Contract Services claims to be one of the largest providers of contracted out cleaning services to the NHS and local government. Its healthcare services division, according to Ms Jennie Harvey, its director, has an annual revenue of Pounds 35m. 'A lot of hospital contracts are still in house at the moment but we have made a few million this year and expect to make a few million next year,' says Mr Mark Aldridge, ICS chief executive. 'Steady growth is the order of the day in a niche market which demands high quality service.' Ms Harvey explains that hospital cleaning contracts are about controlling infection and not just about tidying up. Her staff not only clean but also carry out patient-related work: that varies from one hospital to another, but covers serving meals, preparing d r i n k s, making beds and changing curtains. At Office Cleaning Services, Mr Peter Goodliffe, acting managing director, says the company has moved from a standing start two years ago to an annual turnover of Pounds 10m in local government and NHS contracts. 'By introducing compulsory competitive tendering, the government opened up an enormous area of business potential,' he says. 'This sector is the main expanding area in contract cleaning and is three times the size it was 10 years ago.' As the industry expands into more specialist areas, so has training in techniques and the use of chemicals and equipment. Plans are currently in the pipeline for a new national basic cleaning qualification to be introduced by the end of 1992 and training is now a matter of course for a large number of companies. Mr Goodliffe says that more than half of his full-time operational staff are currently on in-house training schemes. 'Over the past 10 years there has been a quantum leap in how much training goes on - qualified staff are essential if we are going to compete,' he explains.</p>

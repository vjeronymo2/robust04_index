			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Citicorp increases stock offering to 68m shares CITICORP, the leading US bank, was yesterday reported to be increasing its preferred stock offering to 68m shares from 42m in order to raise Dollars 1bn in capital, above the bank's earlier Dollars 650m target. The preferred equity redemption cumulative shares (Percs) were priced late yesterday at Dollars 14.75 to yield 8.25 per cent a share. The yield is at the top end of expectations. Other terms of the offer include a 37.49 per cent capped price premium on the securities. It is the second time that Citicorp has increased the Perc offering, which was originally planned at 32.5m shares. The move comes in the wake of last week's events at Citicorp, which included the resignation of the bank's president, Mr Richard Braddock, and the disclosure that its third-quarter earnings would include large write-offs, including Dollars 870m in the consumer division. Citicorp has been scrambling this year to boost its capital by disposing assets and issuing stock. Wall Street analysts believe the bank is also planning to offer up to Dollars 1bn of ordinary shares to further shore up its capital base. However, Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, said that this may be the last external move to raise capital, depending on economic conditions.</p>

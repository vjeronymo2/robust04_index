			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / German Elections: SPD leader unbowed after defeat in German polls Mr Rudolf Scharping was sitting relatively pretty as the dust settled yesterday on one of Germany's closest election results in years. And he seemed content to sit tight. Looking slightly more relaxed than during pre-election encounters with the press, the leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD) said he would give the government no quarter over the next four years. 'Nothing will get done without the Social Democrats,' he said. True, Mr Scharping has not managed to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl and many party members, exasperated by 12 years of Mr Kohl, were obviously disappointed. He had also not fought the most inspiring election campaign, allowing a lead of several percentage points in the spring to be turned into a 5.1 point bonus for Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. He did, however, manage to improve on the party's dismal performance in 1990 when it won just 33.5 per cent. The odds were also against him: no modern German government has fallen at the elections; they have collapsed mid-term with the break-up of the governing coalition. Had Mr Scharping made it, he would also have been the first state premier to manage the leap from a provincial capital directly to the chancellor's office in Bonn. Most importantly, party members and outside observers were agreed that Mr Scharping had emerged from Sunday's vote unchallenged as the party's leader. For the time being at least he has fended off a challenge from Mr Gerhard Schroder, the ambitious state premier of Lower Saxony, whose differences with Mr Scharping had several times caused confusion in SPD ranks. Once again, though, it seems Mr Schroder will have to play second fiddle. Mr Scharping denied any prospects of a grand coalition and seemed content yesterday to sit out Mr Kohl's new and weaker coalition and wait his turn. That could happen in two ways. The Free Democratic party (FDP), the small liberal party which has been in coalition with the CDU since 1982, might decide in the next few years to transfer its allegiance and support the SPD, reversing the move it made 12 years ago when it caused the collapse of the then SPD government. A more plausible, though still distant, possibility is that the CDU and SPD move closer together over the next four years if it becomes apparent that Mr Kohl's new 10-seat government majority is becoming untenable. Such a grand coalition does in practice already exist. Mr Kohl has a majority of just 10 seats in the Bundestag, while the SPD controls just over 60 per cent of the votes in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber which represents Germany's 16 Lander, and which approves all Bundestag legislation. The parallels with Mr Kohl bode well for Mr Scharping's future. Both were state premiers of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the wine-growing southwestern German state. Now Mr Scharping hopes that he will today be endorsed as the leader of the SPD's parliamentary party aged 46, as Chancellor Kohl was when he took over his party in Bonn in 1976. Mr Kohl had to wait just six years before he managed to move from parliament into the chancellor's office.</p>

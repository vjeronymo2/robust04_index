			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 20 SAPA -- Progress was reportedly made  in Pretoria on Thursday to bring the Pan Africanist Congress  [PAC] back into the transition process. In talks, the government  and the PAC agreed to establish three working committees to meet  as early as next week to take further Thursday's "exploratory  meeting".    A possible first meeting between President F W de Klerk and  PAC leader Clarence Makwetu was also raised "and may be taken  further", a government spokesman said afterwards.    The two sides met for two hours at the offices of government  chief negotiator Roelf Meyer. The issues discussed were:    -- whether there should be one or two ballot papers on April  27. The PAC, like the Freedom Alliance, wants one for the  national government and one for the provincial government;    -- amnesty for members of the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian  Peoples Liberation Army, in the wake of the PAC's suspension of  its armed struggle;    -- the PAC's participation in the Transitional Executive  Council. The PAC announced it would join the body only if there  was joint control over all the country's armed forces; and    -- the PAC's participation on the executive council  sub-council on defence. Some executive council participants have  argued that PAC representation on the sub-council would meet its  demand for proper joint control over the armed forces.    The government's Departments of Defence, Justice and  Constitutional Development will together with PAC representation  form the three working committees. "The most important thing we  want to discuss with government is the question of one ballot or  two ballots," PAC negotiator Gora Ebrahim told SAPA.    The PAC had consistently favoured two ballots, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic] </F>   [Text] The residents of Gorazde spent the worst night of  their lives last night, most of them in the streets as there is  not enough accommodation for all those who barely managed to  save their lives from the chetnik attack on the town's suburbs  and the town itself yesterday. The town hospital also lacks  accommodation.    There is an increasing number of wounded. In this chaos no  one knows their exact number, nor the number of those killed.  It is only known that there are very many. Owing to the close  proximity of the chetniks to the city center, those (?killed)  cannot be evacuated nor buried, nor is it possible to take the  wounded to hospital.    So, Gorazde is dying by itself in the worst possible pain  before the very eyes of the entire international public. [Words  indistinct] is a lie that the UN yesterday sent 336 troops, who  have allegedly stopped the chetniks in their bloody advance  toward the center of the town. The purpose of that information  was only to enable the chetniks to gain time to kill, conquer,  destroy, and torch in peace. Which they did and are still doing  in the most brutal way.    They are hunting down the (?confused) people with snipers  from the (?nearby) hills. In the general chaos that reigns in  [word indistinct] streets, the people do not know what to do nor  (?where to go). The chetniks have been killing these people with  bombs, snipers, and antiaircraft weapons. They are killing them  this morning, too.    The chetniks are receiving tacit support from the UN for  these crimes. Because of these crimes, Mr. Akashi is daily  going to the criminals in Pale to congratulate them on killing  children, women, and the elderly. At the same time he is saying  that the conditions were not ripe for air strikes against the  murders of these civilians.    The situation this morning is the same as yesterday, a shade  worse, because the town is full, brimming with new refugees who  have come from the town's closest suburbs. The chetniks are  continuing to strangle Gorazde. Gorazde's streets are being  fired on by snipers, and with [M-]84's, anti-aircraft machine  guns, tanks, and even mortars. The encirclement of the city  center is becoming tighter and tighter. NATO aircraft are still  overflying the bloody Gorazde skies, not to help the people of  Gorazde, but to film the last moments of the life of these  people.</p>

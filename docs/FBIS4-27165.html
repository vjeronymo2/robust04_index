			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United  States agreed to extend their interim trade negotiating channel  for one year, the Foreign Ministry announced Saturday, ending  speculation that the channel would be closed due to trade  friction between the two countries.    Assistant Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs Son  Chun-yong, Seoul's top representative at the South Korea-U.S.  Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC), talked with Daniel  Tarullo, assistant secretary of state for economic and  agricultural affairs, over the phone Friday evening and agreed  to the extension, the ministry said.    Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Bill Clinton launched the DEC at  a summit in July 1993. Seoul hoped to keep the DEC functioning  for one more year, but strained trade relations with Washington  blurred the prospects until Thursday's final decision, ministry  officials said.    The 12th South Korea-U.S. economic consultation opens  between  the two nations' vice foreign ministers in Washington on June  22, with a final report by the DEC to be adopted.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: TVB wins go-ahead for satellite service Television Broadcasts (TVB), a Hong Kong broadcaster, is poised to compete with Star TV, News Corporation's Asian satellite television arm, following government approval enabling the domestic company to establish a pan-Asian satellite service. The colony's broadcasting authority gave the local station permission to broadcast regionally, but not in Cantonese, the dialect of Hong Kong and southern China. TVB has no immediate plans to capitalise on its new freedom. It will instead concentrate on the Taiwan market and broadcasting encrypted signals which are decoded by local cable operators. Mr Alfred Ng, assistant general manager and company secretary, said: 'We believe our current strategy of selling decoders to cable head-ends, allowing them to distribute our signals, is correct.' It is a policy which appears to have paid off: TVB is among the colony's most profitable media companies, last year turning in a 42 per cent jump in net earnings to HKDollars 519.6m (USDollars 67.3m). Securing permission to broadcast regionally paves the way for TVB's main aim: to be granted a satellite uplink and downlink licence allowing it to bring signals directly to satellite. It currently employs Hongkong Telecom to carry signals and beam them up.</p>

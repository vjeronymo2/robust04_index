			<p>BFN     [Text] A sit-in began at 0600 this morning at the Katowice  steelworks. Twelve thousand workers have joined the strike so  far. All production and support sections of the steelworks are  at a standstill. The strike is supported by most of the trade  unions operating at the steelworks. The strike committee,  appointed by Sierpien-80 [August-80] trade union activists, is  demanding pay increases of 2,000,000 zloty per month, a  30-percent bonus and a one-time payment of 3,000,000 zlotys to  every striking worker.    The damping down of the iron blast furnace number 1 has  begun  and is expected to be completed by 1500. A rally of all staff  is planned for 1300.    The steelworks' management is still of the opinion that it  is  impossible to meet the strikers' demands, as this would quickly  lead to bankruptcy. The management has announced that it would  rather resign than give in to the demands.</p>

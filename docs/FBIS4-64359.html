			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [M. Abizanda report: "Defense Ministry Rejects U.S. Offer </F> for Purchase of 40 F-16 Aircraft"]    [Text] Madrid -- The Defense Ministry has responded in the  negative to the U.S. offer for the purchase of at least 40 F-16  fighter bombers at a unit price of 1 billion pesetas. The  Defense Ministry believes that the purchase of those aircraft,  despite their good price, would entail further expenditure since  this is a new weapons system, especially with respect to  providing maintenance for these fighter-bombers.    As ABC has already reported, the U.S. authorities offered  the  Defense Ministry a batch of their model "A" and "B" F-16's --  the oldest -- from their surpluses. These aircraft, built in  the late seventies, have been decommissioned or are on service  with the National Guard, as a result of the reduction of  aircraft in the U.S. Air Force and because they are surpassed in  their features by the "C" and "D" series F-16's. According to  sources consulted by this newspaper, the United States also  offered A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft.    Although the two types of aircraft -- both the F-16's, with  certain modernizations carried out in Spain, and the A-10's --  would have met one of the Air Force's chief needs, for tactical  missions and support for land units, the Defense Ministry  rejected the option to buy for economic reasons and because of  the purchase of 18 Mirage F-1's from France and Qatar. Among  other tasks, the F-16's would have filled the gap left by the  F-5A's, whose tasks are currently being fulfilled by C-101  training aircraft equipped with bomb targeting and launching  systems.    The department headed by Julian Garcia Vargas felt that the  purchase of these aircraft would have necessitated a major  effort to establish a maintenance network for a new weapons  system. This would be in clear contradiction to the line  pursued by the Air Force in the last three years, in  decommissioning various types of aircraft with a view to making  the air fleet more homogeneous so as to make maintenance more  flexible and cheaper. The purchase of the F-16's would also  have made it necessary to train pilots and maintenance  personnel. For these reasons, although the Defense Ministry  regards the good price for the planes as a major consideration,  the operation would have been much more costly taking a wider  view.    In addition, there are also political factors weighing  against the operation from the Defense Ministry viewpoint.  Sources consulted by this newspaper indicated that the partners  participating in the EF-200, the former EFA [European Fighter  Aircraft], would not take it very well for Spain to purchase  U.S. hardware now, when the project in question is entering a  decisive phase. In this respect, the case of Italy is fairly  similar to Spain's, since its F-104 Starfighters have now  outlived their service life and must be decommissioned, creating  a major gap in its Air Force, as happened with the Spanish Air  Force's F-5's.    The Defense Ministry and the Air Force have now decided on  the purchase of 18 Mirage F-1's from France and Qatar, in the  "C" and "ED" versions. It is hoped that these planes will  complete the fleet of these machines, which has been much  reduced because of a number of accidents, reducing the fleet to  50 planes from the original 60.    The planes from Qatar, according to Air Force sources,  consist of 12 single-seaters and one two-seater, and are  destined, in all probability, for the 11th Wing at Manises  (Valencia), which has hitherto also been equipped with Mirage  F-1's, but in the model in service in Spain, the F-1CE; these  will go back to their original unit, the 14th Wing at Los Llanos.</p>

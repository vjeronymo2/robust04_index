			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Cases in which ASCS must adjust, by increasing or decreasing, a payment which is to be paid under a contract in order to properly make other payments due by ASCS; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any case in which a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits using administrative offset to collect the debt for the type of debt involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Debts due ASCS or CCC may be collected by administrative offset from amounts payable by ASCS when: (1) The debtor has been provided written notification of the basis and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make payment. Such written notification and opportunity includes notice of the right to pursue an administrative appeal in accordance with part 780 of this chapter or any other applicable appeal procedures, if not previously provided;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The debtor has been provided an opportunity to request to inspect and copy the records of ASCS related to the debt;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The debtor has been given the opportunity to enter into a written agreement which is acceptable to ASCS for repayment of the debt;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The debtor has been notified in writing that the debt will be collected by administrative offset if not paid; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The debt has not been delinquent for more than ten years or legal action to enforce the debt has not been barred by an applicable period of limitation, whichever is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Administrative offset shall also be effected against amounts payable by ASCS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of ASCS or the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of a contract or a violation of ASCS program requirements, and offset is considered necessary by ASCS to protect the financial interests of the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) ASCS may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section if: (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice ASCS' ability to collect the debt; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) (1) Judgments in favor of the United States may be offset against any amounts payable by ASCS based on information provided by or obtained from the Department of Justice. Debts due any agency other than ASCS which have not been reduced to judgment shall be offset against amounts payable by ASCS to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government has submitted a written request for offset which is mailed or hand-delivered to the appropriate ASCS State office, Kansas City Financial Management Office, Kansas City Management Office, or Kansas City Commodity Office. Such written request must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Bear the signature of an authorized representative of the requesting agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Include a certification that all requirements of the law and the regulations for collection of the debt and for requesting offset have been complied with;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) State the name, address (including county), and, where legally available, the Social Security number or employer ID number of the debtor, and a brief description of the basis of the debt, including identification of the judgment, if any;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) State the amount of the debt separately as to principal, interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest, if any, shall be computed on a daily basis to a date shown in the request. The amount to be offset shall not exceed the principal sum owed by the debtor, plus interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment interest, penalties and administrative costs that have been assessed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy.

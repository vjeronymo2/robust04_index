			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Judge urges Arrow clarity THE issues behind future Blue Arrow trials should be clarified before proceedings start, the new judge in charge of the cases said yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr Justice Brooke told prosecution and defence lawyers there was 'considerable public concern' about the handling of such trials. He was anxious that issues be clarified and the amount of evidence reduced before juries were sworn in. He recently took over from Mr Justice McKinnon, who was widely criticised for his handling of the first trial, which lasted a year and four days. Proceedings against the four remaining defendants will be split into two trials, Mr Justice Brooke ruled. The trial of Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown, both former Phillips &amp; Drew equity directors, is expected to start in October. The trial of Mr Charles Villiers and Ms Elisabeth Brimelow, both former County NatWest directors, is expected to start early next year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Stacy Mosher] </F>   [Text] Mainland political dissident Han Dongfang has taken  his first step towards establishing himself in Hong Kong, by  taking a job. Yesterday the Hong Kong Christian Industrial  Committee (CIC) announced Han had accepted a job for a year as a  staff researcher, with a salary of about $10,000 a month. The  committee said Han would be responsible for "research in trade  unionism in support of CIC's long-standing programme of trade  union education and the promotion of solidarity among workers in  different parts of the world". The committee said Han's proven  commitment to the labour movement and his Christian beliefs made  him a valued addition to its staff.    Han led protests by nonofficial labour unions in Beijing  during the stormy run-up to the violent government crackdown on  June 4, 1989. After spending nearly a year in prison, he was  allowed to leave China with his wife, to seek medical treatment  in the United States in September 1992, for tuberculosis. In  August Han attempted to return to China through Hong Kong, but  was turned away by Chinese authorities. Subsequent attempts to  go back have also failed. Han has remained in Hong Kong on a  special one-month renewable visa for more than six months. A  legislative councillor, Lau Chin-shek, and the director of Asia  Watch, Robin Munro, have been his main supporters. Han says  Hong Kong will be his base for now, as he continues his work for  the Chinese labour movement.    A friend of Han's in Hong Kong said the committee would not  forbid Han from making further attempts to return to China. Han  applied for a work visa before the lunar new year, and was  granted one on Monday. His wife and one-year-old son remain in  the US. Han has no immediate plans to apply for them to come to  Hong Kong.</p>

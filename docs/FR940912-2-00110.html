			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Carcinogenicity studies with dichlorodiphenyl sulfone are planned with both sexes of rats and mice using the dosed feed route of administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 6. Elmiron (CAS No. 37319&hyph;17&hyph;8)_14-day studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elmiron is a pentosan polysulfate used as an experimental drug in the United States for the compassionate treatment of interstitial cystitis, and used in Europe to prevent thrombosis and hyperlipidemia. The United States Food and Drug Administration Nominated elmiron to the NTP as an ``orphan'' drug in need of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity evaluation. Currently, 14-day studies are being undertaken with oral administration of the drug to rats and mice, to determine if expected effects on the clotting system will be the basis on which to select doses for further evaluations. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity evaluations by standard designs are under consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 7. Benzophenone (CAS No. 119&hyph;61&hyph;9)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Benzophenone is found in many consumer products, e.g., as a fragrance and flavor enhancer, photoinitiator, ultraviolet curing agent, a polymerization inhibitor, and in the manufacture of pesticides and various pharmaceuticals. Benzophenone and the structurally related compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone were nominated for study from a class of ether compounds having widespread potential for human exposure. The carcinogenic potential of benzophenone has only been evaluated by topical administration to female Swiss mice. No indication of carcinogenicity was reported. In NTP 13-week studies, the oral administration of benzophenone was found to cause hepatocellular hypertrophy in rats and mice, and evidence of cholestatic liver injury and renal damage in rats. Marked induction of hepatic CYP 450 IIB was observed in rats and mice. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies proposed for this chemical are of the standard design, but with a stop exposure group using a dose which produced marked liver and kidney lesions in prechronic studies. Toxicokinetic studies are also planned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 8. 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (CAS No. 131&hyph;57&hyph;7)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone is a UV stabilizer used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and plastic products. Consumer exposure is likely greatest through its use in skin moisturizers and sunscreens where products containing up to 6% 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone are permitted. In NTP 13-week studies by the oral and topical routes, similar sites of toxicity were seen, primarily the liver and kidney, and effects on sperm density and the length of the estrous cycle were noted. Other NTP studies indicated that absorption was good after both oral and topical administrations, and major metabolites after intravenous administration were identified. Two-year studies of standard design are planned for this chemical by the oral route of administration rather than a topical one to provide information more comparable to that obtained with Benzophenone. In addition, the severity of the lesions in the topical prechronic studies was limited, indicating that a rigorous evaluation of the carcinogenicity of the chemical would be better achieved using oral administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 9. Methacrylonitrile (CAS No. 126&hyph;98&hyph;7)_2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. Methacrylonitrile is an industrial chemical widely used in a variety of organic processes related to the manufacture of polymers. It is a highly reactive unsaturated aliphatic nitrile found in cigarette smoke, and is known to liberate cyanide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methacrylonitrile has been studied extensively by the NTP including studies of 14-day and 90-day durations in rats and mice by gavage. In addition, absorption, disposition, toxicokinetics, cell proliferation and developmental toxicity studies have been performed. This chemical will be the subject of modeling efforts with physiologically-based-pharmacokinetic modeling techniques, and is also recommended for 2-year chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of a standard design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 10. Acrylonitrile (CAS No. 107&hyph;13&hyph;1)_2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. Acrylonitrile is extensively used for the manufacture of synthetic fibers, resins, elastomers, rubber and plastics. Estimated production is in the range of 30 million to 1.5 billion pounds per year. There is limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of acrylonitrile in workers and Zt has been shown to produce chromosome damage in the blood cells of exposed workers. Acrylonitrile has produced brain, stomach and zymbal gland tumors in 2-year studies in rats, but has not been studied in mice. Brain tumors are rare chemically induced lesions in rodents. There is little chance that the outcome of a mouse cancer study would change the classification of acrylonitrile as a rodent carcinogen, but given the quantitiative differences in acrylonitrile metabolism in rats and mice, it is possible that clues to possible critical metabolities will be gained from comparative studies in mice. Therefore, as part of the nitrile class study, acrylonitrile will be studied in mice by the standard NTP protocol. Toxicokinetic estimates will be derived by analysis of an acrylonitrile-glutathione conjugation product in the urine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

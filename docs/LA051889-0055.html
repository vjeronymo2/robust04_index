			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'WOMAN DEMON HUMAN': CHINESE ARTISTIC VISION  </P> <P> Writer-director Huang Shuqin's "Woman Demon Human" (opening Friday at the  Little Tokyo Cinema 2) begins as many films about actresses do: with the  heroine sitting at her dressing table looking back on her life as she makes up.  Although classic in form, this exquisite film by one of China's few women film  makers has so many distinctive details and is so clearly the work of a  liberated, reflective sensibility that it offers an altogether fresh  experience.  </P> <P> Huang's lovely heroine Qiu Yun (Xu Shouli) is only 30, but her life has already  been filled with accomplishment and heartbreak. The time is the present, as we  begin to flash back to Qiu Yun's childhood, but the settings are so primitive  as to seem in the distant past. For Qiu Yun is the child of traveling opera  performers who tour rural China in oxcarts and perform in the most makeshift  circumstances.  </P> <P> Her happy childhood is shattered when her mother runs off with another man.  From then on Qiu Yin will deal with every one of life's challenges and  disappointments by throwing herself into her career -- often quite literally,  for stardom in the Chinese opera requires the skills of both the gymnast and  the martial artist. Early on she has determined that she will break precedent  and demand to play the more physically demanding male roles.  </P> <P> The part that brings her fame is that of the ferocious-looking ghost of ancient  Chinese folklore, Zhong Kui, who zealously tries to marry off his beloved  sister. Throughout the film, a dreamlike performance of the one-act opera,  "Zhong Kui Marries Off His Sister," is intercut with Qiu Yun's memories as she  gradually accepts that this stellar demon (played by opera actress Pei Yanling)  has in effect married her to the stage.  </P> <P> In "Woman Demon Human" (Times-rated Mature for complex themes) the most  elaborate and glittery of costumes contrast with both the natural beauty of the  countryside and the simplicity of the opera company's attire and life style  offstage. What could have been a soapy old-fashioned "woman's picture" has  become a reverie on art as a way to salvation.  </P> <P> The second feature is another fine Chinese film, "The Old Well." On May 26:  "Desperation" and "Hibiscus Town," two more Chinese films. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET OPERA, PLAY OPEN SAN DIEGO ARTS FEST;  </P> <P> SPEECHES WELCOME A FINE 'BORIS GODUNOV' AT CIVIC THEATRE  </P> <P> It is always a bad sign when microphones are set up in front of the curtain.  That means speeches will delay the start of the significant business at hand.  That also can mean self-congratulation, puffery exchanges and socio-political  hyperbole.  </P> <P> And so it was Saturday night at the Civic Theatre. First Ian D. Campbell,  general director of the San Diego Opera, welcomed the dressy crowd to the  opening of his company's 25th anniversary season. So much for lyrical throat  clearing.  </P> <P> Next, Mayor Maureen O'Connor came on to gush about the simultaneous  inauguration of the San Diego Arts Festival, a three-week extravaganza  subtitled "Treasures of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> "Tonight," she declared, "San Diego has come of age as a great cosmopolitan  city." Ignoring any possible separation of church, state and art, she invoked  blessings from on high.  </P> <P> Then she introduced Mikhail Gribanov, the Soviet deputy minister of culture,  whose name seemed to escape her. Through an interpreter, he spoke of cultural  perestroika.  </P> <P> "Let's forget the bad sides of our relationship," he suggested, eliciting  enthusiastic applause.  </P> <P> Finally, it was time for "Boris Godunov," and a rather good "Boris Godunov" it  was. The fuss proved generally worthwhile.  </P> <P> Although one couldn't tell it from the program magazine, this did not turn out  to be Modest Mussorgsky's "Boris." It was Rimsky-Korsakov's time-dishonored,  slickly prettified version of Mussorgsky's sprawling, forceful and primitive  original.  </P> <P> The staging, moreover, fell a bit short of the festive ideal. Nathaniel  Merrill, the seasoned director from the old Met of Rudolf Bing, kept  vacillating between detailed realism and stock stylization. (The Russian masses  went in for slice-of-life violence in the Kromy Forest but impersonated the  stationary Imperial Choral Society of Moscow for Boris' coronation.) Wolfram  Skalicki's clever but flimsy sets, borrowed from Toronto, looked literal one  moment, sketchy the next.  </P> <P> Luckily, none of this mattered too much in context. "Boris Godunov," which San  Diego last experienced in 1972 with the unforgettable Norman Treigle as the  tormented czar, can be saved by an authoritative conductor and compelling  singing actors in the central roles. San Diego provided these in generous  abundance.  </P> <P> Musical matters were in the sensitive hands of Dzhansug Kakhidze, head of the  Tbilisi Opera in Georgia and one of Sarah Caldwell's secret weapons last year  at her coming-of-age Soviet-exchange festival in Boston. Despite limited  rehearsal time and a somewhat thin-sounding orchestra, he conducted with  urgency and eloquence predicated on a lifetime of specialized experience. He  also elicited an inspired performance from the expanded, all-important San  Diego chorus.  </P> <P> Kakhidze brought with him a Boris and Marina from the Kirov Opera in Leningrad  plus three secondary principals from his own company in Tbilisi. They all  testified to the unique values of a national operatic tradition.  </P> <P> Many aficionados still associate the title role with the virtuosic Feodor  Chaliapin and, in the process, think the challenge must invite vocal indulgence  and histrionic distortion. More recent Soviet bassos, however, have  demonstrated the power of restraint.  </P> <P> Tall, relatively youthful and eminently dignified, Alexander Morozov recalls  such contemporary models as Ivan Petrov and Yevgeni Nesterenko, but he is more  agitated than the former, more psychologically oriented than the latter. He  sings with the rolling, wide-ranging, subtly modulated tones that seem to be a  Russian birthright, commands the stage instantly and savors the expressive  impact of concentration and economy.  </P> <P> Gia Asatiani, as the old monk Pimen, complemented him with a slightly darker  and rougher basso. Despite his reliance on standard gestures, both dramatic and  vocal, he was imposing. Omar Khoperia, the third member of this low-voiced  Soviet triumvirate, introduced a hearty Varlaam who could be humorous without  resorting to buffo cliche and who scored his points with parlando finesse.  </P> <P> Irina Bogachova replaced the originally announced Elena Obraztsova, as Marina.  She conveyed the princess' wily, regal allure with much persuasion, even if her  lush mezzo-soprano was sometimes compromised by unsteadiness under pressure.  </P> <P> In the climactic laments of the Simpleton -- laments made somewhat redundant by  the reinstatement of the St. Basil Cathedral episode -- Teimuraz Gugushvili  capitalized on the luxury of a golden bel-canto tenor rather than the scratchy  sighs and whimpers to which we are accustomed. He was magnetic.  </P> <P> The Americans in the huge cast held their own, for the most part, honorably.  Allan Glassman sang the music of the false Dmitri ardently, acted with  convincing obsession and physically depicted the character fastidiously -- lame  arm, warts and all. Stephen West mustered a persuasive, Mephistophelian  Rangoni.  </P> <P> Martha Jane Howe contributed a lusty Innkeeper, Martha Jane Weaver a sweetly  feeble old Nurse. Sylvia Wen oozed proper purity as Xenia.  </P> <P> Thomas Booth, on the other hand, suggested little of the crucial duplicity of  Prince Shuisky, and Julia Jamison looked far stronger than she sounded as the  Tsarevitch, Feodor. Next to his Georgian sidekick, Bernard Fitch seemed  unusually bland as the vagabond monk Missail.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Technology: Co-operation at the highest level - A pioneeering European-Russian mission is focusing on the astronauts The Soyuz TM-20 due to blast off just before midnight last night from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is the first mission to carry astronauts from the European Space Agency alongside Russian cosmonauts. The spacecraft, carrying one ESA astronaut and two Russians, is heading for Russia's Mir space station - a permanently manned operational base orbiting 400km above the Earth. The 30-day mission not only heralds a new era in international space co-operation, it is also the longest space flight by a western European astronaut. 'This mission is paving the way to the International Space Station (a much-disputed project not yet under way) when European astronauts will live and work in space alongside Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Russians,' says Jean-Marie Luton, ESA's director general. Research during the Euromir 94 mission will focus on the effects of microgravity - the very low gravity environment of an orbiting spacecraft - on the the human body, information that will be needed if permanent manned orbiting facilities and interplanetary space flights are to take place. Profound changes take place in the human body during space flights. Astronauts' faces quickly become swollen because of the movement of body fluids from lower parts of the body towards the head. Disorientation is common. With longer exposure to microgravity, muscles tend to weaken without gravitational forces to work against, and bones lose minerals. At least 50 per cent of astronauts suffer from space sickness. It was once thought that osteoporosis (a disorder characterised by increased fragility of the bones) was controlled by hormonal reactions, yet in space it was found to be affected by disuse atrophy - the lack of mechanical forces acting on the bone structure. 'Ultimately it is believed that once a mechanism has been understood, a means to compensate for it can then be found,' says Heinz Oser, the senior life scientist in the ESA microgravity programme. The length of the Euromir 94 mission will allow many of the more subtle changes in the human body to be monitored over a longer period of time, increasing the validity of the results. Studies of the muscle system in particular will benefit. Other investigations will focus on the cardiovascular, neuro-sensory and skeletal systems. Sleep patterns, radiation effects and the body's immune system will also being studied.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Who's festival is it anyway?: A look at the origins of Christmas in ancient pagan rituals CHRISTMAS has little to do with Christ. This is not to say that a Christian festival has been hijacked by commercialism, although plenty of preachers, in their Christmas sermons, will assert precisely that. No: it means that neither the date nor the components of Christmas bear much relation to Gospel accounts of the birth of Christ, nor even to early Christian practice. The image of the babe born (away) in a manger among cattle (lowing) in (bleak) midwinter, in the (little) town of Bethlehem, on which so much of our celebratory apparatus depends, is mostly fantastical. Mark and John tell us nothing about the nativity, Matthew refers to Bethlehem, but locates the birth in a perfectly ordinary house and all Luke gives is the detail of the feeding-trough used as a cot. The animals are picturesque extras and Biblical scholars tell us that the birth more likely took place in Nazareth with April the probable month. Some time in the fourth century AD the Christian authorities decided to align the birth of Christ with the winter solstice, as reckoned on the Julian calendar. This was a purely pragmatic move, designed to accommodate the manifold oriental heathens who were used to saluting the nativity of the sun on December 25. The compromise with paganism has not stopped there, of course. The extra vegetation we admit to our homes to hail Jesus (or the sun) would make all sorts of infidels happy. Bacchanalian ravers would snatch for themselves our ivy wreaths; Druids nod reverently towards our mistletoe; and savage Norsemen drink bumpers to the yule log. And so on. It all ought to be common knowledge, if we ever bothered to think about it. Meditating on Christmas Past is a useful exercise, however, particularly when trying to imagine Christmas Future. That is, the nature of an end of year festival in a society which is predominantly secular and religiously pluralistic. Those who feel that Christmas is in danger of losing its integrity might reflect on some statistics emergent from a series of religious censuses taken between 1970 and 1987. John Clayton, professor of religious studies at the University of Lancaster, has drawn attention to the trends implied by these statistics. According to the present pattern of growth and decline in membership of Christian and non-Christian faiths in Britain, by the year 2000 adult affiliation to the Anglican church will have slumped to just over one and a half million. This is a little less than the projected membership of the Roman Catholic church. Both Anglican and Catholic numbers have been markedly declining since 1970, although in the case of the Anglicans, it is not clear how many 'born-again' associates of the church show up in these statistics. Membership of the reformed churches (including Scottish Presbyterians) is at more steady level, but is dropping to slightly more than one million. Methodists have steadied, too, at about half a million. It will not surprise anyone familiar with certain parts of London and certain old industrial centres in the north of England, that the religious sect showing the most significant growth is Islam. In cities such as Bradford, the statistics are confirmed in physical change: chapels converted to curry-houses and mosques the size of hypermarkets being erected. Assuming that Moslem adherence in Britain is not affected by secularisation  -which may not be a safe assumption - and continues at its current strength, the number of Moslem worshippers will roughly equal that of Anglicans by 2000, and go on to outnumber them over the following decade. Other non-Christian sects are increasing in numbers, although on a much smaller scale. None the less, by the end of the millennium there will be more Sikhs than Baptists in this country. To publicise these figures on Christmas may seem alarmist, insofar as they evoke a ghost of Christmas Future who speaks no comfort to those who want December 25 reserved as a celebration of the birth of Christ. But the importance of the statistics is easier to grasp at Christmas than at any other time. Christmas is a rite of passage, tailor-made for a secular and multicultural community. It is a hotch-potch of creeds and rituals which ought never to have been yoked together, yet survive as a coherent whole. The ghost of Christmas Future is not a monster: his message is the same as the message of Christmas Past.</p>

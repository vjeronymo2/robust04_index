			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: Medea - Theatre What with Hecuba at the Gate, The Thebans at the Barbican and now Medea at the Almeida, London has begun to sprout a Greek festival. Unless there is to be a touch of Aristophanes to lighten it up, perhaps the time has come to say that enough is enough. Medea, in particular, is heavy going. The Almeida production repeatedly brings to mind the remark by the philosopher, Wittgenstein: 'Of one thing I am certain. We are not here in order to have a good time.' I should also admit to a growing prejudice. After exposure to The Thebans last week (a production with many virtues) I find it increasingly difficult to take seriously people who, however otherwise intelligent, persisted in believing in the oracle at Delphi, the Furies and the inevitability of doom. Medea is Euripides' first surviving tragedy. The story is gruesome. It was Medea who, with her magic arts, enabled Jason to pick up the golden fleece from Colchis and returned with him to Greece. She married him; they had children. The play begins when he is preparing to ditch her in order to marry into the ruling family. Medea has the future wife murdered, then kills her own children. That is about it. The piece has some pathos. Medea is an immigrant in a foreign land who perhaps does not fully appreciate the benefits that Greek civilisation is supposed to bestow. She is a strong character and does not take kindly to Jason's proposal to move up in the social hierarchy. The underlying theme of the Almeida production, and presumably the reason why it has been put on, is that there have always been Jasons: women should stand up to them. As Medea puts is in a new translation by Alistair Elliot: 'It's natural for a woman to be angry with a husband embarking on a second marriage.' Medea is played by Diana Rigg, a fine actress, full of passion, intelligence and looks that kill. But one wonders if she sat in the audience and watched this production whether it would occur to her how relentlessly, hellenically monotonous it is. There are one or two redeeming features. The chorus, played by three women in a mixture of speech and song, is much more effective than the far bigger chorus in The Thebans. The music by Jonathan Dove is very good. There is an excellent performance by Dan Mullane as the messenger who describes the horrors of the murder perpetrated by Medea on her rival. Tim Woodward has an embarrassing time as Jason, since the production is rigged against him and - to be fair to the women's movement - he has no plausible excuses for his action. Direction is by Jonathan Kent. Almeida Theatre until October 24 (071) 359 4404</p>

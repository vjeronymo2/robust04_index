			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / US heading for radio auction bonanza The US government began auctioning off new radio bands yesterday, in an unprecedented move which could raise billions of dollars for the Treasury. The Federal Communications Commission, which has previously given away its licences through lotteries or hearings, was last year given congressional approval to auction exclusive rights to a range of new frequencies which can be used for the next generation in paging, telephone and voice and data communication systems. The Congressional Budget Office predicted the government could raise Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) through the auction. The process began yesterday as 29 bidders competed for a group of 10 nationwide licences for 'narrow band' frequencies. These can be used for advanced paging systems, two-way pagers, and wireless modems and faxes. At the end of the first hour of bidding yesterday morning, two contenders alone had offered bids totalling more than Dollars 104m, aimed at winning all the frequencies. Bidders are identified only by a numerical code until all rounds are concluded. Because FCC rules allow a company to purchase only three of the 10 bands, it is likely that the two companies will have to withdraw bids for some of the frequencies, which might lower the amount the government receives. However, FCC officials said that the first round looked promising. 'This totally exceeded the most rosy projections,' said Congressman Edward Markey, who was instrumental in the FCC securing permission to hold the auction, announcing the first round results. The bids ranged from Dollars 6.25m to Dollars 20m, depending on the frequency and its capabalities. The bidding for the first 10 bands is expected to continue until Thursday, but may end earlier if a few companies continue to out-bid their competitors by large amounts and drive out the smaller businesses. The FCC will then begin to auction off regional narrow-band service licences and licences for inter-active video and data services. By the end of the year, the FCC expects to have sold off 3,500 narrow-band permits, 1,400 inter-active licences and 2,000 permits for the next generation of mobile telephone services, collectively known as 'broad-band' services.</p>

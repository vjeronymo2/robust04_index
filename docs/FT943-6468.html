			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: First-half profits dip at Danone Danone, France's largest food group, has reported a slight drop in first-half net profit to FFr1.67n (Dollars 298m) from FFr1.8bn in the same period of 1993. But it said it was still banking on a profit increase for the year. The beverage products of Danone, which recently changed its name from BSN, are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the weather. This was poor in Europe until June but then followed a spectacular summer on which Danone is basing its confidence for a rise in overall earnings for 1994. It said its beer sales had been artificially swollen in the first half of last year ahead of a rise in French excise tax. First-half turnover was FFr37bn, which was a rise of 6 per cent taking into account new acquisitions and of 2.7 per cent on a comparable basis with the first six months of last year. The group said its operating income and net profit declined slightly in the first half, but its cashflow rose marginally to FFr3.49bn. According to some reports, Danone is negotiating the sale of its Materne jam-making division to Hillsdown of the UK, but the French group is refusing to comment on this. At Friday's board meeting, Mr Franck Riboud, the 38-year-old son of Mr Antoine Riboud, president, was named deputy managing director, or number two to his father. But at the same time, the group's managing inner circle was widened to include two new assistant managing directors.</p>

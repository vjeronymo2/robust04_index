			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  ordered thorough preparations for a possible inter-Korean summit  Monday, calling it an event "that may change our post-liberation  history."    Kim made the instructions after a unification-related  ministerial meeting was held earlier in the day chaired by  Deputy Premier Yi Yong-tok.    The chances of an inter-Korean summit -- the first ever --  are at an all-time high with the top leaders of both South and  North Korea agreeing in principle to the meeting.    Deputy Premier Yi pointed out that the government held a  series of meetings over the weekend to lay out specifics for the  South-North summit.    "The meeting participants are very much in tune with each  other, allowing for rapid progress," said Yi.</p>

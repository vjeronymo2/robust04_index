			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Monument Oil and Gas ahead to Pounds 5.7m MONUMENT OIL and Gas, the UK exploration and production company, saw pre-tax profit more than double, from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 5.66m, in the half year to June 30. 'We've been through an extremely tough period with the coal review. Oil prices are still weak, but we've been able to preserve our cash and expand overseas,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director. The government's coal review had placed a question mark over the development of the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field - in which Monument is involved - since it had threatened to withhold approval for the Connah's Quay power station which is to burn the gas. However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, approved Connah's Quay at the end of March and the Liverpool Bay project is to go ahead later this year. Mr Craven-Walker said Monument's share of the funding for the Pounds 2bn project was Pounds 270m, which the company was hoping to raise on a project finance basis. Mr Craven-Walker warned the City that debt levels in the company would rise significantly as it embarked on the development of Liverpool Bay. He said the second half of this year was a 'major milestone,' for the company, with Liverpool Bay expected to generate substantial future cash flow. Monument is beginning to expand overseas as opportunities in the North Sea dry up. It has targeted South America and south-east Asia for expansion. The company has drilled its first well in Argentina and is currently drilling two more: it will have the results in several weeks. Monument is also exploring in Bolivia. He still sees some room for growth in the North Sea where Monument put in place Pounds 12m financing for the Johnston gas field and began development in June. Earnings per share jumped to 0.8p (0.29p) but the company has decided not to pay a dividend because of the heavy financing costs to come in the second half. Turnover fell to Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 20.8m). Production slipped to 7,900 barrels a day after the disposal of the Buchan field. But output is set to increase substantially when Liverpool Bay comes on stream in late 1995.</p>

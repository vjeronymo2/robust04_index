			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun -- Minister of Foreign Affairs of the  Russian Federation Andrey Kozyrev today levelled criticism at  the Security Council draft resolution released by the American  delegation to the United Nations, on a settlement of the  situation on the Korean peninsula. In his words, the draft  resolution contravenes the accords reached in the course of the  conversations beteen the presidents of Russia and the United  States.    One can only express perplexity at the fact, he said, that  "the American diplomats have released in New York a draft  resolution containing a list of specific sanctions." Andrey  Kozyrev said this was done by the American side despite the fact  that during the telephone conversation between Presidents Boris  Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, and then during the Russian Federation  foreign minister's telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher "it was agreed absolutely clearly to  act jointly, to work out a draft resolution jointly and not to  put forward unilateral unitiatives."    "The release of such a draft resolution unilaterally will  cause us serious difficulty in examining this document," A.  Kozyrev stated. "We will not in any event support the range of  sanctions which is being put forward without previous agreement  with us."    For its part, Moscow, as indeed the heads of the two states  agreed, A. Kozyrev announced, conveyed confidentially to the  American side its own proposals on a draft resolution. They  include both the idea of sanctions and specific ideas on an  international conference on questions of security and the  nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. In keeping with  the accords of the presidents and of the heads of the foreign  policy deparltments of the Russian Federation and the United  States, in the resolution both these elements should be  contained on an equal footing.    Expressing the opinion that "the work will be continued," A.  Kozyrev at the same time stressed that "the unilateral actions  of the American diplomats in New York only complicate the  matter."</p>

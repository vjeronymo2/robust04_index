			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEACH VOLLEYBALL PROFESSIONALS PLAY IN VENICE BEACH  </P> <P> Professional beach volleyball will make its first stop of the season in  Southern California this weekend when the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals  Tour comes to Venice Beach.  </P> <P> The $75,000 Venice Beach Open, a double-elimination tournament, begins today at  9 a.m. The finals are scheduled for Sunday at 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos, together for the last nine years, have been the  most successful duo in the history of the sport and make up the top-seeded  team.  </P> <P> "The fact that we've been together and the fact that we've been playing so long  are big pluses in our favor," Smith, 33, said.  </P> <P> So is his consistency and the blocking ability of the 6-foot-4, 210-pound  Stoklos.  </P> <P> The two have five victories this season and lead in earnings with $75,850  apiece.  </P> <P> Still, parity has been making slow inroads on the tour, especially since  Olympic gold medalist Karch Kiraly rejoined the beach circuit in 1988. Kiraly's  partner has been 21-year-old Kent Steffes, and the two are ranked second with  two victories and $42,600 apiece in earnings.  </P> <P> However, on Thursday, Kiraly dropped Steffes in favor of Brent Frohoff for the  Venice Open, an event they won last year.  </P> <P> "They're an established team, they've won before," Stoklos said of  Kiraly-Frohoff. "But the timing was very unusual. Kent Steffes and Karch --  they weren't playing that badly."  </P> <P> Steffes will team with Sinjin Smith's younger brother, Andrew.  </P> <P> Tim Hovland and Mike Dodd, last season's leading money-winners with eight  victories and $164,000 apiece, have struggled this season but are coming off a  victory over Smith-Stoklos and are presently ranked third.

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Merger helps lift Secure Trust 6% to Pounds 3.9m Secure Trust, the financial services group, reported a 6.2 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 3.94m. Net interest income rose from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 2.57m. Fees and commission rose from Pounds 7.17m to Pounds 7.56m. Mr Henry Angest, chairman, said that the group had benefited from merging the Peoples Bank and Secure Homes into the Secure Trust Bank. This enabled it to offer a wider range of services to the existing customer base. The acquisition of Aitken Hume Bank, now renamed Arbuthnot Latham, made it possible to offer new ranges of services. Mr Stephen Lockley, finance director, said acquisitions and establishing Arbuthnot Commercial Finance, a factoring operation, accounted for the rise in administrative expenses from Pounds 5.08m to Pounds 5.62m. Most of the profit growth had come from Secure Trust Bank, he said, and from the Household Cash Management business where consumer lending had increased. The group's insurance broking business was slightly down on the first half of last year. The interim dividend was raised from 4.5p to 5p. Earnings per share rose 7.5 per cent to 18.6p (17.3p).</p>

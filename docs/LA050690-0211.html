			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND SWEATS OUT SIZZLING CINCO DE MAYO;  </P> <P> HEAT: ANAHEIM'S 98-DEGREE HIGH IS HOTTEST FOR DATE IN 37 YEARS. THOUSANDS  SWELTER THROUGH HOLIDAY FESTIVITIES.  </P> <P> Record temperatures baked Orange County and the rest of the Southland on  Saturday as thousands headed for the cooling waters of the Pacific or choose to  take the heat at a host of Cinco de Mayo celebrations.  </P> <P> Light wind and a stationary high-pressure system sent the mercury soaring to  101 degrees in Los Angeles and 98 in Anaheim, the highest readings for May 5 in  both areas in 37 years, according to the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> "It's hot," said Louise Diaz, with a pineapple Popsicle in hand. Diaz, wearing  a full-length, long-sleeved ruffled dress, was waiting to perform Saturday with  the Folklorico La Fonda dance troupe at the Mariachi Festival in downtown Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> Weather forecasters said the 100-degree temperatures were not expected to  return today. Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which  supplies forecasts to The Times, said the high-pressure system that spanned  from San Francisco to Nevada's Great Basin would move eastward, leaving a few  clouds and highs in the upper 80s and low 90s today.  </P> <P> Temperatures are expected to return to seasonal norms Monday when a marine  layer with cool, moist air and onshore breezes is to resume.  </P> <P> Air quality was rated unhealthful Saturday, according to the South Coast Air  Quality Management District. The AQMD predicted the conditions will continue  today.  </P> <P> In Orange County, tens of thousands of people sought relief at the beaches,  where lifeguards described the weather conditions as near-perfect. Air  temperatures ranged from 70 to 75 degrees and the water was an inviting 68  degrees. Winds were light; the surf a paltry two feet.  </P> <P> "Conditions are ideal," said Newport Beach Marine Safety Officer Mitch White.  "It's a beautiful sunny day, there is hardly any wind, the water is warm and  there are Cinco de Mayo parties along the beach."  </P> <P> Crowd estimates ranged from almost 90,000 in Newport Beach to 5,000 in Laguna  Beach. Huntington Beach lifeguards said attendance was moderate to heavy. And  in Seal Beach, lifeguards reported a crowd of about 10,000, only 2,000 less  than the average daily attendence for July through September.  </P> <P> The perfect conditions were marred by coastal roads clogged with carloads of  sun-loving beach-goers and a few minor encounters between lifeguards and rowdy  beer drinkers. Authorities reported a handful of first-aid calls and rescues  involving children.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County lifeguards reported crowds ranging from 100,000 at Long  Beach and Hermosa Beach to 90,000 at Zuma. In Santa Monica, an estimated  150,000 shoreline visitors lounged on the sand.  </P> <P> About 2,000 customers in Laguna Niguel lost electrical power for about half an  hour Saturday afternoon because excessive demand from air conditioners knocked  a circuit out of service, said Steve Sullivan, spokesman for Southern  California Edison Co.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the county, Latinos and aficionados of Mexican culture sweltered  in the heat at Cinco de Mayo celebrations to mark the victory of a band of  heavily outnumbered Mexicans over the French at Acutzingo Peak in Puebla,  Mexico, on May 5, 1862.  </P> <P> Perhaps the largest observance was at Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana,  where the only real relief from the 93-degree temperature were cold drinks,  beer and the banks of the park's small lake.  </P> <P> Typical of the Cinco de Mayo events were singing, folk dancing, carnival rides,  Mexican food and music, including the first mariachi festival held in Orange  County, which began Saturday at Santa Ana's Fiesta Marketplace.  </P> <P> At UC Irvine, activities included "Noche de la Raza," a student theatrical  production chronicling Mexican history through music.  </P> <P> Thousands of people milled around the grounds of Centennial Park, where  advertisers' huge inflated beer cans and cigarette packs stood like sentinels  over the crowd.  </P> <P> Bands played from two stages. Revelers sampled Mexican cuisine, guzzled beer  and queued up for games and prizes at dozens of display booths, including "El  Mundo de Drackett" (The World of Drackett), where people tossed rings over  plastic bottles of Drano drain cleaner in hopes of winning them.  </P> <P> Others waited patiently for free spinal exams from several chiropractors, who  set up temporary shop on the park's field. Those without a penchant for Mexican  food dined on "beef on a stick" and Thai-Chinese food.  </P> <P> At Fiesta Marketplace, 4th Street was closed to cars between French and Birch  streets, allowing people to gather and wander through the street to listen to  mariachi music, buy tacos or have their faces painted.  </P> <P> Booths offered information on everything from cosmetics to becoming a police  officer, but the longest line was at a booth selling state lottery tickets.  Except for one drunken man who was escorted away from the stage by police,  there were no incidents by late afternoon Saturday.  </P></p>

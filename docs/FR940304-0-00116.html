EPA based this exemption on data submitted to the Agency indicating that these filters do not typically and frequently exhibit the toxicity characteristic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Summary of September 10, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 10, 1992, EPA promulgated a final listing decision for used oils that are recycled and simultaneously promulgated management standards for used oil, codified at 40 CFR part 279 (see 57 FR 41566). EPA determined that used oil destined for recycling did not have to be listed as a hazardous waste because the used oil did not meet the technical criteria for listing a waste as hazardous, particularly in light of the new management standards and other federal requirements which control the risks posed by improper management of used oil. The standards cover used oil generators, transporters, processors, re-refiners, off-specification burners and marketers. The standards included an exemption from the management standards for used oil placed directly in a crude oil pipeline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

On June 17, 1993, EPA corrected several errors in the May 3, 1993, notice (see 58 FR 33341). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Summary of the 1985 Comments Regarding Used Oil Mixed With Crude Oil Destined for Refineries <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 29, 1985, EPA proposed to list all used oil as a hazardous waste (50 FR 49248). Commenters responded that used oil mixed with crude oil be exempt from such regulation because the small quantities of used oil mixed with crude oil posed no threat to the environment when refined with crude oil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Summary of 1991 Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 23, 1991, EPA proposed that the two exemptions from subtitle C requirements promulgated in 1985 (see 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3) (v)&hyph;(viii)) for oil-bearing hazardous waste and fuels derived from these wastes, also apply to used oils. (56 FR 48026, 48042) EPA proposed exemptions from the used oil management requirements (whether or not EPA ultimately listed used oil as a hazardous waste) for: (1) Used oils that are reinserted as feedstocks at primary petroleum refineries; and (2) fuels derived from those used oils. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH DEFENDS CAUTIOUS LITHUANIA POLICY  </P> <P> President Bush moved Wednesday to quell criticism of his muted response to the  Soviet crackdown in Lithuania, facing off with restive Republican lawmakers in  a pair of heated sessions at the White House.  </P> <P> "We need a Winston Churchill, not a Stanley Baldwin," the second-ranking House  Republican, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, reportedly snapped at one point,  referring to Britain's forceful World War II prime minister and a wishy-washy  predecessor who served in the 1930s.  </P> <P> Sources said a "clearly annoyed" Bush strongly defended his policy of restraint  and appeared to cool off much of the criticism.  </P> <P> But the fourth-ranking House Republican leader, Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma,  said that although there is willingness on Capitol Hill to temper public  complaints about the President, there is widespread sentiment there that Bush  should speak out more forcefully.  </P> <P> To that end, the House is expected to approve a resolution as early as today  that expresses strong support of the new Lithuanian government and seeks to  nudge Bush toward establishing diplomatic relations with it.  </P> <P> The Senate passed a similar resolution last week, but only after watering down  a version by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) that slammed Bush for not reacting with  enough enthusiasm to Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence.  </P> <P> Gingrich unleashed his criticism at a meeting between Bush and Republican  congressional leaders.  </P> <P> "We had a very spirited exchange, and he won," Gingrich told reporters.  </P> <P> He said Bush persuaded him that any overt U.S. action -- such as formal  recognition of Lithuania -- would trigger the immediate use of force against  the new government by the Soviet military. He also noted that Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev is under enormous pressure, including from the military,  to use force in Lithuania.  </P> <P> "We don't gain anything by forcing a confrontation," Gingrich declared, noting  that he had been "educated" by the exchange with Bush.  </P> <P> At a subsequent meeting with two Republican and two Democratic congressmen who  recently visited Lithuania, Bush encountered particularly strong pressure from  Rep. John Miller (R-Wash.) to act more forcefully, sources said.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had pointed out to  Gingrich that "we have a strong and consistent policy of urging dialogue" and  that "we want a peaceful resolution." Bush wants to be careful that he does not  inflame the situation, Fitzwater added.  </P></p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Markets: Clarke's first Budget looms out of statistical fog - Economics Notebook The one near certainty about tomorrow's Budget is that Kenneth Clarke will put on a confident performance. The chancellor is an effective parliamentarian who relishes his appearances at the despatch box. It is equally certain that his confidence will be based on statistics which in some cases are of doubtful reliability and in others are simply unsound. Official figures suggest that Britain is experiencing an unusually steady if unspectacular recovery. But key numbers on trade, industrial production and national output could be concealing a different picture. This year has been especially difficult because the introduction of the European single market has turned the figures on visible trade from one of the most to the about least reliable indicator. In October, for example, the Central Statistical Office judged that Britain's visible trade deficit had been widening for some time. A month later, its view was that the trend had been narrowing. However, the chancellor also has problems knowing what is happening at home. The accompanying graphs from this month's Bank of England bulletin show that the official perception of the shape of Britain's recovery has changed substantially since Mr Clarke began Budget preparations. Britain appeared in the summer to be having an ideal recovery, led by strong growth in manufacturing output that held out hopes of a greater share of national production going into exports and investment. The recovery now seems more akin to previous British upturns based on consumer demand and growth in services. According to the Bank, manufacturing output grew in real terms by about 1.5 per cent in the first half of this year compared with an earlier estimate of 2.7 per cent. Meanwhile service sector output, which accounts for 63 per cent of gross domestic product, is back above its recent peak of early 1990. Earlier statistics suggested it was half a per cent below. The changing shape of the recovery partly reflects changes in the price deflators used to calculate the volume growth of exports and output. Statisticians, when they calculate the important volume indices that guide our understanding of the way an economy is developing, do not count every unit of output. Instead they take figures for the value of industrial production, retail sales and gross domestic product and deflate them by what they believe to be the right prices. The Bank believes the export price figures may have been overestimated. The latest figures, showing an average 10 per cent year-on-year jump in export prices to world markets and a 12 per cent rise to non-EC countries, are high in the light of past experience of sterling devaluations when export prices rose by only about half the extent of the pound's depreciation. If the Bank is right, the bottom graph becomes less puzzling. It shows that Britain's exports as a share of domestic demand in the European Union have fallen sharply since the beginning of this year. This is difficult to explain, as exporters seem to be building up market share outside the EU and still enjoy some improvement in price competitiveness following sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. If export prices have risen less than the CSO figures suggest, manufacturing output and gross domestic product will have been higher than officially recorded. There are also some doubts about domestic prices of manufactured goods. The Confederation of British Industry says official figures exaggerate the rise in manufactured goods prices for the home market because they fail to reflect discounting by factories. Recent UK third quarter figures, showing falling unemployment, rising productivity and stagnant manufacturing output, are difficult to reconcile and could lend support to the idea that output is being under-recorded. One explanation of the relatively feeble growth of UK manufacturing output in recent years may be sub-contracting by companies of activities that are not central to their main line of business. The provision of a factory's meals by outside caterers rather than workshop canteens would, for example, lead to a fall in recorded industrial production and an increase in UK service sector output. Such a trend may be part of a bigger problem of official statistics failing to reflect the growth and complexity of the service sector that is affecting the industrialised economies in general. It has been highlighted in a new book, 'Statistics for the 21st Century'*, co-authored by Mr Joseph Duncan, the chief economist and statistician of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US business information group. Mr Duncan points out that the basic data collected to measure economic and social progress have remained essentially unchanged in spite of dramatic changes in business practices and the international economy in recent years. 'Nobody would try to launch today's space shuttle using a set of instruments developed for the old DC-3 aircraft', he says. Yet he contends that governments, businesses and individuals are measuring and managing the economy in this way. The doubts surrounding UK statistics this year may have a silver lining for Mr Clarke: there is a possibility that Britain has been growing at a faster rate than official indicators suggest. But no-one can be content if Britain and other industrial counties are basing economic decisions of importance for the next century on statistical methods developed at the time of the DC-3. *From Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Economic Analysis Dept, PO Box 3938, New York, NY 10163-3938.

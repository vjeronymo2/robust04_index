			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / W German industrial orders fell by 1.6 per cent in June West German industrial orders fell by 1.6 per cent in June compared with May, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. However, demand for consumer goods rose 1.5 per cent. The federal economics ministry said a 3.7 per cent decline in capital goods was largely to blame for the greater than expected fall in industrial orders. Foreign orders fell only 0.9 per cent, but economists are concerned about the impact on exports of last weekend's changes to the ERM.</p>

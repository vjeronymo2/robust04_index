			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Transfer of police duties is urged PRIVATE security companies should take over traffic duties and some other responsibilities from the police, Mr David Fletcher, chief executive of the British Security Industries Association, said yesterday, Alan Pike writes. Tasks that could be contracted out to the private sector included using modern technology to detect speeding motorists, escorting heavy loads on motorways and issuing firearms certificates, he said at a conference of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Eastbourne. Mr Fletcher said the police had successfully handed over the enforcement of parking regulations to traffic wardens and private wheel-clamping contractors. An increasing number of specialist activities was carried out by civilians employed by police authorities, he said.</p>

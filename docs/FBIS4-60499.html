			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 25 May (INA) -- AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that  now the Thatcher-Bush fabrication of the capacitors charge  against Iraq has been exposed, the West's democracy, respect for  human rights, and credibility have come into question.    In its editorial today, the paper stresses that the British  courts' unveiling of the British and U.S. intelligence services'  fabrication of the capacitors' story -- or nuclear weapons'  detonators -- with the prior knowledge of the then U.S.  President and British prime minister, has proved beyond all  doubt that Bush and Thatcher wanted to mislead public opinion in  the West, especially in the United States, and fabricate  justifications to convince legislative and other bodies of the  need to launch a war against Iraq.    Describing such behavior as a reflection of moral  degeneration, the paper notes that Bush and Thatcher were  involved in lies at the highest levels and on the broadest and  most important fronts.    It is noteworthy that a British court yesterday ordered the  release of two British Urmak [name as transliterated] Company  employees, who are serving five-year prison terms, after the  court acquired categorical proof that Thatcher had prior  knowledge of the plot and that British and U.S. agencies  cooperated to frame the employees, Dagger and Speakman [names as  transliterated].    The British court has acquired convincing evidence that the  judge who presided over the trial of the two British employees  deliberately misled the jury into convicting the defendants of  being involved in smuggling nuclear detonators to Iraq.    AL-JUMHURIYAH examines the underlying significance of the  facts and information that have become available to the British  courts about the British and U.S. intelligence and customs  authorities' arrangement of the plan to deliver the detonators  to the airport and then discover them as export-banned equipment  that was on its way to Iraq. The paper says that the aim was to  portray Iraq as being effectively on the verge of producing  atomic bombs, and that the capacitors were the final step in  that plan.    The paper is confident that with the charge of attempting to  smuggle nuclear detonators to Iraq now exposed, the UN  inspection committees' conclusion that there is no move to  produce an Iraqi nuclear bomb, as well as facts that are yet to  be disclosed, it has been proved that the aggression against  Iraq was a basic part of the colonialist West's strategy of  hindering the awakening and progress of any Arab country and  preventing unity between Arab countries.    AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the U.S. and western public in general  to  stress their respect for democracy and human rights and to adopt  clear stands against those who deceived and misled them in order  to peddle the plan of killing hundreds of thousands of human  beings and torturing millions more in Iraq.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / People: BBC's new finance director chosen The former group financial control director of Midland Bank has been appointed director of finance and information technology at the BBC. Rodney Baker-Bates who will take up his appointment on March 22. Baker-Bates, who was born in Liverpool and educated at Shrewsbury School and Hertford College, Oxford, succeeds Ian Phillips who was director of finance and chairman of BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC. In December Phillips sought an assurance about his long-term future from John Birt, then director general designate. When he did not receive such an assurance, he decided to resign. The finance director's job has since been expanded to take in responsibility for information technology. A chartered accountant, Baker-Bates, 48, joined Midland Bank in 1984 and held several positions; a casualty of the Hongkong Bank acquisition of Midland, he left at the end of last year. Previous posts included the group finance directorship at Orion Bank, and he has also worked for consultants Arthur Andersen, spending six years working on major IT projects. Although Birt said yesterday that Baker-Bates brought great financial strength and experience to the BBC 'and will ensure the effectiveness of all our finance functions and information systems', he will also have to try to ensure that there is no repetition of the over-spends or potential overspends of the past two years. Birt recently estimated the total involved over the two year period as Pounds 59m.</p>

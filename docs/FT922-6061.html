			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / DoE predicts a sharp fall in spending on training Youth Training and Employment Training - will fall sharply in real terms in 1993-94, according to internal Department of Employment estimates. The cut, partly for demographic reasons, is expected and follows similar cuts over the past two years. YT is likely to be cut from Pounds 851m in 1992-93 to Pounds 845m in Pounds 1993-94 and ET, for unemployed adults, will rise slightly in nominal terms, from Pounds 807m to Pounds 818m, but not enough to cover inflation. The leaders of the 104 Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer YT and ET in England and Wales and spearhead the government's training initiative, will try to resist the cuts in the spending discussions with the Treasury and the Department of Employment which begin next month. The Tecs' main priority is to win greater flexibility for the way they spend their money. They want more money to be based on 'outputs' - the number of people who achieve specified qualifications, or jobs - rather than 'inputs', the number of people who start courses. People currently finishing ET courses have little more chance of finding a job than people who do not do ET at all. Lord Stockton, chairman of Centec in central London and unofficial spokesman for Tec leaders, said Tecs wanted freedom to offer ET training to people who have been unemployed for only three months, instead of the current threshold of six months. Tecs also want more flexibility on the length of courses, arguing that some people need shorter but higher-quality courses and others longer but lower-level. 'Inflexibility has exacerbated the funding problem,' Lord Stockton said. Tecs are keen to divert as much money as possible from big training schemes for the unemployed to the demanding Investors in People training standard for people already at work. The government is also keen to push Investors in People but will not allow Tecs to abandon the guarantee of a training place for all people under the age of 25. Some London Tecs have still not agreed their budgets with the Department of Employment for the current year but are expected to do so in the next few weeks.</p>

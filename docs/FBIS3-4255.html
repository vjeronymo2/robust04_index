The total number of container berths has gone up to over 30,  with a total handling capacity of three million standard  containers.    So far, the country has more than 860 scheduled container  liners to over 100 countries and regions around the world. The  total throughput of the containers traffic last year reached 3.8  million units.    In Tianjin, north China's biggest port city, eight container  berths have been built, capable of handling more than one  million containers yearly, over one-third of the country's total.    It also has opened several container shipping routes leading  to North America, northwest Europe, Australia and the Persian  Gulf, running 112 scheduled voyages every month.    As one main terminal of the Eurasian continental bridge (a  Eurasian railway from Lianyungang port in Jiangsu Province, east  China, to Rotterdam of the Netherlands), which went into  operation three years ago, the Tianjin port has sent out or  received through it more than 3,000 standard containers yearly.    Currently, China has more than 1,000 container railway  carriages, and 23 percent of its highways can handle containers.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Spanish paper falls on introduction of capital controls FURTHER tension within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System forced Ireland and Portugal to follow Spain's example and impose restrictions on the movement of capital yesterday. The reintroduction of capital controls infuriated many bond investors and traders, and left some wondering which other troubled markets would follow suit. The Spanish government bonds suffered a sharp sell-off yesterday as foreign investors scrambled to get out of the market. The capital controls are intended to hit speculators who have played havoc over recent days with the weaker European currencies by betting on a forced devaluation. According to 1988 legislation on the liberalisation of capital controls, Spain, Portugal and Greece have until the end of 1992 to lift all controls. Both Greece and Portugal may ask for the deadline to be extended until 1995 under special economic circumstances. However, yesterday, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the EC considered the new exchange controls introduced by three member countries to be legal under the EC Treaty. FRENCH government bonds dropped on currency worries but picked up again later in the session. Dealers said most of the activity took place in the futures markets since the spreads quoted on cash bonds were too wide to attract business. One trader at a French commercial bank said the French houses had an informal arrangement to quote especially unattractive prices for French bonds and currency to certain US houses in order to deter speculation in the currency. Bid-offer spreads of three-quarters of a point on bonds - against 0.1 of a point normally - were cited by one house. The franc appeared relatively resilient yesterday as both the Bank of France and the Bundesbank intervened in order to support the French currency. The Matif futures contract fell from 108.00 to 107.70 while the 10-year bond, which opened with a yield of 8.69 per cent, ended at 8.60 per cent. GERMAN government bonds ended lower, pulled down by disappointment over the fading prospects of a cut in German interest rates and poor inflation figures. Traders said the French franc's ability to weather speculation pressure and stay above the ERM floor dashed hopes of an easing by the Bundesbank. Market participants had hoped that the German central bank would be forced to cut interest rates in order to buoy up the franc and reduce tensions within the ERM. The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a range of 90.70 to 91.05 and ended at around 90.87, slightly lower than the opening level. Bond prices dipped briefly following the release of western German state inflation data yesterday. Consumer prices in Baden-Wurttemberg rose 3.3 per cent year-on-year and climbed 0.3 per cent from August. In North Rhine-Westphalia, prices climbed 0.3 per cent on the month and rose 3.4 per cent from September 1991. SPANISH government bonds tumbled as foreigners rushed to sell their holdings following Wednesday's introduction of capital controls. While the curbs were aimed at preventing speculation in the currency, traders complained it had become prohibitively expensive for bond market participants to fund their positions as a result. The yield on the 10-year bond climbed from 13.01 per cent to 13.09 per cent yesterday. UK GOVERNMENT bond prices ended the day lower or barely changed as hopes of lower German interest rates - and hence of a cut in UK interest rates - faded. Volume in the Liffe futures contract was relatively low at about 22,000 contracts. The contract opened at 98.20 and fell to 98.01. However, cash bonds showed little movement, with the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 gaining  1/32 to trade at 98 5/8 in the late afternoon. US Treasury prices rose sharply across the maturity range yesterday following a bigger-than-expected increase in weekly jobless claims. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up at 97 15/16 , yielding 7.426 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up 5/32 at 100 3/16 to carry a yield of 3.885 per cent. Initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose by 15,000 in the second week of September. Although the figures were affected by the impact of Hurricane Andrew, the week was shorter than usual because of the Labor Day holiday, and with car and defence companies laying off significant numbers of staff, the data confirmed the labour market remains in a poor condition. The bearish jobs figures helped offset the negative implications of a weakening dollar. By early afternoon yesterday the US currency was more than a pfennig lower at DM1.4850. THE yen's recent strengthening against the US dollar helped to lift Japanese government bond prices above their closing levels on Tuesday, which was the last trading day before the public holiday. The US currency opened at a historic Tokyo low of Y119.90 to the dollar, and hit an all-time intraday low of Y119.83. A strong yen helps to push up Japanese government bond prices because it means that it is easier for the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.79 per cent in Tokyo yesterday, against Tuesday's close of 4.865 per cent, and ended the day at 4.795 per cent. The number of market-makers in the UK government bond market has fallen to 19 following Hong Kong Bank's move this week to merge its James Capel Gilts and Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged businesses. The operation will continue under the name of Greenwell, which was already among the biggest market-makers, with a market share estimated at around 15 per cent.</p>

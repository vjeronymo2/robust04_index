			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Observer: Enemy message Russia launched an unprecedented assault on the United States yesterday by putting into orbit a satellite bearing promotional material for its emerging private sector. The sputnik, carrying a message from President Boris Yeltsin, was launched from the once top-secret military site of Plesetsk. Its estimated arrival time in the Pacific Ocean, near Seattle, is November 22 - just in time for the US Thanksgiving holiday on November 26. If the plan works, (a big if), the sputnik will be brought ashore by the Russian Pacific fleet. But rather than a turkey, it will be carrying 19 containers of adverts for Russian goods and a cut-glass replica of the Statue of Liberty. The exercise is said to cost Dollars 200m - funded entirely by Russia's new businessmen. If true, it seems a strange investment for a country which is strapped for cash.</p>

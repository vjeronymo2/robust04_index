			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Utilities reject competition Germany's municipal gas and electricity utilities yesterday rejected any attempt to open up the German energy market to free competition as likely to result in drastic concentration on the biggest suppliers, writes Quentin Peel from Bonn. They said the plan by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, to allow third parties access to the gas and electricity grids would undermine local utilities and make German suppliers less competitive internationally.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Electoral reform proponents win support of TGWU executice council SUPPORTERS of electoral reform in the Labour party yesterday won the support of the executive council of Britain's biggest union, the TGWU, which agreed to support change to the existing electoral system. The decision to support change was made after a consultation process in the union. It did not specify which alternative voting system it favoured. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, also announced that tentative merger talks with the building union Ucatt had started. He said there was a clear logic to a merger as Ucatt and the TGWU were the two biggest unions in the industry.</p>

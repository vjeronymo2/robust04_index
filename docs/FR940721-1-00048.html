			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FTA data indicate that about 117 of the 540 fixed route operators required to submit paratransit plans have indicated that they expected to be fully in compliance by the end of 1993. Another 70 providers expected to be fully in compliance by the end of 1994. By full compliance, we mean that the transit property meets all six service criteria spelled out for paratransit systems in the regulation (concerning service area, response time, trip purpose, hours and days of service, fares, and capacity constraints). It appears unnecessary to require transit properties which in fact meet all criteria to do the paperwork for an update every year. If a system is fully in compliance, and no significant changes have occurred, going through this process has no benefit for passengers with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the Department is proposing to modify &sect;&sect;37.135(c) and 37.139(j) to allow transit properties who fully comply with all service criteria for paratransit service to rely on the assurance of ADA compliance required by &sect;27.4, rather than submitting an update report. If significant changes occurred that could affect compliance, or if the system fell out of compliance with respect to one or more of the service criteria, it would have to notify FTA of the problem and submit annual updates until it had returned to compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has some concern that, if it adopts this proposal, it may not have an adequate source of data about the compliance status of transit authorities, ridership, or costs. Such data may be useful for program evaluation as well as forming a basis for reports to Congress or the public. The Department seeks comment on whether, if this proposal is adopted, there should be any additional data reporting requirements concerning paratransit compliance, ridership, and costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Visitor Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 37.127, concerning complimentary paratransit service for visitors, provides that a public entity is not required to provide service to a visitor for more than 21 days from the date of the first paratransit trip used by the visitor. We have been asked whether this means 21 consecutive days or a collection of days over a given period of time adding up to 21. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we propose to add the words ``per year.'' This means that a visitor could have any 21 days of eligibility in any calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Vehicle Acquisition for ``Private Not Primarily Engaged'' Providers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 37.101 contains the vehicle acquisition requirements for private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. Because of the way that section 302 of the ADA itself it drafted, there is no specific vehicle acquisition requirement for ``private not primarily engaged'' entities providing demand responsive service with vehicles having a capacity of 16 or fewer passengers. Rather, entities in this situation must provide equivalent service to passengers with disabilities. This requirement is set forth in &sect;37.171. To avoid confusion, we propose to add to &sect;37.101 a new paragraph containing a cross-reference to &sect;37.171. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Personal Care Attendants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 37.123(f)(1)(i) permits an eligible individual traveling on ADA paratransit to be accompanied by a ``personal care attendant'' (PCA) as well as by any other person of the individual's choice. Section 37.131(c)(3) says that the PCA rides without charge, while the other companion must pay the paratransit fare. These provisions have led to questions about who should be regarded as a PCA. Section 37.123(f)(1)(ii) attempted to provide guidance on this issue by saying that a family member or friend traveling with an eligible individual is not regarded as a PCA unless that person is acting in the capacity of a PCA. The Appendix discussion of this section notes that a PCA is someone ``designated or employed specifically to help the individual meet his or her personal needs,'' such as eating, drinking, using the bathroom, communicating etc. The Appendix also notes that the paratransit provider may, as part of the eligibility certification process, require that eligible individuals register as users of PCAs. The companion of someone not so registering could be charged the paratransit fare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is aware that there may be definitions of PCA used in other contexts (e.g., human services programs). We seek comment on whether one of these definitions would be appropriate for use in the context of paratransit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Equivalent Facilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current provisions concerning ``equivalent facilitation'' (&sect;&sect;37.7 and 37.9) require, as one condition for obtaining a determination of equivalent facilitation, that an entity demonstrate its ``reasons for inability to comply'' with the existing regulatory standards. In other words, before the Department can determine that something is an equivalent facilitation, the applicant must show not only that it is proposing a solution providing equal or greater accessibility, but also that it is precluded from using the solution provided for in the Department's standards. The purpose of this provision was to limit departures from established regulatory standards to those situations where they could not be applied and, therefore, to discourage a proliferation of solutions that might undermine the goal of having uniform, predictable standards. This approach has the disadvantage, however, of also discouraging newer technologies or more innovative solutions that might actually provide accessibility gains in some situations. For this reason, the Department is proposing to delete the ``inability to comply'' language from the equivalent facilitation sections of the rule. We seek comment on whether this is a good idea.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would point out that the proposed change is not intended to diminish the requirement that any equivalent facilitation provide equal or greater accessibility. For example, it would not permit a rail system to avoid installing detectable warnings meeting the regulatory standards without that system having demonstrated that a substitute design was as detectable or more detectable by persons with impaired vision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

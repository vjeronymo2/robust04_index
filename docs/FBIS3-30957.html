"The Moslem side would prefer to leave that  (demilitarization) until after the exclusion zone is negotiated  and up and running," EC negotiator Lord Owen, a co-chairman of  the talks, told reporters.    Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic of the mainly Moslem Bosnian  government told AFP Friday: "We refuse to discuss Sarajevo  without the rest of Bosnia. We want to discuss the overall  settlement now." An aide was carrying maps of Bosnia for the  discussion.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic entered the second day  of talks here in a decidedly more upbeat mood than on Thursday,  when he refused to participate if Serbs did not join an  investigation into last week's mortar massacre in Sarajevo that  killed 68. A compromise was reached Thursday for the setting up  of a committee with Serb and Bosnian government liaisons  involved, to investigate the massacre, which led to the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation issuing an ultimatum Wednesday for  Serb artillery to withdraw from around Sarajevo. The liaison  formula was clearly the key to the compromise, worked out by UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    Bosnian Croats, the third of the former Yugoslav state's  warring factions, were represented at the talks by Mile  Akhmadzic.</p>

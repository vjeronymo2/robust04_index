			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (7): Dogged by legal challenges - Privatisation FIVE YEARS after it began, the Philippines' privatisation programme can be counted neither as a rip-roaring success nor as an abject failure. Dogged by legal challenges and the hesitancy of local and foreign investors, the government agencies responsible for privatisation have limped along through a series of failed auctions, but have eventually succeeded in selling many of the state-controlled companies and assets in their charge. The so-called 'big ticket' items have been particularly hard to dispose of, although the 67 per cent of Philippine Airlines (PAL) offered by the government was snapped up at auction last month for Dollars 368m by a consortium of local business groups. Part of the problem is that the privatisation programme was created more to clear up the mess left by the regime of the late Ferdinand Marcos than to satisfy any ideological craving for free enterprise. In 1986, the same year she came to power, President Corazon Aquino created the Committee on Privatisation (COP) and the Asset Privatisation Trust (APT), two bodies whose mandates have recently been extended because of the slower-than-expected pace of disposals. Privatisation was among the tools used to rescue the Philippine National Bank (PNB) and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government-owned institutions abused and exploited by Marcos and his cronies. The government has taken over some 140bn pesos in problem loans and other assets, and made the APT responsible primarily for selling these non-performing assets, both financial and physical. It is against this background that the APT's achievement in grossing 26.3bn pesos by disposing of 266 out of the 399 non-performing assets in its portfolio must be measured. In all, the privatisation programme has netted 41.1bn pesos. With the APT's remaining non-performing assets either completely deteriorated or hard to sell because of legal impediments, the focus is now shifting to the 50 or so unsold state companies out of the 123 corporations which were earmarked for sale by the APT and a number of state parent organisations such as the Government Service Insurance System. The process has been slowed both by the reluctance of the Commission on Audit to accept the low market values of some of the assets and by the doubts of potential investors in an economic climate affected by natural disasters and the Gulf crisis. 'I think in the experience of other countries, five years is really too short,' says Ms Crisanta Legaspi, executive officer of the Committee on Privatisation. The government is keen to rid itself of loss-making corporations, but its various agencies are sometimes less than wholehearted in their commitment to the principles of privatisation. 'They would not like to lose whatever they have now by disposing of it,' says Mr Jose Sison, associate executive trustee of the APT. The GSIS, for example, is supposed to sell 40 per cent of the Manila Hotel this year, but senior officials, citing the historical and sentimental value of the former headquarters of Gen Douglas MacArthur, are in no hurry to dispose of a profitable company without debts. Furthermore, assets sold by the state often fall into the hands of the oligarchy of wealthy families which has always run the country. 'I think that's one of the flaws of the privatisation programme,' says Mr Sison. 'What's happening here is that we're transferring from one monopoly to another.' Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the central bank, expresses his satisfaction that 'more than 50 per cent of what was targeted has already been privatised', although he acknowledges that the sale of big-ticket items will take time. Thirty per cent of the now profitable PNB has already been sold on the stock market, a further 21 per cent is expected to be offered soon, and President Aquino has approved the eventual sale of 100 per cent. The Philippine Plaza hotel was finally sold last year to Allied Kajima, a Hong Kong-Japanese joint venture. But an agreement on financing for the Dollars 325m sale of Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corporation to Philippine Nickel Corporation has yet to be finalised, and other large companies, including the National Steel Corporation and the Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines, are still waiting for buyers. The government's efforts to sell two thirds of PAL were boosted by higher-than-expected profits in recent months - after a decade of losses - and by the government's decision to assume the airline's foreign debt of Dollars 519m. 'There is an economic need to infuse new money into PAL,' says Mr Feliciano Belmonte, president of PAL and GSIS. 'And GSIS, which is a pension fund for government employees, is not the right kind of sourcing.' The winning consortium in last month's three-cornered bidding was a group led by AB Capital and Investment Corporation and linked to Korean Air. Its bid of Dollars 368m, including a local currency cash component worth Dollars 150m, was well above the confidential Dollars 317m 'hurdle price' set by the authorities and appeared sufficiently high to disarm critics of the sale, even if last-minute obstacles to the deal could not be ruled out. Mr Belmonte, although accepting the necessity of private sector investment in PAL, is noticeably ambivalent about the ideological merits of privatisation. In the absence of widespread official determination to push ahead the privatisation programme under the new government to be elected in May, the disposal of state companies is likely to continue as slowly as before.</p>

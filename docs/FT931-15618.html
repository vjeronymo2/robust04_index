			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: An independent bank governor would avoid stop-go policies Sir, Mr Persaud argues re Bank of England independence that 'it is a populist assertion that politicians cannot be trusted to stand above their narrow political choices'. In so doing he forgets to apply to the problem of the conduct of monetary policy the very same principles of rationality that his economist training has taught him to use in other, 'non-political', analysis of social behaviour. The self interest of a government, call it narrow or not, is to win elections. In order to do that, it must ensure that recovery comes at the end of its mandate and recession (if there has to be one) at the start of it. A central bank governor whose job depends on that outcome will do everything to attain it, with the likely consequence of an inefficient political business cycle. Conversely, a central bank governor named under a statute that assures his independence and links his job and his salary to the achievement of certain objectives democratically set by the parliament, has every incentive to avoid such stop-go cycles and pursue his mandated long-term objectives. This is neither populist nor insidious. Just rational. Concerning the assertion that independence is no panacea it can only be said that there is no such thing as a panacea in any sphere of life, least of all central bank independence. But neither the failure of Sweden's Riksbank to defend the Krona nor Margaret Thatcher's recession at the beginning of the 1980s, nor, least of all, Germany's current economic problems prove anything at all in relation to the long-term objectives of monetary policy. As recent research work has shown, over the last 40 years OECD countries with lower inflation rates have, in all but one case (Japan), a de jure or de facto independent central bank. This is the case in the US, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Canada. On the other hand, countries with higher inflation have suffered a record of government interference in the conduct of monetary policy - as in Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, France and the UK. Last, there need be no problem of accountability provided the objectives of central bank policy are democratically decided, that its governor and board are democratically elected and that it has to present a yearly report to the parliament in which its decisions are discussed and justified.

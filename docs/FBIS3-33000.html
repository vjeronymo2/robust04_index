			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 12 Feb (PL) -- The Cuban State urgently  needs to reduce expenses and increase income, GRANMA, the  official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, asserts today.    In an article, the newspaper reports that the subsidies  given  to national firms that have losses are the main contributing  factor to the Cuban budget's imbalance. In 1993, the budget  deficit amounted to $4 billion pesos (equal amount in dollars).    In our case -- the article adds -- this means that more  money  has to be issued and this, in turn, increases the currency in  circulation without material support, reduces the value of local  currency and its purchasing power, increases labor absenteeism,  and severely decreases labor productivity.    GRANMA explains that the budget deficit and the printing of  more money are not the only causes for the excess of liquidity  as the fact that production and services have suffered a sharp  fall in the past years must also be noted. However and  undoubtedly, the former are key factors in the negative  situation, it adds.    The newspaper warns that expenses must be reduced very  carefully because it is a very sensitive issue and actions to  reduce expenses must not negatively affect the principles of  social justice existing in Cuban society.    Of course, it is indispensable that Cuban firms increase  their economic efficiency, the article stresses.    GRANMA favors the establishment of new taxes, the increase  of  previously existing taxes, and the implementation of new methods  and ways to collect taxes more effectively.    As always happens with controversial topics and advantages,  issues that are so pressing and important to the country,  logically, trigger debate and reflection, the article concludes.</p>

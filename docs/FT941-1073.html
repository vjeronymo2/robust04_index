			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Warrants with a future - Diary of a Private Investor Do you have a piece of paper that has, perhaps, been overlooked but which might now be worth a significant sum? Warrants are easy to forget and are misunderstood by a number of people - yet, their value can sometimes be surprising. My personal pension scheme has had a shareholding in a small investment company, London Finance &amp; Investment, for some time. Last October, the company gave its shareholders one warrant for every five shares held. Each gave its holder the right to subscribe in cash for one share in London Finance at 25p apiece within a certain specified period in any of the years 1996 to 2005 inclusive. As the warrants were free, I simply made a note of their acquisition and did not bother to track their progress. I assumed they would not be worth much until London Finance's share price rose considerably. Earlier this year, though, I was browsing through the share price pages on the screen of the Market Eye financial information service. I noticed that while London Finance shares were quoted at 29-31p, the warrants were 17-19p. I was surprised they were worth so much because it meant people were prepared to pay 17-19p just for the right to buy London Finance shares at some time in the future for 25p each. As I saw it, there were were two obvious explanations. The first was that the warrant-holders hoped public expectations of the company's prospects would enable them eventually to sell the warrants at a profit as their price rose. The second was that they expected the shares to rise to more than 42-44p (the 17-19p warrant price plus 25p a share purchase price) in order to make it attractive financially to exercise their warrant rights and take up the new shares. Issuing warrants has become increasingly popular, especially by companies using them almost like a future-dated rights issue. They have proved especially popular with investment trust companies; many new trusts include warrants with their share capital when they are launched. There are now more than 100 quoted trusts which have warrants, although each trust differs in the terms for them. And, with trust warrants, investors can keep track of their progress fairly easily as many are listed on the FT's share price pages immediately under the trust's share price (which was not the case with London Finance). Although warrants confer the right to buy shares at a fixed price within a set time period, there is no obligation on the holder to do so. Indeed, I suspect a number of people simply consign their warrants to the attic. They should, however, look again at their terms because they may have a valuable asset. This is because warrants usually can be traded in their own right; thus, an investor can keep his existing shareholding in a company and sell all or some of his warrants. Trading in warrants also has attracted investors who are interested in the possibilities of making spectacular gains from being able to take an interest in a company's shares for a relatively modest outlay - much less than actually buying them. Suppose a person bought 1,000 shares when these cost Pounds 1. If they rose to Pounds 2, his Pounds 1,000 investment would be worth Pounds 2,000. But if the company's warrants cost only 10p, an investor could acquire 10,000 for the same initial outlay. Suppose, then, that the warrant exercise price to buy further shares in the company was 130p. When the shares reached Pounds 2, the warrant-holder would not have to pay for more shares - he could sell his warrant rights via a broker on the stock market, perhaps to someone prepared to pay 65p a warrant. The buyer could then either keep the warrants in the hope that the underlying shares would rise still further, or exercise the rights and acquire shares for less than the market price - that is, for 195p instead of Pounds 2 because he had paid 65p for the warrants plus 130p to exercise the rights. (It is worth noting that the price spreads between buying and selling warrants often is greater than those between the buying and selling prices of shares). Meanwhile, the person who sold the warrants to him would have seen his Pounds 1,000 investment in 10,000 warrants turn into Pounds 6,500 cash. On the other hand, if the person who bought 1,000 shares for Pounds 1 saw them plummet suddenly to, say, 70p, he could still sell them and get Pounds 700 of his Pounds 1,000 back (less dealing costs). In such circumstances, the warrant-holder might find little interest in them - especially if their expiry date was imminent - and could lose his entire Pounds 1,000 warrant investment. So, if you have been given warrants free, do not ignore them: they could be valuable, either to keep so that you can eventually exercise their rights yourself; or to sell, either now or at some time before they expire. And if you want a speculative investment, then warrants are certainly worth considering.</p>

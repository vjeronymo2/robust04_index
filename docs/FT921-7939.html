			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: Total Quality Management more than blind faith Sir, Writing about the Baldrige award in his interesting article (Management, February 3), Martin Dickson struck a rather controversial note by describing Total Quality Management as 'a kind of corporate religion'. While accepting that strong commitment is needed, I believe this description could discourage many practically minded chief executives from adopting TQM. In this UK-based consultancy, TQM is regarded as applied common sense, not least because it improves customer satisfaction, while substantially reducing costs, leading to a marked increase in net profit. Blind faith would rarely have this effect. Howard Densley, senior consultant, The Centre for Consultancy, Hallams Court, Littleford Lane, Guildford, Surrey</p>

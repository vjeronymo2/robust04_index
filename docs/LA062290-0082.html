			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARDEMAN DENIED FEES' REIMBURSEMENT  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has turned down Inglewood City Councilman  Garland Hardeman's attempt to collect $230,000 in attorney's fees from the city  and former opponent Ervin (Tony) Thomas.  </P> <P> Hardeman and Thomas fought a bitter two-year court battle after Thomas narrowly  edged out Hardeman in the 1987 City Council election. Hardeman charged Thomas  and his political allies with voter fraud and eventually defeated Thomas in a  court-ordered runoff election last October for the District 4 council seat.  </P> <P> The court in September approved $7,300 for Hardeman to cover court costs such  as photocopying and filing fees. In a separate action, Judge Barnet Cooperman  on May 8 rejected an attempt by Hardeman to recover the cost of attorney's  fees.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILDER TAKES THREE-STROKE LEAD IN PRO-AM TOURNAMENT AT CARMEL  </P> <P> Despite calling it a "tough day," Bob Gilder shot a 3-under-par 68 Friday and  took a 3-stroke lead over two players after three rounds of the $250,000  Spalding Invitational Pro-Am.  </P> <P> As Thursday's three co-leaders faltered under sunny and clear conditions,  Gilder made 15 pars and sank birdie putts of 15, 32 and 7 feet at Carmel Valley  Golf and Country Club en route to his 7-under-par 206 total.  </P> <P> "It was a tough day for me," said Gilder, who last November won a two-man team  tournament in Japan with Doug Tewell and also claimed the non-tour Kapalua  International in Hawaii. "I came out a little rushed and didn't feel as good as  I felt yesterday."  </P> <P> Trailing Gilder, who began the day in a four-way tie 1 shot behind the leaders,  are Lennie Clements, who shot even-par 70 at Carmel Valley Ranch, and Danny  Edwards, who tied two others for low honors of the day with a 66, also at  Carmel Valley Ranch.  </P> <P> Gilder, 82nd on last year's money list with $144,000, credited a new outlook on  the game with his recently improved play.  </P> <P> "I made a decision not to get upset," he said. "I just wanted to go out and  have a good time. I used to always expect to play great, and when I didn't, I  got very frustrated."  </P> <P> Former U.S. Amateur winner Sam Randolph fired a 69 at Carmel Valley Ranch is  alone in third place at 210. Seven other players, including second-round  co-leader Rob Boldt, are within 6 strokes of the leader.  </P> <P> Boldt, one of three second-round leaders after two rounds, shot 2-over-par 74  at Poppy Hills, the most difficult of the three course being used in the  non-tour event. The other 36-hole leaders who also played at Poppy Hills,  suffered worse fates.  </P> <P> Loren Roberts shot 76 and is at even-par 213. Greg Powers carded a 78 and is at  215.  </P></p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Brooke warning on round-table talks MR PETER BROOKE, North-ern Ireland secretary, warned yesterday that unless outstanding differences were resolved soon it was unlikely that 'round table' talks on the province's political future would start before the general election. His remarks followed a meeting with Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the province's two main Unionist parties. The meeting was the latest in an intensive round of meetings between Unionist and Nationalist leaders over the last two months. Until this week there were hopes that the talks, which collapsed last July, might resume shortly. Mr Brooke conceded that 'significant problems' remained but he was careful not to play down too far the chances of success. His comments may have been designed to increase pressure on the leaders to resume talks. Further talks with the province's political leaders are likely to held later this week in London. Mr Brooke also denied speculation that the Tories were trying to attract Unionist support in anticipation of a hung parliament after the general election. He said there was 'zero truth' in the rumours. Unionists say they have accepted Mr Brooke's formula for resuming talks on a devolved government in the province and on relations with Dublin and London. But Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, has accused them of submitting new pre-conditions.</p>

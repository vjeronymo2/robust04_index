			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- "A considerable part of  documents on the clearing up of radiological waste dumps in  Moscow was lost, following the dissolution of architecture  departments at the former district executive committees," said  Sergey Okhrimenko, head of the department monitoring the sources  of ionizing irradiation at the State Sanitary and  Epidemiological Inspectorate.    Since the 1970s large-scale projects were carried out in  Moscow to reveal and eliminate radioactive landfills. In all,  1,200 such landfills grounds were revealed, most of them in  south and south- east Moscow. Now that a part of documents has  been lost, the sites of these landfills, the volume of work  carried out to clear them up and the composition of isotopes  influencing changes in the radiation level, are not known.  There is a danger of radioactive contamination, especially  during new residential construction. Okhrimenko said that they  are drafting a special document, called ecological passport of  residential and public construction, according to which a  package of geological inspection and anti- radiation measures  should be carried out in sites of potential residential  construction.</p>

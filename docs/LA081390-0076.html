			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: LANE-SPLITTING MANNERS A MATTER OF MUTUAL RESPECT  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart: Why do freeway drivers seem to carry a grudge against  motorcyclists? Not all do, of course, but the few who do are downright  dangerous.  </P> <P> I am middle-aged and ride one of those big, full-dress touring bikes. Suffice  to say I enjoy it. Like many motorcyclists, I split lanes in backed-up  bumper-to-bumper traffic.  </P> <P> It's not always easy. I have had car drivers pull over in front of me to cut me  off and block me from passing. If I don't see them in time, they could easily  knock me down and into the path of an oncoming car or truck.  </P> <P> Obviously, many commuters are troubled by such lane splitting, but all of us  motorcycle riders are really doing them a favor. If you took every motorcycle  on every freeway and put them into a lane of traffic, I'll guarantee it would  move every car a half-mile farther back than they are now.  </P> <P> It seems the mentality of most people is, "If I have to wait, everybody has to  wait." But we are not costing anybody any time. In fact, we are actually saving  everybody time spent on the freeway. Give us a break. Leave a little room.  </P> <P> Robert G. Xiques  </P> <P> Orange  </P> <P> An interesting point. I'm not sure just how much time the average commuter  saves because lane-splitting motorcyclists aren't taking up space in the  regular traffic lanes, but it must be a bit. There are, after all, more than 4  million registered motorcycles in the United States, 643,000 in California  alone.  </P> <P> For the uninformed, lane splitting is legal in stalled traffic as long as the  motorcyclist is moving at a safe speed. Unfortunately, some cyclists rip at a  breakneck pace along the narrow corridor formed between the lanes of idling  cars, putting themselves in a precarious position if some driver suddenly  swings into another lane.  </P> <P> While car drivers should be careful to watch out for motorcycles splitting  lanes during the daily peak traffic crunch, cyclists should also take  precautions by keeping their speed down in such situations. California Highway  Patrol officers typically recommend a motorcyclist go no faster than 10 m.p.h.  than the flow of traffic when splitting lanes.  </P> <P> Don't look to do much cruising along 4th Street between Santa Ana and Tustin in  the months to come. At 1 a.m. sharp this coming Friday, the state Department of  Transportation will shut down the 4th Street bridges over both the Santa Ana  and Costa Mesa freeways and begin making preparations to demolish the  structures.  </P> <P> It's all being done as part of the ambitious effort to widen the traffic-choked  Santa Ana Freeway. To expand the freeway from its current clogged six lanes to  a commuter-friendly 12 lanes, the agency has to widen each of the bridges along  the route, and the 4th Street crossings are first on the list. So down they'll  come to make way for a pair of new structures, which Caltrans officials hope to  complete in about a year.  </P> <P> The bridge work is really just an initial step in what promises to be a  decade-long construction project. When completed, the freeway will consist of  12 lanes from its intersection with the San Diego Freeway on the south to the  Orange and Garden Grove freeways on the north.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Freeway was built in the mid-1950s as a rural four-lane freeway  and expanded to six lanes in 1965. Unchecked population growth since then has  dropped the average peak-hour speed on the freeway from 50 m.p.h. to less than  20.  </P> <P> Money to expand the freeway has always been scarce, but passage of Proposition  111, the state gas-tax hike, has solved that problem.  </P> <P> Now comes the hard part: the dust and noise and bother of construction. While  we all put up with that for the next 10 years, motorists can get a peek at what  the project will look like when it's completed. Caltrans has an impressive,  16-by-20-foot model of the entire network that will be on display at the Irvine  Transportation Center beginning today. The display moves in November to the  Tustin Senior Center, Caltrans said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LANCASTER MAN DENIES HOME ARSON  </P> <P> An Antelope Valley water board member pleaded innocent to arson charges after  his arrest in connection with a fire that heavily damaged his Lancaster home,  authorities said today.  </P> <P> Glenn D. Martin, 66, a member of the board of directors of the Antelope  Valley-East Kern Water Agency, was arrested Monday on suspicion of arson of a  residential dwelling, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> Martin, who was released on $10,000 bail after his arraignment, is suspected of  setting a fire Thursday in his home in the 500 block of East Avenue J, deputies  said. Damage to the home was estimated at $90,000, and Los Angeles County fire  reports say an "unauthorized junkyard" on the property hindered efforts to  extinguish the 3:45 p.m. fire and endangered firefighters.  </P> <P> Martin has previously clashed with the city over his practice of storing junk  metal and other debris on his property, authorities said. Martin could not be  reached for comment.  </P></p>

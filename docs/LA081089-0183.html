			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR MANY FIRMS, IT'S NOT ALL IN THE FAMILY  </P> <P> If history is any kind of teacher, the key to success in running a large,  publicly owned family business often is to let someone else do it.  </P> <P> "The test of history has shown that it is very dangerous for a family to run a  big firm," said Alfred Chandler, retired professor of business history at  Harvard University's business school.  </P> <P> The resignation of Frederick A. Wang this week as president of Wang  Laboratories Inc. may be a case in point.  </P> <P> Wang Laboratories, founded by Frederick's father, An Wang, until recently had  phenomenal success, growing into a $3-billion company largely on the success of  its word processors.  </P> <P> But keeping family members running the business may no longer be possible as  the company struggles to fend off lenders, boost a sagging stock price and  shore up mounting losses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Pleased  </P> <P> Chandler points out that some of the best names in business are those of  prestigious families such as the Rockefellers and Du Ponts who preserved their  fortunes by installing well-paid professional managers while keeping tight  control over their companies through stock holdings.  </P> <P> Perhaps the classic case of a dynasty losing control of a company is Ford Motor  Co., which eventually turned the reins over from Henry Ford II to Philip  Caldwell in 1979.  </P> <P> Since then, family members such as Edsel Ford II and William Clay Ford Jr. have  made clear their displeasure with the lack of family in top company posts.  </P> <P> Many family-owned businesses, however, fight to retain their dynasties, often  sparking dissension among other family members or unhappiness among board  members.  </P> <P> In entrepreneurial companies such as Wang, it often is impossible for a son or  daughter to replicate the success of the founder.  </P> <P> "The tendency is to look at Fred Wang and wonder why he isn't able to solve the  company's problems or have the same vision his father had," said Abraham  Zeleznik, a professor at Harvard University Business School.  </P> <P> The younger Wang might take comfort in remembering the plight of Robert W.  Sarnoff, who proved unable to duplicate the success of a highly inventive  father.  </P> <P> Sarnoff was ousted as chief executive of RCA by the company's board in 1975,  ending a family reign that started with his father David 45 years earlier.  </P> <P> At the time, it was assumed that Sarnoff's removal was due to a failed effort  in computers and his inability to repeat his father's successful gamble in the  color television market.  </P> <P> Experts in family succession say nepotism does not have to kill a company and  many succeed through generations of family management -- particularly if they  are not publicly held.  </P> <P> "It's a crap shoot," said Robert Dewar, professor of organizational behavior at  Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. "There have  been tremendous successes, and there are mega-disasters where you can't get the  family out of there."  </P></p>

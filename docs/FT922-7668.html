			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (10): Focus shifts to Venice WOULD A home in a Venetian 'palace' with your own private office wing, be of interest? After four years of selling London's Docklands as a smart place in which to live, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley partner Stephan Miles-Brown is now offering property in Venice, which he sees as an area worth watching. Lord McAlpine and other British businessmen already have homes there, he points out. Venice and Docklands, he says, have some things in common. Both were important trading centres. Both have tall, flat-fronted old buildings looking on to water. Each has an airport close at hand. The old buildings that became fashionable housing in Docklands were originally warehouses. In Venice what are offered are more likely to be important mansions. For example, on sale is the principal part of Ca' Lipomano, a 17th century palazzo. The property is on the island of Zattere and overlooks the Giudecca canal. Little has been done to the exterior but the interior has been restored. There is a ground floor entrance hall with staircase and private lift. The main section is the second floor apartment, with its high-ceilinged rooms, stucco work, inlaid doors and frescos. A 32 ft reception hall/dining room leads into the drawing room, formerly the ballroom. There is a second reception room/music room. Doors at either end of the apartment open on to balconies looking towards canals. There is a study/bedroom, two other bedrooms and bathrooms, kitchen, further rooms and staff flat. The property has a walled garden leading to a water gate and private quay on a small canal, the Rio Ognissanti. A three-storey, 3,600 sq ft office wing has been built in the garden. It can be reached from the main building or from the water gate. Frank Bonfanti, director, market and sales development Europe, for Kellogg, who is selling the property, says that as the wing is modern and not listed, a buyer might prefer to use it differently. It could, for instance, be redeveloped into five small apartments, with a roof terrace. Bonfanti and his brothers inherited Ca' Lipomano but have had to sell its antique furniture to pay death duties. They are reluctantly disposing of the property. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-824-8171) is seeking offers over Pounds 2.275m.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (26): The last word on Unix - X/Open The definition of an Open System has always been open to question. Dr Johnson, were he still labouring over his dictionary, would have to turn to the body called X/Open for the definitive description. X/Open, the new owner of the name Unix, has a definition that would overshadow Johnson's own life work; 24 volumes weighing half a hundredweight (unless delivered on compact disk). Most associate 'openness' with Unix, the operating system adopted in the 1980s by so many minicomputer vendors that it overcame the proprietary interests of any one, including IBM. Ten years ago, not everyone was convinced that this committee-inspired camel with unconventional pedigree would win out over their sleek proprietary horses. Many backed both, just in case. But in a decade, Unix has become the undisputed mid-range standard, which has changed the face, and more prosaically the pricing structure, of computing. X/Open - a collaboration of interested parties, yet also an authority over all of them - has the job of moving the industry towards a single, unified specification for the Unix operating system. As in religion and politics, the most bitter fighting has been internal. According to Geoff Morris, president of X/Open and the high priest of open systems, there is only one way ahead and it is open. 'The world's major businesses report their external spending on open systems will dominate 58 per cent of the world market by 1996,' he said. Mr Morris has more detail to back up this claim. It comes from X/Open's annual market research, called Xtra, and more than 80 IT user organisations serving on X/Open's user council. VESTED INTERESTS There have been a confusing number of organisations campaigning for various Unix causes, mostly driven by allied vendors with a vested interest. But the Open Systems Foundation (OS/F), the defunct Unix International, and even the Common Open Software Environment (Cose), have all been more concerned with vendor-issues than user-led issues. X/Open works with OS/F, (whose work will now reference X/Open's Xtra requirement process) as well as through a number of committees and other associations such as the Object Management Group and the Network Management Forum. The real change for X/Open is more to do with users than vendors. Users, at last, are demanding a place in the forum and some input into the decision-making, especially in committee. This is perhaps the least perceptible development, but the most significant and promising long-term one, because 'open' is not just about new systems, and not just about Unix. Mr Morris said, 'X/Open has suffered from being dependent on the vendor-led community but by 1993 only half its income came from vendors, and by 1995, it will be less than a quarter.' Richard Jaross is director of Uniforum, an organisation set up to represent the many different bodies with an interest in open systems. He is among those seeking to broaden the definition - 'an open system makes it possible for users to run their applications seamlessly across computer platforms, no matter who wrote the underlying systems software, or who made the computing hardware,' he said. The market has caught up with this idea because, as Xtra confirmed, users now put 'openness' high on the list for new systems. The spread of client-server systems, usually with Unix-based systems at the centre, is part of the user-led drive to downsize. But power on the desktop is more useful if it can interface with other systems. LONG-AWAITED MOMENT Symbolically, in October 1993, X/Open became the owner of the name Unix. Novell, which acquired the Unix system last year, granted its trademark rights to X/Open for use as one of its standard brands. This marked a moment that many Unix proponents had long hoped for, when no single vendor would own Unix. In September last year came the technical embodiment of this aim: Spec 1170. This is the single specification devised to replace existing incompatible versions after 1994, to which all products using the name Unix must comply. The 1170 tag itself, was a reminder of how far Unix had come since it was discovered by a generation of students doing their own thing on DEC PDP-11/70s. Spec 1170 is the blend between a single and a multiple Unix, which allows individual suppliers to add extras to their products to improve performance and functions, just as they always have. 'The events of the last year have forced the hand of Unix vendors, bringing a more practical slant to the Unix debate,' said Mark Kusionowicz, manager of systems product marketing in the server systems division of UK systems supplier ICL. 'In effect, the unwelcome advance of NT has had a positive influence on the supplier industry.' According to an end user, Rob Winterbourne, the Unix systems support team manager at Barclays Computer Operations, the issue of 'Unices' is less relevant as the movement advances. 'The major benefits are in the portability of applications,' he said. 'To us as a business, the formalisation of 'middleware' and the ability to put pressure on suppliers is important. For Joe Developer, it shouldn't matter if he's working on an IBM RS/6000, an HP9000 or a DEC Alpha. Spec1170 is an indication that X/Open, while still dominated by suppliers, really is bending towards users.' X/Open's latest initiative is to address a marketplace not even dreamed of when Unix was used on teletype terminals: the information highways leading to the desktop (see D for Desktop Video). The X/Open Desktop Working Group will address the co-existence of many different environments on one screen. X/Open specified products will be tested - the tricky bit - and 'branded.' Unix is the key to most Open Systems solutions and it is that rare phenomenon in the computer industry - a standard reached by consensus. This consensus was not achieved without casualties but the whole idea was that some people would have to give up their own idiosyncratic interpretations of Unix in the cause of standards. X/Open has survived and flourished in spite of the various Unix sects, by concentrating on deliverables like the Application Programming Interfaces specified in 1170. Along with the most successful collaborations in the motor industry, the pooled resources should result in developments for the common good. 'X/Open has customers,' Mr Morris said. 'It can demonstrate where it adds value. A few years ago, no one would have thought that of a standards organisation.' X/Open was set up in 1984 to oversee the technical nitty-gritty of specifying an applications environment for Unix. Its mission statement (aptly named given the religious fervour of its proponents), was 'to bring greater value to users through the practical implementation of open systems'. Ten years ago, not everyone was convinced Unix would work, let alone X/Open. The organisation carried all the hopes and fears of the Unix community. Early commentators thought it a well-meaning cause doomed by political in-fighting. To succeed it had to persuade its constituents, the suppliers, to abandon some of the very things they had done to make Unix a more appealing option on their particular hardware. FRAGMENTATION X/Open, the aim of which was to eliminate industry fragmentation, stayed dignified throughout the so-called 'Unix wars' in which vendors aligned themselves under separate banners, bickering over such standards as graphical user interfaces. Unix itself had unpromising antecedents for a universal operating system. It was owned, not by the giant IBM but by AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, which in the late 1970s was not allowed to compete in the computer market. This resulted in text peppered with the famous trade mark, 'Unix is a trademark of Bell Laboratories', and the farcical situation that anyone wanting to provide Unix had to license it, debug it and badge it by some other name - inevitably, one with an X in it. Unix represented an opportunity for the rest of the Bunch (the term used to describe the also-rans who competed with IBM) to create a common platform on which applications would be portable.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares unsettled by the Bank's inflation report - Market Report Any benefit from the Bundesbank's reduction in both its key interest rates yesterday was counterbalanced, as far as the London stock market was concerned, by the Bank of England's warning on inflation pressures in the UK. Share prices opened higher as London tried to follow other European bourses in anticipating the Bundesbank rate cuts. But London had already turned off before the Bundesbank announcement and recovered only part of its fall by the close of business. With most European centres now closed until Friday for the Ascension Day break, London drifted in late trading, wary of a move by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was looking weak when London closed for the day. The continued nervousness of the London market was reflected in a near 26-point swing in leading indices. The FT-SE 100 Index, up 11.4 initially and down 14.2 later, ended at 3,130.5 for a net loss of 5.8. The Bank of England's inflation report was seen by some commentators as a warning that the next move in domestic interest rates could be upwards and might not be long delayed. Equities soon reversed their early advance, shrugging off gains in UK government bonds and sterling, both of which responded favourably to the Bank's comments. Also discouraging for the stock market was the disclosure of sharp, and wholly unexpected, falls in UK industrial and manufacturing output in March. While analysts hastened to stress that one month's data can be unreliable and that the underlying trend of output remains upwards, the announcement sat badly with the Bank's warning on inflation and interest rates. Any combination of a faltering economy and renewed inflation would be sad news for the stock market. Company news was mostly positive for the market, although the individual shares concerned could not shrug off the market trend. Higher dividend payments from J. Sainsbury and Royal Bank of Scotland sustained optimism on dividend growth among UK companies. Speculative activity was also seen, with the Lasmo/Enterprise Oil situation attracting attention again. The broader range of the market followed the trend in the blue chip stocks, leaving the FT-SE Mid 250 Index with a decline on the day of 10.8 at 3,742.5. Seaq volume increased slightly to 744.2m shares from Tuesday's 728.9m, worth Pounds 1.34bn in retail business. Retail, or genuine investment business, has remained good in spite of recent uncertainties. There were sharp losses among the building and construction issues, regarded as particularly vulnerable to any threat of higher UK interest rates. Some dollar stocks were helped by the strength of the US currency. Oil shares, however, turned dull, with Shell Transport unable to make progress after disclosing trading figures much in line with expectations. The London market is likely to remain in slack water today, waiting for the rest of Europe to reopen on Friday morning, and fearful that the US data on retail sales, producer prices and jobless claims, may provoke a move today from the Federal Reserve. Friday will bring further important figures on the US economy and the following Tuesday sees the next meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee - another danger point for global interest rates.</p>

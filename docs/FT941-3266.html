			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Denmark must repay illegal tax Denmark's Supreme Court yesterday ordered the government to repay a company DKr800,000 (Pounds 80,000) in taxes ruled illegal by the European Court, but it failed to set a clear precedent for other companies on DKr55bn levied in total in illegal taxes between 1988 and 1991. The court ruled that Bose Danmark, the subsidiary of an American loudspeaker company, should have the tax repaid on the grounds that the tax caused the company a loss. But it ruled against a second company, Denkavit, which sold milk substitutes to farms, because the company proved no loss. The tax, known as the labour market contribution, was a special 2.6 per cent addition to value added tax and replaced a wage bill tax. The effect was to benefit exporting companies (VAT is not paid on exports) and to penalise importers and companies with mainly domestic sales. The European Court ruled last year the tax was illegal because it was discriminatory. Mr Ole Stavad, minister for taxation, welcomed the ruling, but said that it was unclear how much money the government might have to repay.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The heads of most terror organizations in the Gaza  Strip have met in Gaza over the last two days. The meetings  included Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, and  rejectionist organizations members. The meetings were held to  prepare for the autonomy period. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan  reports the meetings were initiated by PLO officials in the Gaza  Strip. The participants discussed cooperation possibilities  between the various organizations, with the view of establishing  a civilian and security cooperation apparatus after the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] withdraws from the area. The meetings  were held against the background of an agreement reached  yesterday between 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm,  and the Fatah Hawks on putting an end to acts of revenge against  collaborators and stopping the strikes.</p>

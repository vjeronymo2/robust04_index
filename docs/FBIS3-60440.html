Minic report: "The Winter -- a New Challenge"] </F>   [Text] This winter the Yugoslavs will experience the  sanctions in their full harshness, while our health will be the  first to suffer the consequences of the sanctions. The experts  of the Belgrade Institute for Health Care anticipate an  increased number of those suffering from the infections of the  respiratory organs, because of inadequate clothing and bad  heating.    Influenza, a respiratory infection, whose spreading is  particularly benefited by closed rooms, such as are usually  found in firms, is this year assisted by some new circumstances:  A new sort of virus, but also a new sort of closed room -- the  vehicles of public transportation. Only a small step divides  influenza from pneumonia, which is the major complication,  particularly in the case of the elderly, who chronically suffer  from such diseases....    Flu Contracted on a Bus [subhead]    Epidemiologists forecast that the overcrowding of schools  and  institutions of collective accommodation will result in an  increase in cases of streptococcus infections, as well as of  food poisoning, because, in the meantime, the systematic control  of the production, transportation, and conservation of food  supplies has ceased. An insufficient and low-quality nutrition  brings about a general deterioration of the immunity of citizens.    Some bleak forecasts have already come true: In the last two  years in our capital there has been a growing number of mental,  contagious, and so called insufficiently defined diseases, that  is to say, cases without diagnosis.    "In the period prior to the sanctions, that is from 1986 to  1990, the number of those who died of contagious diseases was  213 on average, two years later it was 272 (27 percent more),  while in the first quarter of this year as much as four times  more cases of death have been reported, relative to last year.  The reason for worry lies with the fact that people are even  dying of diseases that are normally quite curable if a correct  therapy is implemented. This is to say, the main problem is the  lack of medicines," Professor Dr. Svetislav Ristic, head of the  Epidemiologic Department at the Federal Institute for Health  Care, says.    Prof. Dr. Teodor Bakovic, director of the aforementioned  institute, says that the number of newly registered patients  suffering from active tuberculosis has increased by 8.6 percent,  as well as the number of those suffering from psychosis, which  has increased by 3.8 percent. This figure refers only to the  cases registered by general practitioners.    The analysis of autopsy reports in the period prior to the  imposition of the UN sanctions and after it, speaks convincingly  for how endangered the health of Yugoslav citizens is.    "The cases of infections have considerably increased in the  time of the sanctions, particularly cases of pneumonia and  sepsis as causes of death. In the period before the  implementation of the sanctions, there were 20 percent of such  cases, while after the implementation, the number of such cases  has jumped to 42 percent. Before the embargo, infections as  causes of death were reported in 31 percent of all death cases,  while afterwards in almost 58 percent of cases," Prof. Dr.  Vladimir Kanjuh from the Institute for Pathology with the  Faculty for Medical Sciences, says.    Diagnosis -- Unknown [subhead]    Since the sanctions were implemented, the number of accurate  diagnosis has sunk considerably. Until the end of 1992, 42  percent of diagnosis were correct, 39 percent were partly  correct, while 19 percent were incorrect. With the  deterioration of the conditions in the health care institutions,  only 27 percent of diagnosis have been proven correct, 38  percent partly, while as much as 35 percent have been proven  incorrect!    There are many reasons for that: The reduced number of  regular medical checkups, the lack of diagnostic instruments and  medicines, problems in the field of disinfection and  disinfestation....    Among the most frequent causes of death, apart from  "traditional" diseases, the violent forms of death (suicides,  murders, accidents) have also found their place on the scale.  After a long time, anemia (poor condition of blood) has  reappeared as one of the most frequent diseases, as a  consequence of inadequate nutrition. We are no longer safe from  diseases that can be prevented (by a vaccine), because the  number of children immunized by the DI-TE-PER [against  diphtheria, tetanus, and periostitis] has dropped from 88 to 70  percent, while those vaccinated against chicken pox have dropped  from 88 to 76 percent, partly because of the shortage, partly  because of malfunctions, and partly because of the difficulties  of transport.  All age groups are endangered, without distinction, while the  prospects for the future are even worse. The study worked out  by Dr. Viktorija Cucic stresses, among other things, that the  conditions for carrying out scientific research will be reduced  by 64 percent, the possibilities for specialization will drop by  61 percent, the chances for providing basic medicines by 46  percent, while conditions for keeping up the  hygienic-epidemiologic level in health care institutions will be  reduced by 38 percent. The consequence of these changes will be  a decline in the birth rate, an increase in the infant  mortality-rate, an increase in cases of cardiovascular diseases,  ulcers, mental disorders, diabetes, tuberculosis....    The conclusion is quite unambiguous: Either the sanctions  are lifted in the field of medicine, or we shall die out.

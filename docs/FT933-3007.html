			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / A half-written play between two acts: Japan's new coalition policies are expected to emerge soon JAPANESE politics, in its present confused and fluid state, is like a half-written play, in between two acts. As the interval drags out, the actors behind the scenes are hammering out the next stage of the plot. That is the analysis of Mr Shigeru Ito, top political theorist in the Social Democratic party, the largest and shakiest partner in Japan's month-old coalition government. The jovial Mr Ito, once dubbed the 'brain of the Socialists' by Mrs Takako Doi, former party chairwoman and current speaker of the lower house of parliament, became transport minister a month ago. The SDP, formerly called the Japan Socialist party, was thrust into power by the collapse of the conservative LDP government following defections from its ranks. 'For nearly 40 years, Japan was run by a millionaires' party, the LDP, with one party of opposition: us. Act One consisted of the change of administration. I believe that in the latter half of next year, the bell for Act Two will start to ring. At that stage, you will see new policies begin to solidify, placing Japan in a new world,' says Mr Ito, 65. What those new policies will be remains to be seen. Between now and the general election which he expects late next year, Mr Ito believes that the seven-party government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa will manage to hold together, despite its divisions. The big uncertainty in all this is whether the SDP will walk out, so depriving the coalition of its majority in parliament. Its left wing is offended by the fact that the party, humiliated in the July general election, has now suppressed some cherished policies, such as support for North Korea, to please its coalition partners. Mr Sadao Yamahana, party chairman, who like Mr Ito has tried to steer the SDP towards the moderate right, has stood down as a result. However, Mr Ito is convinced the battle for Mr Yamahana's successor, to be chosen at the weekend, will be won by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, a moderate candidate with support from both right and left. 'It is almost a fact that Murayama will become chairman of the SDP. He will fully support the Hosokawa administration,' says Mr Ito. Mr Murayama is said to count on the support of two-thirds of the membership. In the year ahead, political movements born of the summer political upheaval will gather into five main streams, Mr Ito believes. The LDP has already redivided into two groups: a conservative old guard and young members keen on party reform, represented by Mr Yohei Kono, who was elected LDP president after the election defeat. A third stream consists of liberal-minded former LDP politicians who belong to new parties. They include Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party and the New Harbinger party headed by the prime minister's close friend and ally, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. The pair are planning a merger. Fourth, there are the former LDP powerbrokers who masterminded the old government's defeat, such as Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-founder of the Japan Renewal party, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, party founder and present foreign minister, who hold to a conservative line. The fifth and largest, but divided, stream is the centre-left, led by the SDP with a handful of smaller fringe groupings around it. The next election, Mr Ito predicts, will be fought between two coalitions made up from these groupings. 'A US-style two-party system just would not suit Japan because it could not cover our complex mentality,' he argues. He has no illusions about the uncertainty of his own party's future in all this. Mr Ito has no idea exactly which parties the SDP will choose as coalition partners for the next election. However, he says, 'it is clear we will have to co-operate with the liberals' (by which Mr Ito means Mr Hosokawa). First, the SDP needs to work on its image, he acknowledges. The party did even worse than the LDP in the election, losing half its parliamentary seats as voters shunned the two oldest mainstream parties in favour of new political movements and promises of change from the rigid system of the past. 'We made a strategic error. Voters thought we stood against progress, like a red light. We must change that light to green.' Mr Ito knows he faces a hard task. The SDP in parliament is larger than the former Tanaka faction of the LDP to which Mr Hosokawa used to belong, but much less powerful, he says. Meanwhile, the party has to adjust to the decline of socialism the world over. He wryly recalls being told by Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialist former French prime minister, when on a visit to Japan, that the secret of French socialism was its intellectual advantage. Clearly, that is no longer true in France and has not been true in Japan for the past 45 years in which the SDP has been out if power. Even so, he claims, 'I am not pessimistic about the future.'</p>

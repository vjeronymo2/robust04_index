			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Letter: Thorp - doubts about Japan's needs and the plant's future (2) Sir, Paradoxically, a letter from Japanese utilities (June 18) stating their support for Thorp may be the clearest sign yet that the plant will never operate. When Bronwen Maddox wrote of Thorp as a 'Whitehall nightmare' ('Nuclear scheme that became a 16-year Whitehall nightmare', May 8) she noted that 'fear of incurring penalties would make it hard for the government to raise the wider question of whether abandoning the plant, and releasing all parties from the contracts, could be in the mutual interest of the UK and Thorp's foreign customers'. Civil servants had described the situation as a nuclear 'prisoners' dilemma'. Foreign utilities and their governments also fear penalties and view the prisoners' dilemma from an opposite but symmetrical perspective to the UK. If they wish to find a way out of reprocessing, their most effective tactics are to force the UK government unilaterally to abandon Thorp, while they declare their unflinching support for the plant. In that way, they may hope to avoid liability and the punitive terms of their contracts with BNFL. In fact, two recent events support this scenario. The first is that European countries agreed tough new conditions under the Paris Convention for radioactive discharges from Thorp that BNFL will find difficult to meet. Support for this was particularly forthcoming from Thorp's major European customers. The second is the letter from the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan registering full commitment to Thorp and the plutonium fuel cycle. Such actions and declared support are consistent with Thorp's foreign customers seeking advantage in the end-game for the plant. The UK should act decisively, and devote its efforts to closing the plant on profitable terms rather than continue the futile struggle to keep it going.

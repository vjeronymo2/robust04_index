			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Rich strains of the Gothic - Fiction THE WATERWORKS by E L Doctorow Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 246 pages THE ALIENIST by Caleb Carr Little, Brown Pounds 16.99, 534 pages NO NIGHT IS TOO LONG by Barbara Vine Viking Pounds 15, 326 pages It is good to be reminded of the joy, the fun, the satisfaction of a good novel which sweeps you along, engrosses, persuades you to ignore The Nine O'Clock News and forget about walking the dog. EL Doctorow is an old master of this art - remember Ragtime, The Book of Daniel, Billy Bathgate and the rest? - and now, with The Waterworks, he repeats the trick. The scene is New York in 1871, when the city was controlled by the notorious Boss Tweed. The narrator, crusty City Editor of the Telegram, worries about the disappearance of one of his young reporters, Martin Pemberton; he discovers that Pemberton has seen his dead father, Augustus, dealer in slaves and shoddy war supplies, who had mysteriously died without his criminal fortune. Martin, followed by his editor and by the only uncorrupt captain in New York's Municipal Police, sets off in pursuit of the conspiracy and comes upon a surgeon of evil genius, Dr Sartorius, and the orphanage where the wretched street urchins of the city are used in order to provide a promise of eternal life for rich old men who are reluctant to die. This is not a ghost story, as at first seems possible ('ghosts don't come in crowds'), but it certainly has a rich strain of the Gothic. It is a vivid tale, told with a pace and a relish to suspend our disbelief most willingly. Doctorow's central character is not so much Dr Sartorius as the New York of those post-bellum years ('the soul of the city was always my subject . . .'), and it is for this, not the plot, that this novel will be remembered. My only objection is to Doctorow's excessive use of a caesura of triple-dots, which stud every paragraph in a stylistic device which becomes irritating rather than illuminative of a particular narrative rhythm . . . By an odd coincidence, Caleb Carr's first novel, The Alienist, shares many of Doctorow's subjects. A clumsy mix of psychological drama and historical thiller, it recreates early New York (1896 this time) in extreme detail, with a journalist-narrator, a corrupt police force, and abused children. Even the Croton Reservoir water supply features again. Theodore Roosevelt is Police Commissioner at the time, Dr Kreisler is an 'alienist', as the early psychiatrists apparently were called. With the aid of New York's first woman cop and the narrator from the Times, they pursue a serial killer who is hideously mutilating the children. Unfortunately Carr, like many first-time novelists, feels obliged to throw in everything he knows or has researched. The Alienist, absurdly over-long and written in a style which has too little distinction, serves mainly to prove how much he could learn from Doctorow. The point of Ruth Rendell taking the alter ego pen name of Barbara Vine, as I understood it, was that she would thereby cease to be confined by the limits of the 'crime novel'. Her latest, No Night Is Too Long, is a study - an unravelling - of a bisexual love story with a heavy twist in the plot. Handsome young Tim Cornish, frail in his sexuality, falls in love with palaeontologist Ivo Steadman. Ivo only slowly returns the emotion, but narrator Tim thereupon reverses - 'he loved me, therefore I loved him no longer'. And then, in Alaska, Tim meets Isabel and, yes, falls in love with her. But wait - who is Isabel? That takes us to the halfway mark and Ms Vine has a long way to go. Either you like this sort of thing or you don't. Her prose, as always, is cool, elegant, entirely under control, a touch flat. The sex, both gay and straight, will offend only the older great aunts. Suffolk is well done and Alaska has been researched. To me, it goes on too long, rather like the previous bestseller, Asta's Book (just reissued by Penguin). I could not help feeling that this was a spinning of words, cleverly and professionally done, but essentially unreal, diverting us for a few hours but saying nothing to address our own unfictitious lives. Many novels do.</p>

The public comment period ended on August 23, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in ``The Honolulu Advertiser'' on July 16, 1993, ``The Maui News'' on July 21, 1993, and the ``Hawaii Tribune Herald on July 19, 1993. One letter of comment was received offering additional information on the distribution of one taxon. This information has been incorporated into this final rule. One phone call was received opposing the listing and raising the following issue:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The control of feral ungulates is unnecessary and done using inhumane methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several studies verify that feral ungulates damage native plants and habitats. Feral goats and pigs have been implicated in the damage of native vegetation ranging from lowland to subalpine areas (Mueller-Dombois and Spatz 1972; Spatz and Mueller-Dombois 1973, 1975; Scowcroft and Sakai 1983). Goat browsing damage has been observed on individuals of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insulare <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (R. Shaw,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993). Goats, sheep, axis deer, and/or pigs threaten all four taxa through habitat degradation. Recovery efforts for these four endangered taxa should include the control of feral ungulates, but this control should be done in the most humane way possible, consistent with the need to protect the habitat of these taxa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A species may be determined to be an endangered species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). The threats facing these four taxa are summarized in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

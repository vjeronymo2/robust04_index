			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Franjo Tudjman at Zagreb </F> airport upon his return from a visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina --  live]    [Text] [Reporter] We are reporting directly from Zagreb  airport where the president of the Republic, Franjo Tudjman, has  just arrived. Mr. President, let us please begin. Could you  comment on your two-day visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina and tell us  the most important things -- have your expectations been  fulfilled and what happens now?    [Tudjman] I believe I could say on behalf of the Croatian  state delegation that our expectations have been absolutely  justified and fulfilled. We held talks with the state and  political leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Mr. Izetbegovic  [Bosnian president], Mr. Zubak [Bosnian Croat leader], Ganic  [Bosnian vice president], Silajdzic [Bosnian prime minister] and  their associates. Understandably, the talks focused on the  implementation of the Washington agreement on the creation of  both the Croat-Muslim federation and the confederation with  Croatia. We achieved full unanimity in this respect and we also  specifically discussed economic and legal cooperation. I  believe that, in this regard, our visit was completely  worthwhile.    In addition, everything else about the visit was of great  interest. The very opening of the Croatian Embassy in Sarajevo  was marked by the presence of many Croats from Sarajevo. It was  there that we discovered out that there are 120 Croats at  Sarajevo University. We were pleasantly surprised by the young  Croats' choir and we also met many other Sarajevans.    We and the citizens of Sarajevo attached particular  importance to our stroll through the streets of Sarajevo --  something not so common in these wartime days.    Apart from Sarajevo, we visited central Bosnia -- Nova Bila,  Vitez, Busovaca. What happened in Nova Bila should really be  seen -- the conditions in which the local doctors worked while  they were attending the wounded and taking care of the Croat  population. Although the delegation members and I had been  informed about this and watched your television reports, to  witness this in person is a very moving experience. This should  be written about, told about. I am taking this opportunity to  appeal to the Croatian public to pay tribute to those people by  helping them build a new hospital. Instead of an operating  theater, they are still performing surgery in improvised  premises at the church, where wooden benches are sometimes used  as hospital beds.    Our encounters with Croats in central Bosnia and later in  Herzegovina show that the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina  have accepted the Washington agreements but that there are still  some open questions. When we explained that everything that has  been accomplished in resisting Serb aggression with the creation  of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, its military units and  organization of authority, that all this will remain intact  until the Croat-Muslim federation and the confederation become a  tangible reality, people both in Herzegovina and in Bosnia  approved.    Wherever we went, Citluk, Capljina, especially Mostar  [pauses] the visit to Mostar was of great interest to us, but it  was also important for the citizens of Mostar. We went for a  walk in the streets of Mostar, we visited the Franciscan  monastery and the church that was demolished on 9 May, 1992.  This act of vandalism should be seen -- not only the  destruction of the church but also the bombing of the library.  This attests to the determination and courage of the people who  decided to remain until this day on the frontline in defense of  their right to remain on this soil.    However, we were very impressed by what we found in western  Mostar, the part under Croat control: About 25,000 Croats --  the figure is approximate, about 22 to 25,000 Croats -- are  living together with 9,000 Muslims and 3,000 Serbs without any  problems. This means that citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina are  really prepared to make an effort in the name of peace, that  they will accept a political solution, and that the Croatian  authorities in Mostar and in Herceg-Bosna and the Croat  representation [predstavnistvo] in the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina  sincerely wish to see that the drafts of the Croat-Bosniak  federation and a confederation with the Republic of Croatia are  realized, and that they have the support from the Croatian  people in all this.    [Reporter] I would ask one more question if possible. Mr.  President, I would go back to the talks in Sarajevo. Certain  agreements have been reached with President Alija Izetbegovic.  When do you expect these talks to be implemented in concrete  terms?    [Tudjman] The talks have already begun. As you know, at the  last session of the constituent assembly the leadership was  appointed, i.e. Mr. Kresimir Zubak was appointed president of  the federation, Ganic was appointed vice president, a premier  designate was also nominated. At the next session of the  assembly on 21 June work will continue on the forming and  appointment of the government. Other steps are also being taken.  Talks are starting on the canton borders. All this depends on  future talks and solutions which the international community  will come up with regarding efforts to solve the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis as a whole.    [Reporter] If there are no other questions, may I thank you,  Mr. President.    [Tudjman] Thank you.</p>

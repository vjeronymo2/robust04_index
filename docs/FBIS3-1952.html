			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Defense Minister Chi Haotian: "The Spirit of Pioneering </F> an Enterprise Through Arduous Effort is Still Needed"]    [Text] The leading character in the book "The People of  Xiadingjia" is Comrade Wang Yongxing, an old friend of mine. In  him, we can find traces of heroic fighting during wartime, the  quality of an exemplary worker, and a struggling and aggressive  character. The stunning and moving achievements he made in  leading the people of Xiadingjia through arduous efforts have  long been widely known on the agricultural fronts all over the  country. Not long ago, comrade Ai Qi, my old comrade-in-arms  and an author, gathered material, despite his old age, in the  mountainous areas of eastern Shandong and wrote down what he saw  and heard there and completed the book. After reading it, I  acclaim it and have mixed feelings.    Using detailed facts, the book illustrates how the  protagonist killed his enemies, made achievements, and then  vowed to pioneer a cause back home; how he bought a donkey for a  generously high price and engaged in war in adverse conditions  among the hills and rivers; how he made reforms and brought  forth new ideas and led the masses in a struggle to get rich.  This enables people to know the broad-mindedness and courage of  this unyielding old soldier and this undaunted man. The book  also tells with subtleness touching stories about him including  how he did not hang on to his achievements but would rather  become a peasant, how well he has strictly taught his children,  how he has remained uncorrupted, and how he withdrew to the  second front and how his remaining enthusiasm burned. This  enables us to feel deeply how he has worked selflessly for the  public interest and what lofty ideals he has by keeping his  hands clean, and how he has closely integrated himself with the  masses, and how he has harmoniously integrated his career and  life. All this is usual and lofty, respectable and credible.    As an ideal, Comrade Wang Yongxing and the people of  Xiadingjia reflect the spiritual outlook of China's 800 million  peasants; that is, they ardently love the party, the country,  the troops, and firm socialist beliefs; and that they have the  heroic courage of pioneering a cause and struggling  courageously, they have the aggressive spirit of being devoted  to reform and bringing forth new ideas and the fine virtues of  considering the situation as a whole and making a sacrifice  sincerely.... This is the supremely lofty soul of the Chinese  people and is the motivation rallying the people's support and  invigorating China.    The PLA is a great army. Over the past 60 years or more,  tens of thousands of youths with lofty ideas have been steeled  in this revolutionary cauldron. They have made indelible  contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people and to  construction. Comrade Wang Yongxing is a good example of  demobilized and handicapped servicemen and is a piece of good  steel from the cauldron of the army. Countless people like Wang  Yongxing have added glory to the army and have sacrificed for  the country with unlimited loyalty to the party and full ardor  and sincerity. One can see from them that our Army's glorious  traditions are being carried forward on all fronts and have  become a bright torch reflecting on the Great Wall of steel.    People who have been through the years of war deeply realize  that in order to struggle for national liberation and national  independence, it is necessary to endure countless dangers and  difficulties and blood-and-fire tests and to pay the cost of  sacrificing oneself and forgetting about death. Today, the  great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  under the party's leadership presents extremely heavy and  arduous tasks and still demands that we pioneer a cause  arduously and struggle continuously. The publication of the  book will offer people vivid teaching material so they can have  a strong belief in the party's leadership, have strong trust in  socialist beliefs, and carry forward the glorious traditions.  From it, we can absorb political nutrients, cultivate our  morals, arouse the revolutionary spirit, overcome all  difficulties, and proceed from success to success with full  confidence in our hearts.    What needs mentioning is that the author comrade Ai Qi was a  former serviceman. Since retirement, he has devoted himself to  the great tide of reform and construction by writing  courageously and ardently. This persistent spirit is valuable  and deserves praising. I sincerely congratulate the publication  of the book and look forward to the publication of more new  works by comrade Ai Qi.</p>

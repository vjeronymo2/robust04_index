			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Dealers grit their teeth at lack of progress / A report on the difficulties dogging Italy's new bond trading system Teething troubles with the new government bond dealing system introduced last month in Italy have left traders fuming. Combined with uncertainties about the impact of legal changes under the country's new securities law, hard-won progress could be at risk. Sluggish price reporting and slow response times are just two of the complaints levelled at the new system, run by Societa Interbancaria per l'Automazione (SIA), the bank-owned company which already operates Italy's computerised money markets. The new network replaced a Reuters system which underpinned Italy's screen-based primary dealers system. The new system, heralded as more flexible and faster than its predecessor, was seen as a further important step in the continuing modernisation of the bond market. SIA promised many additional features, especially the extra capacity to include more primary dealers and far more bonds. Capacity limitations for the booming bond market had been one of the biggest complaints. However, the new network, linking the 24 primary dealers which make markets in a select number of government bonds, has been dogged by technical problems. Although the number of breakdowns has fallen, price updating remains slow, especially when volume surges. Dealers in Milan are now cautiously optimistic that the bugs are being overcome. 'When it works, it's far superior to what we had before,' says one. But even after all the problems are resolved, the changeover has fuelled growing complaints among dealers outside Italy about unfair competition in securities trading. The problems with the new network mean traders in London, who should receive up-to-the minute prices via a data link from SIA to other international data sources, have found themselves confronted with prices which have been up to three hours out of date. 'We keep open lines with brokers in Milan, but it's proved a terrible handicap,' says one dealer. The result has been that foreign demand for Italian bonds has cooled, while arbitrage based on price differentials between the cash and futures market, listed on Liffe in London, has dried up altogether. Innovative instruments and improved trading practices have been the foundations to the growth of the Italian bond market in the past two years. Increased demand, particularly from abroad, has in turn allowed the government to extend the maturity of its debt, and, indirectly, lower borrowing costs. So the latest setbacks have rekindled fears that turnover may now decline as outsiders lose confidence in Italian paper. 'Italy can't afford a situation in which international investors return to the old pre-conceptions,' says one London-based trader. Some non-Italian dealers even see the new dealing system as part of an ill-concealed campaign to handicap non-Italian banks compared with their domestic rivals. 'Why couldn't they have run the two systems in parallel to sort out any problems?' asks one. 'It's clearly one of a number of political decisions aimed at bringing the market back to Italy.' Such accusations have struck a chord among foreign investment banks currently fighting Italy's new securities trading laws, which threaten to put them at a severe disadvantage compared with domestic counterparts. The problem has been the law inaugurating the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new breed of securities broking and fund management institution. As matters stand, it obliges companies trading in Italian securities with certain types of Italian counterparties to establish a local Sim. The new rules, which took effect last month, remain unclear in many respects, and the requirement to set up a Sim is not being rigorously enforced. But many foreign houses, especially those which have been concentrating their trading activities in London, have complained bitterly. Together, the technical bugs and doubts about the Sims law have dampened turnover on the bond market this year. Although volume on the primary dealers system exceeded L8,000bn (Dollars 6.67bn) on Monday - high by local standards - some dealers say trading would have been much greater but for foreigners' caution. 'The official turnover figures don't include international investors outside the dealers' system. They are the ones staying away,' one trader said. The clouds over the market have obscured continuing progress on other fronts. Last month, the government announced the abolition of withholding tax on interbank deposits. Although the step has little direct effect on bonds, the move should create greater liquidity in the banking system in general and consequently increase domestic demand for government paper. The government has also stuck to its commitment, made last April, to repay billions of lire in withholding tax due to eligible foreign investors in Italian bonds. Repayments have been moving smoothly since starting last September. 'The finance ministry has shown that funds are available,' says Mr Hendrik van Riel, general manager of J. P. Morgan in Milan. However, dealers still complain that the system, which provides repayments within 60-90 days of applications being filed, is too cumbersome. Complex forms, which can only be compiled manually, make the procedure time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, important double taxation treaties with countries like France and Germany, which would simplify repayment procedures, have not been approved by the Italian parliament. Doubts also surround the plan, announced last year, to set up a futures and options market on government bonds. Under the scheme, the new market, which will not be a physical exchange but a computerised addition to the existing primary dealers' system, should be operating by the middle of this year. Some progress has been made. At a meeting last month in Rome, draft proposals were presented for a clearing and guarantee house - a pillar for the new market - and much of the legal framework has been defined. Clearing software is to be provided by ICCH, the London-based clearing organisation, while a Canadian group, STM, is to provide trading software. But even domestic dealers are sceptical that a system can be ready by mid-year. 'There are essential pieces still missing,' says one banker involved in the talks. 'With Italy's reputation, they can't afford to make mistakes,' notes another. 'It will have to be super-good from the start.'</p>

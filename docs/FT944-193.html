			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets The pattern of investment in the world's emerging markets throughout 1994 has been uneven, with many international fund managers turning cautious, writes John Pitt. This is reflected in the flow of funds, which has begun to slow down - from a peak of more than Dollars 205bn in 1993, direct and indirect investment in emerging markets this year is expected to be about Dollars 177bn. The recent trauma in Latin America has shown that even markets perceived as being on the threshold of maturity can conceal a sting in the tail. Turkey has remained one of the worst performing markets in 1994, although equities have clawed back some of their losses during the second half. Mr Tim Lee of GT Management notes that the current environment of negative real interest rates, easy liquidity and a currency still somewhat undervalued should provide a stable background. 'However, this bull market should not be expected to last much beyond the next six months,' says Mr Lee. 'The makings of the next crisis are already in place: inflation is on the verge of a sharp acceleration which will lead to much higher interest rates and a monetary squeeze.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Dollar terms                     No. of         Dec. 23       % Change     % Change Market              stocks            1994      over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America        (207)          582.94          -15.9        -10.4 Argentina             (24)          766.45           -9.4        -22.9 Brazil                (57)          377.66          -11.0        +62.3 Chile                 (25)          786.72           -1.6        +42.6 Colombia1             (11)          773.27           +2.8        +19.9 Mexico                (67)          622.90          -24.7        -38.1 Peru2                 (11)          179.78           -6.3        +48.7 Venezuela3            (12)          463.29           -1.6        -21.7 Asia                 (558)          249.42           +2.8        -14.3 China4                (18)           77.02           -3.0        -48.4 South Korea5         (156)          137.89           -1.0        +16.7 Philippines           (19)          300.45           +2.9        -11.8 Taiwan, China6        (90)          157.59           +1.0        +16.6 India7                (76)          123.41           -0.3         +5.9 Indonesia8            (38)          100.52           +3.8        -19.4 Malaysia             (104)          269.34           +4.3        -20.6 Pakistan9             (15)          354.09           -2.9         -8.7 Sri Lanka10            (5)          170.83           +1.4         -3.6 Thailand              (55)          386.32           +1.7        -19.1 Euro/Mid East        (125)          120.48           +0.2        -28.8 Greece                (25)          222.47           -0.1         -2.3 Hungary11              (5)          156.00           +1.6         -6.4 Jordan                (13)          151.90           -1.0         -8.2 Poland12              (12)          456.11           -2.0        -44.2 Portugal              (25)          120.42           -1.6         +5.8 Turkey13              (40)          127.44           +1.4        -40.1 Zimbabwe14             (5)          245.01           -0.2        +21.2 Composite            (890)          308.51           -6.6        -13.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Local currency terms                     No. of         Dec. 23       % Change     % Change Market              stocks            1994      over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America        (207) Argentina             (24)      470,077.20           -9.3        -23.0 Brazil                (57)   1,205,406,980          -10.4     +1,086.2 Chile                 (25)        1,274.65           -1.5        +33.7 Colombia1             (11)        1,131.25           +2.4        +22.0 Mexico                (67)        1,255.99           +1.7         -6.9 Peru2                 (11)          237.24           -0.7        +49.2 Venezuela3            (12)        1,809.16           -1.7        +27.3 Asia                 (558) China4                (18)           82.36           -3.3        -49.8 South Korea5         (156)          143.37           -1.3        +14.2 Philippines           (19)          350.53           +3.2        -21.1 Taiwan, China6        (90)          156.22           +0.9        +16.8 India7                (76)          137.61           -0.2         +6.8 Indonesia8            (38)          119.57           +3.9        -16.0 Malaysia             (104)          245.73           +4.3        -24.4 Pakistan9             (15)          494.14           -2.9         -6.4 Sri Lanka10            (5)          184.10           +1.6         -3.6 Thailand              (55)          385.33           +1.8        -20.3 Euro/Mid East        (125) Greece                (25)          367.47           +0.4         -4.4 Hungary11              (5)          214.62           +2.9         +6.3 Jordan                (13)          225.13           -0.8         -6.0 Poland12              (12)          699.18           -1.9        -36.7 Portugal              (25)          134.16           -1.1         -2.9 Turkey13              (40)        2,276.19           +1.5        +56.5 Zimbabwe14             (5)          302.57           -0.1        +41.6 Composite            (890)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

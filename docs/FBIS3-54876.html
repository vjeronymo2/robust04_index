The  residents of the north have been waiting a long time for this  decision and regard it as equitable compensation for the  discomfort they experience living in inclement climatic  conditions.    Now, in keeping with the edict, the residents of Karelia  have  been given the right to draw their pensions five years earlier  than before. Apart from this, the northern allowances, payable  over and above the local wages, have been considerably increased.    However, residents in some Karelian villages are still  dissatisfied with what they see as this kind of levelling-down.  In keeping with the presidential edict, the republic has been  divided into two zones with slightly differing benefits. It  transpires that Kostomuksha, in the north of this lakeland area,  is on a par with the southern Sortavala, where the climate is  much milder.    In their appeal to the Karelian Supreme Soviet deputies,  Kostomuksha inhabitants demand that this inequality in benefits  be removed.</p>

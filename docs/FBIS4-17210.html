			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Svetlana Reyter report: "CIA Director Report. Russian </F> Crime Assumes International Scale"]    [Excerpts] "The increasing number of Russian criminal  groups is becoming a global criminal problem that undermines  President Boris Yeltsin's reform program, whereas a growth in  the Russian drugs mafia is becoming a serious international  threat," CIA Director James Woolsey said 20 April. [passage  omitted]    Nikolay Osipov, deputy chief of the Russian Internal Affairs  Ministry's administration for the struggle against illicit drug  trafficking, has told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that  his agency does not fall under the CIA's jurisdiction, so the  CIA chief has no right to set any requirements for it. He  disagreed with a passage of James Woolsey's statement about the  Russian drug mafia's assisting Colombian and Italian groups.  When asked about the quality of his administration's work, Mr.  Osipov declined to respond.    Officials at the Russian Foreign Ministry's Press and  Information Department told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent  that they do not see James Woolsey's report as intervention in  Russian internal policy. In the view of department staffers,  all that was said in the report about corruption among  government employees was the author's insinuations, because he  "has not caught anyone from the Russian government red-handed,  nor does he accuse anyone specifically."    Yuriy Kobaladze, chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence  Service [FIS] press bureau, sees the CIA chief's report as very  competent and approves of his stance on the Russian internal  situation. In Mr. Kobaladze's opinion, the facts used in James  Woolsey's report largely coincide with what has been reported in  open documents drawn up by the Russian authorities, which have  been fairly widely publicized. When asked by your correspondent  whether the FIS considers this report as improper with regard to  the Russian Government, Mr. Kobaladze responded that "the FIS  also affords itself to assess actions by the U.S. Government.  James Woolsey's statement should be seen only as an attempt to  help the Russian Government, not to accuse it."</p>

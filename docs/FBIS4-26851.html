			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Tien Ni (3944 1200) from Jilin: "Due </F> to International Sanctions on DPRK and Economic Difficulties in  Russia, Border Trade Between China, DPRK, and Russia Drops By a  Large Margin"]    [Text] According to an internal CPC document, North Korea  is facing possible sanctions from the international community  due to the nuclear inspection issue and the country is now short  of resources. As a result, Sino-Korean border trade in the  first five months of this year decreased sharply. Informed  people have said that the decline is unprecedented and the  margin of the decline was as big as 72.4 percent. This meant  that the volume of border trade between China and North Korea  dropped to almost one-quarter of the previous level.    The CPC authorities are afraid that North Korea's failure to  endure the economic pressure will eventually lead to instability  in the Sino-Korean border area. Thus, they are trying to  maintain the stability in the border area and have promised to  give limited material assistance.    According to information from the Jilin border area, the  Chinese side was not happy with North Korea's behavior but China  also feared that North Korea, which is adjacent to China, would  behave unscrupulously when the situation becomes critical and  this would in turn affect China's stability. So, China only  gave political support to North Korea.    Jin Zongzhu, former mayor of Tumen City, an open border town  in Jilin and current director of the Economic and Trade  Commission of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, said  that being affected and constrained by various internal and  external factors, North Korea sharply decreased its border trade  with Yanbian Prefecture in the first five months of this year.  The volume of two-way trade amounted to only $80.44 million, a  mere 15.5 percent of the yearly target and down by 46.1 percent  from that in the same period of last year. In particular, the  exports from the Chinese side amounted to only $22.59 million,  only 8.7 percent of the yearly target and down by 72.4 percent  from that in the same period of last year. This marked the  largest margin of decline in the history of Sino-Korean border  trade.    The possible sanctions imposed by the international  community  on North Korea constitute one of the major reasons for the  decline in Sino-Korean border trade. At present, North Korea,  being the main trade partner for Yanbian Prefecture, is  seriously short of energy resources and is undergoing a serious  economic landslide while facing the possibility of sanctions  imposed by the Western countries and crop failures. As a  result, its export commodities continued to decrease and it  could take fewer and fewer materials in conducting border trade  with China. At the same time, the rate of trade contract  fulfillment also dropped to an ever lower level. On the other  hand, Sino-Russian border trade is also undergoing a sharp  decline. This is because the Russian economy has been bogged  down in a predicament for the last few years, plus such problems  as the unstable political situation, changeable policies, poor  trade credit, and rising protectionism in the field of foreign  trade.    The dull situation in the Sino-Russian border trade in the  recent period is reflected in the following figures: In the  first quarter of this year, the volume of imports made by  Heilongjiang Province amounted to only $210 million, down by  52.4 percent from that in the same period of last year, and the  proportion of imports in the gross volume of imports and exports  was down by 27 percentage points. At the same time, the volume  of imports and exports in border trade in the first five months  of this year decreased by 6 percent.    Businessmen engaged in Sino-Russian border trade said that a  major reason for the decline in Sino-Russian border trade was  the fact that the Russian side tightened up the visa control  over people entering its territory and this constrained the  travel of the people engaged in border trade. In addition, the  Russian side also restricted the exportation of raw materials,  increased prices and tariff controls, and tightened up  supervision over imported goods. After China merged the two  foreign exchange rates systems and began to levy value-added  taxes, some Chinese enterprises engaged in border trade recorded  poorer profits in their business and this lowered the import  demand on the Chinese side and also affected the export business.    Moreover, some market factors also constrained the further  development of Sino-Russian border trade. As Japan and the DPRK  increased their competitive power on the Russian market, the  share of the Chinese products in Russia's Far East market began  to shrink and the market for Chinese goods became saturated.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 18 (CTK) -- Chairman of the  ultra-nationalist Russian Liberal Democrats Vladmir Zhirinovskiy  has decided to indefinitely postpone his Prague visit,  representatives of the party told the Moscow branch of CTK today.    The same sources said it was "99.99 percent sure" that  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would not come to Prague this Sunday.    Grigoriy Serebrennikov said it was "very unlikely" that the  visit would take place this month. Asked what the missing  hundredth of a percent could represent, Serebrennikov replied  "Nothing, really."    He said that Zhirinovskiy was concentrating at present on  internal party problems and that on Sunday [20 March] and Monday  he had engagements in Moscow. "He must have made a mistake,"  Serebrennikov said of Zhirinovskiy's announcement on March 14  that he would arrive in the Czech Republic for a two-day visit  on March 20.    The postponement of Zhirinovskiy's visit to the Czech  Republic at the invitation of the far-right Assembly for the  Republic- Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) was announced  after a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party discussed  the issue with a representative of the Czech Embassy in Moscow.    Unofficial sources say the Liberal Democrats were warned  that  their leader's visit to Prague was considered by the Czech  Government to be "extremely inappropriate," and that it intended  to use the possibilities offered by Czech law. Zhirinovskiy's  circles apparently took this warning as a signal that the same  thing might happen in the Czech Republic as happened in  Slovenia, where on March 6 Zhirinovskiy got only as far as  transit at Ljubljana airport and was forced to return to Moscow  a day later.    Officially, however, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic  Party are not admitting the possibility that the postponement of  the visit to Prague could be connected with the wave of  disapproving reactions which the announcement of his visit  provoked in the Czech Republic.    The journeys abroad of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy since last  December's Russian elections have been accompanied by a series  of scandals. He was expelled from Bulgaria, Romania announced  him an undesirable person and banned his entrance into the  country, Germany refused to give him an entrance visa and  Austria, France and Spain proceeded similarly.    Zhirinovskiy does not need a visa to visit the Czech  Republic, but only a diplomatic passport, to which as a deputy  he has a right.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK Company News: TSB the first major to pull the plug - Problems in the centralised mortgage market THE NEWS that Mortgage Express, the centralised mortgage lending arm of the TSB Group, is to withdraw from the market, is likely to be greeted with a stoical lack of surprise among other such lenders. So far no other large centralised lender has closed its doors, but it is no secret that many have been facing very hard times over the past two years. One of the largest lenders, CIBC Mortgages, set up by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second biggest bank with a Pounds 2bn UK mortgage book, has been on the market for the past year without finding a buyer. Other mortgage companies privately admit that they have sustained their profitability only by pricing their mortgages at levels above the market. That encouraged their customers to migrate to cheaper lenders, usually building societies, and pay hefty early redemption penalties of three months interest to do so. Many, though far from all, of the foreign banks and life assurance groups who flocked to the UK mortgage market during the 1980s would now like to be given the chance to withdraw from it quietly. 'About two dozen mortgage books, some of them very small, have been on the market since last summer,' says one mortgage industry analyst. These are forced sales by disappointed new entrants to the market, hoping to cut their losses. They are quite different from well-publicised sales of mortgage books a few years earlier by US lenders under pressure at home, such as the 1986 sale of Bank of America's book to Bank of Ireland or the 1988 sale of Chemical Bank's UK book to BNP. Few lenders publicly admit their decision to sell their books. Still less do they discuss the reasons which make them want to leave the market. 'Many of the mortgage books I have been offered in the last few months are riddled with doubtful quality lending. As a result, some are offered on terms which virtually amount to paying a buyer to take them off the hands of the original lender. Even so, few of them seem to be finding a buyer. Their owners may wish to exit from the market but they can't,' says one mortgage company. Those centralised lenders who do see a long term future in the UK market, such as Capital Home Loans, a joint venture between Societe Generale and Credit Fonciere of France, favour a low profile approach and cautious balance sheet growth for the foreseeable future. By contrast Mortgage Express was a high profile lender during the height of the housing finance boom. 'It grew very fast,' admitted Mr Hamish Paton, TSB managing director for banking services, when announcing its closure last week. At the time Mortgage Express was regarded as one of TSB's strongest performing subsidiaries: one of the most dynamic of the new breed of UK mortgage lenders who expanded rapidly at the expense of the traditional providers of housing finance, the building societies. The thinking behind these new lenders was simple. They would tap the commercial money markets for funds, and avoid high overheads, selling their mortgages through panels of insurance companies rather than through branches and in doing so undercut the building societies. The centralised lenders also attracted customers by offering specialised mortgages tailored to the individual needs, previously unknown in the UK and designed to help buyers scramble up the property ladder. While interest rates were low, this strategy worked well. In the second half of 1987, they appeared to be achieving their goals in spectacular fashion. The building societies' share of the mortgage market was temporarily driven to below 50 per cent, while the new lenders claimed a market share of more than a quarter. Previously unknown names like National Home Loans, The Mortgage Corporation, and Household Mortgage Corporation, rapidly grew books comparable to those of large building societies. If Mortgage Express had been a building society, it would have ranked eleventh by the size of its book after only three years of existence. When interest rates moved back above 12 per cent in August 1988, the advantage returned to the building societies with their ability to fund their lending more cheaply from savings. Halifax, the largest society whose rate is still generally followed by others, kept its rates as low as possible in a deliberate squeeze on the centralised lenders. The societies also quickly learned how to copy the new wave mortgages of the centralised lenders and offer their customers a variety of fixed rate, low start, or deferred interest mortgage products, in place of a single standard mortgage. Despite this, some centralised lenders fought hard in a hostile market. National Home Loans last year reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.2m, down on Pounds 33.5m in 1989. Other centralised lenders were hit by arrears and repossessions as loans made at the height of the mortgage market came unstuck. Mortgage Express was forced to make provisions of Pounds 8m last against mortgage arrears. At the same time, it was unable to keep its costs down, a surprising failure for an organisation without a branch network, and its computer systems were regarded within the group as inefficient. When Mortgage Express lost two of its best executives, Mr Bob Green and Mr Peter Sewell, to a new rival set up by a German bank, its decline seemed to accelerate. As Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB's new chairman, and Mr Don McCrickard, its chief executive, imposed a more coherent structure on the group, Mortgage Express looked increasingly out of place. When most of TSB's six mortgage arms were united as TSB Mortgages last summer, Mortgage Express was left on the sidelines. Its demise, nonetheless, marks the end of an era in its industry. Unless the housing market makes a strong recovery this year, it may not be the only large centralised lender to fall victim to the recession.</p>

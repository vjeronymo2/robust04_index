			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by A. Aleksandrov: "Russia Is Again Being Taught </F> How To Live"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has made  a statement in Congress which as so far failed to attract the  attention in our country which it undoubtedly deserves.    The statement is about Russia and its relations with the  countries of nearby foreign parts. Acknowledging that the  concern expressed by Moscow over the position of the 25 million  Russian-speaking citizens living outside Russia in the countries  of the former Union should not be considered "unnatural," the  secretary of state nonetheless made it extremely clear that  concern is one thing but attempts to resolve effectively the  many problems which the Russian-speaking population are  encountering in the Baltic states, for instance, is something  quite different. These attempts, it emerges from Christopher's  statements, cannot be made except with the consent and even the  authorization of international institutes and forums and best of  all with the agreement of the United States itself.    There is no denying that what Moscow undertakes should, as  Christopher notes, accord with the letter and spirit of  international laws. But another of the secretary of state's  important premises cannot fail to give rise to dispute and keen  doubt: Even in those situations where a request is made to  Moscow by those countries of the former Union "where Russian  troops are deployed and the request is for help in safeguarding  and preserving peace, Russia cannot respond unilateral to such  requests but only in some kind of cooperation with the United  Nations or, for instance, the CSCE," Christopher stated.  Russians, the chief U.S. diplomat repeated, have the right to  appeal to adjacent states "to be concerned for the position of  Russian-speaking citizens and to display generosity with regard  to them but the United States will resolutely oppose Moscow's  adoption of any powerful steps in this direction."    A detail of some importance: Christopher made his statement  in response to President Yeltsin's recent speech to Russian  parliament. The speech spoke clearly enough of Russia's right  to involve itself actively in the development of the situation  in the former Union with a view to ensuring stability and the  protection of Russians. The secretary of state commented with  some scorn on these passages in the Russian president's speech,  describing them as something aimed primarily at "a domestic  audience."    This speech, Christopher reported, is still being studied in  Washington but Washington is prepared to issue a warning right  now to Moscow on how it should behave. In the most unequivocal  terms.    In my view in the warnings which are now being heard from  Washington it is easy to discern an attempt by the Clinton  administration to preserve the status to which Russia has been  reduced in recent years, particularly by virtue of the chaos,  lack of thought, and often simply shortsightedness of our  diplomats' actions. The status which Washington automatically  guarantees Washington its own absolute superpowerdom on the  world arena probably suits the United States completely. It can  hardly suit Russia, nor should it.    Everything is the way it was before. Is that not so?    It seems to me that Foreign Minister Kozyrev should have a  serious talk about this with Christopher when they meet 14 March  in Vladivostok, where the secretary of state is going as part of  his Far East tour.</p>

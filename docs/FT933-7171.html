			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / French Privatisation: France gets its cake, and eats it - Limiting and attracting foreign investment MRS Pamela Harriman, the new US ambassador to France, is an unashamed Francophile, but last month she aired a rare grievance against the French government by complaining about the restrictions on foreign investment in its privatisation programme. The object of Mrs Harriman's criticism was the amendment to the government's privatisation bill to limit investors outside the European Community to a maximum of 20 per cent of the shares in privatised companies. The US lobby argued that the 20 per cent rule was a protectionist measure reminiscent of the traditional constraints on foreign investors in the French financial markets. The amendment survived and is now enshrined in the legislation which will shape the new privatisation programme. The 20 per cent rule is really an irrelevance, given that it only applies at the time of the original issue and non-EC investors will then be free to buy shares on the open market. However, the incident serves as an apt illustration of France's ambivalent attitude to privatisation. The French are undoubtedly keen to attract investment from foreigners and to enhance Paris's status as an international financial centre. Yet they are still anxious to protect privatised companies from the rigours of life in the private sector, particularly from the threat of 'foreign predators', whether they are from inside or outside the Community. One of the main achievements of the last centre-right government's 1986-1987 privatisation drive was its success at attracting foreign investment. Until then it had been difficult for foreign investors to buy shares in France given that so many large companies were privately-owned or state-controlled. The privatisations gave investors away into the Paris market at a time when the UK pension funds were pursuing an aggressive policy of international investment. The proportion of French shares in foreign hands has since increased steadily, from 21 per cent to 28 per cent in the past two years alone, according to the Bank of France. At first glance it looks as though it might be more difficult for the French to attract foreign investment in the new round of privatisations. First, the financial prospects for French companies are more precarious than they were in the buoyant mid-1980s. At the same time, the privatisation market is more competitive, with an estimated Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) of state shares currently scheduled to come on to the market in Europe. Second, whereas foreign investors needed to build up French portfolios in the mid-1980s, they now have substantial French holdings. Warburg Securities estimates that the Paris Bourse represents 23 per cent of the value of all continental Europe equities, but 26 per cent of the average continental portfolio. However, most brokers and bankers are confident that foreign investors will be willing to increase their commitment to France in this autumn's sales. 'French stocks are not cheap at the moment and many European investors, particularly in the UK, are already over-weight in France, but there is still strong interest in many of the companies scheduled for sale,' said Mr David Harrington, equity strategist at James Capel in Paris. Interest from the US is also likely to be high given that many institutions are in the throes of 'internationalising' their portfolios, just as their UK counterparts did during the last privatisation drive. There are even hopes of a strong response from Japan. 'Japanese investors are interested in France, interested in privatisation and, at this time in the cycle, it is a good time to buy,' said Mr Alain Cellier, chief executive of Nomura in France. 'There is only one caveat - the strength of the yen.' The recent fall of the franc and the rise of the Paris stock market - the CAC 40 Index ended last week at a record 2,149.83 - should make French equities seem even more appealing. It might also lessen the risk of foreign investors switching cash from existing French holdings into privatisation stocks by persuading them to bring new money into France. However, this influx of foreign funds does not seem likely to trigger the tidal wave of takeover bids that the traditionalists in French finance fear. The 20 per cent rule is probably the least effective of the government's defensive ploys. The others include plans to assemble networks of sympathetic noyaux durs, 'hard core' investors, to support the newly-privatised companies and to introduce 'golden shares' to some stocks, thereby enabling the state to block takeovers indefinitely. The experience of the last batch of French privatisations suggests that such measures may not be necessary. The only one of the mid-1980s privatisations to have come under attack was the bank Societe Generale, in an unsuccessful raid mounted in 1988 by Mr Georges Pebereau, the French financier.</p>

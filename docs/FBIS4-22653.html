			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Ivan Plyushch: 'He Who Has </F> the Power Has the Key to Paradise'--Elections Continue"]    [Text] By decision of district electoral commissions,  repeat elections of Ukrainian people's deputies were held in 33  districts of eight oblasts in Ukraine. According to Central  Electoral Commission [CEC] data, on 3 April elections took place  in 30 districts, with a high voter turnout. CEC Chairman Ivan  Yemets, in particular, reported that 81 percent of voters cast  their ballots in Gusyatinskiy District in Ternopol Oblast; 78  percent--in Izoslavskiy District in Khmelnitsk Oblast; and so  on. According to preliminary data, elected on 3 April were:  scientist Vasiliy Kostitskiy, a national-democrat close to Rukh,  in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast; the leader of Ukrainian socialists,  Aleksandr Moroz (Kiev Oblast); and Vladimir Bortnik, a  representative of the so-called "party of power" and head of the  Ukragrotekhservis concern.    Repeat elections confirmed the current disposition of  political forces in Ukraine and voters' preferences for some or  other political forces. The second round also confirmed the  personal confrontation between the leaders of two branches of  power--parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch and President Leonid  Kravchuk--which has been increasingly gaining momentum lately.  The latter and his team justly saw in the fact of parliamentary  elections and the election of a new Supreme Council a threat to  the very existence of strong, practically unlimited presidential  power in Ukraine. As is known, the first thing the new  parliament is expected to do, in the words of current Speaker  Ivan Plyushch, is adopt a law on the president of Ukraine's new  powers. It is envisaged that he will be only a head of state  with purely representative functions, and therefore moving  presidential elections from 26 June of this year to a later  date--which Leonid Kravchuk and his entourage insist on--is out  of the question.    Some political forces--both old and new--also speak for a  variety of reasons against strong presidential authority. In  particular, the communists and socialists declared through their  leaders that they see abolishing the institution of the  presidency in Ukraine as the final goal of their parliamentary  activities. Their reckoning is simple: Behind the backs of the  resurrected soviets one can also restore a firm vertical line of  party-communist omnipotence. Many regional economic managers,  too, would like to see a weaker presidential authority,  justifiably seeing in it the strengthening of the functions of  the Kiev center taking the place of the Moscow one. The only  forces that unconditionally support strong presidential  authority are those that associate with it the conduct of a  reformist course. The presidential team apparently took this  circumstance into consideration only lately, and for this reason  made several steps in the direction of privatization. In  particular, on 1 April the parliament's newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY  published a list of 150 enterprises whose stock Ukrainian  citizens can buy with their privatization certificates, as well  as procedures for conducting this operation and samples of the  documentation needed. The publication of these documents looks  more like an April's Fool joke than real help in privatization  or its actual implementation, since Ukraine still lacks a  network of investment funds, brokerage offices, and other  institutions servicing the process of denationalization; the  road of the privatization certificate to the object of  privatization, on the other hand, is difficult and convoluted  because of various paperwork formalities.    Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch permitted himself a sharp  personal attack against Leonid Kravchuk at an election precinct  during the voting on 27 March, and is still in a fighting mood.  Over the past week the mass media showed several times a  recorded interview in which Ivan Plyushch urged Ukrainian  citizens to participate in the second round of elections. He  also urged the citizens to decide were they stand politically  without squandering more money on the conduct of repeat  elections. And on 3 April on Ukrainian television Plyushch said:  "You have to show up and vote--this is best in every respect. We  have neither the money for repeat elections, nor the need, nor  the time to hold them. I appeal to all people of Ukraine; I  plead; I bow deep to them: Come, cast a repeat vote, elect  deputies. Whom you elect is your business. I want to say once  again: He who has the power has the key to paradise. Now the  people have the power. Whom you will pass this power to will be  determined in the repeat elections."</p>

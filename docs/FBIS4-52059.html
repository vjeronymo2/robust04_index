			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-san: "Smear Propaganda That Reverses </F> Black and White"]    [Text] The South Korean puppets' smear propaganda against  us is reaching extremes. According to a broadcast report from  Seoul on 4 May, Kim Yong-sam the traitor threw another party at  Nokchiwon garden in Chongwadae and talked nonsense about us.    Sitting with fellows from the Advisory Council for  Democratic  and Peaceful Unification, he said that our nuclear development  is targeted at South Korea and that the North is even violating  the armistice agreement. This is like a thief turning on the  master with a club.    He said that after announcing the withdrawal from the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty last year, we have accelerated nuclear  development during the past year while insisting on the frame of  confrontation. He even repeated that nuclear development of the  North should be blocked in any event. Traitor Kim Yong-sam said  some useless things to threaten someone by mentioning words,  such as "destruction."    Such a reverse propaganda of the national traitor, war  maniac, and fascist devilish homicide Kim Yong-sam is rude  remarks that can only be made by South Korean puppets who are  experienced in reversing black and white, and a cunning trick to  divert South Korean people's attention elsewhere from their  internal crisis.    First of all, regarding our so-called nuclear development  raved by traitor Kim Yong-sam, those remarks resulted from the  fear that their nuclear development maneuvers might be  discovered by the world. In fact, the ones who are developing  nuclear weapons are not us but the South Korean puppets  themselves.    South Korea's heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the  multipurpose research reactor in Taedok Complex are military  nuclear reactors built under the objective to develop nuclear  weapons. It is not a secret that plutonium and highly enriched  uranium are produced here. The whole world knows that the  heavy-water reactor in Wolsong alone has produced enough spent  fuel containing plutonium to produce more than 370 nuclear bombs.    As exposed by the Central Committee of the South Korean  National Democratic Front, the South Korean puppets are  accelerating the development of positive reactors [silchungno],  which is the third phase of the development of a fast breeder  reactor.    Even while frantically accelerating nuclear development,  they said we were developing nuclear weapons to use against  them. This is none other than a scheme to accelerate their  efforts to develop and arm themselves with nuclear weapons by  using us as a pretext.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam also said that we were violating the  armistice agreement. This is also ridiculous.    The Korean armistice agreement bans the introduction of  operational materials into Korea. Nevertheless, the United  States, a party to the armistice agreement, has continuously  brought numerous operational materials and military personnel  into South Korea from 1954, when the agreement was signed [as  heard], up until today. Still, it had brought them secretly.  However, it is now openly bringing in operational materials and  military personnel in broad daylight. The Apache attack  helicopters and Patriot missiles were recently deployed in this  fashion. Needless to day, all of these are violations of the  Korean armistice agreement.    When traitor Kim Yong-sam took issue regarding the armistice  agreement, he should have taken issue with these violations  first.    Regarding the establishment of a new peace-guaranteeing  system on the Korean peninsula, which we proposed in the Foreign  Ministry's statement, traitor Kim Yong-sam, poking his nose into  this matter, is trying to do something about it. This is a very  foolish act.    How can a colonial puppet who is neither a signatory to the  Korean armistice agreement, nor one who has the prerogative of  supreme command over the armed forces, can sit face to face with  us and discuss the issue of replacing the armistice agreement  with a peace agreement? This is nonsense.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam again made the meaningless remarks this  time that North Korea was developing nuclear weapons and  violated the armistice agreement. As I have stated, this is a  scheme to divert the South Korean people's attention elsewhere  because of an internal crisis.    The South Korean puppets are launching a smear campaign  while  saying that someone is developing nuclear weapons and violating  the armistice agreement. Instead of doing so, they had better  mind their own business. The smear campaign which reverses  facts can never produce good results.    Only destruction awaits the Kim Yong-sam ring, which  aggravates North-South relations, strains tension on the Korean  peninsula, and leads the country to ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring  is walking down a path of self-destruction.</p>

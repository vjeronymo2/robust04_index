Kuchma told journalists after the meeting that Kebich showed  full understanding of the need to establish direct horizontal  ties between Belarusian and Ukrainian manufacturers.    "We should think about tomorrow for ourselves, using our own  experience," Kuchma said. He stressed the importance of  Belarus' integrating role in the restoration of economic  relations between former Soviet republics and supported Kebich's  moves aimed at establishing an economic union with Russia.    During his meeting with Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, first deputy  chairman of the Belarusian parliament, Kuchma said that the  Belarusian model of integration of the monetary systems of  Russia and Belarus is more preferable than others. He supported  the Belarusian Government's position calling for a gradual,  evolutionary development of the economy and rejecting shock  therapy methods.    Kuznetsov and Kuchma called for strengthening both bilateral  inter-state and direct ties between enterprises within the  framework of the CIS economic union.    Kuznetsov noted that 1994 will be a year of big political  activity for Belarus. The republic will have to determine the  future state system, adopt a new constitution and a law on  elections. However, no economic or political upheavals should  be allowed to weaken friendship between the Slav nations and  their good neighbourly and respective relations between each  other.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: International banks pushed to diversify The slackness of international bank credit over the last three years has prompted international banks to diversify their sources of revenue through the underwriting and trading of securities, fund management and the offering of new services involving derivative products, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) says in its latest report* on the sector. It adds that the trend has been reinforced in recent periods by the volatility of interest and exchange rates which has led to greater demand from the non-bank sector for hedging and investment services. Although there was a strong recovery in reporting banks' gross international claims, from a Dollars 106bn fall in the second quarter last year to a Dollars 183bn rise in the third quarter, new credit totalled a mere Dollars 5bn in the third quarter, down from Dollars 40bn the previous quarter. The BIS said this reflected weak demand for funds in the reporting area and an absolute contraction in banks' claims on all other groups of countries, except Asia. The continuing weakness of loan demand from high-quality borrowers also led to a reduction in new international syndicated credit facilities, to Dollars 49.9bn in the fourth quarter from Dollars 54.1bn in the third, and accentuated the downward pressure on lending margins. 'While this does not appear to have been reflected so far in reduced spreads for lower-quality names, there was reportedly some evidence of banks' increasing willingness to lend to such customers,' the BIS said in the report. The report highlighted the rising popularity of Euro-MTN programmes which accounted for 31 per cent of all net issues of Euro-notes and international bonds in the fourth quarter. It added that net new issuance reached a near-record level in the Euro-note market and a peak in the international bond market, at Dollars 24.8bn and Dollars 56.7bn respectively. *International Banking and Financial Market Developments, Bank for International Settlements, Monetary and Economic Department, Basle, February 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed a number of  decrees to appoint the key figures of his government. He  appointed Major General Vladimir Lepikhov, the former chief of  the staff of an army group stationed in the Crimea, as the  chairman of the Crimean security service. The former head of  the security service, Ivan Kolomytsev, was relieved of his  duties.    Meshkov also replaced former Interior Ministry Alexander  Plyuta with Major General Valery Kuznetsov, the former commander  of an army group stationed on the peninsula.

In addition, Meshkov signed a decree to appoint an economist  from Moscow, Andrey Chernyavskiy, as the acting economics  minister. Lyudmila Zaitseva, another member of Yevgeny Saburov's  team, was appointed as the acting finance minister.    The former deputy speaker of the Crimean parliament,  Anatoliy  Franchuk, was appointed the acting minister for management of  state-owned enterprises. He is the only representative of the  former Crimean government.    All the candidatures are subject to approval by the first  session of the new Crimean Supreme Soviet.    A meeting of the parliamentary presidium in Simferopol  Tuesday decided to launch the first session of the Crimean  Supreme Soviet on 10 May 1994.</p>

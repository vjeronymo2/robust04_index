			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Vickers Those investors who coughed up Pounds 60m for Vickers' rights issue last year have found their virtue rewarded. The loss of blood at Rolls-Royce Motors, which had threatened the company, has been stemmed. Working capital and cashflow have been substantially improved, albeit with the assistance of advance payments from the Ministry of Defence. Cosworth engines had a good year in both Formula One and IndyCar motor sport. The dividend is back on an upward track. Now shareholders must weigh how much of Vickers' future prospects are already discounted by the share price. Another Challenger 2 tank order may well be forthcoming from the MoD, but the timing of deliveries will only maintain the current level of production. Further overseas orders, which would provide a boost, are more speculative. Cosworth may well continue to prosper in the precarious world of racing, but the collapsing market for Ford Cosworth road cars is unlikely to recover in the foreseeable future. While Rolls-Royce Motors has stabilised, overall demand is not rising yet. Indeed, in the US there is little sign of renewed interest, despite the strong economic growth. Fears that the market has shrunk for good are probably overdone, but the concern may hold the share price back nevertheless. And however much the company argues that Rolls-Royce can progress through piecemeal joint ventures, a long-term strategic partner is needed to develop a new model. Rolls is still a one horse company and cannot afford to bet everything on changing models alone.</p>

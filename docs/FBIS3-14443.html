According to this agreement the daily production level of  the  12 member countries is 24.52 million barrels, which is really  the same as the present ceiling production level.    Thus oil experts believe the approved OPEC ceiling not only  fails to support the present low oil prices, it will aggravate  the process of their reduction.    It should be noted that the OPEC secretariat had earlier  warned that the failure of the member countries to reduce daily  oil production by about one million barrels would lead to  further price cuts.    But despite the interest of the Islamic Republic of Iran and  the majority of the members, obstructionism by the largest OPEC  producer forced the session to an unrealistic agreement which  was in turn accompanied by greater dissatisfaction of the OPEC  members.    Oil market fluctuation in the past six months -- which led  to  oil price reductions and a subsequent upset in the oil income of  the oil exporting countries -- forced the OPEC members to seek a  solution, through diplomacy and discussions with other non-OPEC  producers, to control production and strengthen oil prices.    And eight non-OPEC oil exporting countries said they were  prepared to reduce a maximum of 250,000 barrels from their daily  production.    Considering the surplus oil supply and in particular with  the  coming of spring and summer when demand generally decreases due  to warmer weather, the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed that  the present production ceiling should be reduced by six percent.    This would have strengthened the oil market and experts  believe oil prices would have increased by four dollars.    The OPEC general secretary and some other member countries  also thought reduction of production ceiling was a necessary  realistic measure and the only means of improving prices in the  present conditions.    However due to the opposition of Saudi Arabia, the  opportunity for success was lost and in the view of the Islamic  Republic of Iran and other OPEC members, the responsibility for  the process of oil price reduction lies with those who did not  wish for a reasonable OPEC understanding and agreement.    But our country, despite its dissatisfaction with the  continuation of the previous production ceiling for the next  nine months, will continue to respect OPEC regulations and will  adhere to the new agreement and calls on all other member  countries for commitment to the approved quotas and the need for  strong political will towards the improvement of the oil market.</p>

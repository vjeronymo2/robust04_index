			<p>BFN     [Text] This evening Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met with a  Yemeni delegation from Sanaa led by 'Ali Mansur Rashid, member  of the General Committee of the General People's Congress.  Rashid said that they discussed the developments in Yemen. He  praised the efforts being made by Egypt and President Husni  Mubarak to stop the bloodshed in Yemen and to reach a cease-fire.    On the failure of the UN envoy's mission, Rashid said that  the UN envoy had made good efforts and put forward certain  proposals. Rashid noted that had they been adopted by the United  Nations and the rest of the Arab countries, they would have  helped to stop the bloodshed in Yemen and bring about a  cease-fire. He said that he and the UN envoy discussed quick  ways to form a military committee, which previously supervised  the armed forces' movements. He said they also discussed  expanding the committee by adding certain Arab parties to it.    Rashid noted that the fighting in Yemen hinges on the  continuation of the rebellion against the constitutional  legitimacy, this group's submission to the legitimacy, and  ending the rebellion. He said: Despite this, we are ready for a  cease-fire and will contribute to forming a committee to monitor  it.    Responding to a question that unity cannot be imposed by  force, Rashid said that the unity was not imposed by force, but  was established peacefully and democratically, and two  referendums were held on the unity. He pointed out that what is  now taking place in Yemen is an attempt to impose secession by  force and we are defending and safeguarding this unity. He said  that he asked 'Amr Musa for Egypt to continue its important and  good role in limiting the Yemeni people's suffering and pain.</p>

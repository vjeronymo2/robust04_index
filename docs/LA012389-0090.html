			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PHONES PRO-LIFERS HE IS WITH THEM;  </P> <P> DENOUNCES ABORTION ON DEMAND AS AN 'AMERICAN TRAGEDY'  </P> <P> President Bush told tens of thousands of demonstrators today that abortion on  demand is an "American tragedy" and said he favors reversal of the landmark  Supreme Court decision legalizing it.  </P> <P> Speaking by telephone hookup to activists gathered near the White House on the  16th anniversary of the historic Roe vs. Wade decision, Bush said he believes  that the ruling "was wrong and should be overturned."  </P> <P> The new President made the call shortly after Vice President Dan Quayle also  assured anti-abortion leaders that the new Administration supports their cause.  </P> <P> "I wanted to share with you my deep personal concern about our American tragedy  -- abortion on demand," Bush said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Way of Life'  </P> <P> "I think America needs a human life amendment, and I think when it comes to  abortion, there's a better way -- the way of adoption, the way of life," he  said, adding:  </P> <P> "I'm confident that more and more Americans every year -- every day -- are  hearing your message and taking it to heart. I promise you that the President  hears you now and stands with you in a cause that must be won. God bless you  all and God bless life."  </P> <P> Talking to anti-abortion leaders earlier, Quayle said, "I have been involved  with a lot of people in my state (Indiana) on this issue. I couldn't think of a  more appropriate group to be meeting with."  </P> <P> White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu accompanied Quayle to the meeting,  and the vice president said Sununu was there because he wanted to hear the  visitors' views.  </P> <P> When a reporter asked whether the Bush Administration could succeed in getting  the Roe vs. Wade decision reversed, Quayle replied, "Time will tell. We have  the same commitment." He said it is important that someone stand up and speak  for "those people who are not yet born."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missouri Case  </P> <P> The noontime rally and a march to Capitol Hill culminated a series of  nationwide protests against the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that  legalized abortion.  </P> <P> The debate has taken on added intensity this year, with a reconstituted Supreme  Court considering a Missouri case with the potential to result in significant  changes in the legal doctrine governing abortion.  </P> <P> In downtown Pittsburgh, about 1,200 pro-choice marchers joined a "March For  Women's Lives." They were met at the Allegheny County morgue by about 40  anti-abortion marchers.  </P> <P> The pro-choice march was preceded by a rally at which Eleanor Smeal, a former  National Organization for Women president, said, "Some people want to save  their souls by spilling the blood of innocent women. That isn't Christianity.  It's hypocrisy. The church has no business dictating the policies of this  country."  </P> <P> Earlier today, Bush said, "Let's go to work," as he presided at a brief  ceremony in the East Room at which 65 White House staff members were sworn in  by Quayle. Bush declared that the lights in his White House will "burn brightly  well after dark," and he instructed his senior staff to put in long hours. He  also told them to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest.  </P> <P> Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would soon set up a  commission to propose ways of strengthening ethics laws governing both  Administration officials and members of Congress.  </P></p>

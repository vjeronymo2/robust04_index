			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Berlusconi seeks to control central bank appointments The Italian government has signalled its determination to control key appointments at the Bank of Italy, bringing into the open a long-simmering debate over the bank's independence. The government's position was made public after the central bank's higher council, the body formally responsible for making the top appointments, failed to reach agreement last Thursday on a successor to Mr Lamberto Dini, who stepped down as director-general in May to become treasury minister. The tough line adopted by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, risks another institutional confrontation similar to that which occurred last week over the right to hire and fire the board of the RAI, the state broadcasting corporation. Mr Berlusconi, owner of the main commercial television channels, achieved his objective at the RAI after a bruising battle with Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Until now the battle over the succession to Mr Dini in the number two position at the Bank of Italy has been fought behind closed doors. But on Friday the prime minister's office put out a statement asserting the government's right to control appointments to the central bank's four-person directorate. The statement said: 'The bank's autonomy cannot be confused with the power to make nominations for senior positions  - a power which in all industrialised countries (including those central banks regarded as having the maximum of autonomy like the German Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve) is vested in the executive.' According to a mix of law and tradition, after any directorate appointment is made by the 13-strong higher council  - composed of the bank's regional office chairmen  - it must be confirmed by the head of state in conjunction with the prime minister and the treasury minister. The government can thus claim to be acting within the margins of its authority. Although the Bank of Italy has declined to enter the controversy in public, its officials are concerned that the Dini succession will be equated with that of the RAI. In particular, Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the deputy director-general who is technically in line for the job, has been portrayed by both the populist Northern League and by the neo-fascist MSI as an unacceptable leftwing economist. Within the bank and among his European colleagues, he is regarded as one of the best technicians on monetary issues. The problem of the succession has been caused in part by the way in which Mr Dini was deliberately passed over for the governorship in May last year when Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi moved to become prime minister. The job went to Mr Antonio Fazio, the deputy director-general. Mr Dini and his supporters have made it known they do not wish to see Mr Padoa Schioppa as the number two and would prefer an outsider such as Mr Rainer Masera, a liberal economist and current head of IMI, the state-controlled finance group. The Bank of Italy is fiercely resisting the imposition of an outsider. The latest compromise suggested is that Mr Vincenzo Desario, the current second deputy director-general, assume the number two slot.</p>

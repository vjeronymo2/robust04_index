			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu has called for a shift from confrontational diplomacy  in dealing with North Korea in preparation for an era of  peaceful coexistence, noting the government has played a  zero-sum game in diplomacy toward North Korea and the  unification issue. There are many non-zero-sum games in the  North Korean nuclear issue and in inter-Korean relations, he  said. In a zero-sum game, a gain for one side entails a  corresponding loss for the other side.    Addressing the opening session of the annual meeting of  overseas mission chiefs on Wednesday, he said what the  government must first consider in dealing with the North Korean  nuclear issue is the need to prevent it from worsening  dramatically. In the short term, the government should aim at  guaranteeing the transparency of North Korea's nuclear program.    He also stressed the need for flexibility and patience in  dealing with North Korea: "Even if North Korea earned time by  use of delaying tactics (in its negotiations with the  International Atomic Energy Agency on international inspections  of its nuclear facilities), such time would not be of any help  to North Korea's nuclear development program."    Commenting on President Kim Yong-sam's internationalization  policy, Han said it is aimed at increasing the global  competitiveness of Korean products and enriching the people's  spiritual and material life, adding, "you overseas mission  chiefs should bear the brunt of this policy as the nation's  outposts."    Any stereotyped and predictable diplomacy should be  transformed into a pragmatic, forward-looking and flexible  diplomacy, he remarked.    Attending the opening session of the meeting, which lasts  until the weekend, were 49 mission chiefs stationed in Asia and  North and South America.    After the opening session, the mission chiefs discussed  measures to attain peaceful unification of Korea, increased  international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and  promotion of South Korea for membership in the United Nations  Security Council.    The prime minister later hosted a luncheon for the mission  chiefs at the Sejong Cultural Center, where he called on them to  do their best in tackling security and trade issues.</p>

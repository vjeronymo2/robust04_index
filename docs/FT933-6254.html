			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Not so friendly after all THE DECISION by the troubled Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire friendly society to impose a 12 per cent levy on its 67,000 policyholders for a compensation fund is unprecedented, says the Registry of Friendly Societies. In a letter to policyholders, dated August 18, L &amp; Y said it had reduced all unit prices on the society's benefit funds by 12 per cent on August 1 for a Pounds 10m compensation fund. It fears that a High Court ruling will oblige it to pay compensation to roughly three-quarters of its policyholders. Bernard White, treasurer, said that since the society is a mutual, members would be liable for compensation were the High Court to decide that the society had to pay. The irony is that policyholders are contributing towards a fund for their own compensation. The society went to court for directions on how to deal with a series of fundamental errors which came to light last year. More than half the policyholders at L &amp; Y - some 39,000 - have suffered as a result of a Pounds 4.3m property write-off on unauthorised investments in its Capital Secure fund. This was advertised as investing only in cash deposits and gilts - but it was found to have invested Pounds 6.8m in a hotel development near Rotherham which, after falls in the property market, was valued at Pounds 2.5m last year. It also invested in the society's present headquarters, Moorgate Hall, a Grade II listed building in Rotherham. The court is to determine the way in which the property losses should be treated and John Ramsden, L &amp; Y's chairman, said the advice he had received from his lawyers indicated that the society might be required to compensate policyholders. The other issue on which the court is to make a judgment is whether 7,000 policies which were funded by a lump sum are eligible for tax-exempt status. To qualify for tax exemption, the policy must be funded by regular premiums. Any lump sum payment is often used to buy an annuity but L &amp; Y had not arranged this. At the end of last year, L &amp; Y's actuary estimated that the society's contingent liabilities were Pounds 8.3m. White says the society is being prudent in setting up a Pounds 10m compensation fund, Pounds 6.3m of which is the estimated payment to those invested in the Capital Secure fund and Pounds 2m for the 7,000 policyholders who may find their policies do not qualify for tax exemption. Policyholders are angry, since they were not consulted over the decision. 'I'm faced with a fait accompli. Nobody consulted me,' said Andy Anderson, a member who lives in Morayshire, Scotland. He said his request for an extraordinary general meeting was turned down. The money is being held on deposit with the Royal Bank of Scotland, L &amp; Y's trustee, and the society says it will be returned to policyholders if the court does not require compensation to be paid.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Forecast cuts hit Barclays SWINGEING forecast cuts by two securities houses knocked Barclays as concern over the clearing bank's exposure to property debts at Heron Group and Olympia &amp; York continued. The shares lost 5 to 317p on turnover of 5.7m. County NatWest chopped its 1992 profits estimate from Pounds 650m to Pounds 475m and Mr John Aitken, County's banking analyst, sent out a very bearish note to clients headed: 'The nightmare continues'. In the note he suggests that a further round of forecast cuts is imminent. He added yesterday that Barclays' exposure to O &amp; Y's debt could be as high as Pounds 400m, far higher than most observers' estimates of around Pounds 250m. Also, Kleinwort Benson lowered its 1992 estimate by Pounds 150m to Pounds 540m, although the house sees the stock as a buy at these levels. Midland optimism Optimism over its proposed merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking helped Midland Bank to escape a general drubbing in the sector. The shares also gained from a press report suggesting that Lloyds Bank had been prepared to bid for Midland on a one-for-one share exchange basis when its own shares were above 400p. County NatWest reigned in its 1992 profits estimate for Midland by Pounds 38m to Pounds 222m, but the stock closed 7 up at 357p on heavy turnover of 7.3m shares. National Westminster Bank was initially firm after announcing that Mr Tom Frost, its chief executive, had resigned. Widely expected, the move reflects a link between NatWest's merchant banking arm County NatWest and the Blue Arrow affair. However, a positive response to the management change was offset by reaction to NatWest's bad debt exposure. This prompted profits forecast cuts by County and Kleinwort Benson. County lopped Pounds 200m off its 1992 figure to Pounds 300m. Kleinwort came down by Pounds 50m to Pounds 500m. The shares closed a penny lighter at 279p. Fresh Lonrho gloom Dark clouds continued to hang over Lonrho, the shares finishing a further 8 down at 79p, after touching 76p. Some 7.9m shares changed hands. The gloom surrounding yesterday's trading followed reports that Fidelity, of the US, the group's second largest investor, may be forced to sell its shareholding in Lonrho if the United Nations decides to impose sanctions against Libya. Fidelity now holds a 9.81 per cent stake in Lonrho. Last week Lonrho sold a third of its Metropole Hotel group to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company for Pounds 177.5m. Sentiment was further hurt by an announcement that the proposed sale, announced last month, of Lonrho's Scottish newspaper group to Trinity International Holdings for Pounds 45m is to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation. Eurotunnel tumbled on news that the company would have to pay an additional Pounds 50m per month to TML, the tunnel building consortium, following a decision by a disputes panel investigating a Pounds 1.3bn claim by TML. The shares, which opened 15 down following a report in Paris of the decision, retreated further to end a net 33 off at 405p. Turnover in London was reasonable at 1.1m shares, but heavy in Paris where some 3.5m shares changed hands. Inchcape moved ahead 13 to 428p after the company surprised the market with a 6.4 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 185.2m. Mr Robert Morton at BZW was among analysts to upgrade his profits forecast following the results. He lifted his current year prediction by Pounds 5m to Pounds 260m. Turnover reached 1.2m shares. Lucas Industries, which reported figures in line with expectations, receded 7 to 112p as dividend worries surfaced after the company said the second-half redundancy costs would at least equal those of the first half. In spite of cutting his full-year forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m, Mr John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney remains positive about the outlook for Lucas, 'particularly given the increased penetration in all European car markets'. GKN eased 2 to 343p in sympathy with Lucas. Smith New Court downgraded Cable and Wireless following an analysts' meeting on Friday at which the telecoms group discussed restructuring costs of Pounds 50m. The house is now looking for profits of Pounds 645m (down Pounds 50m) for this year and Pounds 750m (down Pounds 30m) for 1993. Smith believes that C and W's proposed rate of earnings growth of 10 to 15 per cent in 1993 will not be reached until 1994. The shares declined 6 to 523p. A perception that RTZ would be among the Footsie constituents liable to attract strong support in the event of a Labour victory in the general election, because of the mining group's big overseas earnings and assets, boosted the shares by 13 to 575p. MB-Caradon climbed 9 to 259p with 2m shares traded after well received end-of-year results. The company held its dividend and announced higher profits of Pounds 106.4m. Analyst Mr David Taylor of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew lifted his profits forecast for 1992 to Pounds 135m and reinforced his buy stance on the stock. Supermarket group Asda was the most active stock yesterday, on turnover of 23m shares, but there was little effect on the price, which ended a penny off at 32 1/2 p. An agency cross was reported to have been largely responsible for the volume. Stores, which have been on the slide during the three weeks since the UK Budget, showed a limited bounce. Disappointment at the Budget's lack of political impact, and the failure to cut interest rates, have depressed the shares of companies such as Kingfisher, which recently produced better than expected results. Shares in the Woolworth to B &amp; Q holding company have fallen about 50p since the Budget, but recovered 3 to 483p yesterday. The persistent market rumours concerning a possible bid by Airtours for Owners Abroad - complete with anonymous notes to newspapers and brokers - are under investigation by the Stock Exchange. Both companies deny the story. Meanwhile, Airtours eased a penny to 263p and Owners slipped 1 1/2 to 106p. A big agency cross in Rank Organisation - 1.5m shares at 645p - saw the stock appreciate 4 to 650p. Euro Disney continued to weaken after last week's bearish comments, losing 13 to 1510p.

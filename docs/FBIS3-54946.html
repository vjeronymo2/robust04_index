			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Knyazkov report followed by editorial afterword: </F> "Will IZVESTIYA, PRAVDA, and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Come Out as Always  in Morning Without Holdups?"]    [Text] No, the question posed in the headline is by no  means rhetorical, as it seems at first glance, because Decree  No. 1233 "On the Reevaluation of Fixed Capital at Enterprises in  the National Economy," adopted by the Russian Government 25  November 1993, came into force 1 January. Effectively this  decree suspends the publication of all newspapers and journals,  since the 25-30-percent increase in the value of printing  enterprises' fixed capital is leading to approximately a  500-percent increase in prices for printing services! This  cannot be borne either by a single publishing house, even the  most prosperous one, or the reader, who has already paid  newspaper and journal subscriptions and at excessively high  prices.    Alas, however hard this is to come to terms with, yet  another  cruel blow is being aimed at the press, glasnost, freedom of  speech, and what are virtually Russian democracy's most  significant achievements. Each time it follows the peak of the  latest political action, in this case the Federal Assembly  elections. It is even somehow embarrassing to recall the  government's repeated promises to sort out the questions  relating to prices for printed publications, mail service chaos,  and customs barriers hindering newspaper and journal  distribution. The promise to privatize printing bases with the  participation of journalists was simply not kept....    Concerned by the situation that has developed, on 30  December  leaders of the Union of Journalists of Russia, the Union of  Journalists of Moscow, the Association of Publishers and Chief  Editors, the Committee To Protect Freedom of Speech and  Journalists' Rights, and the Foundation for the Protection of  Glasnost, as well as the chief editors of almost all central and  leading Moscow newspapers, delivered a statement to Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.    The appeal suggests avoiding this blow against freedom of  speech either by means of targeted subsidies or by establishing  a special procedure for implementing this decree in the spheres  of printing, mail, communications, and paper production.  Otherwise, the appeal says, "we will have no option but to  appeal to readers and to the people, urging and asking them to  defend their newspapers and journals, their right to be  well-informed on matters of state, society, and the world....  Finally, our journalists' collectives will simply have to stop  work, and this means that both print shops and publishing houses  will be idle. We state that we are prepared to suspend the  publication of our publications as early as in the  'parliamentary week' -- from 10 through 17 January 1994."    The journalists are not joking. Yesterday at a press  conference in which leaders of the Union of Journalists of  Russia, the Union of Journalists of Moscow, the chief editors of  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA,  VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA, and MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, IZVESTIYA's deputy  chief editor, and others took part, the formation of a strike  committee by Moscow newspapers was announced.    The government has virtually ignored the appeal. Although,  for the sake of objectivity it must be admitted that when the  conference was drawing to an end a possible 5 January meeting  between Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  and members of the Association of Publishers and Chief Editors  was announced, citing Boris Mironov, acting chairman of the  Russian Federation Committee for the Press....    Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Union of Journalists of  Russia, stressed that the impending action is a forced measure.  According to him the final decision whether to carry out the  protest action will be made 5 January. [Knyazkov ends]    The following natural question is probably being asked by  readers: How do KRASNAYA ZVEZDA staffers react to their  colleagues' statements and actions? What will they do if other  publishing houses' publications are suspended?    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA is a newspaper with special status, a  military newspaper. Most of its journalists wear shoulder  boards. A strike, the suspension of publishing, which to our  civilian colleagues are a legal if extreme form of protest,  would be a grave violation of the law to us. We cannot fail to  take into account that in the current conditions the central  military newspaper is often the most important or else the only  source of information for many Army and Navy garrisons and  units, including remote ones.    At the same time KRASNAYA ZVEZDA workers are, of course, in  solidarity with the protest action by Russian publications'  journalists. Everything they are protesting -- the monopolists'  price diktat, the destruction of the press distribution system,  the state mail service's disgraceful work, the creation of  artificial customs and currency barriers hindering a newspaper's  contact with its readers -- all this is very familiar indeed to  us too, we are constantly experiencing all this for ourselves.  The government's latest act in reevaluating fixed assets is  hitting KRASNAYA ZVEZDA hard too.    We add our voice to that of our colleagues and urge that  measures be urgently taken to create acceptable conditions in  which the newspaper market and the distribution system can  function. The survival of the press is now at stake.</p>

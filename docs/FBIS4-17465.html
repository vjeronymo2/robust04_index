			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk refuted the  statement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev about the  intentions of our state to review the accords on the division of  the Black Sea Fleet. The last meeting of the defense ministers  of Ukraine and Russia in Crimea was of a working nature and  cannot be a final evaluation of the division of the Black Sea  Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk told journalists. The statement by  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Ostankino  television company that Ukraine has changed its stand is  groundless, he emphasized.    Leonid Kravchuk recalled that in accordance with the Yalta  accord the fleet should be divided in half. But, proceeding  from the current realities, Ukraine will take only 15-20 percent  of the ships. The remainder will go to pay off its debts to  Russia.    Touching on the issue of a base for the Russian ships, the  president said that he is insisting on their being stationed in  Sevastopol. Balaklava could become the base for the Ukrainian  Navy. Leonid Kravchuk will defend this proposal at his next  meeting with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin.    However, as much as I might respect the defense ministers of  the two states, the Black Sea Fleet issue should be resolved by  the presidents and governments, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized.</p>

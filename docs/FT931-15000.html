			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Economic policy pledge: President-elect aims for package in March PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton yesterday promised that he would have an economic policy package ready for inclusion in a 'state of the union' message by the middle of March at the latest. Responding to questions after revealing more than 30 new White House appointments, he noted that in 1981, the last time a president from a different political party took over, Mr Ronald Reagan had unveiled his policies by mid-March. 'I think we can do better than that,' he added. He again denied that he had broken an election campaign promise by dropping a commitment to cut income taxes for the middle class. He said the press had exaggerated his determination to cut taxes. 'I never met a voter last year who thought that was necessary.' The essential ingredients of his economic plan were threefold, he said: an investment strategy to stimulate growth and increase wages, reduction of the federal budget deficit and national debt, and proposals to attack the crisis in health care. The new appointments announced by Mr Clinton yesterday did not include sub-cabinet level positions in the State, Treasury or Defence departments, all of which are now eagerly awaited. He recommended that Mr David Wilhelm, a senior campaign manager, take over as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, from Mr Ron Brown - who has been chosen to be commerce secretary - with Mr Craig Smith, a long-time aide, as the committee's political director. The party will doubtless accede to this request. As expected, most of the top White House staff posts also went to long-standing associates and campaign workers. Among the more prominent, Mr George Stephanopoulos, the able chief spokesman, becomes director of communications, with Ms Dee Dee Myers continuing as press secretary. Mr Clinton highlighted the appointments of Ms Carol Rasco as assistant for domestic policy, and Mr Eli Segal to be in charge of the new national service corps. Both have been with the president-elect for years. The delicate job of liaison with Congress has been entrusted to Mr Howard Paster, a veteran Washington insider, with Ms Susan Brophy, also well versed in the ways of the capital, as deputy. Mr Ira Magaziner, the business consultant who has been a member of Mr Clinton's economic policy brains trust, is brought into the White House as a special assistant on domestic issues. Mr Gene Sperling, the campaign's economic adviser, will help Mr Robert Rubin run the new economic policy security council. Deputy chief of staff, under Mr Thomas McLarty, the Arkansas businessman, will be Mr Mark Gearan, while another Clinton intimate, Mr Bruce Lindsey, in charge of personnel.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Up to now, the OAU secretary  general has not said anything. However this is the right time  to speak out. They should talk so that everyone's position is  clear. It is clear that some OAU member countries still behave  like colonized people instead of searching for the truth. These  are for example countries which agreed to send their troops in  the campaign to be led by France. The Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] representatives in Brussels gave them the right message:  Please find other ways to repay the French debt, not with  Rwandan blood.    The OAU agreed to sit with the leader of the killers,  Theodore Sindikubwabo, the interim president of Rwanda. This  has been said and forgotten but the OAU should not add one evil  to another. The OAU should choose the right path and openly  denounce the French aggression, because the consequences will be  many. [passage omitted].</p>

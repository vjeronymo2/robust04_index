			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL OPERATOR INVESTIGATING PATIENT'S DEATH  </P> <P> FHP Inc., the health care organization that operates FHP Fountain Valley  Hospital, has launched an internal investigation of the events leading up to  the mysterious death of a patient last November, company officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley police revealed Tuesday they are investigating FHP and a nurse  who formerly worked for the company about about their role in the death of  Francis J. Johnson, 74, who was admitted to the hospital for respiratory  problems on Nov. 13, 1989, and died the following day.  </P> <P> The death certificate, written by an FHP staff doctor, listed the cause of  death as "mestastic breast cancer," but police now believe that the woman  actually died because an FHP nurse administered the wrong medication to her.  </P> <P> A Fountain Valley police spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday that the nurse,  Maureen Daubert, lost her license shortly after the incident but he did not  know if it was related to the death of Johnson.  </P> <P> Police are also investigating the preparation of the death certificate, but no  physicians have been targeted in the inquiry, according to Steve Williams, a  Fountain Valley police investigator.  </P> <P> "This has all caught us somewhat off guard," Anna Marie Dunlap, a company vice  president, said Wednesday. "We've assigned a couple of people to investigate  it, and we plan to have a statement tomorrow or Friday."  </P> <P> Daubert no longer works for FHP, but company officials will not say whether  Daubert was fired or whether she left on her own.  </P></p>

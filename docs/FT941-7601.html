			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Government cuts insurance tax rate to 2.5% The government yesterday bowed to pressure from the insurance industry by modifying the proposed tax on premiums and reducing its rate from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent. The change will only marginally reduce the amount of money raised annually from the tax, introduced in the November Budget - but the changes are expected to yield administrative savings for insurance companies and were widely welcomed by the industry. Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers, said: 'It is much easier for everybody and good news for policyholders.' Following the changes, announced yesterday by Sir John Cope, paymaster-general, the premium tax will be charged on insurance premiums on a gross rather than a net basis - before, rather than after the deduction of brokerage commission. The change will make the tax easier for insurance companies to collect, and the rate has been lowered to reduce the extra burden on insurers and their customers which would have resulted. Sir John said: 'The reduction of the rate is directly linked to the decision to tax gross rather than net premiums. We have been able to address the concerns of the insurance industry about the operation of the new tax to make it simpler and . . . its administration easier.' The yield from the tax will now be about Pounds 760m in its first full year rising to Pounds 835m in 1996-97. That compares with forecasts - calculated on the basis of a 3 per cent rate - of Pounds 775m and Pounds 840m. Sir John said the proposed changes met the insurance industry's requests 'for greater flexibility and for arrangements which tie in more closely with existing systems'. The change will have no impact on policyholders, who will still face average increases of 35p per week on buildings, contents and motor insurance. Mr Baker said the tax as originally proposed would have 'distorted' competition between companies which sell direct to the public and those which sell through brokers. Commission rates differ between types of insurance, so the tax would also have been difficult to administer. Mr Peter Foster, general manager, finance, of Commercial Union, the UK's largest composite (general and life) insurance company, said: 'There is still a danger that the rate of the tax could be increased, but obviously people have been taking note of the representations the industry has made.' Insurers will be able to account for the tax in line with existing accounting procedures rather than on a 'cash receipts basis'. They will be able to account for the tax quarterly rather than monthly as originally proposed, and longer-term policies, for which a premium has already been paid, will not be subject to the tax.</p>

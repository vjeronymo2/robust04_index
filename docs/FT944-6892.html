			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Parties close in Uruguayan poll Uruguayans yesterday voted in what promised to be the country's closest presidential election for decades as latest opinion polls indicated a virtual three-way tie between the main contenders. Polls conducted before campaigning stopped last week put the governing Blanco party and the opposition Colorado party on 29 per cent each, with the left-wing Encuentro Progresista coalition just behind on 27 per cent. Few pollsters were hazarding a guess on the likely outcome, saying the result could be changed by a swing of only 15,000 votes. Whoever becomes president will almost certainly lack a majority in Congress  -whose members were also being elected yesterday - and will have to forge a coalition in order to govern for the next five years. The two presidential front-runners were expected to be Mr Julio Maria Sanguinetti, a former president and candidate for the social democratic-leaning Colorado party, and Mr Alberto Volonte, a maverick Blanco candidate campaigning on a 'non-politician' platform. Close behind in the polls is Mr Tabare Vazquez, the charismatic mayor of Montevideo who leads a coalition ranging from social democrats to socialists, communists and former guerrillas. Mr Juan Andres Ramrez, Blanco's second presidential candidate, is the chosen successor of President Luis Alberto Lacalle, but has consistently trailed Mr Volonte in the polls. Results of the elections, not expected to be officially announced until today, will determine whether Uruguay pushes ahead with the free-market reforms cautiously introduced by President Lacalle. Both Blanco candidates would try to revive the privatisation process and to reform the costly social security system. Mr Sanguinetti, who has complained that overzealous liberalisation has harmed Uruguayan industry, would probably adopt less overtly free-market policies. Mr Vazquez, who enjoys fanatical support in Montevideo but whose party machinery may be insufficiently well oiled to deliver him national victory, has sharply criticised the Blanco reform process. Uruguayans also voted yesterday on constitutional reforms, one of which would make it harder to reform the pension system, while the other would guarantee that 27 per cent of public spending went on education. Blanco candidates say the reforms, both of which stand a reasonable chance of passing, would seriously weaken already stretched public finances. Voting is obligatory for Uruguay's registered electorate of 2.3m.</p>

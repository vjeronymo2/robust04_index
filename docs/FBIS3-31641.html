			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brno, South Moravia Feb 21 (CTK) -- Czech Social  Democratic Party (CSSD) Deputy Chairman Vaclav Grulich today  described Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys's initiative on  a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina  as "hasty."    Talking to journalists, he said Baudys "should never have  made similar proposals public without discussing them in  government."    He said the initiative could lead to further escalation of  nationalist tension in the conflict, as he is actually proposing  what the rest of the world is seeking to eliminate.    Baudys presented his initiative at a press conference in  Prague on Saturday [19 February], prior to his visit to Turkey.  His proposal envisages the creation of a UN executive goodwill  committee, which would oversee the peace process in the area and  in which selected countries the identity of which is linked to  the religious and cultural values of the warring parties, would  participate.    Baudys did not consult with the government or parliament  about it and sent copies of it to various international  organisations and prominent figures.</p>

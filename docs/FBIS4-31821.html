			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition is interested in principles and not  in positions it can hold, Drazen Budisa told journalists  following a several hour-long meeting of the parliamentary  opposition. Jasenka Dudic reports:    [Dudic] The opposition's new proposal is: Until further  notice, not to put forward candidates for the position of vice  president of either chamber of the assembly. We are not  insisting on the appointment of the people we have put forward,  Budisa said, and added that the opposition insisted on the fact  that the 14th session of the Chamber of Counties should be  resumed from the moment the vote on the vice president of that  chamber was taken which, the opposition believes, was not done  in line with the rules of procedure.    [Begin Budisa recording] In return for our concession not to  put forward any candidates for the position of vice president of  either chamber, the opposition demands that principles and the  rules of procedure be honored, which means that the 18th session  of the Chamber of Deputies should be held in line with the rules  of procedure. [end recording]    [[Dudic] If the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] accepts this  proposal, Budisa said that the opposition will return to the  parliament. Failing this, Budisa said that the opposition will  resign from its posts in committees and commissions. He also  said that the opposition is united, and that not even the  Croatian Party of Right will return to the parliament unless all  of the opposition does. Budisa also announced a meeting with  Jure Radic for today and a meeting between opposition and HDZ  negotiators for Thursday [16 June].</p>

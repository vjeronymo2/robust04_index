			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEFFEN CANCELS DISTRIBUTION PACT WITH CONTROVERSIAL DEF AMERICAN  </P> <P> Geffen Records officially terminated its manufacturing and distributing deal  Monday with Def American Recordings, the Los Angeles-based company whose roster  includes such controversial acts as comedian Andrew Dice Clay, rap group the  Geto Boys and hard-rock band Slayer.  </P> <P> "We find ourselves increasingly at odds with Def American's creative  philosophy," said Geffen spokeswoman Bryn Bridenthal.  </P> <P> "Because we believe both in artistic freedom and the freedom to choose the  direction of our company, we felt it would be most constructive to encourage  (Def American owner) Rick Rubin to find a manufacturer/distributor with a  greater affinity for the direction of his label."  </P> <P> The break came following Geffen's decision last month not to release a Def  American album by the Geto Boys, branding as offensive the Houston group's  raps, which sometimes mix brutal imagery and explicit sexual references.  </P> <P> Rubin was unavailable for comment Monday, but he said earlier that he was  contractually free from Geffen after the label refused to handle the Geto Boys  record and that the album would be released through the Warner/Elektra/Atlantic  distribution group.  </P> <P> Rubin's announcement stirred speculation that WEA -- which also, ironically,  distributes Geffen Records -- would soon take over distribution of all Def  American releases.STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

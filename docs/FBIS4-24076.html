			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan's ambassador to South Africa, Mr. Katsumi  Sezaki, says prospects of increased trade between the two  countries are good but that direct investment is less likely.  Speaking in Durban he said that at present South Africa had no  special advantage over Asian countries and that it would have to  adopt a clearer strategy to attract foreign investors.  Referring to trade, Mr. Sezaki said a likely upturn in the  Japanese economy by the end of the year will result in increased  imports from South Africa. He also disclosed that Japan was  examining ways of increasing aid to South Africa and said an  economic cooperation mission would visit the country next week  for talks with the government on the Reconstruction and  Development Program.</p>

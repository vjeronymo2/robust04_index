			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: Enthralling Ariodante - Opera Reports of death, or at least a serious wasting disease, at the English National Opera have been piling up this season, the last under the artistic triumvirate of Jonas, Elder and Pountney. On the evidence of the new Ariodante, they have been exaggerated. Wednesday's account of Handel's 1735 Italian opera - one of his three based on Ariosto's Orlando furioso, one of his most original and beautiful - lashed out with powerful theatrical vitality. At every moment alarming risks were taken and disquietingly intense, complex states were being searched out. On such an evening the ENO could be seen and heard to recover the form established in its keynote productions of recent years. Musically, the performance, scrupulously prepared, was delivered with notable (if not uniform) virtuosity and fidelity to the score - all of it, lasting four engrossing hours, and including the ballet episodes. And dramatically, the modern re-imagining of Handel's opera seria dramaturgy demonstrates, I insist, its own fidelity - to the spirit, if not the letter, of the notes and words. It is not a 'sure-fire' Ariodante that David Alden and his associates (designer, Ian MacNeil, lighting director, Wolfgang Gobbel) have devised. The style essayed is not the supremely civilised late-20th-century survey of 18th-century modes and manners achieved by Nicholas Hytner in Xerxes, the previous Handel production at the Coliseum. People who have kept apace with Alden's work on this stage would hardly expect it to be; surreal dislocation is his well-documented forte. What may surprise them are the new elements in his production vocabulary: a new design-partner (the Olivier Award-winner for the National's An Inspector Calls) has encouraged him to shed the bare light-bulb, tiled bathroom wall and kitchen chair that have provided the identificatory flourishes to the Alden signature, and work up a fresh surge of theatricality. The atmosphere of Ariodante is unique. The libretto (drawn by Antonio Salvi from the same tale in Orlando furioso that inspired Much Ado about Nothing) is focused on a single act of carefully planned treachery, yet shows pastoral warmth, courtly delicacy, romantic ardour, irony, pathos, and tragic agony, all in full-blending co-existence. It permitted Handel to move through the entire range without clash or absurdity, creating a drama of conflicting emotions that is as 'personal', as intimately charged, as any in opera. In Alden's and MacNeil's re-invention, it all takes place under (and, in one scene, upon) a mobile segment of Baroque ceiling, frescoed and corniced, which - like much else in the decor and costumes - infuses controlled bursts of brilliant colour into the theatrical pattern. Its action defines the production hallmark: 18th-century shapes and figures, wrenched out of 'period' context and on to a 1993 stage, now fiercely, now with hypnotised slowness, with the purpose of heightening the intensity, and often the disturbing ambiguity, of Handel's emotional spectrum. In common with Alden's ENO versions of A Masked Ball and Bluebeard's Castle  -outstanding productions both - this show is full of startling visual sleights-of-hand, movement-mannerisms developing thematic function and also a dangerous potential for audience irritation. Acts of violence are plentiful. Moments of dream-fantasy (such as those tormenting the betrayed heroine Ginevra in the remarkable finale of Act 2) are horribly - gratuitously? - vivid. The opera's architectural variety, and the lighter moods that come to re-inforce it, find little representation. On the other hand, I have experienced few Handel productions based on a more tautly woven ensemble of flesh-and-blood characters. Many Handelians will loathe this Ariodante. They have my understanding, even sympathy: Alden, even at his peculiar, idiosyncratic best, has always excited passionate response. For Nicholas McGegan, an experienced Handel opera-conductor making a belated debut at a London opera-house, there will surely be praise all but unstinted. In so big a theatre, with a modern-instrument band disposed in so deep a pit, he had passing difficulty holding voices and instruments together; but the vitality of sound, with each astonishing rhythmic inflection and streak of colour given its due weight of emphasis, afforded the production a wonderfully secure and solid basis. In the title role Ann Murray enjoys the latest of her London Handel triumphs; early on she seemed a mite below best form, putting too much verismo into 'Scherza infida', but then bringing absolute authority to the light-after-dark final aria. Amanda Roocroft, vulnerable and touching as the tragic Ginevra, continues to develop her richly endowed soprano - more clarity is still needed in low-lying phrases, more verbal thrust everywhere. Lesley Garrett (Dalinda) and Christopher Robson (Polinesso), ENO Handelians of masterly stage authority, draw sharp, strong lines in the schemers' roles: both offer moments of uneven tonal emission, whole stretches of superlatively singing-acting. Only the ill-equipped bass King counts as a weakness. Amanda Holden's new translation strikes me as a shade less skilful than usual: well-shaped phrases sit alongside less singable ones, and one or two of pure translatorese. Even so, opera in the language of the audience is a cause well served by this latest example. I found this Ariodante enthralling from start to finish, warts and all. I cannot imagine anyone left indifferent to it. Supported by ENO Trust: in repertory at the London Coliseum until June 10.</p>

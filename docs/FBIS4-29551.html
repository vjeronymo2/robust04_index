			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shen Guofang, PRC government spokesman, by </F> unidentified DER SPIEGEL correspondent; place and date not  given: "`Prevent The War'"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] There is no country that has better  relations with North Korea than China. How dangerous is North  Korea's nuclear potential?    [Shen] We maintain normal diplomatic relations with North  Korea, but there is no nuclear cooperation. North Korea has  declared on several occasions that it has no intention of  developing nuclear arms.    [DER SPIEGEL] The United States says that Kim Il-song has  enough plutonium to build several nuclear bombs.    [Shen] To date, there is no proof of that.    [DER SPIEGEL] What would you advise North Korea to do to  defuse the situation?    [Shen] We advocate a de-nuclearization of the Korean  peninsula, and we are against nuclear arms, whether they are in  North or South Korea.    [DER SPIEGEL] What does this mean in specific political  terms?    [Shen] North and South Korea must get back to the  negotiating table. Also, the United States and the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] must continue their  dialogue with the North.    [DER SPIEGEL] If, however, the issue of sanctions against  North Korea were to be brought before the UN Security Council,  how would China decide?    [Shen] We are basically opposed to such problems being taken  before the Security Council. It would only aggravate the  situation and does not get us anywhere. We want talks.    [DER SPIEGEL] What guarantees are there to prevent Pyongyang  from tinkering with the bomb in the meantime?    [Shen] There is no proof that they have any nuclear weapons  at all. Sanctions would only make the situation worse.    [DER SPIEGEL] Pyongyang has repeatedly threatened war. Is  North Korea bluffing, or is this to be taken seriously?    [Shen] All parties should show restraint and remain calm at  the moment. A war must be prevented; it would not involve any  advantages for anyone.    [DER SPIEGEL] In 1961, China concluded a military mutual  assistance pact. Will you keep it in the event of a war?    [Shen] It is a friendship and assistance pact, which is, of  course, still valid today. But we should not talk of war so  much. I am convinced that there is still enough room for a  peaceful solution.</p>

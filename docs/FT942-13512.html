			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Council set to rule over BAe airport The battle over British Aero-space's attempt to convert its airfield at Filton, north Bristol, into a commercial airport is due to come to a head on Wednesday amid calls for a public inquiry, Roland Adburgham writes. The planning committee of Northavon council, the local authority, will meet then to decide on BAe's application. BAe wants airlines to offer scheduled flights carrying up to 350,000 passengers a year, and to have night-time freight services. The company's plan is supported by business groups and Rolls-Royce, whose Patchway works is next to the airfield. But there is strong opposition from local residents concerned about noise and pollution. Avon county council and Bristol council, which owns the city's airport at Lulsgate, want the application called in by the Department of the Environment for a public inquiry.</p>

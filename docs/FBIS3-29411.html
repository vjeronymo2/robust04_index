"We agreed with each other about the mechanism, the  framework, we would like to have to discuss this," the prince  said after lengthy talks here with his Vietnamese counterpart.    Other items on the agenda were the issue of Vietnamese  settlers in Cambodia, trade facilities and customs regulations.    "But I told my Vietnamese friends the border problem is the  main problem," the prince said.    The prince said he hoped further progress would be made when  Vietnamese premier Vo Van Kiet visited Cambodia in March or  April.    Prince Sirivut said he told the Vietnamese side that the  government was also aware of Hanoi's concern about the fate of  thousands of ethnic Vietnamese who fled to the border between  the two countries last April to escape a Khmer Rouge campaign of  ethnic cleansing and have since been barred from re-entering  Cambodia.</p>

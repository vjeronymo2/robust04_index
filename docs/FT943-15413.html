			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Caverdale to acquire Godfrey Davis Caverdale Group, the motor retailing and industrial products concern, is acquiring Godfrey Davis, a Ford main dealer, for Pounds 2.87m in cash and shares. The Pounds 1.85m cash element of the price will be met by a placing and open offer by Kleinwort Benson Securities of 23.82m new ordinary shares at 14 3/4 p, which will raise Pounds 3m net. Qualifying holders may apply on terms of 80 new ordinary for every Pounds 17 nominal of loan stock held. In 1993 Davis made pre-tax profits of Pounds 217,000 on Pounds 52m turnover. At the year end, it had net assets of Pounds 2.02m. The deal will increase Caverdale's motor retailing turnover by almost 55 per cent.</p>

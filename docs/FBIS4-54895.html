			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Euke Frank; </F> place and date not given: "Visions of a Short-Time Prime  Minister"]    [Text] [Frank] Your transition government has no more than  six months until the next election in the fall. Do you see any  chances at all to take future-oriented steps in such a short  period?    [Moravcik] Absolutely. We have put together a cabinet of  experts. Priority will be given to stabilizing the economic  situation, stimulating exports, and, most important, providing  social security for the people.    [Frank] Is Vladimir Meciar, your former party colleague and  now political adversary, making life difficult for you because  he is in the opposition? After all, his political style was not  always exactly fine.    [Moravcik] Quite so. I think that we will not give him any  chance to make commentaries that are beside the point. He has to  deal nfow with experts and not with political functionaries.    [Frank] If the fall election were to result in a hung  parliament, would you be ready to enter into a coalition with  him?    [Moravcik] For this he would have to change his political  style fundamentally.    [Frank] By his statements on the Romanies living in  Slovakia,  Meciar triggered a storm of indignation in the international  media. What do you think about this problem?    [Moravcik] As so often, Meciar chose the wrong tone and the  wrong words. On substance, however, I must say that he was  right. The crime rate among this part of the population is above  average, and it constitutes a burden for our budget through the  high children's benefits it claims.    [Frank] Are you working on a solution?    [Moravcik] Creating employment means more jobs for  everybody,  including the Romanies. As far as child benefits are concerned,  we will have to make cuts, such as freezing the increase in  child benefits as of the fourth child.    [Frank] According to a survey, more than 60 percent regret  the separation from the Czech Republic....    [Moravcik] In the long term, it was our only chance.</p>

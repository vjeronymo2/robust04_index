			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Czechoslovak Airlines seeks local investor Czechoslovak Airlines is about to enter talks with Czech financial institutions that could lead to a new shareholder injecting fresh capital into the loss-making carrier. The move follows the withdrawal of Air France from an investment in CSA in March. The new investor is likely to acquire part or all of the 49 per cent stake in CSA held by the Czech National Property Fund, the government body that owns shares in companies being privatised. Mr Frantisek Slaby, CSA's executive vice-president for finance and planning, said the airline had abandoned its search for a single strategic partner to replace Air France, and was seeking an alliance with a local investor. 'There are (Czech) institutions able and willing to be financial partners of CSA,' he said. 'The partner would be from the financial sector but not necessarily a bank.' Mr Slaby declined to say who the potential local investors might be. However, one local institution likely to be approached is Ceska Pojist'ovna, the largest Czech insurance company, which has a 4.5 per cent stake in CSA. The Consolidation Bank, the state-owned 'hospital bank' that manages much of the bad debt of newly-privatised Czech companies, and which holds the 19.1 per cent stake in CSA formerly held by Air France, could also be considered.</p>

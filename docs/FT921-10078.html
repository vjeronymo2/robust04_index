			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Call for early French poll FRANCE'S opposition parties yesterday called for early general elections, in a censure motion condemning the government's handling of the Habash affair. The opposition motion was tabled during an emergency parliamentary debate on the controversial hospitalisation last week in Paris of Palestinian leader Georges Habbash. The censure motion, which will be voted on next Tuesday, is almost bound to fall short of the necessary majority, because the Communist Party has said it will not vote for it. Introducing yesterday's debate, Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, accused the opposition parties of exaggeration. She said they were trying to make a political affair out of what was really an 'administrative error', which had rapidly been put right. But the opposition claimed 'the authority of the state has been compromised by the serious disorders which affect its functioning, and by the moral and political crisis of the country'. Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing has proposed that the National Assembly should respond by passing a law dissolving itself.</p>

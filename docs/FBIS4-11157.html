The diplomat stressed the efforts  conducted in the last 62 years to develop and strengthen the  Armed Forces of the DPRK, which resulted in victorious outcomes  in two wars. The official affirmed that today the army, with a  high degree of technology, defends the cause of revolution and  socialism.    [Begin Kim recording] Our People's Army has experienced  guerrilla and conventional warfare since its creation. These  arduous and long struggles resulted in valuable combat  experience. Our People's Army is also contributing significantly  to building a socialist economy. Many commemorative projects  have been erected by our army in the DPRK. [end recording]    Colonel Kim Hwi-paek pointed out that the People's Army is  currently engaged in increasing its combat readiness in the face  of threatening actions by the United States and South Korea,  which have used the issue of the alleged production of nuclear  weapons to deploy missiles and conduct military exercises.    [Begin Kim recording] We have no need to produce nuclear  weapons in the DPRK. Our nuclear efforts are only aimed at  developing the socialist economy and nuclear energy is being  used only for peaceful purposes. [end recording]    The Korean official spoke of the tense situation in the  Korean peninsula arising from the U.S. attitude and pointed out  that his government is as ready for talks as for war.</p>

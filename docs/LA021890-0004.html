			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTIONS OF LAST RESORT  </P> <P> Many of us who oppose abortion have not been led to our position by religious  indoctrination or coldhearted indifference to the plight of women in crisis.  Rather, a basic understanding of the development of the pre-born human, and  what happens to him or her during an abortion, leads to an unsettling  conclusion: This is a primitive and Draconian procedure at any stage,  especially during the second and third trimester. There have to be more humane  solutions to these wrenching problems than dismemberment and disposal of human  life on such a colossal scale.  </P> <P> PAUL C. REISSER, MD  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

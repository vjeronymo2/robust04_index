			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Motoring: Renault's executive ploy Renault's significant new model, the medium-sized Laguna, makes its debut at the Geneva motor show in just over two weeks and arrives in British showrooms in April. Its appearance with right-hand steering so soon after the mainland European launch shows how seriously Renault takes the British market - especially sales to business users and company fleets. Renault is having a product-led recovery in Britain where it sold just over 93,000 cars last year - its best performance since 1979. The Laguna, successor to the old Renault 21, will compete mainly with the Ford Mondeo, Opel Vectra (Vauxhall Cavalier in Britain), Peugeot 405 and Citroen Xantia. But it will also be an alternative to the British-made Nissan Primera, Honda Accord and Toyota Carina E. Where does it stand against such strong opposition? At a probable price range of Pounds 10,500-Pounds 19,000, it should give any of them a run for their money. The Laguna is son of the Safrane - Renault's large, executive-class car - and not a bigger version of the Renault 19. Along with the Xantia, it is the most distinctively styled vehicle in its class. At present, there is just one body: a five-door hatchback that could be mistaken for a four-door saloon. But estate cars, including a family model with three rows of face-forward seats, are expected to follow soon. To start with, only petrol engines will be offered - a 1.8-litre, 95 horsepower version and another of two litres and 115 horsepower, both with four cylinders, plus a V6 three-litre of 170 horsepower. But a 2.2-litre, 85hp diesel joins the range in Britain in October. As a design, the Laguna breaks no moulds. It is a conventional, transverse-engined, front-wheel driven car. Five-speed manual transmission is standard on all but the UK-specification V6. This will come with a four-speed automatic, also available on the two-litre at extra cost. Its suspension uses MacPherson struts (combined coil spring and damper units) at the front and torsion bars at the rear. Four-cylinder models have front disc, rear drum brakes; the V6 has discs all round with ABS as standard, but this is an optional extra on all other Lagunas. There are three trim levels, so buyers can pick and mix engines and interiors to arrive at a car that suits their pockets and tastes. Every Laguna has power-assisted steering, central locking and electric windows. With up-market cars such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Rover in its sights, Renault UK is loading the V6 automatic with leather trim, air-conditioning, on-board computer and powered sun roof. Everything, in fact, to which the executive user has grown accustomed without unnecessary bulk. The Laguna offers four people lounging space and would be tolerable for five. Its boot is among the largest in class. In Tanzania this month, I drove 1.8-litre, two-litre and V6 three-litre Lagunas with manual transmission, and a two-pedal three-litre V6. No, not on dirt roads in the game reserves - these remain Land Rover territory - but mainly on stretches of pretty good tarmac which, one day, will form part of a Cape to Cairo highway. All rode well and felt reassuringly solid. Renault says its aim was to make the Laguna feel like a German car and it does, although the seats are more yielding. Having been assured there was no speed limit in Tanzania* outside the potholed, old banger-infested towns and villages, I gave the Lagunas their heads where it was safe. Even the 1.8-litre cruised quietly at more than 100mph (160kmh), and at 125mph (200kmh) the V6 felt relaxed with power in hand. For a combination of performance and economy, the two-litre was my favourite. It was considerably quicker off the mark than the 1.8 and pulled harder in fourth and fifth gears. It was agreeably nimble on winding hill roads, and the 65-series tyres rumbled only moderately on coarsely-textured surfaces. The figures suggest the fuel consumptions of the various models will be little different - an average 32-33mpg (8.82-8.56 l/100 km). But with temperatures at times around 40`C, what really set the various Laguna models apart was air-conditioning. In the two-litre and V6, it was appreciated - and sorely missed in the 1.8. * Over a drink before flying home, an expatriate put me right. Tanzania has a 100kph speed limit - although few local vehicles seemed capable of much more than half that.</p>

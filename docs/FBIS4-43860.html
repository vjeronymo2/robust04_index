			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Parliament speaker Husamettin Cindoruk said  Friday afternoon [17 June] that the 13 deputies from the  now-defunct Kurdish based Democracy Party (DEP) still retained  their parliamentary status.    After receiving a copy of Thursday's verdict issued by the  Constitutional Court, Cindoruk told journalists that the  deputies, who on Wednesday resigned from the DEP in a last  minute bid to avoid being banned from founding a new party, were  still members of parliament.    His statement coincided with State Security Court chief  prosecutor Nusret Demiral's claim that at least six of the  deputies, who have announced they will not return to Turkey,  were terrorists.    "They are terrorists," Demiral said, without referring to  the  fact that he was preparing to charge them, like the five  deputies who were arrested in March, for the opinions they have  expressed either in writing or verbally. "It is up to them if  they decide not to return... They are terrorists and we know  how we'll get them back," he added, noting that Turkey had  signed international agreements for the extradition of criminals.    He also said, however, that until the detailed verdict  emerged and was published, the deputies would continue to enjoy  their parliamentary immunity.    A lawyer for the DEP told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS the same  day  that under normal circumstances it would take some three months  for such a verdict to be published, but he claimed that since  the court was under political pressure, the process could be  speeded up.    Legally, he pointed out, Demiral's reference to elected  members of Parliament as "terrorists" even before they had lost  their immunity or been in front of a magistrate, was an offence.  Meanwhile, reaction to the DEP closure started to build up  throughout the world as well as in Turkey itself.    Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin said in a statement  that this development showed how vital it was for an amendment  of article 84 of the Turkish constitution to be enacted. He  insisted, however, that he would not comment on a court decision.    New Democracy Movement leader Cem Boyner said, on the other  hand, that the closure of DEP was against the principles of  justice and that the judicial system shaped according to the  1992 constitution, which was prepared under a military regime,  was "too tight for Turkey." Boyner called for major  constitutional amendments.    In a separate statement, Turkish Human Rights Association  Chairman Akin Birdal said the decision of the court was a  political one, and branded the verdict as "a blow to freedom of  opinion."    Murat Bozlak, chairman of the People's Democracy Party  (HADEP), said in his statement that the verdict had shown there  was no true democracy in Turkey and that the principles of a  judicial state were not being met.    Labor Party press secretary Hacer Nursel Uguz concluded that  Turkey was basically insisting on "a policy of violence" in its  search for a solution to the Kurdish problem.</p>

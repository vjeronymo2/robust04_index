			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bradford &amp; Bingley looks for German market niche Bradford &amp; Bingley, the UK's seventh largest building society, launched its assault on the German retail financial services sector yesterday with the declaration that it was aiming for 5 per cent of the German building society market. Mr Geoffrey Lister, B&amp;B's chief executive, said in Hamburg that it was also planning to open up a full-scale branch office this summer under EU legislation. That would allow Mr Bradford and Mr Bingley, the famous bowler-hatted figures used in the society's UK marketing, to take on the German mortgage banking market in addition to the Bausparkassen, the German equivalent of building societies. Mr Lister said the initial DM13m (Pounds 4.9m) investment was small in relation to the market potential, and the society would expand cautiously. In November B&amp;B became the first foreign institution to receive authorisation from German banking regulators to establish a Bausparkasse. The new institution - known as B&amp;B Bausparkasse in Europa - plans to take deposits from next month and will start lending in a few years. There are currently 34 Bausparkassen which share about 15 per cent of the highly regulated German home loan market. Mr Lister said that the plan was to win 1 per cent of the Bausparkasse market - or 50,000 savings contracts - within a year but that in the medium term five times that level of business was a realistic target. B&amp;B selected Germany for expansion abroad after studying market opportunities throughout continental Europe. The appeal of the German market lies in the low level of home ownership - 40 per cent as opposed to a European average of 60 per cent - as well as the perception that the German mortgage finance sector is underdeveloped by the standards of the highly competitive UK market.</p>

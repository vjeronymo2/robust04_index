Indeed, the Assembly notes that the  internal stability in these countries depends to a large extent  on modernising their structures and transformation in economic,  industrial and technological domains, domains where it believes  it is possible and desirable to improve Western assistance for  these countries. The Assembly insists on the creation of a  European information system, as currently initiatives often have  a double use, and calls on WEU member countries to give all  their political and economic support to Moscow's International  Centre for Science and Technology, whose aim is to prevent the  proliferation of technologies of mass destruction. Noting that  Ukraine and Kazakhstan had not yet acceded to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Assembly called on the WEU Council  to try to obtain this accession.</p>

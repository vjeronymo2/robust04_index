Smith, Jr., Executive Director for Air Carrier Operations Issues, Flight Standards Service (AFS&hyph;200), 800 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;8166, FAX: (202) 267&hyph;5230. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area that the ARAC deals with is air carrier operations. Other working groups in this area have dealt with issues such as autopilot takeoff minimum altitudes, fuel requirements, controlled rest on the flight deck, noise abatement, and flight crewmember flight/rest/duty requirements. The Single Engine-IMC-with passengers Working Group is being established to evaluate the safety aspects and overall feasibility of allowing passenger carrying operations in IMC with single engine aircraft. The Single Engine-IMC-with passengers Working Group will forward its recommendations to the ARAC, which will then determine whether to forward them to the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the Working Group's task is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Review the Canadian policy authorizing single engine IMC operations in turbine-powered airplanes and make recommendations for adoption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Re-examine existing policies for commercial IMC and/or night operations by single-engine aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Determine the conditions and/or limitations which should be met before commercial air transport IMC and/or night operations by single-engine aircraft could be permitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When considering the applicability of such operations, include both airplanes and helicopters (both turbine and reciprocating engines), passenger carriage (FAA), passenger/cargo carriage (JAA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Consider and dispose of any petitions for rulemaking or exemption on this subject. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

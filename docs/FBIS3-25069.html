			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Barron] </F>   [Text] Just two weeks after its formation, the peacekeeping  force due to be deployed in hot-spots around South Africa in  five weeks' time is in a shambles. Top instructors have told of  a collapse of discipline, desertion and drunkenness among the  3,500 volunteers at the SADF's [South African Defence Force] De  Brug training camp outside Bloemfontein. In addition, hygiene  conditions at the base are inadequate and there are nearly 200  cases of serious disease.    Now SADF instructors seconded to the force are so  disillusioned that nine have gone on "strike", refusing to obey  any orders that have anything to do with the National  Peacekeeping Force (NPKF). One instructor was sent home on  Friday and the others, according to sources at De Brug, "want  out". At least 100 statements have been submitted by SADF  volunteers who also want to return to their units -- and between  60 and 80 percent of SAP [South African Police] volunteers have  already left. A senior SAP source said about 40 percent of the  police contingents from the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana,  Venda and Ciskei] states had also returned home.    The picture painted this weekend of the fledgling Peace  Force, precursor of a fully integrated National Defence Force,  is grim. It shows a disparate force crippled by lack of  discipline and demoralized by a shortage of facilities and  equipment. Career soldiers, charged with welding former enemies  into a credible force to ensure free and fair elections, said  the peace troops "do pretty much as they like".    "If a guy threatens someone or disobeys a command, there's  nothing we can do. If you try to punish anyone and something  happens, you're in trouble," said a senior SADF officer. Some  MK [Umkhonto weSizwe, Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing]  members had refused to wear regulation overalls. About 45  soldiers are listed as being absent without leave.    The worst incident occurred last Saturday night, when about  600 MK soldiers, many drunk, began toyi-toying and shouting  slogans such as "One settler, one bullet" and "Down with FW".  They demanded on dead SADF member and one dead SAP member  before sunrise, and at least two SADF instructors were  assaulted. Terrified members of other groups refused to sleep  in their tents. They slept in the bush and instructors had to  persuade them on Monday to return. An MK colonel was asked by  an SADF officer to mediate with his men, but he refused, saying  he would be risking his life.    The temporary commanding officer, Colonel Fred Burger, could  not be located that night and was unaware of the incident until  the next day. Colonel Burger has been criticised by this  officers and instructors for downplaying the situation for  "political" reasons.    Compounding the difficulties is the way MK soldiers are  apparently promoted from the ranks to senior leadership  positions overnight. "We have at least one sergeant major of 19  and at least one regimental sergeant major of 21," said the SADF  veteran.    Because of a shortage of facilities, troops have been using  showers and wash basins as toilets. There is only one bathroom  for each company of 200 men. There have been about 40 cases of  malaria and about five of cerebral malaria among MK soldiers.  There are "easily" more than 100 cases of venereal disease and  about 50 of TB. Alcohol abuse is a problem, with shebeens  reportedly operating in the camp.    Colonel Burger refused to answer questions from the Sunday  Times, and after threatening to call the Military Police,  ordered us off the property. NPKF commanding officer Gabriel  Ramushwana visited the camp last week and will hold a media  conference on Thursday.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Colombia in transition - Electricity rationing and tax reforms have curtailed an extraordinary run, writes Sarita Kendall After an extraordinary run which peaked at the end of January, the Bogota equity market has dropped into an unsettled period. With electricity rat-ioning to continue until the end of this year, tax reforms going through Congress and the latest economic growth estimate down to 2 per cent, hopes for a resurgence in the second half of the year have been dampened. However, Colombian analysts see the current situation as a transition period  -a breathing space after last year during which the market capitalisation index tripled. The sudden boom was due to a big increase in share prices which had been undervalued for tax reasons and which responded to changes in legislation, combined with government policies to open up the economy and attract foreign investors. There are fewer than 200 companies listed on Colombia's Bogota, Cali and Medellin stock exchanges. Despite recent growth, fixed income instruments dominate and equities make up only 4 per cent of total trading - last year stock trading reached Dollars 250m. Most of the larger registered companies are in banking, textiles, food and cement, with the top 10 accounting for about two-thirds of market capitalisation. With equity prices now at a more realistic level and the first phase of expansion over, the limitations of such a small market have become clearer. Both domestic and foreign investors are drawn by the profitability of the market while restricted by the small range of stock on offer. The financial authorities have already approved more than a dozen foreign investment capital funds, but for the present only a tiny proportion of their potential can be channelled into the exchange. Mr Fernando Arbelaez of the Bogota stock exchange says: 'Now growth depends on new companies coming into the stock market. Some institutional investors are going to be important too.' Under normal circumstances, the liberalisation of the economy would have created demand for funds to finance the modernisation of industry and services. And the stock market would have been the natural place for many companies to turn; but the electricity shortage (caused by a mixture of drought and bad planning) and the resurgence of guerrilla activity have weakened the government, undermining its economic strategy. Not only are companies reluctant to risk new ventures, but the privatisation process, which should give the market a boost, is moving very slowly. A strike by the telephone company trade union gave the government a foretaste of problems to come and led to the downfall of a cabinet minister. The flow of returning capital continues unabated, with international reserves exceeding Dollars 7bn. At the same time, foreign investors, attracted by changing laws, rich resources and what Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, called a 'bright' economic outlook on his recent visit, are looking for opportunities. For the moment, however, the talk of creating a bigger, more diversified stock market has not been translated into action.</p>

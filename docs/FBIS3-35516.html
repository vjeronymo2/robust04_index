			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Private Bill -- The proposal which was approved  at its first hearing yesterday before the Knesset is composed of  three private members' bills: 1) The proposal prepared by Likud  Knesset Member [MK] Dan Tikhon, which is an exact copy of the  government's previous proposal known as the [former Health  Minister Hayim] "Ramon Bill"; 2) The proposal prepared by Labor  MK Yoram Lass, which includes the amendments made with respect  to the linkage and collection of medical insurance dues, as  agreed upon at the Labor party convention; 3) The proposal made  by MK Hayim Oron and MK Ran Kohen, both from the Meretz party,  which permits a unilateral linkage between a labor union and  Kupat Holim [nation wide sick fund and health care system] (the  Histadrut trade union could obligate its members to be insured  at Kupat Holim, but could not force people insured in the sick  fund to become members of the Histadrut), contrasts with the  position adopted at the Labor party convention which permits  bilateral linkage. The system for collecting health tax in this  proposal follows the "Bayga [nickname for Finance Minister  Avraham Shohat] compromise," according to which the National  Insurance Institute will be in charge of tax collection, but  Kupat Holim will be able to collect a "welfare" tax from its  members, which will stand at 0.8 percent of the insured person's  earnings.    Following the Labor party decisions, the two alternative  bills were brought before the joint health committee and Labor  MK 'Amir Peretz decided to renew the legislative process. Labor  MK Yoram Lass' proposal was attached to the two other bills.  Peretz refused to coordinate legislation with the government,  despite knowing that it too was about to reinitiate the process,  and although he was asked to withhold his bill.    Peretz claimed that the government was not entitled to  impose  its will on the Knesset and invited government representatives  to sit in on the committee's legislative proceedings, which, as  earlier mentioned, had noted down the Labor party's position.  The committee went on to consolidate the three proposals into  one bill, which stipulated three options in clauses 4 and 16,  pertaining, as mentioned above, to the issues of linkage and  collection.    The Government's Bill -- this is the earlier bill (the  "Ramon  bill," with amendments to the clauses on linkage and collection,  as decided upon by the Labor party. Last month, the government  pulled back the bill after it was brought before the Knesset for  its second and third hearings, while promising to resubmit it to  the Knesset plenum after the Labor party convention reached a  decision on the controversial clauses. Last week, the  government, with the objection of the Meretz ministers, adopted  the revised version of the bill, and is going to bring it before  the Knesset next week in order to ask for the Knesset's approval  to resubmit it to the health committee, in order "to operate" on  the two above mentioned clauses.    [Minister] Shahal's "trick" -- Moshe Shahal, the minister  liaising between the government and the Knesset, claimed that he  had found a way to neutralize the private bills and restore the  government's bill, which had been pulled back last month, to its  progressive stage in the legislative process (second and third  hearings before the Knesset plenum). According to the plan,  Shahal was supposed to announce to the Knesset that according to  clause 133 in the Knesset regulations, the government wished to  resubmit the bill for a second and third hearing, and after this  request was approved, to ask, according to clause 127 in the  Knesset regulations, to withdraw the bill so that it could be  amended by the health committee. Al these announcements must be  voted on and approved by the Knesset plenum.    That is why Shahal informed the Knesset last week that he  had placed the government's bill before the Knesset. Shahal  believed that using the regulations would enable him to remove  the private members' bills from the agenda, because when dealing  with the same issue, a bill submitted by the government has  priority. However, the government's legal adviser to the Knesset  ruled that this rule applies only when the government's bill is  submitted before the private one. Therefore, there was no  obstacle to presenting the private bill for its first hearing.    Moreover, Shahal and the leaders of the Labor party were  unsuccessful in mustering a Knesset majority to support clause  127. Their fear was that if the plenum approved the request to  return the bill for its second hearing (clause 133), but turn  down the request to return the bill to the committee for  amendments (clause 127), the Knesset could simply continue with  the second and third hearings, and, in the absence of a  majority, it may approve the law in its original form without  the health committee's amendments. That is why Shahal refrained  from submitting his proposal until Prime Minister Rabin returns  from abroad. Rabin is supposed to use his influence on SHAS  [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Meretz in order to canvass a  majority for clause 127. Only after the bill is brought before  the committee will efforts start to guarantee a majority for the  government's position on the actual contents of the bill.    This effort seems impossible today, and senior Labor party  officials are taking into account the possibility of being  forced to accept the "Bayga compromise."    "The Bayga compromise" -- This stipulates, as does the Labor  party proposal, a bilateral linkage between the Histadrut and  Kupat Holim; however, like the "Ramon" proposal it stipulates  that the collection will be carried out through the National  Insurance Institute. Each Kupat Holim organization will  nevertheless be permitted to collect an employee welfare tax  which will total 0.8 percent of the employee's income and to  transfer this tax to the Kupat Holim management.    The compromise prepared by Finance Minister Avraham Shohat  on  the eve of the Labor party convention was rejected by the  Histadrut.</p>

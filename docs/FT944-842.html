			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flotation rather than a sale is sound logic Sir, Lex (Albright &amp; Wilson, December 14) asks why investors should consider paying more for Albright than the business is worth to Tenneco or trade buyers. If Tenneco's parenting of Albright is destroying value (a fairly common situation), the chemical business will be worth more as an independent company than as part of Tenneco. Since speciality chemicals companies mostly perform badly when they are divisions of larger chemical companies, the logic of a flotation rather than a trade sale appears sound.

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Council reform in Scotland attacked Charges of 'gerrymandering' in the reform of local government structure in Scotland were brushed aside by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, in the Commons last night. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs insisted that proposals to replace the existing 53 district councils, nine regional councils and three island councils with 28 single-tier authorities were designed to improve the electoral prospects of the Conservative party. Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, denounced the Local Government (Scotland) bill as 'shabby, politically corrupt and anti-democratic'. He said that it would 'increase the dead weight of bureaucracy'. The 'politically corrupt, wasteful legislation' would be rejected by voters in the local elections this May, he said. Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat spokesman in the debate, said his party was in favour of single-tier authorities but was not prepared to support a bill 'motivated by purely party political reasons'. Mr Lang said MPs and peers would have opportunities to suggest changes to the local authority boundaries proposed by the government during the later stages of the bill's passage through parliament. He accused the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities of burying its head in the sand by adopting an obstructive attitude to the government's proposals.</p>

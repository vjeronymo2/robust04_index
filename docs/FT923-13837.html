			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y wins 5-week extension to debt scheme deadline OLYMPIA &amp; York yesterday gained a five-week extension from an Ontario court to the deadline for filing a plan to restructure the bulk of its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.2bn) debt. The date has been put back from July 13 to August 21. Justice Robert Blair said the company was left without enough time to negotiate a restructuring plan with its lenders because of the number of other issues in dispute in the eight weeks since O&amp;Y and 28 subsidiaries filed for protection from its creditors. Justice Blair ordered O&amp;Y to file a brief report detailing the progress of the restructuring plan on August 6 and a weekly report on the sale of unencumbered assets to fund general, administrative and restructuring costs. The ailing developer also disclosed yesterday that it had abandoned its original strategy of negotiating simultaneously with all its creditors. Instead, it plans to deal first with lenders to 11 specific buildings, followed by other secured lenders and finally unsecured creditors. Mr Steven Sharpe, an O&amp;Y lawyer, said the company expected to present initial proposals next week to the project lenders. When O&amp;Y Developments and 28 Canadian subsidiaries filed for court protection in mid-May, they were ordered to present a restructuring plan by July 13. But this work has been overshadowed for the past two months by other priorities, including the creation of creditor committees, arguments over the distribution of administrative and restructuring expenses, and numerous court applications. According to Mr Sharpe, 'the company has spent time developing litigation rather than negotiating strategy'. The O&amp;Y team, headed by Mr Steve Miller of the US investment bank James D Wolfensohn, has recruited Mr Bill Kennedy, who helped spearhead the restructuring of Campeau Corporation, the Canadian property and retailing group which had a brush with bankruptcy in 1990. O&amp;Y expects to complete its plan by August 21. In another development, creditors are considering appointing an outside adjudicator to decide on the extent to which the Reichmann family, O&amp;Y's owners, should disclose its private wealth. The creditors have expressed frustration at the reticence of O&amp;Y and the Reichmanns to provide a full tally of assets which might be sold to augment the company's cash-flow. A lawyer for Royal Bank of Canada said yesterday that creditors were seeking a mechanism 'which would provide all the information we need with a minimum of fuss and a minimum of intrusion into private affairs'. The dive in property values which has contributed to O&amp;Y's problems was reflected in a deal involving two buildings outside Montreal, in which O&amp;Y has a 20 per cent interest. O&amp;Y and its partners are selling the properties for CDollars 350,000, which is little more than half the mortgage owed on them. OLYMPIA &amp; York (US) Holdings is in technical default on many of its office buildings across the US, an O&amp;Y spokesman in New York said, Reuter reports. 'O&amp;Y US is in technical default on a great many obligations,' the spokesman said, adding that many of the creditors on the properties had agreed to a standstill pact on the buildings. He said O&amp;Y technically defaulted on the 60 Broad Street building in Manhattan, New York, partly owned by a company controlled by Li Ka Shing, the Hong Kong billionaire.</p>

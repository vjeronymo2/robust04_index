			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.22&blank;Institutional Refunds and Repayments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments of 1992 added section 484B to the HEA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an institution to have in place, as of July 23, 1992, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair and equitable institutional refund policy as promulgated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that section. The fair and equitable refund requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed by law are similar to the fair and equitable refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements prescribed by &sect;682.606 of the FFEL program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The HEA extends this requirement to institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in any Title IV, HEA program and makes various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this fair and equitable refund policy, an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must make a refund of unearned tuition, fees, room and board, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other charges to a student who received Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance (including PLUS loans received on behalf of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student) if the student does not register for the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment for which the student was charged or if the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the institution before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing the period of enrollment for which he or she was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interpretation of the applicability of a fair and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equitable refund policy was the subject of extensive discussions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among the negotiators. The HEA specifically mandates a refund to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any student who received Title IV HEA program assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, at issue during the negotiations was the fairness and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity in having a refund policy for students who receive Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA program assistance that is different from the refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy for those students enrolled in the same educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program who do not receive Title IV, HEA program assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several negotiators felt that requiring institutions to apply the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund requirements found in this proposed section to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who attend an institution would be an unauthorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intrusion by the Secretary into the administrative decisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution. Many negotiators felt that compliance with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund requirement that is applicable to all students would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> too costly for an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Secretary proposes to define a fair and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equitable refund policy only with respect to students who receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program assistance. Although the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to limit the scope of this provision to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients, under this proposed provision an institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be prohibited from adopting these refund requirements for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a written statement containing its refund policy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective students and make its policy known to currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled students. This proposal is based upon requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently prescribed by &sect;682.606 of the FFEL program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to expand this FFEL provision to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the written statement must be clear and conspicuous and must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include information on the allocation of refunds and repayments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to sources of aid. In keeping with current FFEL program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, the Secretary proposes that the written statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include examples of the application of the refund policy. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement would be met if the institution informs students in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the written statement that examples are available and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution makes the examples readily available to the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the current FFEL program regulations, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to require an institution to provide the written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement to prospective students. Section 668.41(b) of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations defines a ``prospective student'' as an individual who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has contacted an institution participating in any Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for the purpose of requesting information concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admission to the institution. The Secretary believes that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student is a ``prospective student'' if he or she is not enrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an institution and has not entered into any contractual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement or incurred a financial obligation to attend an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to provide this written statement to a student prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the earlier of the student's enrollment or the execution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student's enrollment agreement. If the institution's refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy changes, the institution would have to ensure that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students are made aware of the new policy and advise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently enrolled students of any changes that the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to apply to those students for their current enrollment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

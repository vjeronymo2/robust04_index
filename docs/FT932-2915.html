			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (17): VW revives fortunes - Vsat services GERMAN car manufacturer Volkswagen has revived the fortunes of a satellite-based business communications technology which was in danger of being suffocated by regulatory obstacles before it had even made its mark in Europe. Volkswagen has awarded a contract to Scientific Atlanta of the US to install the largest internal satellite communications network in Europe. It will eventually connect 6,000 Volkswagen dealers in different countries and is to be used for data communications and business television services. Signals will be received and transmitted via very small aperture terminals (Vsat) dishes developed in the US that are only a fraction of the size and price of the conventional satellite dish. Vsat networks the same size as Volkswagen are commonplace in the US, but in Europe Vsats have been slow to take off. Previously, the largest two-way contract in Europe was a 150-terminal network run by the Italian government's department of social security. There are a number of reasons why Vsats have failed to make their mark in Europe. First, the services that can be transmitted by Vsat can also be delivered by terrestrial data communications networks. State-owned telephone operators across Europe control this business because they supply the private circuits which companies need to build their own private data communications networks. They also operate public data networks. The public operators have been reluctant to unlock the potential of Vsats which are identified with small private service providers who could even threaten their own businesses. The development of Vsat services has largely been driven by private companies. But they have found the way blocked by the PTTs (post, telegraph and telephone companies) who control the sale of satellite capacity - Europe's telephone operators jointly own Eutelsat, the European satellite organisation - and who can resort to a number of tactics to hinder and delay the deployment of networks. The biggest potential for Vsats lies in the installation of pan-European networks for companies with offices in several different countries. It can be technically difficult and immensely time-consuming to piece together a pan-European network using leased lines, so a satellite network, which can be installed in a matter of weeks, provides an attractive alternative. Volkswagen went for a Vsat network because it met the German company's requirement better than terrestrial links, according to Mr Klaus Schultz, Volkswagen's director of communications systems. Availability of leased lines in Europe is poor, he says, and Vsats also give greater flexibility. The company will use Vsats to send information to its dealers and also plans a business television service in the future. Three other leading European car manufacturers have also been pioneers in the deployment of Vsat networks. Renault of France has a two-way data communications Vsat network for its 140 dealers in eastern Germany. The network was installed by Teleport Europe, the leading supplier of Vsat systems in Europe. Daimler Benz has linked 20 of its European subsidiaries on a Vsat network supplied by Deutsche Telekom. And last year, BT won a contract from Ford's UK arm to install a one-way Vsat-based television network for several hundred UK dealers. Car companies are particularly suited to Vsat satellite systems because they have a requirement for point-to-multipoint communications. Their central offices need to send and receive data from many outlying sites where their dealers are based. Campsa, the Spanish chain of petrol stations, is using a Vsat network to route information from its main offices to petrol stations up and down the country. Campsa had to bully Spain's semi state-owned telephone operator Telefonica into installing its network. Telefonica is one of the public operators which have largely ignored the arrival of Vsat systems. But the success of Vsats in the car industry has not been mirrored in other sectors. While the unfavourable regulatory environment and the hostility of the public telephone operators have been crucial factors in the slow take-up for Vsats, there has also been a problem persuading businesses that Vsats provide a reliable and cost-effective alternative to terrestrial networks. 'Service providers are affected by the image of the sector as immature, unstable, risky and under-resourced,' according to report published by the Cambridge-based telecommunications consultancy Analysys earlier this year. It says this perception will change in coming years, but for the moment, 'No service provider has yet had time to establish a track record that could completely reassure the average corporate telecommunications manager.' Many of the service providers are names new to corporate telecommunications managers. Teleport Europe was set up in 1990 specifically to offer Vsat services, while Scientific Atlanta is an established service provider in the US, but has only started to make an impression in Europe in the past year. Pricing Vsat services has been another problem. Few customers will switch from terrestrial solutions to satellite solutions unless there is a cost saving. Service providers are undercutting public telephone operators for large Vsat networks, but offer only small price savings for smaller systems. Volkswagen, therefore, was able to achieve a lower price than if it had opted for a terrestrial network. But this will be the first two-way network with more than 1,000 terminals and most networks only have about 50 terminals. Analysys believes that service providers will have to drop their prices for these smaller networks if they are to develop their businesses. There has always been an expectation that Vsat services will make the same impact in Europe as in the US where leading corporations such as General Motors, Chevron and Chrysler have Vsat networks covering thousands of sites. There are well over 100,000 one-way and two-way Vsat terminals installed in the US, compared to less than 10,000 in Europe. But several industry players now say that comparisons are invalid. In the US, the retailing, distribution and financial sectors have been the big sectors for Vsats. Analysys notes that 'the geographical spread of these services in Europe is much more restricted.' There are, for example, no European equivalents of nationwide US retailers such as K-Mart. Patterns of use may, therefore, develop very differently in Europe, according to Analysys.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: A FLOWERED PATH INTO WEDDED LIFE  </P> <P> Picture it: a lily-and-rose blanketed gazebo perched on a grassy cliff  overlooking a pounding turquoise sea.  </P> <P> Now, picture trumpeters in black tie proclaiming the arrival of a bride so  majestically turned out that wedding guests suck in their breaths. Her white  lace gown glitters with a gold beaded bodice. Her bouquet -- a waterfall of  bridal white roses, lilies of the valley and Casablanca lilies -- sparkles with  more gold beads.  </P> <P> As she inches toward the gazebo, her Cinderella pumps never touch the lawn.  Why? Because, along with gussying up the Ritz-Carlton gazebo and gold-flecking  her bouquet, a florist has stripped 1,000 white roses of their petals to create  a path upon which Peggy O'Neil-Milhous will sweep into wedded life with Charles  Rohrer.  </P> <P> Sound like something out of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"? Perhaps. But  it's business-as-usual for Paul Ecke. His Black Iris in Laguna Beach is Orange  County's hottest hothouse.  </P> <P> Just last week, Ecke created the floral arrangements that graced the oval table  upon which four U.S. Presidents did lunch at the Nixon library. When President  Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald R. Ford, and Richard M. Nixon and their wives sank  their teeth into Dover sole with lemon butter sauce, they did so beside three  Ecke bouquets: first, the centerpiece, a spray of yellow roses -- a favorite of  Pat Nixon's -- interspersed with Sterling Silver roses, Queen Anne's lace and  freesia; and then, two smaller satellite bouquets, floral bookends for the main  masterpiece. Ecke also did the library's entry bouquet. And, he provided the  white orchids that glamorized the facility's four guest bathrooms.  </P> <P> Also last week, Ecke created the birthday bouquet sent to Harriet Nelson by her  son, David. It was a spring basket loaded with flowers -- lilies, roses,  tulips, freesias -- and one perfect gardenia, he says. "David's bouquets to his  mother always include one gardenia."  </P> <P> Ecke also dreams up arrangements for Laguna Beach resident Bette Midler. "She  likes them stylized, but not too far out," Ecke says. Ditto O.J. Simpson.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Taylor likes them romantic. Ecke did arrangements for La Liz when she  vacationed last year at the Ritz-Carlton.  </P> <P> Then there are developer-clients like Donald Bren, Donald Koll, David Stein,  Barry Brief, and Jim and Al Baldwin. And, on occasion, William Lyon. Ecke has  also done the popular Orangewood Ball for Kathryn Thompson. Not to mention the  Christmas wreaths that Nixon sends to his good friends, developer Donald  Bendetti and his wife, Dorothy.  </P> <P> Or the posies that regularly spruce up the waterfront manse of Western Digital  chairman Roger Johnson and his wife, Janice.  </P> <P> There is also the Dallas mega-millionaire whose name Ecke doesn't want to see  in print. (The prominent Texan's daughter will marry in Orange County this  fall. Rumors are flying that the Bushes may attend.)  </P> <P> In a monetary way, things haven't always come up roses for Ecke, a high-energy  guy who disarms you with his Colgate smile.  </P> <P> In 1979, he was an art director for schools in the Irvine and Anaheim areas. He  loved his job. But there were those "summers off," as he calls them.  </P> <P> He needed odd jobs to make ends meet. "I did some abstract painting," he says.  "But it wasn't enough." When a fellow faculty member asked him to create  something special, decorate a table for a party at one of the schools -- "Come  on, you're an artist -- you do great bulletin boards!" he told Ecke -- Ecke  decided to give it a try. And he ended up doing several more. "I created a look  women liked. Then I began doing parties, weddings, benefits. Things really took  off."  </P> <P> Ecke's floral "look" came at a time when hostesses and brides were getting  burned out on traditional arrangements, he says. "They were tired of the same  old carnations, roses and mums." So he gave them drama -- exotic concoctions  using ginger, anthurium, orchids and angular foliage.  </P> <P> Now, Ecke specializes in the tropical and the traditional. For the recent  Milhous-Rohrer nuptials, Ecke not only flooded the gazebo with flowers and  topiary trees, he surrounded the towering wedding cake -- embellished with  edible 24-karat gold -- with 14 marbleized pillars topped with explosions of  white blooms. He also provided the white liquid-silk coverlets that camouflaged  every ballroom and garden chair.  </P> <P> The occasion's centerpieces stood atop three-foot acrylic pedestals. "The  magnitude of the flowers for that wedding just blew my mind," Ecke says. (Ecke  used a grammar school room to accommodate the blooms he ordered for Peggy  Milhous. His shop wasn't big enough.) "It was absolutely the most elegant  wedding I have ever seen," he says.  </P> <P> For Orange County's ultimate power lunch Thursday at the Nixon library, the  trick was to have the roses opened "just enough" when the Presidents sat down  to dine, Ecke says. "We made the arrangement on Tuesday to get it to the  library on Wednesday because security was so tight we couldn't go into the  library on Thursday," he says, catching his breath.  </P> <P> "We took the flowers out of the cooler for eight hours to start them opening.  Then we put them back to stop them from opening. At the library, they were kept  in an air-conditioned room until lunch so they would be absolutely perfect."  </P> <P> They were. Now that's flower power.  </P></p>

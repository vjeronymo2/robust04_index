Bondarenko, A.A. Reznichenko (deceased), </F> and A.A. Usachev, Dagestan Polytechnic Institute; UDC  620.172.3:669.295.5]    [Abstract] Pipes made of the titanium alloy PT-7M (titanium  plus 1.8-2.5 percent Al, 2-3 percent Zr, and 0.1 percent C) with  a diameter of 13 mm and wall thickness of 1.5 mm were subjected  to fatigue tests under a variable-sign load in a fixed plane on  resonance-type units with electromagnetic excitation of  vibrations. During the testing each pipe was bent like a beam on  two supports under the effect of a running inertial load,  inertia forces, and inertial moments of additional weights  attached on its brackets. The span of each test pipe segment  measured 520 mm, and the gradient of the bending moment on the  section of likely fracture (about one-fourth of the span) did  not exceed 0.1 percent/mm of the bending moment in the  midsection. A loading frequency of 100 Hz, a symmetrical cycle  with a constant deformation amplitude, and a test base of  10[.sup]8[/] cycles were used. The error in measuring the  deformation amplitudes did not exceed +/-5 percent, and the  temperature regimen conformed to the requirements stipulated in  state standard GOST 25.502-79. Fifteen series of 15 specimens  were tested. The titanium alloy's notch sensitivity was found to  increase somewhat as the temperature increased. At T = 20C,  the effective notch-sensitivity index concentration  K[.sub]eff[/] equaled 2.53 versus 3.13 and 2.77 at T = 250  and 350C, respectively. An average value of  K[.sub]eff[/] = 2.81 was assumed. (The maximum value of the  theoretical notch-sensitivity for a stretched wafer of linearly  elastic material is K[.sub]eff[/] = 3.) As the temperature  was increased, the titanium alloy pipes' ``sensitivity'' to  absorption of hydrogen (relative decrease in _s_[.sub]-1[/]  as the hydrogen content increases) decreased. It was suggested  that the test results summarized in table form be used to  estimate the lifetime of equipment containing pipes made of  PT-7M titanium alloy by hypothesizing the linear summation of  instances of fatigue.

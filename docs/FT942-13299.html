			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Trial of ex-BCCI official to open The trial of Mr Imran Imam, a former senior official with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, starts today at the Old Bailey. Mr Imam is charged with six offences including two of conspiring to conceal documents, three of furnishing false information and one of conspiring to falsify records. He denies all the charges. His prosecution is the last of four to be brought by the Serious Fraud Office after its investigation into the bank. The jury was selected yesterday and will be sworn in today. The trial is expected to last two to three months. Meanwhile, the trial of Mr Nazmu Virani, former head of Control Securities, the property and leisure group, is nearing its close. The judge is expected to send the jury out to consider its verdict tomorrow. The prosecution alleges Mr Virani helped BCCI carry out its fraud by signing false audit confirmation returns which enabled the bank to overstate its profits by about Pounds 20m. Mr Virani, who did not give evidence in his defence, denies 11 counts of furnish-ing false information, one of theft and one of false accounting.</p>

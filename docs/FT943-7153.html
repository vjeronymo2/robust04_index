			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Arafat extends grip over West Bank: Accord will give Palestinians control of five services Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last night initialled an agreement in Cairo to extend Palestinian powers across the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Under the agreement, known as early empowerment, Palestinians will assume authority over the five West Bank services of tourism, health, social welfare, direct taxation and education for up to 1m people. The Israeli military-run Civil Administration will control all other government functions until after Palestinian elections, due in December. The handover gives Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, his first formal foothold in the heart of the still occupied West Bank. The PLO had pressed Israel for a speedy extension of powers over the West Bank, saying it was vital to maintain the peace momentum and shore up fragile Palestinian support for Mr Arafat's concessions to Israel in negotiations since last August. With early empowerment under way, Mr Arafat will be better placed to fend off critics who said he would end up as mayor of a desert strip and Israel would drive a wedge between Gaza and the West Bank. Talks can now begin about the much more difficult third stage of the process: redeployment of Israeli troops out of Palestinian population centres in the West Bank and the holding of the Palestinian elections. Education will be the first significant service handed over to Palestinian administration. Israel has said it will complete the full transfer to Palestinian control by the start of the school year on September 1. The Civil Administration yesterday handed authority to Palestinians over 150 government-run schools, educational institutions and offices of the education department in the Ramallah area. Mr Naim Abu al-Humos, Palestinian director-general of education, said the West Bank's six remaining school districts would be transferred by August 29, including buildings, supplies and textbooks at present owned by the Civil Administration. The success of the handover will determine the pace of peace talks and depend largely on the PLO's ability to fund services. Already, the cash-strapped Palestinian National Authority is struggling to administer for the 850,000 residents of Gaza-Jericho. Tax collection is almost non-existent and the PNA treasury largely depends on the slow drip of international aid and the transfer of Customs duties collected by Israel on Palestinian imports, so far worth Shk13.5m (Pounds 2.8m). Israel has voiced concern about the PNA's ability to fund West Bank services amid predictions that revenue collections, particularly of income tax, which yielded Shk143m last year, would fall far short of the money collected by Israel during its occupation. The PNA treasury will be deprived of West Bank Customs revenues until after the elections. Israel and the PLO will make a joint approach to international donors to seek allocation of a contingency fund worth Dollars 9.5m (Pounds 6.3m) a month for six months. The extra money comes on top of Dollars 13m a month the PNA can draw from a special fund for the running expenses of its administration in Gaza-Jericho. Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, claimed yesterday the World Bank had made a serious error of judgment by not infusing emergency funds quickly into the self-rule areas; he warned that economic problems and high expectations would lead to unrest.</p>

The year 1993 was a difficult one. We felt the full effects  of the worldwide economic recession. Many jobs were lost. No  one should remain indifferent when fellow citizens lose their  jobs. I am also thinking in particular here of the  psychological distress of those concerned and of their families.  Many feel that they are no longer needed. That is not the  case. We are all dependent on one another. It is our joint  responsibility to secure existing jobs and create new ones.    Reports show our economy improved again toward the end of  this year. Things are also gradually getting better in our most  important partner countries in Europe and in America. The  important thing now is to decisively exploit these favorable  prospects to improve employment in Germany. We must preserve  jobs throughout Germany and create new jobs. That is and  remains my most important aim, and this aim is achievable if we  all work together -- employers and employees, trade unions and  employers' associations, the state and the parties.    However, overcoming the recession is insufficient in itself.  With a view to the future, we must also simultaneously  strengthen Germany as a business and investment location. The  German economy has not worsened, but we all have to adapt to the  fact that our competitors in the world have in the meantime  improved and are more numerous than before. We have already  made a number of important and also some unpopular decisions in  1993 to secure our future. Reductions in personal assets were  unavoidable in this process; demands often had to be restrained.  Only in this way can we permanently preserve the basis of our  social security.    We have again made good progress on the path toward internal  German unity. Growth was really strong in the states of former  East Germany. Many people's personal situation has improved.  Unfortunately, existing jobs are still being lost, but  increasingly we are succeeding in replacing them with new  competitive jobs.    Particularly in difficult times it is important to stand  together. I know how much good will, how much public spirit,  and how much willingness to help there is in Germany. Every day  millions of people simply carry out their duties -- at work, at  home with their families, and as voluntary workers at social  establishments. I would like to thank them all most, most  warmly.    Hard work and public spirit are the basis for our country's  wealth. Having confidence in oneself, being there for others,  raising children, sharing with others -- these are the real  sources of happiness. In this understanding of ourselves we  will also complete the unity of our fatherland. Walls of  indifference have to be removed in this process. This task can  be carried out every single day. This is also true of the  relationship between old and young. Elderly people deserve  respect and affection. They have the right to recognition for  their life achievements. We are now harvesting what they sowed.  Therefore, it goes without saying for me that pensions cannot  be touched and that pensions in the former East Germany must be  brought up to the Western standard without delay.    The youth is our future. In 1993 we again succeeded through  common effort in providing enough places for education and  training. We can all be happy about this success, and I thank  all those who contributed. I am proud of our young generation.  They are open-minded and cosmopolitan. They want to learn in  order to achieve something later. They are prepared to take on  responsibility in the economy, society, and the state.    We are influenced by the developments and events in our  neighborhood more than most other people in Europe. For 48  years we, the Germans, have been fortunate enough to be able to  live in peace. Hardly any generation before us was granted  this. Peace and stability are not available for free. They  must be secured again and again. Therefore, we must press ahead  with European unification and continue to develop our alliance  with the United States. European unification and friendship with  the United States will guarantee us peace and freedom in the  future as well.    We are all worried by the wars and bloody conflicts in the  east of our continent, particularly in the former Yugoslavia.  Only in a strong European Union can we effectively help to  solve these problems. The Maastricht Treaty gives us new  opportunities to do this.    Europe is a fundamental basis for growth, employment, and  economic stability. Not least, this benefits the Germans.  Every third job here depends on exports, particularly exports  to our neighboring European countries.    Dear fellow citizens, we will also face difficult tasks in  1994.    The discussion about the correct path for our country is  good, and it is necessary. Despite all our differences we  should, however, be fair in our dealings with one another, show  respect and understanding for one another, and have patience  with each other. The fight against hostility to foreigners and  extremism must unite us all. Right- and left-wing extremism are  a disgrace to our country!    Despite all our troubles we should gratefully acknowledge  that we have it better than most of the peoples in Europe and  other continents. However, securing our future requires us to  tighten our belts further. I know more and more people are  realizing this is necessary. The tasks we have ahead of us can  be solved. What we need are courage, realism, energy, and  confidence.    I wish you all a good new year. May God protect our German  fatherland."</p>

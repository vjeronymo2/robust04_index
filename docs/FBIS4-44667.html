			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "European Remote-Sensing </F> Alliance"]    [Text] Four national companies specializing in agricultural  remote sensing have jointly created Eurofast, the first GEIE  (European economic interest group). The four companies are:  France's Sotema (Agricultural Remote-Sensing Company), Germany's  GAF [expansion not provided](Gesellschaft fur Angewandte  Fernerkundung), Great Britain's NRSC (National Remote Sensing  Centre), and Italy's Telespazio, a subsidiary of the IRI-STET  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction-Turin Telephone Finance  Company] group. The Eurofast GEIE will specialize in  agricultural and forestry applications of satellite imaging.    "The creation of Eurofast demonstrates the intent of the  Europeans to organize as a high-performance remote-sensing  structure, with sights set on occupying center stage in a  high-technology sector of the future," said Jean-Claude Cazaux,  general manager of Sotema, in his 24 January announcement of the  forming of the new group.    Eurofast ("Forestry and Agriculture with Satellite  Technologies") is expected to improve European potentials for  assisting various parts of the world in dealing with problems of  land-use inventories, estimates of agricultural and forestry  areas, forecasting of harvests, etc. The group will also be able  to develop its activity in related domains such as the  environment, and the study or measurement of the impact that  large-scale projects may have on natural resources. It is thus  expected to "open up new possibilities for developing  operational tools for use by rural land administrators, land-use  planners, and agricultural and forestry policy makers," says  Sotema.    Actually, the four firms are already jointly providing  satellite remote-sensing services to the European Community,  particularly under the European MARS pilot project on the use of  remote sensing for the development of agricultural statistics.</p>

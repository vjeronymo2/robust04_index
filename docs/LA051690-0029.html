			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: GETTING A CLUE ON WHEN TO BUY AND WHEN TO BAIL OUT  </P> <P> An old line that never loses its relevance: The only thing tougher than knowing  when to buy a stock is knowing when to sell it.  </P> <P> With the Dow Jones industrial average at record highs, it may be more fun to  think about jumping in than jumping out. But any investor with paper gains  ought to take the Dow's surge as an opportunity to do a quick portfolio review.  Maybe it's time to do a little pruning.  </P> <P> A lot of investors are jittery about what's next, all right. Walter Haddad, a  veteran broker at Paine Webber Inc. in downtown Los Angeles, says he's getting  plenty of calls from clients with one basic question: "They want to know if the  fun is over."  </P> <P> Unless you're convinced that another crash is imminent, selling everything  makes no sense. Rather, the decision has to be made stock by stock.  </P> <P> First, consider the basics. Any capital gain will be taxed at the same rate as  ordinary income. So you'll be giving Uncle Sam a 28% to 33% cut, and many  states take a cut, too. But while taxes are a consideration, that alone never  should stop you from selling, experts say.  </P> <P> Another basic question is, what will you do with your profits? Don't sell until  you've decided where the money will go, whether that's another stock or a  short-term parking place.  </P> <P> After covering those bases, how do you pick out stocks worth selling? Some  strategies:  </P> <P> * Tom Anderson, a Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. broker in downtown Los Angeles who  has been in the business for 31 years, is guided by one of the most trustworthy  of all yardsticks: a stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), or price divided by  most recent four quarters' earnings per share.  </P> <P> "When a stock is selling for 20 to 21 times earnings, or a higher multiple than  it has sold for in a long time, that's often the time to get out," he said.  Pepsico Inc., for example, closed at $68.75 Tuesday. It's up 7% year to date,  after a 62% rise in 1989, and now sells for 20 times earnings. That's been the  ceiling on the P/E since 1980, and Anderson takes that as a sell signal.  </P> <P> That doesn't mean Pepsico won't do well over the long term, he notes. If  earnings keep rising, the stock will, too -- over time. But this latest surge  looks spent to him, or at the very least it has raised the risk level. So it's  time to take profits.  </P> <P> * Has the stock had a "climax run" -- a rapid, exponential rise? Morgan White,  principal at Woodside Capital Management in Menlo Park, says such runs often  are great sell signals.  </P> <P> That may appear to fly in the face of a long-held market maxim, which is that  you cut your losses if a stock drops 7% to 15% from where you bought it, but  that you let your profits run. However, White notes that "no stock goes up  forever," and after a dramatic rise, selling some is an insurance policy.  </P> <P> Look at software firm Adobe Systems. It has risen to $46.50 now from $20.25 on  Jan. 1. The greed-monger in you might say, "Wait for more!" But after a stock  doubles, as a general rule you might want to sell half the stake, White said.  </P> <P> * If your paper gain on a stock is, say, 15% to 20%, you face a tougher sell  decision. Many investors feel that kind of return is all they need to justify  bailing out. Some brokers disagree. "People are eager to take a small profit,"  said Paine Webber's Haddad. "But you're going to make as many mistakes that way  as selling at a loss."  </P> <P> Take another look at the company's fundamentals, Haddad advises, and remind  yourself why you bought the stock in the first place. If the firm's earnings  outlook has improved dramatically over the past year, "the stock can be cheaper  at $40 than it was at $20," he said.  </P> <P> But above all, Haddad said, the decision to sell should be based on your  "comfort" level: If you can't sleep at night because you fear your paper gains  could disappear, then sell some of your shares -- even if it's just a portion  of each holding. You'll feel better, you'll have new capital to put to work  elsewhere, and yet you'll retain the bulk of your long-term commitment to the  stocks.  </P> <P> Have money funds peaked?Even before the stock market reawakened with a bang  last Friday, individual investors were pointing the way: They've been pulling  cash out of money-market mutual funds since late March in favor of stock funds  and other longer-term investments.  </P> <P> The unanswered question is, how much of the $383 billion that's still in money  funds will flow to stocks? The evidence so far in May suggests that investors'  appetite for stock funds remains strong but that long-term bond funds also are  garnering a lot of cash once again.  </P> <P> What's interesting is that investors aren't fleeing money funds because fund  yields are plunging. The average fund yield has been steady in the 7.6% to 7.7%  range all year, notes Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of IBC/Donoghue's weekly  money fund letter. The latest figure is 7.66%.  </P> <P> Instead, investors must simply see better potential in stocks and other ideas.  And perhaps not surprisingly, the investors who are most actively shifting  money around are those who have brokers to prod them.  </P> <P> Money funds sponsored by brokerages have accounted for the bulk of the drop in  assets so far: The broker fund category has fallen to $160 billion in assets  now from $167 billion in late March. In contrast, assets of general purpose  money funds, often used by independent investors, have fallen only slightly, to  $132.2 billion from $133.4 billion.  </P> <P> Some of the decline in money fund assets has been seasonal, as investors pay  tax bills. Even so, fund companies say there's no question that a shift to  longer-term investing has begun.  </P> <P> "We've seen a definite turnaround in May -- investors moving into stock funds  and long-term municipal bond funds," said Greg Johnson, vice president for  marketing at Franklin Group mutual funds in San Mateo.  </P> <P> At fund giant T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, spokesman Steve Norwitz  said stock fund sales are leading the wave. "Stock fund sales have exceeded  bond fund sales every month since December," he said. "That hasn't happened  since 1986."  </P> <P> Investors also are moving out of tax-free municipal money funds and into  longer-term municipal bond funds, Norwitz said. That's occurring even though  average yields on tax-free money funds have risen to 5.5% from 5.2% since late  January, while long-term interest rates have been falling since late April.  Investors obviously have one viewpoint here: It's time to lock in long-term  yields before they go even lower.  </P> <P> Martin Gawne, spokesman at Kemper Group mutual funds in Chicago, said money  flows into the firm's U.S. Government bond fund were strong last week. That  fund's yield now is 9.19%. Second most popular bond fund at Kemper: the  Municipal Bond fund, yielding 6.87% tax free -- equivalent to a 10.25% taxable  yield in the 33% tax bracket.  </P> <P> Briefly: Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden is in Los  Angeles this week. He addresses the World Affairs Council on Friday at the Los  Angeles Hilton. . . . William O'Neil, long-time market pro and publisher of  L.A.-based Investor's Daily, issued a super-bullish stock market forecast on  Tuesday, predicting the broad market will rise 25% over the next 12 months.  </P> <P> THE MONEY FUND DRAIN  </P> <P> After peaking at $392 billion in late March, money market mutual fund assets  have fallen sharply.  </P></p>

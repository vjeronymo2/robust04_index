			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chorus of disbelief greets Mexican oil reserves claim - Industry experts agree the official figure is twice as high as it should be PEMEX, MEXICO'S giant oil monopoly, is no stranger to criticism. But rarely can it have been as hard to take as when the company's former vice-president for exploration and production accused the company late last year of 'perfectly consciously' lying about it reserves, recording them at above double actual levels. Mr Francisco Inguanzo, who had been vice-president of Pemex's exploration and production from 1964 to 1976, claimed in an interview with the news magazine Proceso to have been commissioned in 1988 by the director of Pemex to write a report on Mexico's reserves. After eight-month of study he put Mexico's reserves at just 33.1bn barrels, subsequently reduced to 29.9bn barrels for December 1991, compared with the official estimate of current reserves of 65.5bn barrels. Mr Inguanzo's findings, while denied strenuously by Pemex, are supported by almost all other independent studies. As is shown in the accompanying table, drawn up by Mr George Baker of the University of California, Los Angeles, all but one study reckons Pemex's crude reserves are between 20bn and 30bn barrels. Pemex's figure of 65.5bn barrels includes the crude equivalent of natural gas and condensates reserves. The figure that appears to support Pemex, by the US Geological Survey refers to 'identified reserves'. This includes undiscovered reserves - which are not proven. The differences between the Pemex estimates and all the others depend in part on the classification of the huge Chicontepec field. According to official Pemex figures, the field holds 10.9bn barrels of crude oil and 6.7bn of oil equilavent, or 25 per cent of proven reserves. Pemex is not producing oil from this area, never has, and has no plans to do so in the future - and thus, according to Dr Charles Masters of the Geological Survey, Chicontepec should not count it as a proven reserve under internationally accepted standards. Pemex says it is sufficient that Chicontepec could in theory be profitably exploited. But even this is by no means certain. According to those questioned it is extremely doubtful. Mr Inguanzo, said that if Mexico was an honest country even the most unqualified engineer in Pemex would conclude that the figures for Chicontepec were 'ridiculous'. Mr Joseph Riva, a geologist at the Congressional Research Service in the US says: 'Chicontepec may never make economic sense', because the field is not uniform, and thus would require 20,000 small wells to extract all the oil. Dr Masters, who after much heart-searching finally included Chicontepec as an identifiable reserve last year, said: 'I have always had the idea that Chicontepec never is going to be used. It is not a proven researve by any means at all'. The field, he says, is 'very irregular' and 'will be a very difficult thing to produce'. The Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company, in a study commissioned by the US Department of Energy in 1990 concluded that 'the 11 per cent recovery factor used by Pemex (for Chicontepec) far exceeds the established practice for that kind of geology', and assumes a recovery factor of just 5 per cent. The difference between Pemex and independent experts does not just depend on interpreting Chicontepec. Mr Inguanzo's estimate for Pemex's oil and equivalent is a full 35.6bn barrels less than the company's, and only half the difference can be explained by Chicontepec's exclusion. Mr Inguanzo is not specific about where the other differences lie and in a detailed analysis of the Proceso interview, Mr Baker concludes that Mr Inguanzo may be referring to reserves that are supported by current production, rather than future production. Still, there is agreement among those interviewed that the number of wildcats made by Pemex in the late 1970s is not consistent with the huge increase in reserves at this time. Mexico's reserves figure jumped from 16bn in December 1976 to 72.5 bn in 1982. Mr Riva, who puts Pemex's crude reserves at 26.4bn barrels, concurs. 'I was always giving Pemex the benefit of the doubt,' he says. 'If this engineer (Mr Inguanzo) says 21bn barrels, I believe him'. Furthermore, Mr Inguanzo claims that subsequent excessive drilling has lead to a loss of water pressure in many wells, and damaged productivity. The Petroleum Finance Corporation says independent estimates of reserves in the off-shore Campeche zone are lower than Pemex's because of a sharp pressure drop in wells occasioned by a lack of water injection in drilling. None of these engineers or geologists deny that Mexico is rich in oil. Pemex's daily production is 2.7m barrels a day, or about 1bn barrels a year. It is thus, by the worse estimate of its reserves, operating at a production to reserves ratio of 21 to 1, double that of the US. Further there is a general consensus that much more oil lies undiscovered - another 35bn to 40bn barrels, Mr Riva believes. Mr Bernie Picci, an oil analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York says 'vast areas of Mexico have not been touched which are thought by statistical extrapolation to have large amounts of oil'. But bringing these undiscovered reserves to the surface is going to require money (and in the deep sea areas expertise) that Pemex does not have. As it is, Pemex will probably have to spend at least Dollars 2bn a year to maintain exports at current levels of 1.3m barrels a day. (Production is split equally between exports and domestic use. But with domestic demand increasing by 10 per cent a year, Mexico will become a net importer in 7 years unless production rises). Strapped for cash, and with reserves falling, the Mexican government will find it increasingly tempting to drop the constitutional ban on foreign companies wild-catting for oil. Mr Inguanzo's revelations, by showing that Mexico is not as rich in oil as many Mexicans thought, may hasten that day.  ------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATES FOR PEMEX RESERVES (billion barrels)  -------------------------------------------------------              Crude             Total                oil         petroleum                        equivalent(a)  ------------------------------------------------------- Pemex         44.6          65.5 USGS(b)       44.9         (66.2) Riva          26.4         (41.7) Inguanzo     (20.9)         29.9 Baker         22.9          38.1 PFC           32.5  ------------------------------------------------------- Sources: George Baker and Mexican Policy News.  ------------------------------------------------------- (a) At Pemex conversion rate, which is more favourable than the standard US rate.

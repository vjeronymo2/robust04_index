			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION  </P> <P> Why doesn't someone point out to the television directors what a disservice  they do to their audiences when they shoot dance numbers from the side? After  all, if one was present for the live performance and could only see the dance  from the side, that would be considered a bad seat.  </P> <P> Judy Steinberg, Encino  </P></p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Index-linked One might have expected index-linked gilts to perform well after a devaluation. And so they have, with a rally that matches the performance of equities. Long dated index-linked bonds offered an unprecedented real return of 4.75 per cent on the morning sterling left the ERM. A correction of this riskless rate was overdue. Ditching the D-Mark parity is, after all, a policy aimed at reducing real interest rates. But the fall in index-linked yields stands in contrast to the apparent equanimity with which holders of conventional long-dated gilts have viewed events. The message from the former is that the market is anticipating a sharp fall in real interest rates, from the latter that there is to be no substantial rise in long-term nominal rates. The anomaly is all the more puzzling since the difference between conventional bond yields and index-linked yields - a measure of the market's inflationary expectations - has widened. From almost 4 per cent immediately before ERM exit, the yield differential reached 5 per cent by the end of this week. Arithmetic dictates that conventional gilt yields will simply have to rise next year if the differential is to return to the levels seen before sterling was hitched to the D-Mark in 1990. By raising over Pounds 1bn from sales of index-linked paper last week the government was quick to spot the funding opportunity. Even so, the sector may continue to lack liquidity. Index-linked bonds have certain tax advantages for UK retail investors. Overseas investors gain no protection from the ravages of inflation as expressed through the exchange rate.</p>

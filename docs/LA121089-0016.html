			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> BLACK MAGIC: Christmas is a time of tradition, even in heavy-metal circles. So  we were cheered to see that headbanger-faves Anthrax is reviving a tradition of  their own -- returning to their Brooklyn club roots this weekend to play under  the assumed name of Satan's Lounge Band. (Tipper Gore, please relax -- it's a  reference to an old Bill Murray "Saturday Night Live" routine, not a satanic  endorsement.) The shows, scheduled for Friday and Saturday, will take place at  Brooklyn's L'Amour club. . . . Meanwhile, Aerosmith just opened its U.S. tour  in Charleston, W.Va., with L.A. dates due sometime early in 1990. (When the  band played London's Hammersmith Odeon recently, it was joined by Whitesnake's  David Coverdale, who hopped on stage and crooned "I'm Down" with the group.) .  . . Blues fans take note: Roomful of Blues will be in town tonight at the  Palomino Club. . . . And if you're staying home, you can hear blues concerts  every Tuesday on "Bluesstage," which airs from 11 p.m. to midnight on KPCC-FM  (89.3). This week the show features performances by pianists Charles Brown and  Dr. John, while the Dec. 19 show offers Guitar Slim and Son Seals.  </P></p>

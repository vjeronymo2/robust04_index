			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Russia policy is vital: EU entry alone can guarantee eastern Europeans' independence It is hard to imagine how the 12 governments of the European Union could have wasted so much political energy over four miserable votes in the Council of Ministers. This is supposed to be a Union of like-minded European countries with common interests. Don't they realise the issue they should be worrying about is developing a coherent policy towards Russia and its former satellites? Apparently not. Russia is the really big issue facing western Europe, and it demands a European strategy. But Europeans are doing what they have done for 50 years: hoping the Americans will take care of it. Unfortunately, US policy towards Russia and its neighbours veers erratically from one simple-minded nostrum to another. Not long ago, US policy was committed wholly to friendship with Russia, to the neglect of its former satellites. The peace of the world would hang on the reform of Russia at home and its stability abroad - so that was where the US should invest its energies. Since the Russian elections last December, the wishful thinking behind this policy has become apparent. Russian nationalists are on the rampage; leading economic reformers have been forced out of government; and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the previously pro-western foreign minister, has started echoing the new rhetoric of nationalism. In recent days there have been two rumours of coups threatening the Yeltsin regime. Now the balance of the argument in Washington has swung right round: the idealists and the advocates of friendship with Russia are under sharp attack from the realists and the advocates of containment. Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former US national security adviser, has derided the pro-Russian policy as 'romantic', and has called on Washington to support Ukraine's independence, so as to prevent a resurgence of Russian imperialism. Under assault for his Russia-first policy, President Clinton has started paying more attention to Russia's neighbours, beginning with invitations to the leaders of Ukraine, Georgia and Kazakhstan. This US antithesis between friendship and containment is too one-dimensional to be much help in framing policy. In fact, it may not much matter what America's policy is, because the US cannot really have much influence on events in the east. Containment is not a real option, because neither Congress nor the White House would be prepared to pay for it. American cold war geo-strategists may imagine they can again contain the Soviet threat, but they are playing anachronistic power games. It is absurd to ask whether Russia is a friend or an enemy; the Russians themselves may not know what they are because they are at the epicentre of a vortex, an earthquake, a field of force. But unless or until it breaks up into a collection of tiny bits, Russia will be an enormous geopolitical mass exerting enormous gravitational force on its surroundings. Any piffling Western attempt to deny, merely by force of moral indignation, this Russian sphere of influence is doomed pitifully to fail. We do not like the way Moscow destabilised 'independent' Georgia and Belarus back into the Russian orbit; but did we do anything about it? No. Will we do anything to protect the independence of Ukraine? No. Or the Baltic states? Be serious. It may prove impossible to challenge Russia inside the borders of the former Soviet Union at an acceptable risk to our interests. The only place we can hope to counteract the gravitational pull of Russia is in eastern Europe; and the only way we can do it is to extend our own sphere of influence. In practice, the Russians may not want to take back their eastern European empire piecemeal. But if we want to prevent the danger, we must extend our western empire into the east. The 'we' in this context is western Europe, it is not America, and it is not Nato. The US has already made clear it will not extend its security guarantee beyond the existing borders of western Europe. So if we want to guarantee the independence of the eastern Europeans, we can only do it by bringing them into the European Union. Ah, you will say, but we are already committed to the principle of admitting them: the 12 said so at their Copenhagen summit last June. Any day now the Poles and the Hungarians will deliver formal requests for membership. And the German government has said it will be pressing hard to open up the Union to the east Europeans, starting during its presidency of the Council in the second half of this year. But this extension eastwards cannot be politically neutral. The expansion of the European Union may be less threatening to the Russians than the expansion of Nato. But it is still a challenge to the Russian sphere of influence through an expansion of the western sphere of influence; and it will require the mustering of a European foreign policy towards Russia and its neighbours, not as an episodic, optional, rhetorical extra, as in the Maastricht treaty, but as an unavoidable, operational, federal necessity. The voting argument has distracted attention from the more important fact, that we are moving into a qualitatively new phase in the integration of Europe. Enlargement to the east means that we shall have come to the end of the step-by-step process launched by Jean Monnet. Instead, the member states will have explicitly to commit themselves to the principle and the practice of a truly European foreign policy; they will, for the first time, have to define the final state of the European Union; and they will have to rethink its constitutional arrangements from the ground up.</p>

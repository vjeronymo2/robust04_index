			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN DROWNS, BROTHER IS SWEPT TO SEA ON OUTING AT BLACK'S BEACH  </P> <P> A relaxing afternoon at Black's Beach in La Jolla turned deadly for a group of  friends Thursday when one member of the party drowned and his brother was swept  out to sea by powerful riptides.  </P> <P> Florentino Pineda Bonilla, 19, was pronounced dead at Scripps Memorial Hospital  in La Jolla at 3:50 p.m. after efforts to resuscitate him failed. His  25-year-old brother, Jose Guadalupe Bonilla, was listed as missing Thursday  night after a fruitless search by lifeguard boats and a helicopter.  </P> <P> The Bonilla brothers, who had been staying in San Diego, lived in the Mexican  state of Oaxaca and had limited swimming skills, their friends told  authorities.  </P> <P> Deputy Coroner Cal Vine said the two men were wading in waist-deep water about  2 p.m. when they apparently stepped in a hole and lost their footing. Friends  spotted Florentino in the rough surf and pulled him onto the sand, where a  passer-by identified as Chris Andrews performed CPR, lifeguards said.  </P> <P> Another beachgoer, meanwhile, climbed the rocky cliffs overlooking Black's  Beach to summon help, and lifeguards from the La Jolla Shores station arrived  on the scene just before 3 p.m., according to supervising lifeguard Lt. Brant  Bass.  </P> <P> Florentino was taken by Life Flight helicopter to Scripps, where he was  declared dead 20 minutes later.  </P> <P> Searchers on a U. S. Coast Guard helicopter and two boats from the lifeguard  headquarters in Mission Bay failed to turn up any sign of Jose Guadalupe. Their  hunt was called off about 4 p.m. and will not resume today.  </P> <P> Lifeguards said the brothers had been wading on a state-owned stretch of the  popular beach below the Torrey Pines Glider Port.  </P> <P> "It's safe to assume these individuals . . . were non-swimmers," lifeguard Matt  Rowland said.  </P></p>

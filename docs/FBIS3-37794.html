			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations February 22 TASS -- Russia has urged  the United States and the European Union "to exert the necessary  influence" on Bosnian Muslims in order to avoid any possible  provocations in Sarajevo.    "It is crucial in this critical moment to exclude a  possibility of any provocations and sabotage of the peace  process. Not only Sarajevo's fate but the fate of Bosnian  peaceful settlement on the whole depends on this", the Russian  Foreign Ministry said in a statement distributed in the United  Nations on Tuesday [22 February].    Russia called on the West "to exert the necessary pressure  on  the Bosnian Government to make it cooperate with the United  Nations in unblocking and demilitarizing Sarajevo", according to  the statement circulated as a U.N. Security Council document.    If the U.S.A. and the European Union member countries press  on Bosnian Muslims to make them help unblock Sarajevo, the West  would act "on the same lines it declared while saying that  political settlement of the conflict would be preferable", the  document says.    It recalled the Russian initiative which made Bosnian Serbs  pull back heavy guns from Sarajevo and added that Russia's  "consequent line which excludes any unilateral ultimatums has  yielded results".    "We are accounting that goodwill which was shown by one of  the conflicting sides in the moment critical to the (conflict's)  settlement will evoke equally concrete responsive moves", it  reads.    Russia also proposed that after unblocking Sarajevo, the  United Nations urgently consider ways of establishing its  administration in the city and measures to stregthen other safe  areas on the Bosnian territory.</p>

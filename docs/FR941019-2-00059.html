Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  Statutory Framework <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) authorizes establishment of tolerances and exemptions from tolerances for the residues of pesticides in or on raw agricultural commodities (RAC's), and section 409 of the act authorizes promulgation of food additive regulations for pesticide residues in processed foods (21 U.S.C. 346(a), 348).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 408 of the act, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from tolerances when appropriate, for pesticide residues in raw agricultural commodities. Food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues in processed foods are established under section 402 of the act. Section 409 food/feed additive regulations are required, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 409(a)(2) of the FFDCA, no section 409 food/feed additive regulation is required if any pesticide residues in a processed food resulting from use on a RAC has been removed to the extent possible by good manufacturing practices and is below the tolerance for that pesticide in or on that RAC. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through'' provision because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to processed food. Thus, a section 409 food additive regulation is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when despite the use of good manufacturing practices the concentration of the pesticide residues in a processed food is greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact with a pesticide. Monitoring and enforcement are carried out by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of a food additive regulation under section 409 requires a finding that use of the pesticide will be ``safe'' (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)). Section 409 also contains the ``Delaney Clause,'' which specifically provides that, with limited exceptions, no additive may be approved if it has been found to induce cancer in man or animals (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(5)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In setting both section 408 tolerances and section 409 food/feed additive regulations, EPA reviews residue chemistry and toxicology data. To be acceptable, tolerances must be both high enough to cover residues likely to be left when the pesticide is used in accordance with its labeling and low enough to protect the public health. With respect to section 408 tolerances, EPA determines the highest levels of residues that might be present in a raw agricultural commodity based on controlled field trials conducted under the conditions allowed by the product's labeling that are expected to yield maximum residues. Generally, EPA's policy concerning whether a section 409 food additive regulation is needed depends on whether there is a possibility that the processing of a raw agricultural commodity containing pesticide residues would result in residues in the processed food at a level greater than the raw food tolerance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Petition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Uniroyal Chemical Co. has submitted a petition requesting the revocation of the feed additive regulation established under section 409 of the FFDCA for dimethipin on cottonseed hulls. The following provides background information and sets forth the basis for the petitioner's request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The section 408 tolerance for dimethipin on cottonseed is established at 0.5 part per million (ppm) (40 CFR 180.406). The section 409 feed additive regulation on cottonseed hulls has been established at 0.7 ppm (40 CFR 186.2050). In a peer review of dimethipin, dated January 5, 1990, EPA classified dimethipin as a Group C (possible human) carcinogen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dimethipin is the active ingredient in Harvade harvest growth regulants registered by Uniroyal. Uniroyal claims that since Harvade is applied to cotton 7 to 14 days before anticipated harvest, a high percentage of the chemical is deposited on the cotton leaf which subsequently abscises and drops to the soil surface. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uniroyal Chemical is requesting revocation of the section 409 feed additive regulation for cottonseed hulls because, they claim, that it is not needed and that revoking it will avoid any inconsistency with the Delaney Clause in section 409 of the FFDCA. According to Uniroyal, concentration of dimethipin in cottonseed hulls does not exceed the section 408 tolerance for cottonseed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To support the assertion that there is no concentration in the processed commodity, the Petitioner references a processing study [MRID No. 42920902], which was submitted as a requirement of reregistration of dimethipin. Uniroyal claims that this work demonstrates that dimethipin residues do not concentrate in cottonseed hulls (a processed commodity) when compared with those in ginned cottonseed (a raw agricultural commodity) (MRID No. 42467001 and 42920901). The study results are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this new processed fraction study, maturing cotton was treated with an exaggerated (2X) rate, resulting in an average cottonseed residue of 0.563 ppm. Values for cottonseed hulls averaged 0.451 ppm. Only one out of four of the individual sample concentration factors (values for which are -41%, -30%, -5%, and +7%) suggest a small possibility of concentration. The mean factor of -17% indicates a net dilution of nearly one-sixth in generating cottonseed hulls from raw cottonseed. Uniroyal declares that since the 2X rate produced no residue in hulls higher than 0.53 ppm, treatment at the full labeled 1X rate will not have a reasonable probability of producing residues in cottonseed hulls higher than the RAC tolerance of 0.5 ppm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uniroyal submitted a critique of two previous studies addressing the magnitude of dimethipin residues in cottonseed and processed fractions. Uniroyal claims that the new study is better documented and more representative of real-world conditions. In light of new data, the Petitioner urges EPA to reconsider whether a section 409 feed additive regulation is necessary for dimethipin in cottonseed hulls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 40 CFR 177.125 and 177.30, EPA may issue an order ruling on the petition or may issue a proposal in response to the petition and seek further comment. If EPA issues an order in response to the petition, any person adversely affected by the order may file written objections and a request for a hearing on those objections with EPA on or before the 30th day after the date of publication of the order (40 CFR 178.20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : 21 U.S.C. 346a and 348.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Daniel M.

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Travel: Over the bed of Charlemagne - Leslie Gardiner explores a quiet corner of Europe where three nations meet and examines the time-warp of the Fagnes, Belgium's mountainous fen country The Belgian Army built this tower, says M. Rhenan as, hand over hand, we negotiate its spiralling steel rungs. Part of their assault course, perhaps. There is quite a view from the top, nonetheless: northward the industrial sprawl of Maastricht and Aachen, southward the undulations of a countryside rich in pastures, pine woods and mineral springs. This is Dreilanderblick, or Trois Frontieres, where three nations join hands. Beneath us a farm-hand urges red cattle out of a Dutch meadow, down a German lane and into a Belgian milking parlour. Cyclists from Aachen in Germany park their machines in Belgium and unpack their picnics in the Netherlands. The Meuse river becomes Maas before our very eyes. 'And that moorland to the south?' 'The Fagnes,' says Rhenan. 'The fen country of Belgium.' Unlike England's fens, the Fagnes extend across mountainous ground. Between Eupen and Malmedy, two little towns of European renown long before Maastricht (they once issued their own postage stamps), we stand near Belgium's highest summit, which is all of 2,000ft, at the ancient travellers' rest called Baraque Michel. I step up to the door of the Baraque and launch a thunderous attack on the bell. It responds with a booming peal. When the Baraque was the only building on the Fagnes, they tolled this bell to guide lost travellers to safety. 'Even now they toll it,' says Rhenan. 'Two summers ago - you have certainly read of it - a whole class of schoolchildren went missing on the Fagnes. The Belgian army searched for them and the bell tolled continuously for two days and nights.' Today it is breezy but when the wind drops the mist will settle over the Fagnes. They are no bigger than the English fens (about 40 miles by 25). The Eupen-Malmedy road crosses them and the forestry department's map is a gridiron of paths which intersect here and there at a maison forestiere. But the paths are confusing in that sea of peat moss and meadow grass, and the low-built maisons are poor landmarks. 'You lose direction,' says Rhenan. 'You walk in a circle. You grow very cold. You sink to the ground and sleep in the bed of Charlemagne.' The bed of Charlemagne is an expanse of brackish moss which gives rise to some of the rivers of the Ardennes. In an hour's walk we meet only one other walker: a German who comes here to botanise and to listen to the tinkle of the streams. 'I live beside the Rhine, but I cannot hear it any more. I only hear endless vehicles, drunken immigrants, police cars and quarrels among neighbours.' Turning our backs on the Maas-Rhine triangle (like leaving industrial Lancashire behind as you climb to the Pennine Way), then descending easy gradients and picking up south-flowing streams, we enter Belgium's smiling back-of-beyond, the undiscovered country. The zigzag streets and crooked spires of Malmedy and Stavelot doze in a time-warp. On a town square enclosed by steep crow-stepped gables we meet the shakos, frogged tunics and bassoons of a Ruritanian band. We almost expect to see His Serene Highness, fresh no doubt from exercising his droit du seigneur, appear on the balcony for the daily anthem and plaudits of loyal citizens. Or is this the line-up for one of those famous marches militaires, exclusive to this region, which, with solemn music and uniforms older than Belgium itself, maintain the pure, unbroken traditions of the old-time volunteer marcheurs, the villagers who protected religious processions and defended sacred relics? But this is Lent and the marches do not usually begin until Easter Monday. Meantime, the carnivals reach their climax. Happy the child of south-eastern Belgium. He grows up in a world of make-believe. Early spring for him is the season of clowns, giants, fire-eaters and sword-swallowers, cardboard forts and papier-mache armour, stilt-walkers and fairytale characters come to life. From the way the adults behave at the Lenten festivities you suspect that the children never grow up, and you do not blame them. We caught the tail-end of Malmedy's six-day carnival, with its expensive fancy dresses. On Shrove Tuesday we saw the mayor of Eupen handing the civic keys to 'Prince Carnival', but didn't linger for the licensed buffoonery which followed. And at Stavelot we mingled with the blancs moussis (dialect: 'dressed in white') as they performed with pigs' bladders and fired salvos of confetti from antique cannon. The blancs moussis commemorate the monks of Stavelot Abbey, who used to escape and flit through the carnival in bedsheets and false noses. Dig a hole anywhere on the skirts of the Fagnes and mineral water gushes out. Most carnival townships are also watering places. Queen of the spas is Spa itself, which bestowed its name on hydropathic establishments worldwide. Upmarket leisure pursuits have taken hold of this smug little town of scented pines, fountains and golf courses. We had managed to avoid the week of the Belgian grand prix which meant we could motor round the circuit on the Francorchamps road, threading the black rectangles of pines, racing past half-timbered farmhouses which carry the slogans of Elf, Bosch and Pirelli on their roofs, past the white flagpoles, covered stand and pits, under the Mobiloil bridge and down the long straight where a whiff of burning rubber still lingered. Finally to Liege, home-town of Rhenan, and I brace myself for a little campanilismo. Long ago I passed through Liege at night and I remember spiritual desolation, blast furnaces, slag-heaps and the clanking of trucks loaded with pig iron and brown coal. Nothing could be more removed from the present-day reality. Broad boulevards sweep under curving cliffs where the Meuse used to flow. Every other car is a Ferrari. Tall narrow houses clamber skywards. In the Outre-Meuse quarter, a self-proclaimed free republic to which you are admitted with a comic passport, the alcoved madonnas are newly-coiffeured and Baby Jesus has a pink face. It is carnival time here, too. Liege is a city of elegance and sophistication. It is a dockyard port, a hub of revitalised steam trains, a showpiece of domestic architecture, a fashion centre, a museum of industrial archaeology, a metropolis of marionette drama, a mother of arts and sciences and, at this season, an overflowing basket of flowers. Challenged to name five famous Belgians, you need not step outside Liege. The musicians Cesar Franck, Gretry and Ysaye, the sculptor Del Cour and the crime novelist Georges Simenon will do for a start. Gastronomy is rife. At the Vachter hostellerie we dined on Zealand oysters, coucou de Malines and Moka cream. The Chateau Margaux '53 at the foot of the wine list was amusingly priced at Pounds 165, but the Graves rouge at the top was quite drinkable. After all, this was Lent. What must the Liege restaurants be like at Christmas? Later, we looked in at the Olivettes cafe chantant and the Ane Rouge cellar on the waterfront, the scene of Simenon's first novel. What next? For me it was bed. Rhenan approved. 'Il y sont des nights, des stripteases, des gamblings . . . sont amusants, mais ils ne sont pas Liege.'</p>

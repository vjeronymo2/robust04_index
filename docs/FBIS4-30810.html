			<p>BFN     [Text] Bijeljina, 27 May (TANJUG) -- It has been learned  from the press center of the eastern Bosnian corps of the army  of the Srpska republic that Muslim forces launched an all-out  offensive on Mt. Majevica this morning.    From the direction of Drijenca, Humci, Nahvioci, Brnik,  Vrazici, and Teocak, Muslim forces launched an artillery attack  on Serb positions and civilian targets in Priboj, Vukosavci, and  Lopare. A tank attack was launched around 0900 and about 100  shells were fired on these targets. A school, a church, and a  farm in Priboj were attacked by Muslim forces and two civilians  were wounded.    At around 1000, Muslim forces supported by heavy artillery  launched an all-out infantry attack on Banj Brdo, Stolice,  Piperi, and Spasojevici. The Serb defense forces energetically  repelled the completely unprovoked attack and inflicted huge  losses upon the enemy.    Being unable to launch an infantry breakthrough, in the  early  afternoon the Muslim forces started shelling Banj Brdo, Stolice,  and civilian targets around Lopare.    The defense lines have not changed and there have been no  casualties among the Serb fighters.</p>

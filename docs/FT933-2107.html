			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Executives feast on champagne and birdies OFFICIALS AT the Belfry golf course in Warwickshire were yesterday putting the final touches to mobile offices and hospitality suites for the Ryder Cup, which the organisers predict could attract more corporate attendance than any other sporting event in Britain. Companies such as IBM, IMI, Chase Manhattan Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland have taken hospitality suites for the European-US competition, each costing Pounds 49,000 for six days. The suites, known as 'platinum pavilions', have fax machines, mobile phones, share information and dining facilities for up to 50 guests. Mr Richard Brown, one of the corporate hospitality organisers, said: 'They can monitor shares or drink champagne all day. It's up to them.' All 38 platinum suites have been sold out, as have the less luxurious range of pavilions, the gold, silver and bronze. Other executives are expected to rough it in 250-seat restaurants which will cater for the 7,500 corporate clients expected each day. Organisers predict ticket receipts of more than Pounds 2m, which will offset the cost of improving the course's greens and refurbishing the DeVere Hotel, owned by Greenalls brewers. The competition on the fairways is likely to be mirrored by the transatlantic profile of the business guests, Mr Brown added. Executives from British companies such as Bass will be able to rub shoulders with their counterparts from Pepsi Cola over four-course lunches in the best suites. The directors of Pepsi, however, will be arriving at the Belfry in grander style than those from Bass, based in nearby Burton-on-Trent. Personnel from the US company flew into Birmingham yesterday on a specially chartered Concorde with executives from Time Warner, American Express and the US team.</p>

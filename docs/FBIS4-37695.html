			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kuwaiti petroleum minister by Randah </F> Taqi-al-Din in Vienna; date not given: "Kuwait Negotiating With  India and Pakistan to Build High-Capacity Refineries"--first  paragraph AL-HAYAH introduction]    [Text] Kuwait's new petroleum minister, 'Abd-al-Muhsin  Mid'aj al-Mid'aj, has said in an interview with AL-HAYAH in  Vienna that Kuwait would restore its former oil refining  capacity to what it was before the Iraqi invasion within 10  years. "Kuwait has made a great deal of progress in its  negotiations with India and Pakistan to build large and modern  oil refineries in both countries," he said. He reaffirmed that  Kuwait rejects the idea that the Iraqi deputy secretary general  of OPEC, Ramzi Salman, should assume the position of acting  secretary general, and said that "Kuwait is with the decision of  the international community on the question of reopening the oil  pipeline between Iraq and Turkey."    The text of the interview follows:    [Taqi-al-Din] You are Kuwait's new petroleum minister; do  you  want to introduce a new plan for the oil sector?    [Al-Mid'aj] The oil sector in Kuwait is constantly  developing  and renewing itself. There are plans put into motion by my  predecessors, and there are new plans whose implementation I  will oversee in the near future, as Kuwait has emerged from a  terrible invasion and the destruction of its oil institutions.  They actually began to rebuild the oil sector after the  liberation. One thing we are doing is to adopt a new strategy  for our oil sector in terms of production, export, and oil  projects outside Kuwait.    [Taqi-al-Din] What are the priorities in terms of your oil  investments outside Kuwait?    [Al-Mid'aj] We have a long history of investment outside  Kuwait; it's nothing new. We have many activities in Europe, the  United States, East Asia, and the Arab countries. We have  refineries in Europe, we are investing in the gasoline  distribution sector, and we are active in oil exploration  through KUFPEC [Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company].  Also, our Santa Fe operations are ongoing abroad--these are  projects that were operating before, and still are.    [Taqi-al-Din] Are there any new ones?    [Al-Mid'aj] We are now looking at some new areas and will  complete our contacts with some of the countries we have  actually begun to consult with, such as the countries of the Far  East, to implement new oil production projects and get into  refining operations. We have now finished one round of  negotiations with India to build oil refineries there, and we  also have contacts with Pakistan to start up similar operations  in the near term. We still have not decided on the capacity of  these refineries, but I believe they will be modern and  high-capacity.    [Taqi-al-Din] What is your current production capacity?    [Al-Mid'aj] We have a production capacity of 2.4 million  barrels per day [bpd], and we are exporting 2 million. Turning  to our refining capacity, in 10 years Kuwait will have restored  its refining capacity to what it was before the invasion.  Refining capacity in our Kuwaiti refineries will increase by  nearly 100,000 bpd. (Refining capacity before the invasion  ranged from 800,000-880,000 bpd.) We are now in the final stages  of rebuilding the refineries that the Iraqi forces destroyed.    [Taqi-al-Din] It appears that the OPEC conference is unable  to choose a new secretary general, because Iran is nominating  its ambassador to Tokyo to that post and rejects the will of the  majority to appoint former Venezuelan minister Alirio Parra. It  is said that if nothing can be worked out, the Iraqi deputy  secretary general, Ramzi Salman, will become acting secretary  general. What do you think?    [Al-Mid'aj] It is absolutely unacceptable to us that Deputy  Secretary General Ramzi Salman be acting secretary general,  because the person who is given the post must be neutral, and  because the economic organization must have nothing to do with  politics. Our view is that the secretary general must be  neutral; he must not engage in politics, nor should he impose  the policy of one country, or be closer to one country than  another. It is a strictly economic organization. I hope we may  arrive at a solution and appoint a new secretary general who is  not aligned with any country.    [Taqi-al-Din] Are you comfortable with current oil price  levels?    [Al-Mid'aj] We will be comfortable if the oil market  stabilizes and if prices are reasonable, so there will be no  upset in the oil market. We do not approve of disruptions in  prices. We always seek to stabilize them, with the cooperation  of both sides: the producers and the consumers. Prices are now  in the process of improving logically and reasonably to the  point where producers are almost satisfied, and yet the prices  are not a burden to consumers.    [Taqi-al-Din] We hear a great deal these days about how the  United States has permitted the reopening of an oil pipeline  from Iraq and Turkey, in order to help Turkey. What is your  position on this?    [Al-Mid'aj] Our position is that of the international  community: There is an economic danger to Iraq, for well-known  reasons. We are with the international community, and if it  makes a decision, we will support it. I believe that the  international community will not put up with any political game  the Iraqis may have in mind, but we are with the international  community in any decision it makes on this subject</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Money Markets: UK rates ease again CASH rates in the sterling money market softened yesterday morning as dealers continued to believe that a near-term cut in UK base rates might become possible, writes James Blitz. However, towards the end of the day, several dealers felt that the possibility of a base rate cut had receded following comments from the chancellor of the exchequer to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, and an analysis of the Bank of England's operations in the sterling money market. As one discount house dealer put it: 'Nothing in what the chancellor said gave me the impression that base rates were about to come down.' The structure of Mr Norman Lamont's economic policy was not fleshed out in any more detail, but some dealers felt that there was a clearer commitment to managing the exchange rate to ensure that inflation is controlled. In the morning, the Bank of England's offer to deal in the early round without a repurchase agreement fuelled speculation that a rate cut was imminent. Traditionally, the Bank offers to buy a 'repo' at the established rate when it wants to kill all thought of a base rate move. The news that it was offering to deal in the shorter-dated Bands 1 and 2 actually heightened speculation of a cut, pushing 3-month money down to 8 3/4 per cent. The December short sterling contract shot up to its highest level since 9 per cent base rates were introduced, peaking at 91.98. According to one dealer, the Bank turned down offers to buy bills at cheaper rates, re-establishing the rates for Bands 1 and 2 at 8 7/8 per cent. 'By turning cheaper deals away, the Bank sent a strong message to the market that rates are not going to change,' he said. The December short sterling contract later fell back to close at 91.89, 1 basis point up from its opening level. Cash rates retained their optimistic tone, with 3 month money closing  3/16 per cent down on the offered side at 8 3/4 per cent. One month money closed at 8 15/16 per cent from 9 1/8 per cent offered. The Bank revised its forecast shortage down from Pounds 750m to Pounds 500m, buying Pounds 4m of Band 1 bank bills, a further Pounds 254m in the afternoon, and providing late assistance of Pounds 165m.</p>

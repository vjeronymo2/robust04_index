			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (5): Europe's 'anchor' still intact - The economic recovery has helped the German currency Despite consensus among economists that the dollar should rise against the D-Mark during 1994, the German currency has proved stubbornly strong. Economists put the D-Mark's resilience down to two factors - inherent weaknesses in the outlook for the US currency, coupled with increasing support from economic fundamentals for the D-Mark. On the US front, economists cite a host of factors which led to dollar weakness, despite the likelihood of further Fed tightening of interest rates. These range from investors' demand for a higher yield on US securities to compensate for the risks of holding such investments after a period of high volatility in the US government bond market, to the perception that President Bill Clinton's administration considers it politically desirable to see a weaker dollar versus the yen to enhance the US's trading position relative to Japan. While trade relations between Japan and the US do not directly touch the US currency's relationship with the D-Mark, the D-Mark strengthens by default as a result. The German currency is helped by the growing conviction that Germany is pulling out of its worst recession since the second world war. Expectations that the German economy is to endure a double-dip downturn - ie a lurch downwards this summer - have been contradicted by a mass of economic data suggesting that a more than modest recovery is under way. Figures on order intake, exports and employment, coupled with increasingly bullish polls of business expectations and a spate of good news from the corporate sector, have changed the climate of expectations. One telling expression of this was the forecast in April from four out of five of Germany's leading economic institutes: they predict a pan-German growth rate of 1.5 per cent for the year, representing a slow but sure recovery. Financial institutions are even more optimistic: Dresdner Bank, for example, expects the economy to grow by 2 per cent. The rosier outlook for the economy has forced the financial markets to revise their expectations on the scale and timing of further cuts in short-term interest rates. The rationale for the change in outlook is that recovery makes it more likely that the Bundesbank will start increasing interest rates again to check the inflationary impact of better than expected growth. Despite economists' expectations of further cuts in the discount rate during the year, euromark futures - which give rates for three-month borrowing - tell a more pessimistic story. They suggest that the interest rates will reach a low point for the current monetary policy cycle in September this year at 4.7 per cent, compared to the present 5.1 per cent three-month rate. Thereafter rates will rise to 5.60 per cent by the end of next year, the futures market suggests, a reversal of earlier expectations that rates would carry on falling towards 4 per cent within 1994. 'This represents a sizeable correction in short-term rate expectations,' comments Mr Joachim Fels at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. With German interest rates set to rise again as of the turn of the year, and the German economy pulling out of the doldrums, it is not surprising that the D-Mark's status as a 'safe haven' currency is intact. This is true in respect of the US dollar - and in Europe where the D-Mark has in the medium and long-term staged a dramatic appreciation against other currencies. Despite doubts, the D-Mark has preserved its role as the 'anchor currency' for Europe and the currencies belonging to the slimmed-down European exchange rate mechanism. The appreciation of the D-Mark against certain European currencies since the end of 1991 (up 29 per cent against Spanish peseta, 27 per cent versus the Italian Lire and 14 per cent against the pound ) has worsened the competitive position of German industry - but the corrective in industry's favour will come not via a depreciation in the nominal value of the D-Mark. Germany will strive to regain its competitiveness through an improvement in labour costs.</p>

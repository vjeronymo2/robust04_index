			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Croats and Moslems agree Bosnia truce: Washington and Moscow join in diplomatic drive to lay groundwork for a wider peace plan Bosnian Croats and Moslems agreed a ceasefire yesterday as the US, Russia and western Europe pressed ahead with efforts to lay the basis for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The ceasefire, to start at 11 am GMT tomorrow, was announced by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations envoy. It was agreed at UN-sponsored talks in Zagreb between Mr Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-led Bosnian army, and Mr Ante Roso, the Bosnian Croat military chief. The accord appears a success for international efforts to build on the peace arrangements for Sarajevo, where the threat of Nato air strikes combined with Russian pressure has led to withdrawal of Serb artillery. The Croats and Moslems agreed all heavy weapons would be handed over to UN troops or withdrawn from battle fronts. Mortars will be pulled back 10km from front lines, and tanks and heavy artillery 20km. UN troops will move in to ensure compliance. If the truce holds in central Bosnia, it could pave the way for lifting the Croat siege of Mostar, in western Hercegovina. In their latest efforts, Washington, the UN, the European Union and Russia are engaging in a three-pronged strategy aimed at creating a new peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina, according to diplomats. Under this strategy mediators are pressing for firm ceasefires in certain regions, allowing unhindered access for humanitarian aid convoys and eventual demilitarisation of the areas. But diplomats said success would depend on a western commitment to send more peacekeepers to Bosnia - for which omens are not good. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, and Mr Charles Redman, US special envoy, held talks in Zagreb yesterday with Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, the international peace negotiators. The talks centred on Croatia and the Bosnian government agreeing to an eventual 'confederation' for Bosnia, following a ceasefire in central Bosnia and lifting of the siege of Mostar. US officials had hoped Germany would play a greater role in persuading Croatia to pull its troops out of western Hercegovina. Mr Mate Granic, Croatia's foreign minister, said yesterday Zagreb had withdrawn about 1,200 troops from western Hercegovina. But US officials said the pressure from Bonn was not enough. 'It might be in the interests of the Moslems to sign up to a confederation,' a Belgrade-based diplomat said. 'If not, they will be left with an unviable state. If they are to have any hope of survival, the Moslems must make a deal with either the Serbs or the Croats.' This is where Washington's role is crucial, as part of the second prong to the strategy. US and European leaders have told Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic they will help postwar reconstruction in an effort to win Moslem endorsement of the diplomatic peace initiative. But Mr Izetbegovic is cool largely because Croatia still refuses to withdraw its troops. The third element involves the Russians, who can put pressure on the Serbs. 'Trying to coalesce these three elements of the strategy will be difficult,' a British diplomat said, adding that pressure to capitalise on involvement by Moscow and Washington must not be squandered. Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday proposed an international summit on Bosnia - an idea welcomed with caution by western nations.</p>

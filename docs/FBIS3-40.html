			<p>SUMMARY                                          The Japanese Government appears to be making only slow progress  on the package of measures it is drawing up to demonstrate to the  United States that it is willing to open Japanese markets and  deregulate the Japanese economy.  This slowness is apparently due  in part to divisions within the government over prospective parts  of the package, such as increases in long-term investment and tax  cuts.  Infighting within the coalition government and a growing  perception that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government is  ineffective also appear to be slowing progress on the market  opening package.                                       END SUMMARY     Japanese Government leaders continue to send signals that  progress on the package of market opening measures that Tokyo is  drawing up is proceeding slowly and will not be completed by the  originally projected date at the end of March.   According to the  16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura told a news conference on 15 March that a final package  of measures would not be presented to the United States until the  G-7 Summit in July.  Although earlier reporting indicated that an  interim package might be ready by the end of March, the 16 March  Nihon Keizai Shimbun report did not quote Takemura as saying  anything about such a package.  Similarly, the 16 March Mainichi  Shimbun quoted Minister of International Trade and Industry  Hiroshi Kumagai as telling reporters on 15 March that it would be  "impossible" to complete measures designed to deregulate the  Japanese economy by the end of March.  Kumagai reportedly added  that it would "probably take until the end of June to resolve"  issues connected with the measures.     One of the factors delaying progress on the package appears to be  that the government is divided over several of the most important  measures in the package.  One of these measures is reportedly a  plan to increase investment under Japan's current 10-year plan  for investment in public works projects by about 100 trillion yen  over the current 430 trillion yen.  This plan appears to have  support from several cabinet ministers, including Director  General of the Economic Planning Agency Manae Kubota,  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, and Transport Minister  Shigeru Ito, all of whom belong to the Social Democratic Party of  Japan (SDPJ), the largest party in the ruling coalition.  According to a 4 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun report, Kubota came  out in favor of increasing the investment plan during a 4 March  news conference, arguing that the increase would help jump start  the sagging Japanese economy.  A 4 March Kyodo report indicated  that Igarashi supported Kubota and advocated increasing  investment to 600 trillion yen.  The 10 March Yomiuri Shimbun  identified Ito as another supporter of the plan.  In addition,  Japan's two leading business groups, the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) and the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai) have also supported the increase,  according to 7 March Kyodo and 8 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun  reports.     The Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, reportedly opposes the  increase because there are no clear sources of revenue to finance  it.  The 1O March Yomiuri Shimbun quoted Minister of Finance  Hirohisa Fujii, a member of the Shinseito, a key party in the  ruling coalition, as telling a 9 March news conference that  discussions of the increase, "including financial resources, are  just beginning and there is no need to change our pace."  The  paper also cited an unnamed MOF official as stating that "it  would be irresponsible to make a pledge to expand investment when  there is no hope of securing financial resources."  According to  Yomiuri Shimbun, MOF is particularly concerned about increasing  investment in public works when reform of the tax system is still  under debate.  In addition, the paper reported that unnamed  officials in MOF are arguing that there was no need to include an  increase in the 1O-year investment plan in the measures the  government is currently drawing up in the wake of the collapse of  U.S.-Japan trade talks because the United States "has not once  asked for expansion of public investment during the framework  talks."     Tax Reform     Another contentious issue among the market opening measures is  tax reform, particularly the timing and scope of proposed tax  cuts.  Some ministries and some bureaucrats, including some  officials in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI), appear to be pressing the coalition to decide quickly on  a tax reform package to include in the package of market opening  measures.  An unnamed senior MITI official told an Asahi Shimbun  reporter on 10 March that the ruling coalition should make a  "quick decision" about tax system reform and include tax reform  plans in the market opening measures (Asahi Shimbun, 11 March).  Speaking at a news conference several days later, MITI Minister  Hiroshi Kumagai also reportedly pressed for a rapid decision on  tax cuts, stating that the government must come up with a plan by  the end of June.  The SDPJ has also been widely reported to be a  strong supporter of tax cuts.     Here too, however, the MOF appears to be blocking progress.  The  ministry apparently continues to oppose any measures to cut taxes  unless sources of revenue other than deficit financing bonds can  be identified to offset the cuts.  During a news conference on 11  March, Finance Minister Fujii argued that the Japanese Government  should not make hasty decisions about tax reform or tax cuts only  in order to include them in the package of measures designed to  address U.S.-Japan trade friction, according to an 11 March Kyodo  report.     Bureaucratic Resistance     Resistance from elsewhere within the government bureaucracy may  also be stalling work on some of the market opening measures,  particularly those designed to deregulate the Japanese economy.  The 10 March Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed officials in the  Cabinet Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs, which is  reportedly charged with compiling deregulation measures, as  complaining that the ministries were "reluctant" to draw up any  measures beyond those that they have already presented to the  Hosokawa administration.  Similarly, according to the 10 March  Yomiuri Shimbun, many government ministries and agencies are  arguing that they have already implemented as many measures to  deregulate their operations as they are currently capable of  doing.     Coalition Infighting     A fourth factor delaying progress on the market opening package  appears to be infighting within the ruling coalition government  over the handling of the package.  In particular, tensions  between Prime Minister Hosokawa and Shinseito Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa on the one hand and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura  on the other seem to be spilling over into the handling of the  market opening package.  According to the 10 March Asahi Shimbun,  Takemura was charged with overseeing work on the market opening  package.  However, because of the tension between Hosokawa and  Takemura, some government offices seem to have been reluctant to  work with the Chief Cabinet Secretary.  The 10 March Asahi  Shimbun reported that some ministry officials question whether he  has Hosokawa's confidence.     Tensions between Ozawa and Takemura and also between the  coalition and the bureaucracy may have derailed Ozawa's planned  trip to Washington at the end of March to discuss market opening  measures.  According to the 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun, both Ozawa  and Takemura appear to have been working from different  directions to resolve bilateral trade frictions, and Takemura may  have seen Ozawa's trip as as undercutting Takemura's official  role in coordinating work on the market opening package.  In  addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appears to have  resented Ozawa's plans to get involved in bilateral relations.  The 13 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted MOFA and Japanese  Embassy officials as claiming they never heard of plans for  Ozawa's trip and denying that it had been approved by the  Japanese Government.  According to the 16 March Nihon Keizai  Shimbun, MOFA officials were miffed that they were not consulted  about the trip.     Outlook     The divisions within the government, the resistance of parts of  the bureaucracy, and infighting within the coalition will  probably not only continue to delay progress on the market  opening measures, but also to limit the scope of any measures  that are ultimately drawn up.  Some of the steps being debated,  such as tax reform, involve deep, long-standing divisions among  the parties in the ruling coalition that will probably be very  difficult to resolve in the near future.  In order to incorporate  such steps in the market opening package without threatening the  unity of the already splintering coalition, the coalition parties  will probably have to work out compromises that will water down  the measures to the point that they will have relatively little  impact.

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (3): The roads become longer and clearer - Europe's single market opportunities EARLY enthusiasm among express industry companies for the rapid development of their own large European networks has now been replaced by greater caution and an urgent need to keep costs firmly under control. Recession and the sight of both leading international operators and domestic companies having to retrench after finding it too costly to develop or sustain intra-European networks have had a salutary effect on the industry as a whole. More positively, the advent of the EC Single Market and the resulting removal of intra-EC border controls has stimulated some new express industry development. In particular, there has been a noticeable expansion of road-based delivery services. Still to be resolved, though, is who will be the longer term express industry winners and losers in the European market. Some observers claim only established international operators have the experience and resources to be successful. Mr Bryan Draper, managing director of UK domestic parcels carrier Elan, maintains that in order to offer a total package, express parcel delivery companies cannot serve Europe alone. 'I believe that parcels companies without a full international pedigree are going to receive extremely bloody noses from the guys who are not only there already but who are also geared up for the future with very experienced and wide open eyes,' he says. Other express industry observers and service operators, though, disagree. They believe there is room in the intra-European market for well-organised alliances and partnerships between leading national or regional operators. Leading UK overnight parcels delivery company Securicor Omega Express (SOE), for instance, has set up its Network Europe operation on that basis. Plans include developing a 48/72-hour road-based cross-border trunking network, sub- contracting most of the domestic pick-up and delivery operations in each country to local operators. Another UK parcels carrier, Amtrak, recently introduced a new European express road/ferry service called Airtrak Roadlink, operated in conjunction with Continental delivery agents, to join its established European courier and express operations. United Carriers plans to launch a 'comprehensive' range of European express parcel services in June as part of a system called General Parcel being established by a group of companies in different countries. And Seabourne Express Group is using the European rail network to develop delivery services to Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. Meanwhile, Mayne Nickless group UK parcels carrier Parceline is stepping up promotion of its Euroline service which was launched last year to provide 36/48-hour road-based delivery to 14 European countries. A daily trailer runs between Parceline's UK hub at Birmingham and a Continental hub at Boom, Belgium where traffic is fed into the networks of various European delivery partners. A key advantage of using such a system, claims Mr Colin Millbanks, Parceline chief executive, is that it keeps down costs. 'From day one, we have been able to offer a comprehensive service which is low cost and does not rely on considerable increases in volume in order to get down the conventional cost curve. Consequently, it was immediately profitable,' he says. In fact, Parceline recently cut rates for the Euroline service, although it will not give precise figures. Rivals claim the move reflects the increasingly tough battle for intra-European express traffic. Parceline maintains it simply reflects the economies of scale being gained through increased traffic volumes being handled by the service. Either way, the reduction of rates for Euroline fits in with a widely-predicted longer-term trend towards lower prices in the European express market. That point was highlighted by Mr Tony Keating, European director of logistics for international parcels giant United Parcel Service (UPS), when he spoke at a recent postal and parcel services conference in London. He claimed that rates for overnight delivery of parcels within Europe were still around twice those for similar operations in the United States. But with the advent of the EC Single Market, the gap should start to close. To make his point, he compared the published full rate tariff for delivering a parcel overnight in Europe, for example between Glasgow, Scotland and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and over the same sort of distance within the US, say between Indianapolis and Philadelphia. For overnight delivery by air in the US, a three-kilo parcel would cost around Dollars 20 and a 10-kilo parcel Dollars 37. And by road, which would give next-day delivery although not next morning, the rates could be as low as Dollars 2.80 for the three-kilo item and Dollars 5 for 10 kilos. Full rate tariff for the Glasgow-Amsterdam overnight delivery, continued Mr Keating, would be around Dollars 44 for a three-kilo parcel and Dollars 70 for the larger item. Even discounted rates would still be around Dollars 30 and Dollars 49 respectively. Main reasons for that disparity, he said, were the huge economies of scale in the US market, greater efficiencies brought about by fierce competition and the wider use of technology like vehicle/computer communications. 'The huge economies of scale are probably the most important factor in this. But as larger operations appear in Europe, I see no reason why these economies should not be achieved over here,' commented Mr Keating. In line with the move to reduce costs for express delivery services in Europe, and boosted by the removal of intra-EC border controls, leading operators are beefing up the development of road-based services to run in tandem with their more expensive air express systems. Mr John Mullen, chief executive of TNT Express Worldwide, believes there is going to be further substantial upgrading of European road transport operations and more competition. 'We are almost certainly going to witness some important entries from overseas, particularly from the US, who view the European road market as a big opportunity,' he says. As if to confirm that point, US airfreight/air express company Emery Worldwide earlier this year launched a new road-based intra-European operation called Cross Continent Service. Initially available within the EC, future plans for CCS include extending the service to cover countries outside the EC, for example in Eastern Europe. That intention reflects a general belief among express companies that developments in Eastern Europe are opening up new opportunities. For the moment, though, the most immediate stimulus for European express industry development is the arrival of the Single Market. In addition to the removal of border controls, increased viability of centralised warehousing/distribution is generating demand for fast, frequent, reliable delivery systems. Not all EC developments have been positive for the express industry, though. VAT issues are causing uncertainty and there is concern over the outcome of the EC Green Paper on postal services due to have been discussed this month by European Council Ministers. Express companies want to know how far cross-border mail/express services will be deregulated, what will be reserved for the post offices and how such 'reserved' traffic will be designated.</p>

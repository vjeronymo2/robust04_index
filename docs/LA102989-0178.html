The Sacramento Municipal Utility  District, which is shutting down the publicly owned plant, said it would pay  the fine even though the problems have been corrected. The NRC found that 43 of  the 77 workers belonging to the core of Rancho Seco's emergency response team  were not properly trained.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Athens, March 28 (AFP) -- An EU [European Union]  decision on Greece's blockade of neighbouring Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] will be made  "probably just after Easter" unless the embargo on the  ex-Yugoslav state is lifted, EU commissioner Hans van den Broek  said Monday [28 March].    Announcing the last deadline after a one-hour meeting with  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias, the EU commissioner in charge of external  affairs said if the blockade was still in place the Commission  would "draw its own conclusions."    Van den Broek has been designated by the European Union to  seek a solution to the dispute. EU sources have suggested the  blockade, imposed on February 16, may be illegal under European  law.    The Commission was aware Greece "has some good arguments" on  its side, van den Broek said.    But he added that the Commission must both "assure itself  that Community law is respected" and on the other hand use its  political influence to find a "permanent and satisfactory  solution" to the Greek-Macedonian dispute.    He is to liaise with UN envoy Cyrus Vance and U.S. special  envoy Matthew Nimetz, who is expected in Athens overnight before  meeting Papandreou and Papoulias on Tuesday.    Papoulias said "efforts" for a solution were on-going and he  would meet Vance "very soon in New York".    Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos  denounced criticisms levied against Greece by its European  partners on Sunday, saying they "are encouraging the  intransigence of Skopje and don't help Mr. Vance's efforts."    EU foreign ministers meeting at Ioannina rejected Greece's  arguments in favour of the six-week-old trade embargo and called  on Greece to find a solution to the deadlock.    Greece claims the name of Macedonia for its own republic  bordering the former Yugoslav republic, and insists the latter  call itself by a different name and abandon symbols associated  with ancient Greece.</p>

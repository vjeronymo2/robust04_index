			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review"]    [Text] In Cartagena de Indias, Cuban President Fidel Castro  has said the United States should change its immigration policy  regarding Latin America and the Caribbean. Addressing the  plenum at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the Cuban president  broached a sensitive point when he called on the United States  to enact a law that would automatically legalize the status of  Latin American and Caribbean peoples who have entered the  northern country, as it is doing with Cuban citizens today.    The double standard in the U.S. policy regarding immigrants  of the hemisphere can be seen most notably in the last three and  a half decades, as Washington has given special treatment to  Cubans who reach that country while it has repressed the  citizens of other nationalities.    As a result of the Cuban Readjustment Act, enacted in the  United States in 1966, any Cuban, regardless of motive or means  of transportation, may be granted political refugee status  merely by reaching U.S. territory and remaining there for a  year. The laws favoring Cuban immigration and the slowness in  granting permanent residence through legal means have encouraged  illegal departures from Cuban territory. The exceptional,  privileged treatment the United States grants to Cuban  immigration is contingent upon a political premise that is not  given to citizens of other regional countries.    There are instances in which fragile boats full of Cubans  and  Haitians have reached the coast of the Florida peninsula: Cubans  searching for better economic opportunities and Haitians  escaping military repression. The U.S. authorities returned the  Haitians, but the Cubans received every possible assistance and  were quickly able to legalize their status and subsequently  turned over to their relatives.    More than 7 million immigrants entered the United States  between 1981 to 1990, according to official figures, but Cuba  ranks 16th among the countries that contribute the most  immigrants. There is no other reason, other than political, to  treat Cubans with privilege to the detriment of the remaining  Latin American and Caribbean immigrants, especially Mexicans.    No wonder the Cuban president just stated the following in  Cartagena de Indias: At a time when the Berlin Wall no longer  exists, the wall being built at the Mexican-U.S. border should  be torn down.</p>

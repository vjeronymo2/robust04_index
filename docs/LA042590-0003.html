			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY TO FUND WATER RECYCLING STUDY  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council wants to know if millions of gallons of treated  sewer water now being dumped into the Arroyo Simi can be recycled and sold for  agricultural and industrial uses.  </P> <P> The council, acting as the Simi Valley Sanitation District Board of Directors,  voted 4 to 0 Monday night to spend $30,000 to hire an engineering firm to  determine if a reclamation program is economical.  </P> <P> The study is expected to take four months once a contract has been awarded. It  will be funded with district money from the 1989-90 budget, city officials  said. The study will determine the cost of reclaiming the water, the amount of  revenue that would be generated by the reclamation program and how it will be  funded, officials said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Vicky Howard, who has been pushing for the study, said using the  water to irrigate schoolyards, golf courses and fields would help ease the  city's water shortage. The reclamation program also would generate an  undetermined amount of money for the city, officials said.  </P> <P> "I think it's a viable program," Howard said. "We have to utilize the water  that's coming into the area and being wasted. The water coming from the  sanitation treatment plant is relatively good water and could be used for  agricultural, industrial and recreational uses."  </P> <P> About 9 million gallons of treated sewer water per day is dumped into the  Arroyo Simi, which serves as a flood-control channel, said Ronald C. Coons,  director of the city Public Works Department. That water could be recycled and  used for various irrigation programs, Coons said.  </P> <P> While not suitable for drinking, reclaimed water could be used to irrigate golf  courses, landscaped freeway medians, schoolyards and certain agricultural  fields, as well as for industrial and commercial landscaping, Coons said.  </P> <P> Waste Management Inc., operator of the Simi Valley Landfill, has already  expressed interest in using reclaimed water if a program is implemented.  </P> <P> "The water would be used for truck washing and irrigation of landscaping for  aesthetics and erosion control," said Mike Williams, general manager of Waste  Management. "It would be a significant savings for us and for sure be a better  way to go as far as resources."  </P> <P> Coons said the city conducted a waste-water reclamation study in 1979. That  study found that more than $10.2 million would be needed to implement a  reclamation program, which would involve building a pump station at the  sanitation plant site, water storage facilities and a network of pipelines to  carry water to customers.  </P> <P> "It did not prove to be an economically viable project" and the project was  shelved, Coons said.  </P> <P> Now, with the statewide drought in its fourth year -- causing some cities,  including Ventura and Santa Barbara, to adopt mandatory water-saving measures  -- Simi Valley has decided to take another look at a reclamation program, Coons  said.  </P> <P> While such a program would be an expensive undertaking for the city, at least  two sources have proposed paying some of the costs, Coons said.  </P> <P> Officials of the Metropolitan Water District, the largest supplier of water in  the east county, and the State Water Resources Control Board have said they may  offer rebates or low-interest loans for water reclamation projects.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks has applied to the state for rights to use about 13,000 acre-feet  of treated sewer water it now dumps into the Conejo Creek. The city wants to  sell the water to farmers on the parched Oxnard Plain.  </P></p>

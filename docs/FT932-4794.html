			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Babbitt emerges as court front-runner THE secretary of the interior, Mr Bruce Babbitt, appears to have emerged as President Bill Clinton's favourite candidate for the vacancy on the US Supreme Court. Several administration officials, confirming Mr Babbitt's status as front-runner, were quoted yesterday as saying an announcement was imminent. Mr Clinton said yesterday afternoon he was still 'working on' his selection. The White House has been considering candidates since Justice Byron White announced in March his intention to retire, and now needs to move speedily to get the justice confirmed by the Senate before the summer recess. Mr Clinton is the first Democratic president to be given the opportunity to name a justice to the court since President Lyndon Johnson appointed the late Mr Thurgood Marshall in 1967. Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, of whom Mr Clinton had spoken favourably, withdrew his name from consideration several weeks ago. Mr Babbitt, a Harvard law school graduate, was Arizona's attorney-general before serving 10 years as state governor from 1977-1987. He ran a creditable campaign for the Democratic party's presidential nomination in 1988. Nevertheless, his selection would raise some eyebrows in Washington, on the grounds that the administration is in enough difficulty without the removal of one of its most effective Cabinet members so early in Mr Clinton's term. Mr Clinton's preference for the court is for someone politically adept and middle-of-the-road, whom he knows personally and whose nomination would present few problems. Mr Babbitt, having passed scrutiny by the Senate this year for his present job, fits this bill, as would Mr Richard Riley, now the secretary of education, and reported to have declined recently a presidential approach to serve on the court. Judicial appointments have been a minefield for the president, which is ironical given that he and his wife are both lawyers. There were two botched nominations for the attorney-general's position at the beginning of his term and, last week, he withdrew the selection of Ms Lani Guinier to run the Justice Department's civil rights division. Although the federal bench, on which judges may sit for life, contains far more Republican appointees than Democratic, there had appeared no shortage of qualified candidates. After the Guinier fiasco, Mr Clinton badly needs someone whose confirmation would not be in doubt. AP reports: Mr Mark Gearan, a veteran Democratic campaigner who managed then-Senator Al Gore's successful vice-presidential campaign last year, was yesterday expected to be named as White House communications director, Now a deputy chief of staff, Mr Gearan would succeed Mr George Stephanopoulos.</p>

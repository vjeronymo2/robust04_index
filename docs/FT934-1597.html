			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Money supply figures hit German bunds German government bonds tumbled yesterday following the release of disappointing money supply figures, and the market proved unable to make up for lost ground later in the day, ending a quarter point lower. Most activity took place in the futures markets, while cash bond prices ended little changed, dealers said. Bund market participants had started the day awaiting the outcome of the Bundesbank's final council meeting for 1993, with some dealers hoping to see an easing. However, with the release in the morning of higher than expected M3 money supply figures, any hopes of a rate cut evaporated and the futures prices fell sharply. German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent in November, compared with a 6.9 per cent rise in October and well outside the central bank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range. Bund market participants were taken by surprise as money supply had appeared to be gradually edging down in recent months. In the three months to November, growth in M3 money supply was an annualised 7.5 per cent, compared with a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 5.5 per cent in the August to October period. At its council meeting yesterday, the Bundesbank left its key interest rates unchanged, and economists now expect the next reduction in the 5.75 per cent discount rate and 6.75 per cent Lombard rate possibly to take place early next year. The Bundesbank announced a 1994 M3 target of 4 to 6 per cent, which dealers said did not come as a surprise, adding that the targets have not been achieved in the last two years. UK government bonds continued their energetic rally following the latest batch of economic news showing that inflationary pressures remain subdued while the economy comes out of recession. Although the gilt market's upward momentum was interrupted briefly by the release of worse-than-expected German money supply figures, long-dated gilts gained half a point on the day, helped by the low inflation background, while short-dated issues underperformed, with a rise of about  1/16 point, as the chance of a near-term base rate cut appeared more remote. Underlying average earnings rose by 3 per cent year-on-year (seasonally adjusted) in October, after 3 per cent in September. Meanwhile, the number of unemployed fell much more sharply than the market had expected, with a provisional, seasonally adjusted 36,100 drop in November to 2.82m or 10 per cent of the workforce. The figures follow a steep drop in October, which was revised to a 52,100 fall from 49,000. Coupled with Wednesday's stronger than expected retail sales data, the sharp drop in unemployment means there is less reason to hope for an imminent base rate cut. On the funding front, the Treasury announced that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for November was Pounds 3.1bn. While this was slightly higher than market expectations, dealers said the news had little impact on the gilt market because funding pressures have eased in the wake of the Budget announcement. The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 gained  1/16 to trade at 106 1/8 by late afternoon while the 8 3/4 per cent stock due 2017 gained half a point to trade at 126 3/4 . The US Treasury market softened yesterday, but a further barrage of bearish news for fixed-rate investments barely dented bond prices in thin pre-holiday trading. In the first volley, the Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit had narrowed a touch in October but both exports and imports showed solid gains, suggesting increased activity despite sluggish overseas markets. That impression was reinforced by the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia, which said its index of regional business activity surged to 42.4 this month from 22.4 in November. Although a reading of 32 had been expected, prices stayed within the narrow ranges established over the past fortnight, suggesting the market had already adjusted to the accelerated level of economic growth in the fourth quarter. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/32 at 99 11/32 , with the yield rising to 6.294 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.182 per cent. South Korea plans to scrap its 10 per cent ceiling on individual stock holdings in listed companies from January 1997, Reuter reports. The finance ministry said the change would not apply to foreigners, who are restricted to holding 10 per cent of any listed stock. The ministry had earlier proposed removing the ceiling from next July.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Gatt chief to intervene in Europe-US oilseeds row MR Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will travel to Brussels and Washington within the next few days to urge the European Community and the US to resolve their oilseeds dispute and to reconvene world trade talks in Geneva. Ambassadors to Gatt made clear at an informal meeting with Mr Dunkel yesterday that they wanted him to talk to the two trading powers urgently. At today's emergency meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee, the top-level supervisory body for the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, Mr Dunkel is expected to be given a formal mandate to sound out the US and EC on getting the Geneva talks restarted. The hope is that this will increase the pressure on the two trading blocs to come to terms over oilseeds before the US-imposed sanctions deadline of December 5 and, if necessary, bring their broader dispute over farm subsidies back into the scope of the multilateral negotiations. Meanwhile, foreign ministers of the 12 EC countries agreed last night that negotiations with the US on farm subsidies should resume immediately to head off the risk of a transatlantic trade war. But the ministers also agreed the bloc would have to respond if Washington carried out its threat to slap massive duties on food imports from the EC on December 5, German economics minister Jurgen Mollemann told reporters. The 12 EC countries had earlier been split between French demands that the EC immediately start drawing up counter-retaliation plans against the US, and British and German wishes to get negotiations restarted immediately with Washington to head off trade war. 'You can't negotiate with a pistol to your temple', said Mr Bruno Durieux, the French trade minister. Nevertheless, only Spain, Belgium, Portugal and Greece rallied unequivocally behind France during the meeting. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, last week relinquished his responsibility for negotiating the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round because he felt Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was undermining him by siding with France. 'There is urgency about getting (the talks with the US) going,' a UK presidency official said, 'and it is obvious that there is a meeting on Wednesday,' referring to what could be a showdown between Mr Delors and Mr MacSharry. 'Let us say that there will be urgent disappointment if (after Wednesday) they haven't sorted themselves out.' The UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark - the countries most opposed to setting in train reprisals against the US - acknowledged that a majority of EC member states would back retaliation against the US if there was no settlement on the oilseeds row and Gatt within the 30-day 'cooling off' period before Washington acts. The breakdown of the US-EC farm subsidy talks in Chicago last week and subsequent threats of an escalating trade war have infuriated other countries involved in the 108-nation Uruguay Round, which is teetering on the verge of collapse. Trade officials in Geneva yesterday expressed bitterness that the US and EC had failed to take the necessary political decisions to resolve their differences and pave the way for a successful completion of the round.

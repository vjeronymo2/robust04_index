			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERC TRADERS TAKE BREAK FROM PITS TO LEARN ABOUT ETHICS;  </P> <P> COMMODITIES: ALL 2,500 MEMBERS OF THE FUTURES EXCHANGE IN CHICAGO ARE REQUIRED  TO TAKE THE COURSE BECAUSE OF LAST YEAR'S FRAUD SCANDAL.  </P> <P> They were stepping out of a frenzied blur: The flash of hand signals, the  brightly colored coats, the sweat and sore feet and hoarse voices of the young  (almost exclusively male) traders who are smashed together, all day long, on  the steps of the ruthless pits.  </P> <P> Here, on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago is still the  city of the big shoulders, the city that works, still my kind of town; here,  where billions of dollars change hands in incomprehensible fashion in the Swiss  franc pits, the live cattle pits, the Eurodollar option pits, Chicago still  does what it has always done best, which is to provide a forum for capitalism  at its most elemental.  </P> <P> And yet just minutes removed from that organized melee, just after gathering  their breath from shouting their last orders of the day, 55 of the Merc's best  traders and brokers were brought to a sudden stop on Monday, forced to step  across the street and into another world, where quiet contemplation would  replace raw economics.  </P> <P> The traders, still wearing their trading badges and vests, had come to the  Chicago-Kent College of Law across Wacker Drive from the Mercantile Exchange in  downtown Chicago for the first of the Merc's new ethics courses, now mandatory  for all 2,500 of its members.  </P> <P> In the wake of last year's explosive commodities fraud scandal on Chicago's  trading floors, the Merc's leadership had decided that a professionally  developed seminar in ethics would at least help make traders more aware of the  fact that, down in the pits, morals do apply.  </P> <P> "The whole course is designed to get them to reflect on what their behavior (as  traders) says about them as people, and what their behavior says about their  trading system," observed Donna Sockell, a business ethics specialist at  Columbia University's School of Business, who developed the program for the  Merc. "We're not really teaching ethics. We're trying to get them to pause and  reflect, to get away from the hustle of the pits and step back and think about  what their choices say about them."  </P> <P> Still, James Oliff, chairman of the Merc's ethics committee, stressed that the  program is, in a sense, just preaching to the converted. The dozens of traders  who were indicted or convicted in the federal inquiry have been suspended from  the Merc and thus have not been invited.  </P> <P> "We're approaching this as if our members are good, hard working professionals,  who are here to take some professional training," Oliff insisted. "If we just  encourage them to think about what their actions mean, then we've accomplished  our job."  </P> <P> Skeptics noted, however, that the course also performs another task for the  Merc, by providing good public relations just one week before the first  criminal trials are scheduled to begin in the widespread commodities fraud  case.  </P> <P> Some even say the new ethics program is symbolic of how much more aggressive  the Merc has been -- compared to the more traditional Chicago Board of Trade --  on the public relations front since last year's scandal. The Board of Trade,  Chicago's largest and oldest commodities exchange, is still studying whether to  require its current members to attend an ethics program, although new members  are exposed to ethics discussions during their orientation, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "The Merc has been more aggressive at public relations," observed Steven  Senderwotz, a former assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted criminal cases in  the commodities fraud area and who now defends traders in criminal cases. "The  Merc is trying to do things in-house, to try to convince regulators that  additional regulation is not necessary."  </P> <P> Still, the two-hour course did seem to make some impression; traders emerging  from the classroom on the third floor of the law school came away impressed.  "It was a good course, it was a good idea," said one trader who refused to give  his name.  </P> <P> "I was thrilled with their participation," gushed Richard Kling, the law  professor who conducted the first session Monday. "I went in expecting anger  and hostility from them, for having been forced to come here. There was some of  that initially; they are angry that the alleged misconduct of a few has  tarnished an entire industry. But eventually they became very involved in the  discussion. At the end, some of them said thanks, you've opened my eyes."  </P> <P> Although the session was closed to the press, Kling said the discussion focused  largely on "gray areas," forcing the traders to think about hypothetical  situations on the floor of the exchange in which the behavior described was not  necessarily illegal, but still unethical.  </P> <P> "For instance, we talked about what they would do if a customer said, 'I don't  care what you do in the pits, as long as you make money (for the customer),' "  said Kling.  </P> <P> "And," Kling added happily, "they all said they would be willing to say no to a  customer."  </P></p>

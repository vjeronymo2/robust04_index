			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fighting fit and looking for aerospace deals - McDonnell Douglas is emerging from a harsh restructuring with its focus sharpened McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group, has been building up financial muscle. It wants to put itself in a good position to take advantage of investment and acquisition opportunities for its core aerospace business. 'We have conducted an overall analysis of our industry and identified areas of business where an acquisition would make sense,' Mr John McDonnell, chairman, said. The company was considering internal investments to expand core businesses, as well as acquisitions 'if an opportunity comes along at a reasonable price'. However, Mr McDonnell said that it was not seeking to make a hostile takeover bid. In particular, it was interested in expanding its helicopter business and satellite launch activities, Mr McDonnell said. Barely two years ago, the US company had planned to shed its helicopter activities as part of its restructuring and recovery programme. However, Mr McDonnell said it had now decided to keep this business and expand it. He stressed, however, that the company was no longer interested in diversifying, and wanted instead to concentrate on strengthening its core aerospace businesses. 'We've learnt our lesson. In the late 1980s, I was the prime advocate of diversification in the company: now I'm the prime advocate for aerospace,' he said. The company's sweeping restructuring programme, which has reduced the workforce from 135,000 in 1990 to 67,000 at the end of the latest quarter, has given the group a strong capital structure. A 20 per cent increase in first-quarter operating earnings, to Dollars 259m compared with Dollars 215m in the same period last year, continued to help reduce debt. 'We reduced net debt by more than Dollars 400m in the first quarter, and our net debt-to-equity ratio is now down to 0.36, which is one of the lowest in the industry - lower than that of our principal competitors, including Lockheed and Martin Marietta,' he said. The company's strong recovery has been reflected in a leap in the share price, from about Dollars 48 at the end of 1992 to around Dollars 120 this year. Mr McDonnell said the outlook for the military aircraft business remained good. However, with continuing pressure on government defence budgets, he expected 'a reasonably stable' market rather than growth. The big challenge for the company's military aircraft business remains the troubled C-17 large transport aircraft programme. The company reached a settlement with the US government at the end of last year over the Pentagon's purchase of an initial batch of 40 aircraft. Under the settlement, McDonnell Douglas has been placed on a two-year probation while it makes technical and managerial improvements to the programme. The agreement is estimated to have cost the US government Dollars 348m and McDonnell Douglas Dollars 454m. 'This gives us until the end of 1995 to demonstrate we can deliver the aircraft on time, on spec, with high quality and at an affordable cost. If we do, it could lead to a programme of as much as 120 aircraft for the US Air Force and potential overseas sales to the UK and other countries, as well as some modest sales in the commercial market,' Mr McDonnell said. However, if the C-17 failed to meet the programme targets and the Pentagon cancelled it, the cost to McDonnell Douglas would be about Dollars 2bn in lost sales a year during the next decade. 'This programme will account for about 20 per cent of our government business in the next decade,' Mr McDonnell said. Although the company is trailing Boeing and the European Airbus consortium in the commercial aircraft field, its prospects have been boosted by Saudi Arabia's decision to buy up to Dollars 6.2bn worth of airliners for Saudia, its national carrier, from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Mr McDonnell said Saudia was expected to complete its analysis of its fleet renewal and expansion needs 'in the next month or two', and the company was hoping to win a 'significant slice' of the order. It is offering its MD-11 three-engine airliner as well as the narrow-bodied MD-90 and MD-80 aircraft. Mr McDonnell conceded that the world airline industry was continuing to have 'a hell of a time', but he expected the airliner market to bottom this year. 'I do see signs that we are coming out of the depression. I've been through three cycles. People have speculated that we would go out of the commercial business. It hasn't happened yet and it won't happen in this cycle,' he said. The company intended to remain in its two niche markets in the commercial business, with its MD-11 wide-bodied and MD-80, MD-90 and the planned MD-95 narrow-bodied airliners. However, Mr McDonnell said he had not abandoned the idea of forging an international alliance for the commercial aircraft business, with foreign partners acquiring up to 49 per cent of it.</p>

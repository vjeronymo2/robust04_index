			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Decline in loan losses boosts SE-Banken A big drop in loan losses enabled Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken to compensate for a weaker underlying performance in the first nine months and lift profits to SKr2.87bn (Dollars 400m) from SKr71m. Sweden's leading commercial bank said the SKr2.8bn improvement included SKr789m in capital gains. The main impact on the figures came from a 44 per cent cut in loan losses to SKr4.35bn. Like other Swedish banks, SE-Banken has benefited from lower interest rates and economic recovery and put behind it the crisis that brought it large losses due to collapsing property values in 1992. However, its result before loan losses was 7 per cent worse than a year ago at SKr7.23bn. Excluding this year's capital gains, the deterioration would have been 17 per cent. The worse underlying performance reflected: A 10 per cent reduction in net interest income to SKr6.36bn, caused by a continued drop in lending volumes and narrower interest rate margins. A 12 per cent fall in commissions, fees and foreign exchange earnings to SKr4.37bn. This reflects lower activity in most financial markets. A 5 per cent rise in costs to SKr5.95bn Excluding capital gains, the group's third-quarter profit was SKr602m, compared with SKr755m in the second quarter and SKr730m in the first three months. The bank said adjustments in the value of its investment portfolio were only taken into account at the year-end. It said the large rise in long-term interest rates this year meant the market value of its SKr82.4bn bond portfolio on September 30 was SKr963m lower than the acquisition value.</p>

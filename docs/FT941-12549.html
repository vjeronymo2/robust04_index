			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: UAP in UK bid talks Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurance company which has for some time hoped to expand into the UK non-life insurance market, yesterday confirmed that it was in negotiations with a possible acquisition target. It refused, however, to comment on the company's identity. 'We have made contact with a UK company but it would be premature to say more on the matter as our discussions are still at a preliminary stage,' the company said. UAP hoped to conclude a UK deal before the end of 1994 but it was 'unlikely' that the negotiations would be finalised 'for the next few months'. 'I think it's going to be one of the smaller unquoted vehicles . . . a big quoted company would be very difficult to digest,' said Mr Trevor May, an analyst with BZW. Mr Philip Hoyle, of Provincial Insurance, the UK's largest privately-owned company and a rumoured UAP target, said yesterday that his company is 'not in discussions with UAP'.</p>

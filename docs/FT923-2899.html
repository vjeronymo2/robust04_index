			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Growing 'green fuel' may be alternative to set-aside On the ground floor of the building that houses the Austrian Ministry of Agriculture in Vienna, there is a small display. Its backdrop is the familiar 12-star blue flag of the European Community. Its purpose is to promote among the administrators who work in what was formerly the War Ministry the concept of Austrian membership of the EC. Detailed negotiations with the EC are to begin in 1993. I was there to talk to Dr Adolf Hanser, who is involved in strategic planning of agricultural policies with responsibility for the promotion and exploitation of fuel oil from vegetable sources. Although other countries are planning or building their own bio-fuel industries, it is Austria that leads the world in the development of the technology to convert rape oil into diesel fuel. Since 1982 the country has been seeking the best and cheapest method to produce a vegetable-based fuel that will power conventional engines designed to run on fossil fuel. The scientists have perfected a fuel which produces only marginally less power per litre than fossil fuel, and which is much more environmentally friendly. They believe they are ready to go into commercial production. Indeed, a few days ago in Austria I visited the biggest bio-diesel fuel production plant in the world, with an annual capacity of 15,000 tonnes. It was in the final stages of being commissioned but will not hold the production record for long. There are similar plants under construction in other European countries, some of them scheduled to produce up to 100,000 tonnes per year. Most are based on Austrian technology. Unlike many of our European partners, however, the British Ministry of Agriculture appears to have little enthusiasm for oilseed rape-based bio-fuel, in spite of the fact that growing the necessary crops on set-aside land is specifically permitted under the terms of the CAP reform. Officials cite the fact that the positive energy balance - after what is used in the production process is accounted for - is small and that the cost in relation to that for fossil fuel is high. I wondered therefore why Austrian officials had reached a different conclusion. Dr Hanser told me that his country's interest in bio-fuel began in earnest in 1982 when, like most other European countries, Austrian cereal production became surplus to domestic consumption. The country was growing nearly 1m tonnes a year more than it needed. The cost of exporting this, however, was getting out of hand and ministry officials therefore sought alternative uses for the surplus land. Set-aside was considered but rejected. It would have been too expensive to compensate farmers for lost income over the area that it would have been necessary to take out of production, said Dr Hanser, and Austrian farmers would have hated to grow nothing but weeds. I know the feeling. It was decided to opt for what were calculated to be the cheaper alternatives of other crops such as peas and beans for protein and of developing a bio-fuel industry. This, it was judged, would at the same time respond to the growing demands of Austrian citizens for 'greener' policies. The basis of the bio-fuel initiative was that the government would forgo excise duty on bio-fuel and make it possible for potential refiners to buy raw rape oil at the world price by paying an area subsidy to farmers. This was calculated to bring the farmers' income per hectare of rape grown up to the level they would have received if they had grown wheat. If they had grown wheat, they would have received the Austrian guaranteed price of nearly Pounds 200 per tonne - almost twice as much as the present EC guaranteed price, which is itself to fall by 30 per cent because of the CAP reform. 'It is the government's responsibility,' Dr Hanser said, 'to ensure that the 6 per cent of the Austrian population who are farmers and farm workers are as well off as other comparable members of society. Prosperous farms help to keep our countryside beautiful and attract tourists. The people of Austria are happy to pay our farmers this money to keep the country looking how we and our guests want it.' Remembering the EC exhibit downstairs, I asked how he thought such a policy would fit in with Austria's proposed membership of the Community. 'We shall have to negotiate special permission to continue our subsidising policies at the same levels,' Dr Hanser replied, apparently oblivious to my raised eyebrows. However, the fact remains that Austria, which is paying more per hectare to support its arable farmers than in the UK, has still found it more economical and politically acceptable to support the production of environmentally friendly renewable fuel than to allow vast areas to be set aside. The Austrian government accepts that bio-diesel from rape seed will never produce more than about 5 per cent of its total fuel requirements. It even accepts that farmers may not always be the most appropriate people to use such fuel in their tractors. Nevertheless, Austrian farmers use roughly the same quantity of fuel as that produced from rape seed and the area is about the same as that used to grow hay for the horses that provided farm power 50 or 60 years ago. Austrian policy, because of the high cost of bio-fuel, is concentrating the limited supplies of it available in areas where avoidance of air and water pollution is important. The low emissions of carbon and sulphur from bio-fuel, for instance, make it ideal for powering snow-levelling machines on ski slopes. It can also be employed beneficially in activities where vehicles come close to natural water supplies, reducing the risk of pollution. Another use where the payment of a premium for safer fuel would be justified is in public transport in large towns, in order to reduce air pollution. Indeed, Friends of the Earth were urging such action in the UK only last week. I understand that the Reading bus company is about to begin running its vehicles on bio-diesel for a trial period to assess benefits to air quality. The fuel they will use, however, will be imported from Europe through a subsidiary of Ferruzzi, the Italian company. Good for Reading. Good for Ferruzzi. But British farmers and British refiners could be producing bio-fuel here. Next year about 15 per cent of our arable land will be set aside and growing little but weeds. Some could be used to grow environmentally friendly fuel. As in Austria, it would only provide a small percentage of total fuel needs. But it could help to improve the environment and avoid the waste of land and resources on farms. All it would take would be modest encouragement from the British government, which seems set on discouraging non-food crops on set-aside land. Other EC countries where bio-fuel technology is well advanced include France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Ireland. So why not in Britain too?</p>

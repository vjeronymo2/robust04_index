			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola Amatil pays more after good result COCA-Cola Amatil, the Australian soft drink and snack food company, has raised its annual dividend to 17.5 cents a share from 15.5 cents after a solid profit and sales performance in 1992. Net profit rose 13.8 per cent to ADollars 77.4m (USDollars 52.2m) on a 17.7 per cent sales rise to ADollars 2.1bn. But some gloss was taken off the result by an ADollars 11.6m adverse tax settlement which reduced earnings after abnormal items by 4.4 per cent to ADollars 65.8m. The result was achieved in spite of a 6.7 per cent decline to ADollars 33.7m from ADollars 36.1m in pre-tax profits from the snack food division, which was sold just after balance sheet date to United Biscuit of the UK. THe snack division increased sales and market shares, but was hit by reduced margins and higher input costs. Beverage operations, the largest in Australia, lifted pre-tax earnings 8.6 per cent to ADollars 182.1m.</p>

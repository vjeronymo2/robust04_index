			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO, EL TORO GIRLS PLAY TO 1-1 TIE IN SOCCER  </P> <P> After El Toro and Mission Viejo high schools battled to a 1-1 tie Thursday, El  Toro Coach Bob Chavez realized that poetry and girls' soccer don't mix.  </P> <P> "It's funny, the kids told me to read this to them before a big game," Chavez  said, holding a crumpled up piece of paper with the words "JUST DO IT."  </P> <P> "I guess they thought I was just reading poetry."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo (14-4-2, 4-2-2 in league play) dominated South Coast League rival  El Toro (15-3-2, 5-1-2) early, but didn't score until Nikki Charette's goal  with 10 minutes remaining in the half. The goal came after goalie Allegra  Garcia twice had denied Mission Viejo with diving saves.  </P> <P> "We were lucky it wasn't 3-0 before halftime," Chavez said.  </P> <P> During the break, Chavez discarded the "poetry" and screamed at his players  with his own inspirational message.  </P> <P> "In the the second half we were ready to play," Chavez said, "We started moving  the ball better, but we're in a scoring slump right now."  </P> <P> Chavez credited Mission Viejo's defense for his team's lack of offense.  </P> <P> Shawn Viloria's goal gave El Toro its second tie with Mission Viejo this year.  </P> <P> "I like games like this," Mission Viejo Coach Jim Dutton said, "Both teams  never quit, and any time we play El Toro, it's a war."

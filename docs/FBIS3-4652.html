			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- A South Korean  puppet radio recently spread a groundless rumor that forestry  workers of the DPRK in the far eastern region of Russia asked  for "asylum" in South Korea. Japanese, French, British and  other reptile Western media accepted the false report and are  working with extra zeal to spread the fiction of "defection" of  DPRK's forestry workers.    The rumor is an unfounded propaganda and sheer fabrication,  a  mere intrigue to do harm to the DPRK. This is a malicious abuse  and slander against the DPRK, a dignified country, and an  unpardonable insult to the Korean working class who are masters  of the country.    The DPRK Government bestows all solicitudes upon the Korean  forestry workers who are now working devotedly in the Far East  with a single resolve to contribute to the development and  prosperity of the country, so that they may feel not the  slightest inconvenience in their life. And it grants many state  benefits to their families in the homeland.    It is unimaginable for the Korean forestry workers to turn  their back on the beloved homeland and ask for "asylum" in the  cursed society of South Korea, the workers who are devoting  themselves to timber production with burning patriotic zeal,  encouraged by the good benevolence of the socialist system.    The rumor about "defection" of forestry workers spread by  the  South Korean puppets is a preposterous fabrication that could be  invented customarily by two-bit shysters accustomed to telling a  lie.    It is only too clear that the rumor spread by the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique as well as the persistent clamor about  "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK is aimed at tarnishing the  international image of the DPRK, doing harm to the cause of  anthropocentric Korean-style socialism and frustrating joint  timber production in the Far East at any cost.    It is not hard to gather that also lurking behind it is the  ridiculous intention of the puppets to divert elsewhere the  people's attention in a bid to extricate themselves from the  dilemma in which they find themselves now, hit hard at the 50th  meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights now open in Geneva  for the devastated human rights issue of South Korea.    Deserving attention is the despicable move of Japanese and  Western subsidized means of propaganda which readily accepted  the false report and are misleading the public opinion. They  have made no scruples of false propaganda, paying no heed to the  authenticity of their news, for their sinister political aims  and money-making. The unbiased public opinion cannot but be  angry at such filthy and base behavior of theirs.    Whatever intrigues the South Korean puppets and seditious  forces of the West may hatch up, they cannot break the Korean  people's singlehearted, rockfirm unity, nor can they destroy the  socialist system of the DPRK which is demonstrating its  invincible might. It is as foolish as trying to break a rock  with eggs to make an attempt at destroying the socialist system  of the DPRK with intrigues.    The South Korean puppets and seditious forces of the West  must look straight at the trend of the times and immediately  stop their false propaganda aimed at harming the DPRK.</p>

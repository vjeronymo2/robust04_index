			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HALL SAYS NO DEAL TO NEW 'DEAL'  </P> <P> It's anybody's guess whether game show host Monty Hall is out to beat the clock  or strike it rich. But apparently the sky's the limit now that he's bowed out  of a new "Let's Make a Deal."  </P> <P> Hall will not be the host when "Let's Make a Deal," the show he co-created,  produced and starred in for 4,500 episodes, returns to the NBC daytime schedule  this summer.  </P> <P> "I'm looking for new fields to conquer," said Hall, 64.  </P> <P> Hall, who keeps busy doing commercials and making guest appearances, may pop up  on the show from time to time as a surprise guest.  </P> <P> The new version of the show will originate from the Disney-MGM Studios Theme  Park in Orlando, Fla. Hall will remain a half-owner of the new version.  </P> <P> A former sportscaster, Hall also has been the host of such shows as "It's  Anybody's Guess," "Beat the Clock," "Strike It Rich" and "The Sky's the Limit."  </P></p>

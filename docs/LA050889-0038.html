			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Calling him "one of the most dangerous criminals to come out of society," a  district attorney has urged Kings County residents to sign a petition opposing  parole for Booker T. Hillery, convicted twice of murdering a Hanford girl 27  years ago. Dist. Atty. Garry Gonzalves was one of many county law enforcement  officials backing the petition drive prompted byHillery's 10th parole hearing  June 22. Fifteen thousand people signed the first petition circulated for a  parole hearing after Hillery was sentenced to a life term two years ago on his  second conviction. Hillery was convicted of stabbing 15-year-old Marlene Miller  in her throat with her own scissors as she sewed a party dress March 21, 1962.  </P></p>

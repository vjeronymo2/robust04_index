			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Norway braced for Italian backlash Erland Johnsen and the rest of Norway's defence are bracing themselves for an Italian backlash in their World Cup Group E clash in New Jersey today. 'E' is considered the toughest of the six first-round groups. Qualifying matches for the second round continue for another week. 'The Irish did us a favour by showing us that it is possible to play our way in this heat but they didn't do us a favour by beating Italy,' said the Chelsea defender. Ireland beat Italy 1-0 last weekend. The Italians are seeking more than the three points that will put than back into group contention and restore their battered reputation. 'We have to play like we're convinced we'll win,' said Italian midfielder Demetrio Albertini. 'We let Ireland dictate the game to us when it should have been the other way round.' Ireland remain favourites to win the group. Johnsen said: 'I'm sure Ireland will beat Mexico on Friday. They are very similar to us and Mexico will find it hard to play against that style. They don't like the muscular defensive play.'</p>

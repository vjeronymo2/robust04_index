			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / The FT Interview: The discreet intermediary - King Hassan An 'economic summit' in Morocco, over a thousand miles away, may seem a cruel irrelevance to relatives of those killed or maimed by last week's bus bomb in Tel Aviv, or to Palestinians thrown out of work by the indefinite sealing off of the Gaza Strip. But King Hassan II, who will open the Middle East economic summit in Casablanca on Sunday, believes it is highly relevant. 'Peace is not just a paper that you sign,' he says. 'Peace must have a content. It must forge common interests which put it beyond the reach of a new flare-up. The peace process has no meaning or reality unless it is accompanied by an economic development pro-cess.' This is not, he adds, a purely theoretical or long-term vision. He believes the Casablanca conference, to be attended by executives from leading multinational companies as well as heads of state and government, can and must 'provide answers in the short term which will change the everyday life of people in the region'. It must, he says, 'get across to political and business leaders both that this region has a formidable potential once peace is established, and that it has a desperate need for capital and jobs, which alone can make the peace process meaningful to the great majority of its people'. The 63-year-old king, interviewed in the slightly incongruous setting of his royal stables and stud farm, is no newcomer to the Middle East peace process. He has acted as a discreet intermediary in contacts between Israel and its Arab neighbours, and notably between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organi-sation. Last week, in a ground-breaking interview with Israeli television, King Hassan said Morocco had a special relationship with Israel, based on its continuing links with 600,000 Jews of Moroccan origin 'whom I consider my children even if today they reside in Israel'. An Israeli 'liaison office' in Rabat is to be opened today, as a step towards formal diplomatic relations. Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat will both be in Casablanca on Sunday, despite the tension between them caused by the violence of Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic resistance group. Well aware of the threat this violence poses to the peace process, King Hassan says he was not surprised by the Tel Aviv explosion. He thinks it may well be repeated, and both sides should be ready for that. But this, he says, is a reason to accelerate the peace process, not slow it down. A rapid move ahead to 'the second phase, in which the Israeli army will be redeployed and the PLO's administrative authority will no longer be confined to the Gaza Strip and the island of Jericho', would enable Israel and the PLO to work together more effectively to combat violence. 'The longer you confine this entity to such a small surface,' he explains, 'the more the dangers will multiply. It's like a theorem in physics: if you have a pressure of 1,000kg on a surface of one square centimetre, it's more dangerous than the same pressure distributed over two square metres.' The scientific simile is typical of a monarch who is determined to modernise his country, seeing no contradiction in the fact that his authority derives from centuries-old tradition and from religious faith. His only fear, he says, is that 'change is coming too slowly', and that 'if we do not change, Morocco may fall victim to its own administrative routine'. The younger Moroccan entrepreneurs look to him for support in taking on vested interests and opening the country fully to foreign competition and investment. Some say Morocco has actually benefited from the violent conflict between military repression and Islamic extremism in neighbouring Algeria: Moroccans are more aware that a liberal monarchy enjoying Islamic legitimacy is a precious asset. All the king will say in public on this subject is that 'Morocco is Morocco and Algeria is Al-geria'. In other contexts he stresses Morocco's advantage in having 'existed as a state for 1,200 years'. And he brushes aside any idea of a clash of civilisations between Islam and the west. 'On the cultural level,' he declares, 'the west and the Moslem world have contributed equally to world culture . . . We are just as cultivated as the west, and we will never clash with it on the level of culture or of civilisation.' Politically, however, King Hassan is far from satisfied with the current performance of western Europe. He says he is 'very sceptical' about the latest grand design from Brussels for a Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area. 'I'm a bit like St Thomas,' he says. 'I like to see before I believe. We've had so many promises from Europe. But Europe is expanding. It's trying to digest mentalities and social structures which are different from its own. It's trying to deal with everything at once, and with itself. That's why I don't feel so much resentment towards Europe: it is searching for itself.' Resentment shows through, all the same, and the irony gets heavier when he speaks of the different approaches the EU takes to its eastern and southern neighbours - the former being identified as future members of the Union, whereas his own application in 1987 (which he now admits he himself 'did not really believe in either') was laughed out of court. 'That doesn't hurt me,' he claims, 'because I think Europe remains an entity with a certain memory. They think of themselves as the whites, the colonisers, while we are the former colonies. We are not full citizens. We supposedly have no scholars - and yet we do have them. We have no great professors - and yet we do have them . . . 'And so they look for allies more to the east, because there people are white, . . . because it's one big family. And then they look across the Mediterranean and say: 'Ah yes, it's true, there are those poor little people that we colonised . . .' ' Religion, the king insists, plays no part in it. 'It's still the memory of the European colonial past which is at work.' In the last century, he points out, Europe produced a galaxy of scholars 'who had a perfect knowledge of Islam and of Moslem civilisation'. If Europe now fears Islam and associates it with violence, that is due to 'a regression on the European cultural level'. Yet he admits that 'there are faults on both sides', and he is hoping to improve matters through Ifrane University, Morocco's first private university, which will open its doors to Moroccan and foreign students in January. 'Inspired by American teaching methods', this will be 'open to all revealed religions'. But the students, paying a maximum fee of Dollars 5,000 a year, will be expected 'to specialise in an Islamic subject', as well as study technology and science, including economics and business studies, at the highest international level. By the end of a three or four-year course they will 'look at Islam in a new way', and will spread its 'real image' on their return to their own coun-tries. The languages of instruction at Ifrane will be English and Arabic, and the choice of English in preference to French is significant. One of the colonial legacies King Hassan and his countrymen are most anxious to escape from is what they see as a constricting tete a tete with Latin European culture. Perhaps for this reason, he is disappointed at the lack of official UK interest in the Casablanca summit. France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Austria will be represented by their heads of government, and the US by secretary of state Warren Christopher. Britain is sending only Mr Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the Foreign Office, rather than Prime Minister John Major or foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd. 'I should have liked Mr Major or Mr Hurd to come in person,' says King Hassan wistfully. 'After all, Great Britain has always been present in the Middle East, and it was with us in Morocco that she had her first commercial treaties.'</p>

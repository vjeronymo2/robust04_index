One of the two men responsible was arrested after the attack  Friday evening on the offices of the Social Democratic Populist  Party, they said.    No one has claimed responsibility but police attribute the  attack to the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which  has called for a boycott of next Saturday's local elections and  threatened reprisals against participants.    Offices of the centre-right True Path party, a coalition  partner, and the opposition Motherland Party have also been  attacked and a candidate of the centre-left Republican People's  Party was killed Thursday in nearby Kayapinar by unknown  assailants.    More than 10,000 people have been killed since the PKK in  1984 launched its armed struggle to take the southeastern region  out of Turkey.</p>

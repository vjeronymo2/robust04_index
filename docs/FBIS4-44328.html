			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dinfo Comes to an End"] </F>   [Text] The government has decided to wind up the Dinfo  [Military Intelligence Division] and to merge the Military  Intelligence Service [SIM] and the Strategic Defense  Intelligence Service [SIED]. The decision emerges from a bill  to which EXPRESSO has had access and that [Defense Minister]  Fernando Nogueira sent to the Assembly of the Republic yesterday  afternoon. According to the document, the new department will  come directly under the prime minister, through the minister  with the relevant portfolio.    The government seeks through this initiative to improve the  efficiency of the external security services -- whether of a  military, strategic, or economic nature -- adjusting that aim to  the material and human resources with which they are provided.  To this end, it proposes not only the existence of a smaller  number of officials but also the setting up of a single  department, having in mind improving the conditions of work and  of performing tasks.    The new body, which will be called the Strategic Defense and  Military Intelligence Services (SIEDM), will result from the  merger of the current SIM and the SIED, which, despite being  enshrined in the current law, was never set up.    According to Framework Law on the Intelligence Service of  the  Republic (SIR), there are currently three departments taking  part in the areas of the country's internal and external  security -- the Intelligence and Security Service (coming under  the minister of internal administration, it is devoted to  internal security), the SIM (which includes the Dinfo and comes  under the defense minister through the Armed Forces chief of  staff -- CEMGFA), and the CIED, which exists only in law.  <H5>  New Rules for Military Intelligence Agents </H5>   With Fernando Nogueira's new proposed change, the Dinfo  (which is still responsible for the defense of the country  against an external threat) and the CEMGFA disappear from this  structure. Despite the Armed Forces chief's removal from the tip  of the SIM's leadership pyramid, military personnel will  continue to make up the new body's cadres, except that they will  not be able to exceed 50 percent of the SIEDM's personnel or be  placed in a position other than that of a mere service  commission. Moreover, this will be the case with the civilians  to be recruited from the public administration, the ranks of the  judges and the state attorney's office, and the diplomatic corps.    In addition, military personnel who serve their service  commissions in the SIEDM will be subject not to Armed Forces  regulations but to those of the body itself. Through this  measure, Fernando Nogueira allays certain concerns expressed by  the opposition parties during the contacts that he had with them  last year. At those meetings, some party representatives  expressed misgivings about the excessive presence of military  personnel in the SIEDM and their activity.    However, as is common in other countries, the Armed Forces  will have just one military intelligence division (DIMIL),  intended to gather any specific operational intelligence -- not  any intelligence of a strategic nature. Even so, and in order  to reassure the opposition parties, Fernando Nogueira inserts in  the bill an article providing, within this vast restructuring,  that the Intelligence Services Oversight Council will assess the  DIMIL's reports.    So this is a kind of guarantee assuring politicians that the  military personnel will not exceed their duties within the  strict operational framework that will be assigned to them.</p>

This designation may be in addition to or in lieu of designation as a claims JA or claims attorney, depending on the local command needs and available personnel. When assertion of affirmative claims is a full-time responsibility of an attorney or JA, the table of distribution and allowances (TDA) position title can also reflect the recovery function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Designation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The chief of a command claims service, an area claims office, or a claims processing office with approval authority may designate an RJA or recovery attorney for all or part of the area of responsibility assigned to the service or office.

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Lang accused of gerrymandering MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, was accused yesterday of gerrymandering in his plans for reorganising local government in Scotland. The accusations followed publication by The Scotsman of details of Scotland's new council structure. The newspaper said the new system comprised only 28 single-tier authorities compared with the present two-tier system of nine regions, three island authorities and 53 districts. The Scottish Office refused to comment on the The Scotsman's revelations, but the 28-council structure is believed to be either the final proposal or a late draft and is in line with recent hints from ministers. Mr Lang is expected to announce the new structure next week. As expected, the new local authority plans involve the disappearance of four of the nine regions, including Strathclyde, which contains more than two fifths of Scotland's 5m population. The Lothian, Tayside and Central regions which, like Strathclyde, are all Labour controlled, will also disappear. Scotland's four cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, will each become unitary authorities. A total of 25 unitary authorities will be created, while the three island councils will be unchanged. The Scottish Office has argued that local government needs to be reorganised to make it simpler and more economical. Unlike in England, where a commission is taking evidence before making proposals, the Scottish Office has drawn up its scheme following the publication of a consultation document. Yesterday Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party accused Mr Lang of creating some authorities with anomalously small populations in order to try to protect existing Conservative councils or to construct new ones. The Tories control only five district councils in Scotland and hold none of the regions. Labour called the leaked proposals an 'act of revenge by a government which consistently puts its own interests first'. The Liberal Democrats called the plans 'grubby electoral self-interest'. The SNP said: 'The Tories cannot win control of Scotland at the ballot box so they are resorting instead to redrawing the map.' The new map shows Central region being broken in two, with Conservative-controlled Stirling district becoming a new single-tier council and the two Labour-controlled districts of Clackmannan and Falkirk being linked. A new council called East Renfrewshire would be created around Glasgow by extending the boundaries of Tory-controlled Eastwood district to include the Conservative-voting area of Barrhead. Mr Allan Stewart, the Scottish local government minister, is MP for Eastwood. The Scottish Office's proposals include replacing Lothian region with a new authority in Edinburgh, and merging Labour-run West Lothian and Midlothian into a single council called the Lothians.</p>

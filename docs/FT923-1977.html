			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: BES slips past the Revenue's curbs - John Authers explains how sponsors have reduced risk THE BUSINESS Expansion Scheme (BES), introduced to encourage investment in cheap rental housing, has slipped the bounds set for it by the Inland Revenue. The original idea was to offer investors full top-rate tax relief in return for two 'catches' - they had to put their money away for five years, and take a substantial risk. But the schemes put on the market for the present BES season seem to have eradicated both. BES sponsors started limiting risk by asking housing associations and universities to covenant to pay a fixed sum for BES shares after the five-year tax-exempt period had elapsed. But these schemes had no third-party guarantees from financial institutions. Now, however, several clearing banks have been persuaded to underwrite schemes. These companies are effectively as safe as the banks themselves. The latest innovation, which turns the tax shelter market on its head, is the non-recourse loan. Investors can take out a loan, with shares in a BES company as security. This allows them to realise their investments well within the usual five-year BES period. Taking out leverage to benefit from tax reliefs would normally be risky. If something went wrong with the BES, the borrower could find calls being made on his other assets. But a scheme introduced last week by Johnson Fry, and imitated immediately by others, allows for non-recourse loans. Under this scheme, the bank was allowed to recoup its money only from the BES shares and had no recourse to the borrower's other assets. This opens the way for stupendous returns simply by arbitraging the Inland Revenue. Johnson Fry was quickly imitated by Close Brothers' Bessa Blue Chip scheme, guaranteed by Barclays, and both issues are now almost fully subscribed. More schemes on similar lines seem certain to appear, however, as demand has proved to be exceptional. Under Johnson Fry's scheme, TSB's Mortgage Express agreed to lend investors an amount equivalent to 76p for every Pounds 1 they invested. Top-rate taxpayers would have received 40p in tax relief and so, in practice, would have invested only 60p. This is equivalent, after the delay in receiving tax relief is taken into account, to an annual yield of 19.8 per cent. Basic-rate taxpayers would only make a profit of 1p, having parted with 75p. Close Brothers then introduced a non-recourse loan with identical terms of 76p per 100p invested after one year, and also offered to lend money at 72p per 100p invested after six months - at about the same time the tax relief would arrive. According to Close Brothers, this is an annualised yield of 25 per cent. Terrace Hill Capital and Smith &amp; Williamson Securities are sponsoring two schemes (with guarantees from large banks) which will buy newly-built properties. Accumulus, sponsored by Terrace Hill, will buy properties built by developer Metfield Estates. After five years, Metfield will pay Pounds 1.25 for every Pounds 1 spent now to buy back the properties. If Metfield is unable to do this, the money will be paid by the Standard Chartered Bank instead. Loans are available after one year, but fixed-rate non-recourse terms have not been negotiated. Cavendish Wates Guaranteed, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, is similar. Wates, the developer, will build and then buy back the properties for the same price of Pounds 1.25 for every Pounds 1.00 spent now. Wates' ability to pay is guaranteed by Midland Bank. The equivalent annual yield to a top-rate taxpayer of both these schemes is 14.7 per cent - better than the TSB and Barclays' offerings, which work out at 13.8 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively if held for five years. Also on offer is the Third Johnson Fry University Cash-Backed scheme, which will buy property for Loughborough university. There are no special loan provisions, but the scheme is backed by a certificate of deposit held by the Law Debenture Trust Corporation. The rate over five years is Pounds 1.28 1/2 for every Pounds 1.00 invested now. A similar offer is available from Airways Assured II. However, analysts John Spiers of BESt Investment, and Anthony Yadgaroff of Allenbridge have both found fault with the estimated annual yield of 15.3 per cent published by the scheme. Spiers says it should be closer to 14.9 per cent, they say. The cash backing arranged for the scheme is sufficient only to cover 74 per cent of the necessary cash at the end of five years. Chamberlain De Broe, an independent adviser, is offering an execution-only dealing service for BES schemes at a charge of Pounds 50. Alan Greening, of Chamberlain De Broe, points out that locking in to the BES for five years could still be wise, as there is no way of knowing what tax shelter arrangements will replace it. According to Greening: 'You are sacrificing the long-term returns by opting for a short-term loan. We would recommend that after April 5, people should be locking up for five years because we don't know what the alternatives to BES are going to be.' He accepts that the non-recourse loan was 'almost a stroke of marketing genius' on the part of Johnson Fry, and he expects other banks to offer higher loans. He regards 80 or 90 per cent loans as feasible because many banks have large property portfolios. Less secure BES companies are on offer. Kerrington MaxiGrowth is the latest in a series of companies which buy property, rent it (hopefully, for high yields) and then aim to sell for a profit after five years.</p>

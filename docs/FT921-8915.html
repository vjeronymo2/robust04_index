			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Surge in car-part investment reported THE VEHICLE components industry is being revitalised by a surge of inward investment 'the like of which has not been seen for 40 years', according to an Economist Intelligence Unit report. The report identifies Japanese vehicle makers as leading the wave of investment. They will have the capacity to produce more than 700,000 units a year by 1995. The report forecasts that the effect will be felt throughout Europe as indigenous manufacturers are forced to adopt Japanese 'lean production' methods to remain competitive. Component makers will benefit as Japanese-style partnerships develop between vehicle makers and suppliers, in contrast to the adversarial relationship which has existed in Europe and north America. The report warns that any component supplier which is only looking to Europe is 'already behind in the race'. It goes on: 'It is essential that the component manufacturers of the future must be able to supply vehicle manufacturers on a global scale, wherever their plants are situated.' Highlighting the rationalisation which has taken place in the UK components industry over the past decade, the report identifies the emergence of 'a core of successful international players with a lean and efficient manufacturing base and a global perspective'. Among such groups 'breakeven is being steadily reined back, new partnerships are spreading the spiralling burden of R&amp;D costs and a renewed drive for quality is evident', the report says. It warns that a number of other suppliers have yet to respond effectively to the need for increased investment in research and development and other resources, or make the changes in attitude necessary for survival.

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: How sport can damage the national health - Injuries to amateurs and loss of production total nearly Pounds 1bn each year. But you can insure against disaster SPORT is supposed to make you healthier but the number of people limping back from skiing holidays, or appearing with an arm in a sling after a squash match, can give the opposite impression. A study by Sheffield University's medical school estimated that 8m days were taken off work every year in England and Wales because of amateur sporting injuries. Recurrent injuries accounted for another 3m days off. The study put the cost of lost production and treatment for all of these injuries at almost Pounds 1bn a year. Researchers found that while more than a quarter of injuries came from soccer, the most risky amateur sport was rugby, with 54 significant injuries for every 1,000 occasions of play compared with three per 1,000 in swimming. Another risk faced by amateur sportsmen is being sued for damages - say, if a golfer injures someone with a bad slice off the tee or a cricketer damages property with a towering six of the Botham variety. But insurance is available for all these eventualities; in fact, you might be covered already without realising it. Many sports groups, teams and clubs have insurance covering all their members for accidents, whether to themselves or others. But such cover tends to provide fairly low pay-outs, so you might find it prudent to take out another policy, either as a top-up with the same insurer or separately. If you have a personal accident or permanent health insurance policy already, you might find it covers injuries from the milder sports. But these policies often exclude horse, car or motor cycle racing, mountaineering, potholing, flying (as a pilot) and winter sports. Some may exclude 'violent' sports like rugby or karate or insist on special terms for them, such as higher premiums or a lower level of cover. Winter sports can be covered most easily with a travel insurance policy  - unless you indulge often, in which case an individual sports insurance policy could be worthwhile. A number of specialist insurers offer personal accident policies for one specific sport, often through an arrangement with its national controlling body. Some also cover sports equipment for theft and damage under the same policy. Ask your organisation about any scheme it might have. If you are an all-rounder who prefers to take part in a number of different activities, it could be worth your while to examine a policy of the type offered by Crispin Speers and Amsport, a subsidiary of Norex. This divides sport into three risk levels. You take out insurance at the level appropriate for your most dangerous activity; this then covers you for any other activity in the same or a lower category. Crispin Speers' (071-480-5083) amateur sports policy can be taken out for individuals or teams of up to 20 people. It divides a list of several dozen sports into three risk categories. The lowest includes badminton, golf, rowing and squash. Football, polo, martial arts and equestrian sports are rated medium risk; while rugby, American football, mountaineering and motor racing are high risk. The premiums are calculated in units of Pounds 100, and the amount of cover for each depends on the risk category. For an individual in a low-risk sport, Pounds 100 would buy accidental death and dismemberment cover of Pounds 25,000, permanent total disablement cover of Pounds 50,000, and temporary total disablement of Pounds 100 a week. For a high-risk sport, the same premium would buy Pounds 10,000 of accidental death and dismemberment cover, Pounds 20,000 of permanent total disablement, and Pounds 50 a week for temporary total disablement. A maximum of 10 units can be taken out, but Crispin Speers does not offer liability cover. Amsport's (071-895-9950) Gameplan policy for individuals lists 102 sports in three risk categories. The list is similar to that of Crispin Speers but the companies take a different view of some activities. Amsport defines water-skiing as high risk but Crispin Speers rates it as low. Cover comes in gold, silver or bronze versions. Gold cover provides a weekly benefit of Pounds 100; hospital benefit of Pounds 30 a night; dental fees of Pounds 275; physiotherapy fees of Pounds 300, Pounds 37,500 if you should lose a hand, foot, arm, eye or leg, or as a death benefit; and Pounds 75,000 if you should lose both of any of them, or for permanent total disablement. There is also Pounds 1m personal liability insurance and all the cover applies to any sport you attend as a spectator. Gold cover costs Pounds 124 a year for high risk, Pounds 84 for intermediate and Pounds 58 for low risk. A discount of 20 per cent is available if you opt out of the weekly benefit. Amsport also has separate policies for school-age footballers, as well as adult football and rugby teams. Wellesley (0279-626262) offers a policy for amateur sports teams of up to 20 people. The premiums are calculated by units and each covers each member of the team for benefits of Pounds 5,000 each for death, loss of an eye or limb, or permanent total disablement; Pounds 25 a week for temporary total disablement; Pounds 10 a night in hospital; and up to Pounds 250 for dental fees. A cricket team would pay Pounds 125 a unit, a football team Pounds 165 and a rugby team Pounds 450. Public liability cover of Pounds 1m is an optional extra at Pounds 75 for a rugby team or Pounds 50 for other team.</p>

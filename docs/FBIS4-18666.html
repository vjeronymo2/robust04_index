			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ari"-signed report: "Foreign Demand Results in 2-Percent </F> Increase in Industrial Production"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- According to the Munich-based Ifo  Institute, west German production will increase by approximately  2 percent this year. Production of the processing industries  declined by 7.7 percent in 1993.    Ifo expects a 5-percent real increase in export sales.  Domestic sales, on the other hand, are expected to go up only  slightly.    Positive stimuli by investments and stock cycles are clearly  weakened by an increase in imports and declining private  consumption. This was evident in the low domestic orders at the  end of last year.    Forecasts for the major sectors of industry indicate  differing results. Ifo expects a 1 to 2-percent decline (1993:  minus 5.8 percent) in production of electrical goods, a 4 to  5-percent decrease (minus 11.4 percent) in the textile industry,  and an 8-percent decline (minus 9.9 percent) in the clothing  industry.    West German mechanical engineering, which has lost  approximately one-fifth of its production since 1990 (1993:  minus 11.7 percent), can expect a slight increase of  approximately 1 percent in 1994.    The electrical industry's capital goods sector will increase  by some 3 percent (1993: minus 7.7 percent), which is partly a  result of major supplies to eastern Germany.    In Ifo's view, production of pickup trucks and trucks, which  declined by 25 percent in 1993, could stagnate even with foreign  demand slightly increasing. Production of sedans and station  wagons is, however, likely to increase by 5 percent, in spite of  domestic supplies slightly declining (1993: minus 19.5 percent).    Due to stronger impulses from the domestic market, the  chemical industry can expect production to increase by at least  3 percent in 1994 (1993: minus 2.2 percent). Since steel  consumption is going up again, the iron and steel producing  industry is expected to increase by some 2 percent (1993: minus  7 percent).</p>

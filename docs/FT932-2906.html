			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mandatory Pounds 87m bid for Watts Blake WATTS BLAKE Bearne, a 280-year business based in Devon and the world's biggest supplier of ball clay, is in danger of losing its independence following the launch yesterday of a Pounds 87m bid. Sibelco, a privately owned producer of silica sand for the glass industry based in Belgium, is bidding 420p cash per share for the British group. The offer failed to win unqualified approval from the City. 'This is a quality company with a unique product and unique assets. The price does not reflect the true long-term potential of the group,' said Mr Ian Hilliker, an analyst with NatWest Securities. Watts Blake shares, however, failed to rise above the offer price, and later fell back to 415p, a net gain of 24p. There is a loan note alternative on the basis of Pounds 21 for every five shares. The notes carry interest at 4.75 per cent and are redeemable at par in September 1994. The bid was sparked by a decision earlier this year by Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, to dispose of its 15.6 per cent stake. This triggered a concert party agreement under which Sibelco and Quarzwerke of Germany, each owning 14.8 per cent, were also required to put their stakes up for sale. The agreement also provided a formula allowing the partners to buy each other out. The combined offer for sale lapsed last month leaving Sibelco free to launch its own bid yesterday. Sibelco said yesterday it has arranged to buy the stakes of Ceramics and Quarzwerke. This would take its holding to 45.2 per cent, leaving it only 4.9 per cent short of winning majority control. It said the Stock Exchange requirement to make an offer once the holding had gone above 30 per cent was the impetus for the bid, rather than a desire to take over over the company. 'The purchase of the Ceramics stake really was a tidy up operation. Rather than have the stake overhang the market, we decided to buy it. Sibelco intimated that it was still 'early days' to say what it would do with Watts Blake if it acquired control. However, it had always held the current management of Watts Blake in high regard. Heavy sticky ball clay, which once produced tobacco pipes, is used worldwide to manufacture ceramics such as sanitary ware, wall and floor tiles and table ware. The largest deposit in the world, found in Bovey Basin near Newton Abbot in Devon, has been mined by the company since 1710. Watts Blake also owns extensive clay reserves in Germany and in the US where in 1989 it bought United Clays, the second biggest ball clay producer in that country. The company generates 85 per cent of its sales outside the UK, and estimates that it provides clay for 40 per cent of the European sanitary ware market, a third of the US market and half of the Far East market. It also claims to supply a quarter of the European and US floor tile market. Ceramics is thought to need new funds to support its other business interests; it has unconditionally agreed to sell its shares to Sibelco at the offer price. Quarzwerke, a private company producing silica sand, has also agreed to sell its shares 'subject to Sibelco's ability to purchase shares under the City Code.' The concert party agreement, negotiated in 1990, arose after Sibelco and Quarzwerke acquired the 21 per cent holding in Watts Blake previously held by English China Clay. They subsequently increased their stake when Ceramics sold part of its holdings to the continental European companies.</p>

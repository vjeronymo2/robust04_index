			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Ten arrests at unveiling of 'Bomber' Harris statue POLICE arrested 10 protesters yesterday at the dedication ceremony in central London of a statue of Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, the RAF chief responsible for the blanket bombing campaign over German cities in the Second World War. The arrests followed the unveiling of the statue by the Queen Mother, who was interrupted and heckled during a speech honouring Sir Arthur and the 55,000 allied Bomber Command aircrew killed in action. Scuffles broke out as protesters standing in a crowd of wartime veterans shouted 'Harris was a mass murderer'. The Queen Mother said that Sir Arthur was 'an inspiring leader' and that the bombing crews had 'given us hope and the means of salvation' during the war. The ceremony sparked protests in several German cities and was condemned by civic leaders in some towns hit by RAF bombers. The German foreign ministry and the mayors of Dresden, Cologne and Pforzheim protested at the memorial. The Queen Mother, patron of the Bomber Command Association which paid for the statue, performed the ceremony at St Clement Danes Church in the Strand.</p>

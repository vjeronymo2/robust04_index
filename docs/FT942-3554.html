Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said the company continued to operate in an aggressive and competitive environment. However, it had won a record number of orders, including increased work overseas. He added: 'At this stage of the year the future looks encouraging.' Taking into account the outlook the interim dividend is raised from 0.275p to 0.29p. Losses per share were down at 0.08p (0.56p) or 0.05p (0.43p) fully diluted. Turnover slipped to Pounds 21.4m against Pounds 22.1m including Pounds 594,000 from discontinued activities.

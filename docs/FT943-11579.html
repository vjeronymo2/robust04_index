			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Indian reform India's capacity to respond to economic crisis is remarkable. What is more questionable is the country's willingness to persist with tough reforms once a crisis has been overcome. There is an inclination towards complacency, if not sloth, instead. As the International Monetary Fund warns in this year's annual report, that is the risk India is running now. Much has been achieved since the country found itself on the verge of a default on its foreign debt in June 1991. The exchange rate has been floated; trade and industrial policy regimes liberalised; financial sector and tax systems reformed; inflow of foreign capital encouraged; and the budget deficit reduced. By last financial year 1993-94, the current account deficit had disappeared, as export performance improved (and the economy entered a period of slow growth). Simultaneously, an unexpectedly large inflow of private foreign capital led to a rapid increase in foreign exchange reserves, to some seven months of imports by the end of last financial year. The crisis had indeed been overcome. For all that, further reform is vital. Among the biggest remaining problems is the inefficiency of public enterprise. Of the central government's 237 active industrial enterprises, 104 lost a total of Rs39.5bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in the year to March 1993. The profits of most of the rest were inadequate, the total return on capital being a mere 2.4 per cent. Yet public enterprises employ 46 per cent of the capital stock and dominate essential industries, such as transport, telecommunications, banking, oil and electric power. Probably the main reason for the failure to privatise public enterprise  - and, indeed, to deregulate the labour market itself - is fear of organised labour. Yet the proportion of the labour force working in the public sector is a mere 6 per cent. The privileges of this tiny minority are being supported at the expense of the population as a whole. Equally bad, there has been a deterioration on the macroeconomic front. Last financial year the fiscal deficit was over 7 per cent of gross domestic product, not 4.7 per cent, as had been planned. There is growing concern that the deficit will not fall fast enough, while inflation has reared its head once more. It is not that Indian reform is to be written off, still less that another crisis is round the corner. The danger, instead, is that enough may only have been done to bring Indian economic growth over the rest of the decade to some 5-6 per cent, at best. This is not good enough for the future of India's impoverished multitudes. What is needed is more ambition and less toleration of mediocrity.</p>

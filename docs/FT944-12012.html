			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Yen The other side to the dollar's weakness is the continuing strength of the yen. Neither country is happy with the situation. While the US Federal Reserve waded into currency markets yesterday for the first time in many months, the Bank of Japan's intervention in currency markets has become increasingly frenetic. But buying dollars and selling yen alone will achieve little. Changes in monetary policy are needed in both countries. The Fed's approach to raising interest rates has been dilatory. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, who retires next month, has been giving the economy a valedictory twist of the monetary screw. Short-term market rates have been nudged upwards in the last few months and long-term rates have joined the global surge. The monetary stance is inappropriate. Japan's economy remains mired in the foothills of a painfully slow recovery. Despite the still low nominal interest rates, prices are falling fast - consumer prices dropped by 1.6 per cent in the three months to August. Real interest rates have risen by more than 1.5 percentage points in the past year. The risk of a deflationary spiral remains real, magnified by the threat from a still-precarious financial system. The trade surplus may at last have started to decline, but that alone will not prevent the yen rising yet higher. On current policy, Japanese investors see little reason to reverse the repatriation of their investments that has been at the heart of the currency's strength for so long.</p>

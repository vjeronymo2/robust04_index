			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Elections Commission [CNE] has decided  to use computers in the electoral process. This was revealed by  CNE chairman Dr. Brazao Mazula. He said the CNE's decision is  irreversible and does not depend on the political parties'  approval. Many opposition parties publicly opposed the use of  computers in obtaining election results, alleging that they  could be manipulated and that Mozambicans did not have enough  experience in their use. In an interview with DOMINGO, Brazao  Mazula said the political parties have been briefed on the CNE  decision.</p>

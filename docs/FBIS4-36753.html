			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-'Azim Darwish] </F>   [Text] As four political groupings are trying to establish  themselves as legal political parties, some opposition figures,  arguing that greater democracy is a powerful weapon in the  battle against terrorism, are hoping the national dialogue will  result in the removal of restrictions on the establishment of  political parties.    Under Egyptian law, a semi-governmental body called the  Political Parties Committee is empowered to examine and approve  or reject all applications for the establishment of political  parties. Those whose applications are rejected have the option  of filing an appeal with a special tribunal.    Opposition leaders view the existence of this committee will  disfavour, describing it as a sword hanging over political  pluralism, and would like to see it disbanded.    At present, four political groups, embryonic parties, are  vying for the blessings of this committee. They are:  Al-Mustaqbal (The Future) Party, whose founder, secularist  writer Faraj Fudah, was assassinated by Islamist militants two  years ago, Al-Wifaq al-Watani (National Consensus), which is a  Naserist faction led by Kamal Ahmad; the Egyptian Democratic  People's Party, a breakaway group from the Islamist-oriented  Labour Party, led by 'Adil Wali; and Nabil Fudah al-Nahdah  (Renaissance) which is viewed by many as a front for the  outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.    Ahmad Tal'at who, as Faraj Fudah successor, is fighting a  legal battle to legalise al-Mustaqbal Party, believes that  unrestricted freedom to establish political parties is a crucial  weapon in the war against terrorism. "Just as there are those  who raise the slogan that Islam is the solution, a counter-motto  should be raised that democracy is the solution," Tal'at said.    With Fudah's assassination in the back of his mind, Tal'at  believes that his party's principal battle will be waged against  "those who politicise religion or vest politics with religious  trappings."    Tal'at said, "There are those who argue that the principles  of Islam provide solutions to various problems, but they should  come forward with a specific programme outlining how those  problems will be addressed. But to content themselves with  merely raising this slogan is a form of intellectual  intimidation... What is required is a well-defined programme  that would be at the centre of extensive debate. No attempt to  impose certain views, and no threats of punishment or reward,  should be made."    Tal'at blamed the rise of terrorism on "the absence of  democracy and pluralism, in the shadow of a single party and a  single viewpoint. As a result, citizens despaired that changes  could be made peacefully by means of the ballot box. They split  into a passive majority and an extremist minority that believes  that changes should be imposed by force. The way out of this  dilemma is to broaden the exercise of democracy and remove all  restrictions on the establishment of political parties."    Tal'at emphasized that legalised political parties alone can  fill the political vacuum or else there will be attempts by  minority groups to impose their views on society and undermine  the very foundations of democracy.    Kamal Ahmad has been fighting legal battles for years to win  recognition for his Nasserist Al-Wifaq Al-Watani party. Ahmad  sought first to establish the party under the name of the  Alliance of the People's Working Forces. But he was denied  permission by the Political Parties Committee. He filed an  appeal with the special parties tribunal but lost again after a  seven-year fight. Now he has revised the party's platform and  changed its name to Al-Wifaq Al-Watani and is keeping his  fingers crossed.    Ahmad fought another related battle, contesting the  political  parties law before the Supreme Constitutional Court. He won a  court ruling that a section of this law was unconstitutional.  This is the section that makes support for the 1978 Camp David  peace accords with Israel a precondition for legalising any  political party.    'Adil Wali, a former MP and leading figure in Ibrahim  Shukri's Labour Party, has also been fighting for years to gain  a licence for his group, this time under the name of the  Egyptian Democratic People's Party. Wali belonged to the  "socialist" faction of Ahmad Mujahid that broke away from the  Labour Party five years ago. But he turned against Mujahid  afterwards and applied for the establishment of a Socialist  Party. The application was rejected, however, by the Political  Parties Committee as well as by an administrative court, with  which Wali had filed an appeal.    Wali did not admit defeat, however. He rewrote the party's  programme and filed another application, this time under the  name of the Justice Party. He was turned down again by the  Political Parties Committee and the Supreme Administrative  Court. Now he is making a third attempt, by filing an  application with the Committee for the establishment of the  Egyptian Democratic People's Party.    Leaders of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood deny any  connection with Nabil Fudah, who is working to establish  Al-Nahdah Party. But many political observers believe  Al-Nahdah, if it ever gains official recognition, will be  nothing more than a front for the Brotherhood, its passport to  legality.</p>

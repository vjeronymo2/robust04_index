			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: STATE LOTTERY IS NO BIG WIN FOR EDUCATION  </P> <P> They were buying tickets for the California state lottery this week at the rate  of 1,250 a second, drawn by a record jackpot of $67 million.  </P> <P> But don't think that this is just gambling. It's a state lottery, with the  money going for a good cause -- public education. As some of the early lottery  ads put it, "Our schools win too."  </P> <P> Even before the lottery began in 1985, however, California's superintendent of  public instruction Bill Honig was saying, "I wouldn't bet on it." Four years  later, the lottery was pulling in $2.6 billion a year, 39% of it, or $1.04  billion, earmarked for education. But state education officials say the gain is  offset by cuts in legislative funding. Many schools, expecting individual  allotments, are getting nothing because school districts are appropriating the  money to cover their budget deficits.  </P> <P> Lotteries have historically been an accepted way of funding everything from  public works to private colleges, although they have periodically fallen into  disgrace. Now, since New Hampshire instituted its state lottery in the  mid-1960s, lotteries have been proposed in almost all 50 states, and 32 states  plus the District of Columbia have them. Some form multistate lotteries,  knowing, says Paul Dworin, editor of New York-based Gaming &amp; Wagering  Business magazine, that "a lot of people will only play when the stakes are  huge."  </P> <P> Lotteries appeal to taxpayers and legislators alike as a way of raising money  without raising taxes. Actually, gambling of all kinds seems appealing now.  With annual gambling revenues estimated at almost $250 billion, the $15 billion  from state lotteries is just a small but significant part.  </P> <P> Indeed, this is gambling, justified by the cause and the assumed governmental  controls. Some states put money into general funds. Two-thirds have targeted  specific funds -- public education, senior citizens (Pennsylvania), parks  (Colorado), economic development (Oregon), even a fund for treatment of problem  gambling (Iowa). Most give half the winnings to winners, 35% to 40% to the  state fund, and up to 15% to the cost of operation (administration, marketing,  retailer commissions).  </P> <P> State lotteries do have detractors, often on moral grounds, and not just church  lobbies (whose objection may include competitive concern for their own  lucrative bingo games and Las Vegas nights). Lotteries also offend the American  work ethic, being an undeserving, unproductive, thoughtless, effortless way to  make (not earn) money.  </P> <P> Furthermore, linking gambling to education, say critics, makes gambling  acceptable, even commendable, to the nation's children. It's touted as good,  clean fun, and anyone can play. "The lottery is the cheapest ticket in town,"  says Dworin, "the most accessible, most benign form of gambling." The marijuana  of gambling, it could be a first step toward addiction.  </P> <P> Some object on grounds of fairness, saying that lottery contributions, while  voluntary, are like regressive taxation. The middle class may put more money  into lotteries, but the money poor people put in represents a higher percentage  of their income. The burden of funding schools is unequally spread.  </P> <P> There are also practical problems. California's PTA, among others, "opposed the  ballot proposition on the grounds that lotteries are not a stable source of  funding for education," says Harriet Borson, the state PTA's director of  legislation. Ticket sales are unpredictable and disbursements naturally  periodic, and "you don't know how much you have," says Borson, "till the end of  each quarter."  </P> <P> Nor is getting it guaranteed. New York has dedicated lottery funds to education  for two decades, but the legislature simply canceled the gift when money was  needed elsewhere -- to fund the 1980 Winter Olympics, or just to balance the  budget.  </P> <P> Many objections are wiped out when people think the lotteries work, i.e. raise  money for the chosen goal. And they do raise money, passing over to state  governments now an average of 38.5% of revenues (New York is tops at 45%).  </P> <P> Unfortunately, it may be just a drop in the particular bucket. California's  lottery money has never contributed more than 4% of the annual K-12 education  budget. Florida's education commissioner calculated that the lottery funds  received for education in 1988-89 covered just five days of school.  </P></p>

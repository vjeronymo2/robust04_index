			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Christophe Lamfalussy: "The Irreplaceable Mr. </F> Dehaene?"]    [Text] Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose popularity is far from  evident, has just benefited from the most effective and least  costly of promotional campaigns, courtesy of the GUARDIAN  newspaper. Last Wednesday's edition [9 March] of the British  daily reported that the Belgian prime minister is Helmut Kohl  and Francois Mitterrand's preferred candidate to replace Jacques  Delors.    This cannot be verified. Dehaene is surprised, but it is not  impossible that his name is being considered without his  knowledge. This kind of appointment, which is settled by the  heads of state and government of the Twelve, is very insidious.  There are those who can be encouraged to become candidates.  And there are also jobs which you do not refuse.    Jean-Luc Dehaene owes his experience on the European  political scene to the term of the Belgian EU presidency. With  his rough manners, he was not an obvious candidate to impress  anyone. But, situation after situation the Belgian prime  minister succeeded in demonstrating his ability to solve crisis  situations. President Mitterrand in particular is indebted to  him for having settled the differences between Paris and  Brussels on the site of the European Parliament.    To consequently conclude that he is the Paris candidate,  however, would be rather hasty. He is no doubt preferred by  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a Christian Democrat, who would like to  squash at the earliest opportunity the candidacy of Sir Leon  Brittan, a British conservative who is campaigning as European  commissioner.    There will be much speculation until the European summit in  Corfu 24-25 June. In the meantime, why not support the  candidacy of a Belgian as head of the European Commission, even  if it does mean denying ourselves his services?    It is true that the Belgian domestic situation has worsened  and that Jean-Luc Dehaene brings a certain cohesion and  stability. But if we are forced to conclude that there is  nobody in Belgian politics to replace him, we must then also ask  ourselves what exactly Belgium would be losing, as it would  greatly benefit from having a Belgian as president of the  European Commission.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY LEAGUE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL SHOWS CHAMPIONSHIP FORM IN VICTORY  </P> <P> Foothill High School had every reason to sleepwalk through its regular-season  finale against Santa Ana Friday night.  </P> <P> The Knights came into the half-empty gymnasium at Santa Ana as the proud owners  of the Century League championship, having clinched the title last Friday.  </P> <P> Foothill also was Orange County's ninth-ranked team and was riding a nine-game  winning streak.  </P> <P> The Knights could have turned in a forgetable performance in a meaningless  game, but the they didn't, routing Santa Ana, 75-54.  </P> <P> The victory pushed Foothill's record to 18-6 overall, 10-0 in Century League  play. It was the first time in the school's history the Knights had gone  undefeated in league play.  </P> <P> "We went 13-1 in 1982-83," Foothill Coach Jim Reames said. "It's tough to go  undefeated in this league."  </P> <P> Santa Ana had won the past four Century League titles.  </P> <P> Guard Mark Wilkinson had 23 points, most on quick drives that led to layups and  and short jump shots, to lead Foothill. Center Fred Amos added 17 and forward  Nick Konopisos 15.  </P> <P> "We're playing pretty good basketball right now," Reames said. "The last few  games, the margins have been 15 to 20 points. Hopefully, we'll get a good  seeding, maybe one of the top four in the (Southern Section) 3-AA."  </P> <P> Playoff pairings will be announced Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> Foothill led, 20-8, at the end of the first quarter and the game was never in  doubt. By halftime, the Knights' lead grew to 38-17.  </P> <P> Konopisos had nine points and Wilkinson six during the pivotal second quarter  when Foothill outscored Santa Ana, 18-9. A 9-2 run by Foothill over the final  4:18 of the half decided the game.  </P> <P> With a victory out of reach, Santa Ana's smooth forward Chauncey Woolridge took  the opportunity to show off his jump shot. And his drives to the basket. And  his leaping ability. And his rebounding.  </P> <P> Even in defeat, it was an impressive display.  </P> <P> Woolridge had a game-high 25 points, missing only one of his eight shots from  the field in the second half.  </P> <P> A fade-away, eight-foot bank shot and a pretty, stop-and-go move that set up a  fast-break layup were the most impressive of his 19 points in the second half.  </P> <P> Woolridge was the only scorer in double figures for the Saints (10-13, 5-5).  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Canyon 51, El Modena 49 -- Abdi Barkhordar scored on a layin after a steal by  Dan Bottiaux with about 40 seconds left to give Canyon a lead that held up at  El Modena. Barkhordar had a game-high 18 points for Canyon (14-10, 7-3). Kevin  Wilborn added 16 for Canyon. Jeff Leedom led El Modena (13-11, 5-5) with 14  points.  </P> <P> Villa Park 58, Santa Ana Valley 55 -- Aaron Boone scored 17 points and Alex  Vicario 11 to lead host Villa Park (3-17, 2-8) to its best league record since  1984. George Alvarado had 26 points for Santa Ana Valley (4-16, 1-9).  </P></p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown strengthens election stance MR Paddy Ashdown (above) yesterday further hardened his party's negotiating stance if the Liberal Democrats hold the balance of power in a hung parliament after the election. He said his party was prepared to force another election almost immediately if his terms for a coalition were not met. Speaking on BBC's Panorama programme, Mr Ashdown said he was prepared to see that the 'government is removed if they have ignored the view of the electorate.' He has stressed that a commitment to electoral reform for the House of Commons and an agreed legislative programme for a full parliament would be preconditions of Liberal Democrat support.</p>

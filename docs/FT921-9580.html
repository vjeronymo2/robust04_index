			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (Campaign Profile): Ashdown's Bonnie Prince Charlie SHORTLY after the 1983 general election the boyish Social Democratic Party MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye dashed from the Commons chamber, anxiously seeking the advice of a colleague. He was supposed to be replying for the party in a complex debate on the Scottish rate support grant. He turned to his ally and confessed: 'I have never paid rates in my life.' Mr Charles Kennedy, now president of the Liberal Democrats, still suffers from having responsibility thrust upon him at an early age. Just 32 years old, he has been an MP for almost a decade. With his pillow-like face and deep-set eyes, neat streak of glowing red hair and a reputation as Westminster's most likeable chap, he will take a leading role in the Liberal Democrats' election campaign, touring constituencies and providing television 'sound bites'. Not too high a profile, however, because Mr Kennedy has yet to show that a bonnie prince can be a powerful Liberal Democrat force, perhaps a future leader. He has still to demonstrate full mastery of policy details and prove he can be a philosopher king, even in a minority party unlikely to see much increase in the election from its current 22 MPs. For now, Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, sets the Liberal Democrat vision; Mr Des Wilson is the election strategist. Mr Kennedy's colleagues are almost as disappointed by his lack of application as they are smitten by his human warmth. He is a bon viveur, a wit, a charmer who always has time for everyone. He is someone with an urgency to get on with enjoying life, for whom a good joke can save a thousand policy lapses. 'He is the Prince Hal of the party,' says one senior official. 'He is still at the wine-and-song stage.' Mr Kennedy knows his biggest skill is as a communicator, rather than championing his social market politics. 'He has never made any pretence of being the party intellectual or thinker,' says one Liberal Democrat MP. Another says: 'He has kept it in check since he became president, but he did have a tendency to be flippant at the party's expense.' But there is a borderline between communicating as a politician and as a journalist which Mr Kennedy sometimes fudges. Since winning the party presidency two years ago, he has appeared less as the party clown. But he still broadcasts regularly on radio for BBC Scotland and London's LBC. He also writes a column for The Scotsman. Few doubt he could make his money from professional punditry. Liberal Democrats have a hard time grabbing prime time in the Commons' chamber. But Mr Kennedy does not compensate with the press conferences or campaign launches beloved by his more ambitious colleagues - even though he is a spokesman on health, one of the biggest election issues. It is as if he would prefer to be on the other side, asking the questions and calling the shots. Inquiries at the Liberal Democrats' Westminster office for speeches on Mr Kennedy's political philosophy suggest that his reputation as a wag predominates. 'Are you looking for the sense-of-humour line?' asks the press officer. In fact Mr Kennedy openly admits that his conversion, first to social democracy and then to the Liberal Democrats, 'was not a great conversion on the road to Damascus sort of thing'. As a teenager his sympathies were 'fairly moderate, sort of centre-right of the Labour party', but his greatest enthusiasm was debating. In Fort William, where he was born, he won a Scottish schools' debating competition. He loved the clash of arguments and inventive interlocution. At Glasgow University he decided against joining the Labour club when he discovered that it was gripped by an aversion to all things elitist and did not take part in the debating society. Instead he turned to the new Social Democratic Party - and particularly its founder member, Mr Roy Jenkins, now Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. He joined the SDP team which won the Glasgow Hillhead by-election. A year later, while studying in the US at Indiana University he applied to be SDP candidate in the geographically vast Ross, Cromarty and Skye constituency. He was surprised to be selected, and more aghast when he beat the sitting Tory MP with a majority of 1,704. After the 1987 election, he was the most eager of the five SDP MPs to merge with the Liberals. Lord Jenkins remains a mentor. Mr Kennedy's political philosophy, as far as it goes, mixes social market economics and quotations on liberty from John Stuart Mill with Lord Jenkins' warnings on the tyranny of the current political system. Like all Liberal Democrats, Mr Kennedy wants proportional representation for elections. But he is pragmatic, rather than passionate. He is a Catholic but not fanatically religious. He has a high regard for Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, who saw politics more as a vehicle for achieving influence, less about the power of ideas. In that he differs from the radicalism of Mr Ashdown, who has set a sweeping Liberal Democrat agenda - pro-Europe, internationalist, anti-monopoly, and strong on individuals' rights, education and the environment. So far there is no evidence of friction between Mr Ashdown and Mr Kennedy. The roles they have carved are mutually exclusive. Mr Ashdown leads aggressively from the front, expecting his colleagues to follow. Mr Kennedy is happy to share the bandwagon if it is going roughly in the direction he wants. He works hard on the 'rubber chicken' circuit - the endless constituency annual general meetings and after-dinner speeches. Where the clash with Mr Ashdown might come is if the Liberal Democrats held the balance of power after the general election. As much as Mr Ashdown has gingered up the party's radicalism, so he has also ratcheted up the conditions for his support. He is determined to force constitutional reform and an agreed agenda for a four-year government. Mr Kennedy is perhaps less ambitious. He was a supporter of the 1977-78 Lib-Lab pact which saw the Liberals gain little in terms of policies implemented. On his own, he might settle for less than Mr Ashdown. A devolved assembly for Scotland might be enough. Yet maybe rebellion is too much to expect of Mr Kennedy; he shows little inclination to rock the boat, he is in no hurry for power. His strong following among Liberal Democrats would make him a popular choice in the party to succeed Mr Ashdown. But he may want to learn a little more about rigour and ruthlessness in politics first.</p>

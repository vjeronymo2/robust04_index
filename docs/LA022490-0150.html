			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CLASSES MAY RETURN TO CLOSED SCHOOL  </P> <P> The Fullerton School District is considering reopening Maple School for  specialized programs while continuing to use it as a community services center.  </P> <P> That recommendation for the closed elementary school was contained in a report  to be considered during a public hearing at 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Maple  Senior Multiservice Center, 701 S. Lemon St.  </P> <P> The report was written by a task force of school and city officials, along with  members of the public.  </P> <P> The Fullerton School District leases space at the school to the city and other  organizations providing community services. Services include day care, Head  Start classes and the Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, which provides  short-term housing for the homeless and emergency food supplies to low-income  residents.  </P> <P> Supt. Duncan Johnson said he would like to see those services remain but add  specialized school programs for some students. Maple School would not be  reopened to provide regular classes, he said.  </P> <P> The task force recommends holding specialized classes at the school, such as  advanced academic classes and specialized language classes for students  learning English as a second language. The school should be open to  preschoolers through sixth-graders from throughout the district, the task force  said. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

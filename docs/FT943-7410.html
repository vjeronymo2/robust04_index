			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Markets in perspective The tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve a week ago today was warmly received by the world's equity markets, although the performance was not all one way. Malaysia and Mexico featured on the positive side, although the latter's 3 per cent gain on the week in local currency terms could be attributed to expectations ahead of last weekend's presidential election of a victory for the ruling PRI party. Malaysia, too, was driven higher as much by domestic news as by that coming out of Washington. Good inflation data for July helped prompt the upward move, while an announcement from the central bank on regulatory changes in an effort to encourage the flow of overseas funds into the country was an additional stimulant.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     % change  % change                    % change in local currency *   sterling* USdollars*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of  Start of                                              1994      1994      1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria         +0.12     +1.10    +4.85     -6.89     +0.12     +4.77 Belgium         -1.21     +0.04    +3.53     -5.08     +3.31     +8.12 Denmark         -0.51     -5.17    +3.14     -4.04     +2.18     +6.93 Finland         +4.08     +2.43   +24.84    +19.81    +31.07    +37.16 France          -0.27     -1.32    -3.25    -10.46     -4.37     +0.07 Germany         +1.00     +0.01    +8.03     -6.60     +0.67     +5.36 Ireland         -1.74     -1.47    +5.78     -1.27     +2.17     +6.91 Italy           +2.95    -10.11    +3.96     +7.67    +12.15    +17.35 Netherlands     -0.59     +0.29    +8.69     -4.31     +2.73     +7.50 Norway          +1.20     -0.97   +11.38     +4.73    +11.07    +16.23 Spain           -2.45     -1.32    +0.38     -7.99     -2.61     +1.92 Sweden          +0.30     -2.38    +8.09     +1.46     +4.77     +9.63 Switzerland     -0.81     -1.11    +5.22    -11.52     -2.88     +1.64 UK              +1.40     +2.61    +4.32     -6.01     -6.01     -1.64 EUROPE          +0.57     -0.10    +4.22     -6.06     -1.95     +2.61  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia       +0.45     +0.59    +8.78     -4.12     -0.28     +4.35 Hong Kong       -0.48     +3.11   +27.48    -21.61    -25.09    -21.61 Japan           -0.49     +0.64    -0.80    +13.01    +22.39    +28.07 Malaysia        +3.82    +16.66   +49.41    -10.38     -9.47     -5.27 New Zealand     +0.74     +4.15    +4.18     -2.62     -0.31     +4.31 Singapore       +0.87     +6.14   +23.62     -7.30     -5.14     -0.73  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada          +0.55     +1.29    +7.23     -0.80     -8.76     -4.52 USA             +0.36     +2.42    +1.47     -0.26     -4.68     -0.26 Mexico          +3.28    +19.46   +45.42     +3.86     -8.83     -4.60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa    -0.84     +4.55   +45.28    +18.34     +8.53    +13.57  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX     +0.19     +1.51    +3.15     +1.07     +2.56     +7.32  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on August 19th 1994.

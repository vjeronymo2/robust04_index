			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Monetary union 'may be delayed' ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in Europe has cast doubt on the ability of European Community member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published yesterday. The Treasury and Civil Service committee's report says it is not confident that seven of the 12 member states, including Germany, will be able to fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in January 1997. It will not be achieved before 1999 if Germany does not meet the criteria within the next four years, says the committee and in view of Germany's difficulties this may not happen. In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread belief among politicians in France and Spain, and probably elsewhere in the community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in 1997. Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean that prospects for monetary union would disappear, it says. The report says that only limited progress has been made in preparations for the establishment of the European Monetary Institute and the European Central Bank.

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / French minister praises political ties with London THE UK government's drive to forge closer ties with its fellow conservatives in France won reciprocation yesterday from Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, who hailed 'the excellent climate' that had been achieved in Anglo-French relations in the past two months. In an interview published in yesterday's Le Figaro, Mr Juppe said France's relationship with Britain was 'not an alternative, but a complement to' its compact with Germany. The Bonn-Paris relationship was the European Community's main motor, but not the sole one. The minister said as the EC grew, it would have to let certain members take the lead in certain areas. A Community of 15 or 17 members 'will not be able to do everything all together', he said. He added that it was obvious 'France, Germany and Britain have a special responsibility for security'. In general terms, Mr Juppe attributed the identity of interest between France and Britain to the fact they were 'old and great powers' whose permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council gave them a special role. But this has been cemented by very close co-ordination between the two governments in the Bosnian crisis. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, was the first minister Mr Juppe met after he assumed office. Meanwhile, the British prime minister, Mr John Major, is to visit Paris before the end of this month - one of the first foreign leaders to call on the new centre-right government.</p>

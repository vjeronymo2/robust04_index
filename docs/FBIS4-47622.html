			<p>Summary:       Amidst the growing controversy over the influence of  satellite television on Middle Eastern opinion and public morality,  a Saudi-owned weekly magazine has suggested a technological means  for Saudi Arabia and other regional nations to regain control over  the television media.  Quoting American and British experts in cable  and microwave technology, AL-MAJALLAH suggests that the current  system of direct satellite reception by consumers should be replaced  by national cable television grids that will ensure quality program  content and reduce the cost of reception equipment for the consumer.  The hard copy version of this Foreign Media Note contains 2 cartoons  with captions.     The Arab world has witnessed a rapid rise in the use and  popularity of satellite television since the end of the Gulf War.  The MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY (25 Mar 94) reported that "CNN woke  up millions of people in the Middle East to the fact that there was  a satellite alternative to the worthy but dull outpourings of state  television."  The growth in Middle Eastern demand has been matched  by rapid expansion in the supply of Arabic-language satellite  programming to the region.     The Saudi-owned Arabic weekly AL-MAJALLAH of 16 April 1994  provided a brief summary of the major Arabic-language stations:     Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC):  A London-based, Saudi-  owned, single-channel service established in 1991 that is planning  to expand to four channels in 1994.     Arab Radio &amp; Television (ART): Saudi-owned and based in Italy.  Currently broadcasting on 4 channels.     Egyptian Space Channel (ESC):  Egyptian-government owned station  that benefits from an extensive archive of Egyptian movies.     Orbit Satellite Television &amp; Radio:  Saudi owned, Rome-based  multi-channel television service which is due to begin operations in  1994.  Plans call for 20 channels.     Dubai Satellite:  Single-channel, state-owned service that  provides news and entertainment on a 24-hour basis.  This is  currently the only Arab station that is available worldwide.     Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia have also opened satellite services.     Debate on the Merits of Satellites     The growth in satellite broadcasting has touched off a discussion  of its merits and dangers in the Middle East press over the past few  months.  Articles and cartoons in the government-owned Egyptian  press, for example, have described the cultural impact and  commercial opportunities afforded by satellite programs, while the  opposition press is warning that satellite broadcasting will bring  either increased political control over viewers or, if left  uncontrolled, corrupt viewers' morals.     Egyptian journalist Muhammad 'Abu-al-Futuh expressed the fears of  many concerning the impact of satellite television when he argued  (AL-SHA'B 22 Feb 94) that the satellite dishes bring more "poison,  immorality, and decadence" than benefits, which makes them a  "ferocious threat that must be resisted."   He observed that the  "obscene and homosexual programs that the dish will bring us are  more dangerous than cancer and AIDS.  It is the intellectual and  cultural (equivalent of) AIDS."  Exploring other negative aspects of  satellite TV, the 1 April issue of AL-SHA'B warns that the new  Arabic-speaking stations will simply become further instruments of  political control designed to limit society's access to a variety of  political opinion.     Another perspective is provided in the 23 March issue of Egypt's  semi-official AL-AHRAM, which boasts that the Egyptian satellite  channel, Egyptian Space Channel (ESC), has become an effective  culture voice for Egypt among Arabic-speaking viewers abroad.  Under  the headline "Egyptian Space Channel Wins First Prize During (the  holy month of) Ramadan,"  AL-AHRAM reported that according to its  survey, ESC's programming attracted more viewers in Paris than any  other Arab station.  Respondents to the AL-AHRAM survey expressed  strong appreciation for the station and requested an expansion of  its cultural programming.     The commercial promise of satellite broadcasting for Arab  business and advertisers has also attracted the attention of the  regional press.  AL-MAJALLAH and the MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY,  for example, follow media trends and report market penetration  figures for satellite stations drawing on sources such as the  influential media index published in February 1994 by the Dubai-  based Pan-Arab Research Center.  Publications such as Egypt's AL-  MUSAWWAR (1 Apr 94) have described an intense struggle among  satellite stations for market share.  AL-MUSAWWAR's 1 April article  introduced the topic of commercial satellite competition under the  headline of "Satellite Channel War in the Arab Skies."  Despite the  intensity of the competition, AL-MUSAWWAR also indicated a degree of  common ground among Arab broadcasters.  In its interview with 'Amar  al-Laythi, the director of the Middle East Broadcasting Center, AL-  MUSAWWAR quoted him as saying: "All things considered we can assume  that we (Arab broadcasters) have a common goal which is to fight  against the foreign satellite channels and to pull Arab viewers away  from them."     Controversy over the impact of satellite television is directly  related to the vast success of satellite programming in the Middle  East over the past two years.  The TEHRAN TIMES (FBIS NC1404125094)  of 10 April, for example, cites another Iranian daily as estimating  that some 400 new dishes are being installed on Tehran rooftops  daily.  The MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY (25 Mar 94) referred to a  "dish craze" in Saudi Arabia where "it is estimated that there are  more than 150,000 dishes (installed) and that at least 1 million  people have access to satellite television services."  Although  specific statistics are not available, the satellite phenomenon is  widespread throughout the Middle East, especially in circles that  can afford the relatively expensive reception equipment.     Governments' Response     In response to the perceived threats of foreign influence and  corruption of domestic viewers, authorities in Egypt, Saudi Arabia,  and Iran have begun imposing varying levels of control on satellite  viewing.  AL-HAYAH of 27 March reports that two Egyptian provinces,  Daqahliyah and Dumyat, have ordered that satellite dishes be removed  from the roofs of coffee shops, clubs and other public places.  Meanwhile, the 25 March THE MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS WEEKLY reports a  total ban on private ownership of satellite dishes in Saudi Arabia,  and in Iran the 10 April TEHRAN TIMES announced that  "the use of  satellite dishes is not illegal, but will need to be authorized."     Proposal to Counter Satellites     Against this backdrop of fear and controversy, the Saudi-owned  AL-MAJALLAH devoted its 16 April cover story to discussing cable  technology as a possible solution to the perceived threat of  satellite broadcasting:     "Many specialists in worldwide satellite communications believe  that cable systems for capturing satellite broadcast will be the  path of the future for many Arab states.  With the increasing number  of satellite broadcasting facilities outside the geographic confines  of the countries, the only means to guide and control this sector is  through national cable systems, which may later evolve into regional  systems and nets."     The AL-MAJALLAH article focused specifically on a microwave  technology known as MMDS (microwave multi-directional system), a  point-to-multipoint broadcast system compatible with cable  technology.  Citing American and British experts in the field, AL-  MAJALLAH explained that MMDS can support the rebroadcast of 24 to 56  ground and satellite channels.  Local microwave/cable operators  retransmit the programming to subscribers who pay an annual  subscription fee and receive the signal via a small, inexpensive  antenna.     From AL-MAJALLAH' point of view, the MMDS approach has  advantages for national authorities, advertisers, and viewers.  Its  first advantage is the ability "to monitor the broadcast content to  be sure it is consistent with general good taste."  The presence of  national cable grids will also enable advertisers to better measure  the market and adjust their programming and advertising accordingly.  The consumers too will profit because the MMDS antennas are far  cheaper than conventional satellite dishes, and the MMDS approach  enables the subscriber to select and be billed for only those  channels actually wanted.     Return on business investment may also represent a reason for  introducing MMDS technology into the Middle East.  The MIDDLE EAST  BUSINESS WEEKLY article 94) suggested that at least in Saudi Arabia  the elimination of direct consumer access to satellite transmissions  could create a lucrative market in retransmitting satellite  programming for some Saudi investors:     "The Saudi decision (of 10 March 1994 to ban private dish  ownership) means death to the market in satellite dishes, but not to  satellite television.  Earlier this year, it emerged that ARA  International Products Company of Riyadh, an affiliate of (the  Saudi-owned) MBC, had been authorized to set up a microwave multi-  directional system (MMDS) television service from Riyadh.  It is  understood plans call for the new service to provide up to 15  channels, including the two Saudi state television channels and  MBC."

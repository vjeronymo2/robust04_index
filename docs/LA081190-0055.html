			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> RAY CHARLES DELIVERS RICH HORN OF PLENTY;  </P> <P> THE FAMED R&amp;B SINGER DELIVERED A RANGE OF MOODS AND STYLES TO THE COACH  HOUSE THAT NEARED PERFECTION.  </P> <P> Ray Charles doesn't work long, and he certainly doesn't work cheap, but his  work was something close to perfection Thursday night at the Coach House.  </P> <P> Charles, who will turn 60 next month, was in startlingly good voice throughout  his early show, the first of four sold-out performances in a two-night stand  (that's about 1,500 tickets sold at $39.50 a shot, the bulk of which probably  goes to Charles for the sort of payday that can really make a guy look like a  genius).  </P> <P> As usual, Charles' set clocked in at a precise and punctual 55 minutes,  including a five-minute warm-up blow by his 16-man band. But if the overall  framework of a Charles show is strictly bounded, the 11 songs he inserted  within it Thursday were the essence of musical freedom and unchained  spontaneity.  </P> <P> Charles' range of moods, styles and textures turned those 50 minutes into a  cornucopia, with his voice giving full embodiment to the concept "horn of  plenty." He rang true with cottony, deep-grained intonations to create a  cloistered intimacy during ballads, or he blasted forth with piercing falsetto  cries that served as exclamation points for more exuberant soul workouts. He  consistently held and shaped sustained notes more firmly than you'd think  possible for a graying icon.  </P> <P> An unbalanced sound mix left things a bit unfocused at the start, and an  abbreviated, if frisky, "Busted" was cause for some slight concern early on,  especially when Charles swung immediately into "Georgia On My Mind." But the  loving, unpredictable rendition he gave that chestnut erased any fear that this  was going to be a short hour of casually tossed-off hits. For the rest of the  show, Charles made every moment seem uncharted and full of invention -- whether  on an achingly lovely ballad like "She Knows," a driving soul shot featuring  the five Raelettes doing a strong impression of Aretha and the Sweet  Inspirations, or a friendly, gospel-ized Charles takeover of a standard like  "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning."  </P> <P> The show would have been a delight if Charles had played it with his hands tied  behind his back. The fact that he frolicked just as freely with his fingers  doubled the delight. No purist, Charles has discovered digital technology with  a vengeance. He made liberal use of the electronic keyboard colorations at his  disposal, changing timbres, bending notes, making his piano sound like a  distorted blues guitar or a ringing vibraphone or even a synthesized bass --  and doing it all in a way that was light, playful and fully in sync with his  orchestra.  </P> <P> Charles' band had a marvelous set too. It's hard to imagine a horn section --  13 members strong -- playing with a better blend of magnificent clout and  sensitive control than Charles' crew. Typically, Charles uses his Orange County  club dates at the Coach House or the Crazy Horse Steak House to get the kinks  out of his ensemble before a major tour, and he isn't loath to chastise players  for their imperfections right on the bandstand. This time, there was nothing  for him to do but whoop with delight at the sound around him and holler yet  another "Oh, yeah." The same went for a crowd that made a good investment, even  at premium prices.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text of speech by D. Vasilyev, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation State Property Committee, given at the All-Russian  Conference "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and  Development of the Stock Market" held in Izhevsk in late March:  "Completion of Check Privatization: Problems of the Present and  Future"]    [Text] Check privatization is coming to a close. What  are the results of it? To what degree was the path of market  transformations chosen the correct one? What did the citizens of  Russia receive? What will happen with the check investment  funds? The participants in the All-Russian Conference "Problems  of Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the  Stock Market" held in Izhevsk in late March sought the answers  to these questions.    Today we are presenting an account of the speech made  at this conference by the chairman of the Russian Federation  State Property Committee [GKI], D. Vasilyev.    Privatization has taken place. By 1994 most Russians had  become stockholders. Last year 39,000 enterprises were  privatized, in all 86,000 enterprises since the start of  privatization. Thirty-one percent of the enterprises were  privatized through the creation of joint stock companies, and 69  percent--through their sale. As a result, large and medium-sized  enterprises became truly private and the state's share in them  is now less than 25 percent. Half of the people employed in  Russian industry work in these enterprises and half of the  country's industrial potential is concentrated there.    So, half of Russia is already bourgeois, although the other  half remains socialist. Our job in the remaining 3 months is to  privatize 70 percent of all enterprises, turn Russia into a  more-or-less bourgeois country, and create the foundation for  continued progress toward private ownership and market trade.    At the present time, privatization encompasses all sectors  of  the national economy, including, despite the long-time  opposition, the fuel and power engineering complex. The  military-industrial complex has also embarked on privatization,  and the proportion of enterprises banned from privatization  there is only about 30 percent; the rest will be privatized, and  most of those will undergo check auctions.    Despite the difficulties, more than 85 million checks have  been collected. This is of course not enough to say that all the  problems have been resolved. As we certainly assumed, the  situation in terms of regions is very differentiated. Even now,  against the general background there are 10-15 outstanding  "peredovik" [leader] regions (that is the old term, but there is  no other as yet) where the number of people employed in private  enterprises is on the order of 69 percent. They include St.  Petersburg, Samara, Sverdlovsk and Vladimir oblasts,  Arkhangelsk, and others. In those places the question being  resolved is not so much privatization as it is attracting  investments. The enterprises are preparing for a second issue,  developing business plans, and deciding questions of raising  economic efficiency.    But the situation is more complicated in some regions. And  accordingly certain social, economic, and political problems may  arise there. These are regions where the number of checks  collected is substantially lower. About 20 regions are included  among those where less than 20 percent of the checks have been  collected. The GKI's task is to provide them with all kinds of  help. This is necessary since the population takes a fairly  serious attitude toward the checks.    But just what problems related to this will arise in the  near  future? What is the situation regarding use of the population's  checks?    Unfortunately, a large part of the population (this is an  objective reality) have not used their privatization checks and  are confused over how to do it. In accordance with Russian  peculiarities, a large part of the population will go to give up  their checks at the last minute. That is to say, if we do not  take advantage of April and May to actively influence the  behavior of people as investors, June will be a tense period for  some territories. That means those regions where there are many  checks and a sufficient number of privatized enterprises have  not been readied. If we do not rectify the situation,  disappointment awaits people. They will have the right to ask  the question, why their vouchers were not supported with the  necessary objects of investment.    But what must be done to avert the looming conflict?    The first direction is to speed up check auctions. In  accordance with the instructions of Mr. Chubays, more than 160  of the largest enterprises in Russia are being put up for  auction in May-June. Among them are more than six oil industry  installations, Gazprom [Gas Industry], "Norilsknikel" [Norilsk  Nickel], the largest nickel-producing monopoly enterprise, and  most steamships. It is remarkable that for the first time  military-industrial complex installations are being included in  our schedule. They will be sold at interregional check auctions.    Apart from GKI activity, it is important to assess the  results of the work at the local level. How are the  opportunities being utilized for those enterprises which are  being sold throughout the country's territory (for example, the  Russian Joint Stock Company YeES [Unified Power System] of  Russia)? Very poorly. That is precisely how we can describe the  situation where a region participates in an all-Russian check  auction and collects 100-200, a maximum of 1,000 checks, and the  enterprises put up for auction are enormous. Usually four  regions collect 75 percent of the checks (Moscow, St.  Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and Omsk). The rest of the regions do  a poor job of taking advantage of these opportunities. The  reasons are on the surface, as always. Information-explanatory  work is being handled extremely badly, and there is not enough  of it--people do not know the elementary things. But they must  know them; namely, what is being sold, at what times, and where  the application can be made.    A great deal depends on the local organs of power. We are  going to survey the regions and find out how their  organizational potential is being utilized. We can no longer  talk about how there are no enterprises for sale now. Every week  5-7 major enterprises are put up for auction and they are sold  within a month. So on the order of 23-30 major enterprises will  be sold at the same time. Accordingly, the effectiveness of the  use of receiving points will be raised, and so on.    The second direction is regional check auctions. What is  happening here? An ordinary person who makes rational judgments  above all gives priority to local enterprises, since it is more  convenient for him to participate in assembling stockholders,  the location is more familiar, and the like. But, judging from  the existence of plan schedules for regions (and there are now  55 of them in the GKI), by-no-means all territories are ready  for this work.    If the process of privatization is analyzed from the  standpoint of selecting possible ways to create joint stock  companies, clear preference is given to the second variant which  allows the labor collective to obtain the controlling bloc of  stock. Three-quarters of the enterprises which became joint  stock companies chose this variant of privileges. One often  hears that such an approach closes off opportunities to  influence an enterprise and control it. I do not quite agree  with that. For example, in St. Petersburg the danger of the  second variant does not particularly disturb anyone, since a  simple process occurs because the securities market is developed  and privatized enterprises are fairly attractive. The altogether  normal, healthy process of buying up stock from the enterprise's  employees begins right during the closed subscription or after  it is over. And two forces operate here; on the one hand, the  director buys up the stock, and on the other, the outside  investor, who usually acts through brokers. As a result, the  proportion of the outside investor increases substantially if he  puts effort into it.    The picture is different in regions with an undeveloped  securities market, where the directors face the task of making  themselves the "chairmen of the kolkhoz" at their own  enterprises. The solution to this situation is to continue to  accelerate development of the stock market and buy up stock from  the labor collective members and the directors. How much time  will be needed to do that? In St. Petersburg this process takes  an average of only 9 months. And essentially there is no  enterprise where such an opportunity would not exist.    Privatization in Russia has brought a new institution with  it, check investment funds [ChIF]. We can now already say that  ChIF's not only have come into existence, but they represent a  real economic force. They have collected more than one-third of  the vouchers and represent the interests of more than 30 million  stockholders. Their activity does not contradict the fundamental  interests of developing the Russian economy. When they interact  with the management of privatized enterprises, ChIF's make such  demands as investing in production and following a market  strategy. The ChIF's are a new institution in the stock market  which has the smallest interest in inflation; this distinguishes  them from commercial banks. The latter pump preferential state  credits through themselves and are completely indifferent to how  they are used in the economy and whether they are returned or  not. The ChIF's occupy an altogether different position. They  have a real social base to resolve the question of financial  stabilization. Such a base did not exist in 1992-1993 and  accordingly the problem remained. The situation has changed now.  And that inspires the hope that there will be a turn for the  better in 1994-1995.    The GKI is trying to assist the ChIF's, and that includes  using measures envisioned in the state privatization program.  Basic attention has been devoted to tax questions, the  possibility of having blocs of enterprises' stock, and  determination of the ways to conduct stockholder meetings. Today  the question of corporate management is becoming the focus of  the agenda after making enterprises joint stock companies is  complete. Very soon the Law "On Joint Stock Companies" is to be  discussed. I think that in connection with this the government  faces serious disputes, since the question will arise: how will  enterprises be managed when the lack of control over directors  reaches the maximum.    There is one more problem: who will participate in the  capital of our enterprises? I have been, am, and will remain an  opponent of commercial banks' participating in the capital of  industrial enterprises. Only investment banks and investment  institutions which will engage in long-term crediting but not  cashier service to clients can have this right. Let them invest  and participate in the capital of industrial enterprises. That  is the fundamental issue.    These and other important questions must be resolved soon.  "Voucher" privatization is coming to an end, and we must  determine what has been accomplished, and how, and where we  should go from here. Life itself will answer many questions.  But for now the agenda includes developing a strategy for the  next stage of market reforms.</p>

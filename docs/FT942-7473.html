			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Lasmo board comes under attack: Chairman reiterates call for small shareholders to reject bid Lasmo, the oil exploration company, yesterday took its battle to fight off a hostile bid from fellow explorer Enterprise Oil directly to its share-holders. The prospect that even relatively small investors may play a decisive role in determining Lasmo's fate meant that Mr Rudolf Agnew, chairman, and Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, had to be particularly persuasive in convincing those who attended the meeting at London's Barbican of the wisdom of rejecting Enterprise's overtures. Mr Agnew dismissed as 'junk paper' the Pounds 1.4bn Enterprise bid, which so far does not have a cash sweetener. 'The Enterprise bid is a nonsense. There is no reason why Lasmo's shareholders should give away their bright future to solve another company's internal problems,' he said. The new chairman also dismissed concerns expressed by one shareholder that there might be some truth to Enterprise allegations that Lasmo will remain financ-ially weak in spite of its recent rights issue. 'We're in good nick,' he said. Mr Agnew had more problems when another shareholder recited a litany of alleged violations of the Cadbury code on corporate governance. In a statement which was warmly received from the floor, the shareholder criticised the rolling contracts enjoyed by some directors. He also questioned whether 'overtime' provisions for the chairman and deputy chairman amounting to Pounds 700 a day were warranted. A suggestion that Lasmo's directors freeze their salaries and other forms of compensation until the dividend could be raised substantially was also warmly received from the floor, in sharp contrast to the icy glare from Mr Agnew. He accused the elderly shareholder of being an 'effective' propaganda tool for the 'opposition'. He also claimed that Lasmo conformed to the Cadbury code, although he made no secret of his distaste for many aspects of it. 'Much of Cadbury is linked to an economy in marked decline,' he said. Mr Agnew said he would look at the idea of freezing directors' salaries, although he 'was not sure what it might accomplish'. As for his own role, he was prepared to leave if that is what shareholders wanted. After all, he said, 'I don't have to work for you.'</p>

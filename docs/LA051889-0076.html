			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LATINO ACTIVIST TOVAR BACKS BERNARDI IN COUNCIL RACE  </P> <P> Latino activist Irene Tovar endorsed Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani  Bernardi Wednesday for the June 6 runoff election, saying he had proven his  dedication to the northeast San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "I respect people who show their interest in the community by being involved,"  Tovar said at a news conference outside the Pacoima Community Center. "I don't  think you can just come out of the clear blue."  </P> <P> She said she did not believe that Lyle Hall, Bernardi's opponent and a city  fire captain and former firefighters union president, had been involved enough  in the community.  </P> <P> Hall, in an interview, defended his record in the community, particularly with  respect to the labor movement and various anti-graffiti and business leader  groups.  </P> <P> "I've always tried to be active and involved in community affairs, because I  think that is important," he said.  </P> <P> Tovar was one of six candidates who ran against Bernardi in the April 11  primary. She came in fourth with 10% of the vote. She said she waited so long  to announce her endorsement not because of uncertainty about Bernardi, but  because she had surgery shortly after the primary.  </P> <P> Tovar acknowledged that Bernardi's decision to make this his last term played a  role in her endorsement. She said she would consider running again in four  years.  </P> <P> Many Latino leaders believe a Latino candidate would have a better chance in  1993 if Bernardi wins now and then steps down, than if Hall wins and runs  again.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he has made no commitments to endorse anyone when he leaves  office. "Four years from now is a long time," he said.  </P> <P> The 7th District, as reapportioned in 1986, is more than half Latino. Both  Bernardi and Hall have wooed Latino supporters during the runoff campaign.  Several prominent Latinos, including state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles),  have supported Hall.  </P> <P> Echoing a group of 18 Latino leaders who endorsed Bernardi in April, Tovar  applauded the councilman's efforts to supply more police to the area and his  work against gangs, drugs, graffiti and the proliferation of liquor stores.  </P></p>

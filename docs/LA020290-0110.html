			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEC PROBES FIRST INTERSTATE OVER $400-MILLION RESERVE  </P> <P> First Interstate Bancorp said Thursday that the Securities and Exchange  Commission launched an informal inquiry related to the $400 million that the  bank set aside last December largely to deal with its problem-plagued Texas  unit.  </P> <P> The intent of the inquiry wasn't disclosed, but when banks or other firms set  aside large sums to cover potential losses, questions are often raised about  whether adequate and timely disclosures were made.  </P> <P> A First Interstate spokesman called the inquiry routine. He quoted from a Jan.  8 letter from an SEC staff member in Washington that said the request should  not be taken as "an indication by the commission or its staff that any  violation of law has occurred" nor that it reflects wrongdoing by any person at  the bank.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based banking company has been plagued by problems with its  units in Texas, where it made the untimely acquisition of ailing Allied  Bancshares in early 1988, and in Arizona, where it has been hurt by that  state's soft real estate market.  </P> <P> In December, First Interstate disclosed that it would set aside $400 million in  provisions largely to deal with problem real estate loans in Texas. Two months  earlier, First Interstate disclosed a $350-million provision for real estate  problems in Arizona. Those moves resulted in a $124.5-million loss for First  Interstate in 1989.  </P> <P> The Arizona provision was made after a review by officials from the Office of  the Comptroller of the Currency. First Interstate disclosed Thursday that its  Arizona unit must abide by unspecified rules related to its lending practices  and other matters, under an agreement reached in January with the regulators.  </P> <P> First Interstate is trying to sell 7.5 million shares to replenish its capital,  the financial cushion that banks maintain against losses.  </P> <P> As it does, institutional investors and securities analysts are growing  increasingly critical of how its management has disclosed its problems,  complaining that the bank has surprised them too often over the past two years.  </P> <P> Some investors and analysts were especially angry when the Texas problems were  disclosed just weeks after the Arizona announcements. They contend that the  bank should have disclosed all of its problems at once.  </P> <P> Bank executives in previous interviews have denied that there was any intent to  space out the announcements. Last month, the bank disclosed that Joseph J.  Pinola, who has taken the brunt of the criticism, will retire on June 1, to be  succeeded by Edward M. Carson, the company's president.  </P></p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Strong yen widens Japan's trade gap The combination of a strong yen and rapid growth in the country's principal export markets pushed Japan's trade surplus higher again in July, according to preliminary figures published yesterday by the Ministry of Finance. The customs-cleared merchandise surplus rose last month by 4 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 12.3bn (Pounds 7.9bn), the highest July figure on record and the fifth largest for a single month. Exports rose 6.9 per cent to Dollars 34.44bn, and imports grew 8.5 per cent to Dollars 22.15bn. The longer-term trend suggests the surplus is narrowing, but only slowly. In the three months to July the figure was 2.3 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago. The steep appreciation of the yen in the last few months has kept the dollar-denominated surplus stubbornly high, as the value of the country's exports has risen rapidly. The politically troublesome surplus with the US was Dollars 5.6bn last month, up 20 per cent on a year ago. A Ministry of Finance official attributed the sharp rise to the high yen and the strength of the US recovery. He noted that the rate of growth was slowing, but said prospects in the next few months would depend on developments in the currency markets. The most important factor in the long-term movement of the trade balance, however, is the pace of Japan's economic growth. The government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) yesterday gave a slightly more upbeat assessment of growth prospects, although once again it refused to state unequivocally that a recovery was under way. In its monthly report it contented itself with observing that 'bright spots have been spreading lately and there are movements towards pulling out of the slump - but gradually'. Its reluctance formally to declare a recovery contrasts with the assessment of the Bank of Japan, whose governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, on Wednesday repeated its view that the economy was 'headed for recovery'. Yesterday an EPA official said 'the situation is not such that the word 'recovery' can be used,' citing continuing weakness in capital spending and uncertainty about the yen. Meanwhile, corporate bankruptcies declined last month by 0.3 per cent from a year earlier, according to figures published yesterday by the Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency. Total cases fell to 1,126, the first year-on-year drop for four months.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Observer: Distance no object The use of distance as an excuse for inaction has certainly not diminished since Neville Chamberlain dismissed Hitler's 1938 invasion of the Sudetenland as a quarrel in a 'far away country'. But the old excuse has been shunned by Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny. Outside his homeland, he is best known for his championship of the environment, not least as leader of the Business Council for Sustainable Development at the 'earth summit' in Rio in June. Hence his embarrassment when Observer's colleague in Chile subsequently reported on an iron-pellet plant there belonging to a company in which Schmidheiny has a 30 per cent stake. The plant was belching out 37 tonnes of iron dust and the like daily, more than 50 times the amount permissible in the US, and reputedly harming the local olive groves and sea fishery. Yet far from espousing the attitudes of its Swiss stakeholder, the company was fighting clean-up orders all the way to the Chilean supreme court. Confronted with the case, Schmidheiny said he'd known nothing about it, but would investigate. Now he's issued a statement on the results. True, it ruminates about the difficulties of implementing sustainable development policies in a country such as Chile. But Schmidheiny promises that the plant will be cleaned up gradually at a cost of as much as Dollars 30m.</p>

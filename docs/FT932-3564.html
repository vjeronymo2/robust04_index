			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Sweeping reforms of tax proposed FAR-REACHING tax reforms, including new ways of taxing international companies, and local referenda over tax levels are called for in a pamphlet published today by Demos, an independent think tank set up to explore radical solutions to long-term problems. Voters are unwilling to vote for tax increases, according to Demos, yet governments find it impossible to cut public spending. Taxes have become 'disconnected' from the services they finance, and taxpayers do not believe that higher taxes will produce better services. At the same time, the globalisation of production makes it harder for governments to raise taxes from business. International companies use low-tax countries to locate factories and declare profits. New strategies are needed to break these fiscal deadlocks facing governments across the world, Demos says. One reason voters are reluctant to support higher taxes is that financing public spending through general taxation has lost legitimacy, it says. In a less deferential consumer society citizens want to know where their money is going, and are suspicious of tax increases which are spent through behind-the-scenes negotiations in Whitehall. This problem could be overcome by linking tax revenues much more closely with the programmes they finance, Demos says. Taxes should be 'reconnected' to the services they pay for by earmarking particular taxes for specific purposes. This should be combined with a transfer of tax and spending power back to local authorities, with local referenda on spending over government limits. On health spending, Demos suggests that voters could be consulted on an additional Pounds 34-a-year tax, which would be used to increase real National Health Service funding by the 2 per cent a year needed to maintain the quality of service. A London Transport referendum could test support for an extra Pounds 1-a-week tax on every household to create a world-class underground system. Businesses could also be polled on a levy through the business rate to improve London's infrastructure. The pamphlet advocates a global approach to business taxation, to avoid competitive tax-cutting. It suggests that the European Community should establish a common European corporate tax, collected by an EC agency. It would focus on the top 100 European companies whose sales account for 40 per cent of EC GDP, and encourage harmonisation of accounting standards between member states. Reconnecting Taxation.

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Whitehall 'risks overstretching charities' WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS have been warned not to place additional demands on the voluntary sector without making adequate resources available, according to a report prepared with the involvement of key government departments. The report, to be published today, also warns that repeated changes in government social and training policies are making the private sector and grantmaking trusts reluctant to support social programmes. The involvement in the drawing up of the report of the departments of employment, education, environment and health and the Home Office gives its findings an important status. They are likely to be considered by the ministerial group on the voluntary sector. Resourcing the Voluntary Sector was compiled after discussions between charities, corporate funders and the government departments. It is the work of three charity umbrella bodies - the Association of Charitable Foundations, the Charities Aid Foundation and the Corporate Responsibility Group - and will be launched at the Charities Aid Foundation conference today. The report says that government demands on the voluntary sector can be both direct and indirect. It suggests that the sector could be revolutionised by government policies to encourage organisations to provide services under contract to public agencies. This would also have the effect of significantly increasing funds flowing through the sector. However, there was a risk that contract funding might 'destroy the very features' of the voluntary sector that led statutory funders to use it. 'These are its flexibility, choice and diversity between big and small service providers, advocacy and watchdog functions,' the report says. The government sets the agenda for other funders - such as private companies and grantmaking trusts - because of its dominant position, the report says. But companies and trusts have found dramatic shifts in government policy 'disruptive and undesirable'. Examples of such policy changes included the Community Programme, Employment Training and Youth Training. Just as basic government funding could attract other financial support, its withdrawal could lead to waste and loss of funds. Some funders had seen projects that they had supported collapse when government money was withdrawn. As a result, the funders 'would not readily join in partnerships to support government-funded programmes in future'. Last month Mr John Major, the prime minister, rejected recommendations in another report that tax relief for charities should be abolished now that many provide services under contract to public bodies.</p>

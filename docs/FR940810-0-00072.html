			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The former ``initial monitoring'' provisions allowed use of historic data. OSHA now requires the evaluation of data from earlier asbestos jobs to estimate exposures on new jobs. However, the ``data'' reviewed are more than air monitoring results. This record has convinced the Agency that consideration of factors in successfully controlling asbestos exposures needs to be a part of the assessment. In addition to measurement results, the assessment must review relevant controls and conditions, factors that influence the degree of exposure. These include, but are not limited to, the degree and quality of supervision and of employee training, techniques used for wetting the ACM in the various circumstances encountered, placing and repositioning the ventilation equipment, and impacts due to weather conditions. The assessment therefore must be based on the competent person's review of all aspects of the employer's performance doing similar jobs. Only if similar controls are used and the work supervised by the same or similarly trained personnel, may past data be relied on. In addition, the results of initial monitoring required if feasible, must inform the competent person's assessment. Judgment of the ``competent person'' is required when reviewing records of past work. For example, even where an employer's earlier glove bag removals produced some exposures above the PEL, if more recent glove bag removals by the same crew show no exceedances, the ``competent person'' may be warranted in predicting that the current job performed by the same crew will be well controlled and exposures will not exceed the PELs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other basis allowed for an initial exposure assessment is ``objective data'' to show that it is, in effect, impossible for a job to result in excessive exposures. The 1986 standard, 1926.58, paragraph (f)(2)(ii), allowed such data to demonstrate that the ``product or material containing asbestos cannot release *&blank;*&blank;* (excessive) concentrations *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Since the record of this proceeding shows that almost all asbestos products may in time become hazardous, if for example, their matrix becomes disturbed, the activity, as well as the material, is the exposure-limiting factor. OSHA therefore now allows a showing that a specific activity involving a product is incapable of producing exceedances. The ``objective data'' must demonstrate that under ``the work conditions having the greatest potential for releasing asbestos,'' an activity coupled with a specific material, simply cannot result in excessive concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA cannot predict all the combinations of activity and product which will meet this test. OSHA believes instead that construction employers should be given the responsibility for making these determinations for their particular work. However, on the record of this proceeding, they would appear to be limited to Class IV activities, or certain Class III activities such as limited removal of intact asbestos containing gaskets using wet methods and containment methods. OSHA notes that under no conditions can a Class I removal qualify for this exemption; based on the record of this rulemaking, every removal activity involving TSI and surfacing ACM is capable of releasing fibers above the PEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are separate provisions regarding a ``negative initial exposure assessment'' which is a demonstration that the activity involving the asbestos material is unlikely under all foreseeable conditions to result in concentrations above the PELs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The competent person must exercise judgment in performing these exposure assessments. For example, if initial monitoring is evaluated the first day's measurements which reflect set-up activities may not adequately predict later exposures on a removal job. The competent person should examine both the first day's exposures and comparable full job exposure data from other comparable jobs, before a conclusion is reached that exposures on that job will not exceed the PELs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In large measure, the required bases for making a ``negative exposure assessment'' in the revised construction standard are the same criteria which would, under the 1986 standard, have allowed an employer to claim an exemption from initial monitoring based on ``historic data.'' The standard makes it more difficult to base an initial exposure assessment on historic data than did the previous provision for initial determination. Now, the assessment must consider, the experience and training of the crews. Therefore, the standard now requires that a negative exposure assessment must compare crews with comparable experience and training, an employer cannot compare untrained and inexperienced crews. And no ``negative exposure assessment'' can be made if the crews which disturb asbestos in the current job are untrained. OSHA believes that a major factor in the effectiveness of all control systems for removing asbestos-containing materials is the experience and training of the contractor and employees. Evidence in the record shows dramatic reductions in exposure levels as untrained employees learned proper glove bag techniques (see e.g., the NIOSH study, Ex. 125).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lack of a ``negative exposure determination'' usually indicates that workers are not experienced/trained or that a job is complex. In such situations, additional protections, less dependent on experience of the workers, or the complexity of the job, should be required. Thus, critical barriers are required in all Class I and II work, and for Class III work, plastic barriers are required, where negative exposure assessments are not produced. If the employer cannot assure that levels will be minimized, protection against migration of asbestos dust must be provided. Similarly, if excessive levels are possible, employees in all classes must be protected by respirator use and the standard so requires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes its approach balances the concern that asbestos exposure levels vary from job to job and may be non-predictive of future levels with the Agency's knowledge gained from long-term enforcement of the asbestos standard, that different employers have different ``track records.'' The negative initial exposure assessment provisions require consideration of factors which have been identified as influencing the variability of results. In fact, one commenter stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* it is invalid to predict that any particular operation is always below the PEL,'' identified critical contributing variables as ``the materials, work practices and experience of the crew'' (Ex. 7&hyph;52). OSHA is requiring the ``negative exposure assessment'' to be based on these, among other, factors. OSHA emphasizes that a ``negative exposure assessment'' does not predict exposure levels beyond a particular job. A new assessment must be produced each time another job is undertaken. Employers may evaluate repetitive operations with highly similar characteristics, as one job, such as cable pulling in the same building, so long as the historic data used also reflect repetitive operations of the same duration and frequency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Cambodia plant for Heineken Heineken, the Dutch brewer, is planning to build the first brewery majority-owned by foreign shareholders in Cambodia. The brewery in Phonmh Penh will have an initial capacity of 170,000 hectolitres when completed in mid-1996 at a cost of Dollars 25m. Cambodia's beer market was equal to 160,000hl in 1993 - about 2 litres per capita - but is expected to grow to 270,000hl by the end of the decade. The capacity of the brewery could be gradually expanded to 500,000hl to meet demand. The country has only one brewery, Heineken said. The Dutch beer group and its Singapore-based partners Fraser &amp; Neave will own 80 per cent of the brewery, to be called Cambodia Brewery, through their existing joint venture Asia Pacific Breweries (APBL). The remainder will be owned by Progress Import and Export, the Cambodian importer of APBL's Tiger beer brand. The Cambodian brewery will produce Tiger beer as well as ABC Stout, another APBL brand.</p>

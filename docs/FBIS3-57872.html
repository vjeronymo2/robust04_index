			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed E.Z.: "Chirac Keeps At a Distance From </F> Balladur"]    [Text] Of course, the RPR [Rally for the Republic]  president has not become a dissident. He still "approves of and  supports" Edouard Balladur and his government, which "are doing  everything they can to correct the situation." What is more, he  "does not regret" leaving Matignon [prime minister's office] to  Edouard Balladur: "I needed some time to assess the situation,  to keep myself at a distance from the daily events, to think  about the major reforms which are needed today, and all that was  not compatible with the constraints of government," he explained.    Today, however, after the successful outcome of the GATT,  after the UDF [Union for French Democracy] ministers urged their  prime minister to run in the presidential elections, after the  FINANCIAL TIMES consecrated Edouard Balladur as its "man of the  year," Jacques Chirac must keep a distance -- even a minimum one  -- from the government's policy if he wants even a small chance  to be a credible candidate in the presidential elections; he  also needs to put something else forward, "another political  line," which will allow him to rally all those who believe that  Balladur's reforms are not fast, nor strong enough.    This is precisely what Jacques Chirac has been doing. "We  are going through exceptional times when the French people  understand that deep changes are necessary and accept them," he  explains. Thus, "a real revolution of the mind must be  initiated, major reforms must be undertaken and developed, and  the peoples' reactions must be taken into account." And for all  those naive people who believe that this is exactly what Edouard  Balladur has started to do, Jacques Chirac makes himself quite  clear: All of this will be done during the hectic months of the  presidential campaign, which will be of a "high level and will  make it possible to initiate the renewal of France." Another  dispute between Chirac and Balladur is over the date when real  change is going to take place. For Balladur, the new era  started in March 1993 and will continue uninterrupted after the  1995 presidential elections. For Jacques Chirac, nothing will  really start until then.  <H5>  Obsolete Measures </H5>   The first thing that applies in this context is the  employment policy. It is true that Jacques Chirac, committed by  his support to the government, admits that the "Giraud law is a  step in the right direction." He adds, however, that "it is not  enough." "Ways of thinking must be changed, another policy is  necessary, more money must be spent actively for [social]  integration," he recommends.    This reminds one of the ideas of Charles Millon [Republican  Party] and Philippe Seguin [chairman of the National Assembly]  on the transformation of the ANPE [National Employment Agency]  and the ASSEDIC [expansion unknown] or also of the theories of  Alain Madelin [minister of economic development] on the  necessity for everyone to create their jobs. It can be said  that the experts convened by Jacques Chirac are beginning to be  productive. "At all events," says Jacques Chirac, "the old ways  of fighting unemployment from a social point of view do not  measure up to the current problems." Still, Mr. Chirac does not  accuse Edouard Balladur, as others do, of being content with  obsolete measures. Not yet. The prime minister understands by  now that the Giraud law would be his weak point as a  presidential candidate. This is probably why a further  reduction of taxes on the lowest incomes is expected in the near  future.    But the employment problem is not the only source of  opposition between the two men. Schools could well be another  one soon, public schools in particular. Whereas Matignon will  announce a plan to strengthen security in public schools "in the  next few days," Jacques Chirac yesterday called for a "large  plan to rehabilitate and modernize public schools."</p>

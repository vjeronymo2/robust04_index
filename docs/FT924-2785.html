			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (15): Lansing gets it right first time - Manufacturing View BEING 'right first time, more often' was the aim of Lansing Linde in acquiring its CAD software. Lansing, based in Basingstoke and employing 2,000 people, is a well-known name in the manufacture of warehouse handling equipment, particularly lift trucks, writes Claire Gooding. It was a privately owned company known as Lansing Bagnall until its acquisition in 1989 by the German company Linde, which specialises in counter-balanced engine trucks. 'What we were looking for was the flexibility of bringing products to the marketplace more quickly', explains Brian Cayley, senior executive engineer. In 1983 the company assessed around 50 suppliers of CAD software, from mainframe to PC hosts. By the time Linde bought Lansing in 1989, there was already substantial investment in two products: Computervision at Lansing, and Intergraph at Linde. There are 12 Intergraph seats and 18 Computervision seats currently in use. Rather than start from scratch, the company aimed to integrate its existing software in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) strategy embracing CAD, CAM, CAPP, MRP and shop floor control systems. It chose CPlan from CADCentre as the next step in Computer Aided Process Planning. Chassis manufacture was selected for the trial as the most complex and variable component. CADCentre's contract, worth Pounds 90,000, included hardware, training, and support. The CPlan software was first installed in 1988 and currently supports 12 seats running on Sun workstations. The trial has been so successful that the techniques learned in implementing CIM are to be used in a new manufacturing plant being built in Basingstoke. Four years ago, it took 12 weeks to complete the product after receiving an order. Now, with the help of CPlan's CAPP techniques, it takes only four weeks. Lansing takes integration seriously. It has a direct Electronic Data Management (EDM) link with its Blackwood plant, and its CAD facilities are linked with its MRP and manufacturing packages, its machine control, and even its technical publications. 'We take a wide view of the benefits', says Mr Cayley. In his opinion, companies investing in 3D software should look for more than an increase in drawing productivity, however dramatic. 'There are tremendous productivity benefits in going from 2D to 3D, but you can find find yourself in a trap: it doesn't necessarily better design. The current convention is to produce a drawing, but CIM involves more than that.' He points to several benefits in having invested so much in technology - 'it gives us the ability to explore alternatives quickly, and to optimise our designs. With the levels of ever-closer integration, we are going down the road of parallel engineering.'

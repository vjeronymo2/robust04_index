"From the storm and stress of the first few years of  reforms,  we are going over to more thorough constructive work, which  involves deeper structures and institutions of the economy. The  government should be up to this work, and therefore it has taken  a somewhat new form," Chernomyrdin said at a meeting in the  Interior Ministry on Tuesday.    "The president's policy of deep-going democratic reforms in  Russian society, in its economy and political institutions will  be continued and will be aimed at meeting the strategic  interests of Russia," the prime minister said. He said only the  president and Constitution, not any of the present or former  members of government, were guarantors of the reforms, which  meant the demands for the revision of that policy were aimed  against the president rather than the government, he said.    "I am proud that I come from the `Red' enterprise managers.  What is really bad is that those who are now seeking power have  no experience and would run experiments on the whole country,"  Chernomyrdin said to the stormy applause of his listeners.    He admitted that the previous month had been marked by a new  serious bout of inflation. He said inflation and the present  grave financial situation were the number-one problem for the  government, which would focus on "a reasonably tough policy of  financial stabilization and measures to curb inflation as much  as possible."    The premier said the government would tightly control  budgetary expenditures this year. "Most of the promises will be  kept," and the government is determined to pay all its debts for  1993, he said. "The people will understand that we finally have  to live within our means. The government will no longer deceive  or delude anyone," he said.</p>

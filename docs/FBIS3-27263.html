			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Guangxi Regional People's Government recently  promulgated a decision on the implementation of a  revenue-sharing system. The decision points out: The  implementation of a revenue-sharing system is a major decision  of the party Central Committee and the State Council and is an  important element of economic structural reform.    The decision demands: Following the implementation a  revenue- sharing system, first, it is necessary to strengthen  graded budgetary management, and an additional expenditure  should be borne by the relevant administrative level. The  regional government will not bear expenditures which should be  borne by a prefecture, city, or county, or vice versa. Second,  it is necessary to strengthen management over administrative  spending, to improve control over administrative expenditures,  to exercise strict management over expenditure limits, and to  encourage departments with the necessary conditions to increase  their income.    Third, it is necessary to strengthen management over the  collections of administrative charges and to put them under  budgetary management so as to prevent the loss of revenue.  Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen management over  extrabudgetary funds. The administrative departments' budgetary  and extrabudgetary revenue should be put in a uniform revenue  and expenditure plan. Fifth, it is necessary to forge a balance  between revenue and expenditures. Under the revenue-sharing  system, prefectures and cities should work out their budgets in  such a way that a balance between revenue and expenditures can  be maintained with some surpluses. The regional financial  department is not responsible for making up prefectures' or  cities' deficits; in such cases, the prefectures and cities  should make efforts to resolve them.    The decision stresses: The implementation of the  revenue-sharing system is a major step in financial reform. All  prefectural administrative offices and city governments should  strengthen their leadership to ensure its smooth implementation.</p>

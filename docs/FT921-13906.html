			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Final call for power shares payment INVESTORS in National Power and Powergen, the two electricity generating companies, will have received letters this week asking them to pay the second and final instalments on their shares. Most investors received 300 shares in last year's flotation, split in the ratio of 186 National Power to 114 Powergen. The amount you pay will depend on whether you opted for the discount, or the bonus shares, at the time of the offer. Those who opted for the bonus will have to pay the full instalment of 75p per share - a total of Pounds 225 on a typical 300 share allocation. If you opted for the discount, you will save 14p per share, which means that the typical investor will have to pay Pounds 183, a saving of Pounds 42. Payment, which must be made by cheque, should be sent to the address shown on the notice. Separate cheques must be sent in respect of each company and of each family member who holds shares. If you have not paid by February 4, you could lose your rights to the shares and the incentives. You will receive a refund of only your original payment of 100p per share - and lose your subsequent profits. To allow time for the cheques to clear, make sure they arrive by January 30. Those who want sell their shares without paying the second instalment must do so before January 27, when the shares start trading in their full-paid form. Anyone who owns generator shares and has not received their instalment demand, or who has a detailed query, can call the registrars of the companies on helplines. For National Power, call Lloyds Bank on 021-433 4466; for Powergen, call National Westminster Bank on 0272-465511.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler Motors Corp. said it was restructuring its vehicle engineering  operations to focus product development on an entire vehicle rather than its  components. Chrysler Motors is Chrysler Corp.'s auto-making arm. Under the  restructuring, the engineering operations will be divided into four basic  groups, with support units also being created. The support units include  scientific laboratories and Chrysler's proving grounds. No layoffs in the  6,000-worker Chrysler engineering organization are planned, the statement said.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: BP explores growth BP yesterday signalled that it was ready to move from retrenchment to growth. The switch in thinking was not spelt out in so many words. The phrasing, in a briefing to analysts, was rather that the group's exploration and production division now had options. Under a conservative scenario, production - which fell from 1.7m barrels a day in 1988 to 1.4m last year - would grow at 2 per cent a year. But BP also produced a chart showing production, under a more ambitious scenario, growing at up to 7 per cent. The subtext was clear. The exploration and production division, at any rate, wants to expand. It is understandable why BP is talking in a coded way. The last time it embarked on an investment splurge in the late 1980s, it fell flat on its face. Gearing rose to 100 per cent, its chairman had to resign and the dividend was halved. If shareholders are not to take fright, they will need reassurance that a new expansion plan will not suffer the same fate. Matters may be different this time. First, BP has vigorously cut costs. Second, its investment plans are judged on the assumption that crude prices will fall to Dollars 14 rather than rise to Dollars 25. Third, the group has become strongly cash-generative so it should be able to increase capital spending, while still raising its dividend by 20 per cent a year and paying down debt. Yesterday's presentation marks a first attempt to win investors round to such a plan. But shareholders will be right to withhold their judgment until an expansion strategy is spelt out in greater detail.</p>

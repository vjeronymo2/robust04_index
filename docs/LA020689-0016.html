			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Andre Previn travels to Vienna and Hong Kong this month. The Los Angeles  Philharmonic's music director conducts his orchestra's Pension Fund benefit  Tuesday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (when Itzhak Perlman is soloist  in Beethoven's Violin Concerto), then takes the red-eye to Austria. In Vienna,  Wednesday through Saturday, Previn will rehearse the Vienna Philharmonic in  preparation for the orchestra's engagement at the Hong Kong Festival, Feb.  15-22. In Hong Kong -- the Vienna Philharmonic is the only orchestra playing at  the 1989 festival -- Previn will lead the orchestra in four programs, including  Beethoven's Fourth and Seventh Symphonies, Dvorak's Eighth (which he leads  here, Tuesday) and other works by Mozart, Brahms, J. and R. Strauss and Haydn's  Symphony No. 104. Previn returns to Los Angeles Feb. 25, and will conduct his  next L.A. Philharmonic concert on March 3. ALEENE MacMINN and JUDITH MICHAELSON  </P></p>

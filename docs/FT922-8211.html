			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Europe's computer champion on the ropes Hopes that in the creation of Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems (SNI) Germany - and Europe - might have a computer champion able to hold its own with the cream of the US and Japanese manufacturers have taken a battering over the past 18 months. Formed in late 1990 through the merger of Siemens' computer division with Nixdorf Computer, the fallen star of German information technology, the new company had expected to return an operating profit by the end of 1991. Earlier this year, however, Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, the company's chief executive, warned that SNI will still be in the red at the end of its current financial year, which ends in September, despite healthy improvements in sales. Its ability to cut its losses, moreover, will remain hostage to improvements in the general economic situation, he said. However, many people believe that SNI can still form the nucleus of a Europe-owned computer industry, and Siemens is committed to the company, arguing that data processing is a core technology in electronics. Mr Wiedig, underlines the position: 'We want to return to the black as soon as possible, but if in two or three years we have not done that, we will not sell the business.' Siemens acquired Nixdorf two years ago to save the ailing minicomputer manufacturer from financial collapse. Failing to anticipate the sudden overall downturn in computer sales, Nixdorf's revenues slipped quickly out of line with expenses. In the year prior to the takeover, losses amounted to just over DM1bn. Siemens, on the other hand, is the powerhouse of European electronics, a company even the mighty International Business Machines feels comfortable with as a partner in semiconductor research; its computer group, focusing on the needs of large companies, made a profit of DM700m (Dollars 432m) in 1990. Furthermore, Siemens has deep pockets and, contrary to rumours that the marriage was a shotgun affair, was eager to take advantage of Nixdorf's international marketing network and its contacts with smaller companies. The new company, with 50,000 employees and revenues in excess of DM12bn, is the world's eighth largest. Its product line includes mainframe computers, mid-range systems, personal computers and workstations and it spends some 14 per cent of revenues on research and development. It has excellent opportunities to open up new markets in the east of Germany and in eastern Europe. So why have expectations of an early return to profitability been so comprehensively dashed? Mr Wiedig points to three factors working against the immediate success of the new company. First, although it was not immediately apparent at the time, SNI was born at the beginning of the worst year in modern computing history, when aggregate results for the world's 10 top companies showed both reduced revenues and losses. 'It is important to carry out mergers when economic conditions are positive,' Mr Wiedig says, arguing that sales growth creates an aura of success which helps to weld the company together. Second, there was a significant cultural difference between the two partners. Siemens had specialised in building data processing systems for large customers while Nixdorf's expertise lay in developing solutions to the computing problems of small and medium customers. This gap was not helped by feelings of resentment on the Siemens side that the performance of the new company was prejudiced by Nixdorf's continuing losses, or bewilderment from former Nixdorf employees who found it difficult to come to terms with their reduced status in the German computing hierarchy. Third, the business procedures and computing systems used by the two companies were very different, leading, in the first months at any rate, to lost and delayed orders. 'It took time to bring our internal data processing together,' Mr Wiedig says. 'Data processing systems make a company more productive, but in the two companies there were 200 different systems. Now we have created a lot of data processing bridges.' It may be a further three years before complete compatibility is established. 'Every procedure had to be newly created by combining elements from the two partners. It was difficult and with the industry in a poor state, people became disillusioned. They started enthusiastically, but then reality struck home.' 'That phase is now over. There is still some merging of mental attitudes, but for most employees, that should be complete by the end of the year.' The measures SNI is taking to restore profitability differ little from those of its leading competitors. They include the reduction of 4,000 jobs, or 8 per cent of the workforce, between June 1991 and September this year, together with a reduction in manufacturing capacity, rationalisation in production and cost cutting. The aim is to save some DM600m annually, while halving the DM781m loss recorded in 1991. In the first quarter of the current year, sales rose 26 per cent to DM3.8bn while orders rose 14 per cent to DM3.7bn. The results are encouraging for those who believe that Europe should maintain a strong manufacturing presence in the computer industry, among them Mr Wiedig who argues that if Europe is to remain competitive, it has to retain key skills including semiconductor technology and data processing. 'At present we are simply inviting Japan to take the lead in all the key technologies but if we change our attitude they will change theirs. 'We do have to find new rules for the game; Europe has resources, demand and skills, but it lacks co-ordination.' Mr Wiedig is less exact about where the initiative should come from but agrees it could be from Brussels, from the computer industry or from a single company. An example of the kind of co-ordination he seeks is, perhaps, the plan by SNI, Olivetti of Italy and Groupe Bull of France to develop Community-wide computer networks to tackle cross-border issues. 'Europe cannot afford to lose the third industrial revolution,' Mr Wiedig avers. 'In agriculture, it takes half a day to turn a camping meadow into a potato field; but in information technology the position, once lost, will not be repairable within 10 years.'</p>

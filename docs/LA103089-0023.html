			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS CIRCLE PICKS 'MISANTHROPE' FOR BEST PRODUCTION  </P> <P> "The Misanthrope," the La Jolla Playhouse update of Moliere's classic about an  artist's frustration with the shallow values of his culture, won for best  production at the sixth annual San Diego Critics Circle Awards ceremony held at  the Abbey Restaurant Sunday.  </P> <P> But "The Misanthrope" picked up no other awards in a year when no one  production swept the votes as the Old Globe's "Coriolanus" did last year and  the La Jolla Playhouse's "A Walk in the Woods" did the year before.  </P> <P> Instead, the 14 winners were drawn from 11 shows and eleven of the awards went  to the Old Globe (seven) and the La Jolla Playhouse (four).  </P> <P> The remaining three awards went to the Lawrence Welk Resort Theatre for best  musical ("She Loves Me"), Starlight Musical Theatre for best choreographer (Don  and Bonnie Ward, Starlight's artistic directors, for "My One and Only") and UC  San Diego for best scenic design (J. Michael Griggs, "Strindberg Sonata.")  </P> <P> Only two shows, the Old Globe's "The School for Scandal" and its current hit,  "Breaking Legs," won more than one award apiece.  </P> <P> "Scandal," the Richard Brinsley Sheridan play about malicious gossip mongers in  18th century England, garnered a win for Old Globe executive director Craig  Noel as best director, (Noel was last recognized in 1987 with a special award  commending his 50 years in San Diego theater), Paxton Whitehead as best actor  and Robert Wojewodski for best costume design.  </P> <P> "Legs," Tom Dulack's world premiere comedy about a playwright who gets into  trouble when mobsters want to finance his play, picked up a best supporting  actor award for Michael Genovese (who won the same award in 1986 for "Gillette"  at the La Jolla Playhouse) and a best supporting actress award for Sue Giosa in  her San Diego theater debut.  </P> <P> "Legs," the only winner still running, plays at the Old Globe through Friday.  </P> <P> The Globe, which had dominated the nominations for the October, 1988, through  Sept. 16, 1989, season with 24, won all the directing and acting honors, with  the best actress award going to Sada Thompson for "Driving Miss Daisy," Alfred  Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play at the Old Globe.  </P> <P> The La Jolla Playhouse, which picked up 14 nominations for a season half the  length of the Globe's, won the awards which emphasized overall production,  including best production ("The Misanthrope"), best road show ("Dangerous  Games") and best new play ("Nebraska," Keith Reddin's story about tensions  among the people who watch the missiles).  </P> <P> But the San Diego Repertory Theatre, which had 10 nominations, including six  for the critically acclaimed "Burning Patience" -- the most nominated show of  the evening -- left empty-handed.  </P> <P> The San Diego critics differed sharply from New York critics in their  assessment of "Dangerous Games" as best road show. "Dangerous Games,"  co-created by Broadway choreographer Graciela Daniele and Jim Lewis as a  dance/music/theater piece about torture, eroticism and machismo in a nameless  Latin American country, closed on Broadway shortly after being savaged by the  New York critics a little over a week ago.  </P> <P> A Broadway failure of 26 years ago was also honored by the San Diego critics  when they gave the best musical nod to Lawrence Welk's "She Loves Me." The  story, about two people who meet through the personals under pseudonyms and  don't realize they work in the same shop, has achieved cult status over the  years in the regional theater circuit.  </P> <P> The San Diego Critics Circle gave out two special awards in addition to the 14.  The financially beleaguered La Jolla Playhouse, a strong presence in the awards  scene since the theater was revived in 1983 after a 19-year absence, was  commended for "outstanding achievement in choosing and sustaining a standard of  artistic integrity invaluable as a catalyst in San Diego's emerging theater  renaissance."  </P> <P> Sledgehammer Theatre, a small, homeless theater which has made a practice of  building temporary theater spaces in abandoned warehouses, was praised "for  outstanding achievement in the creative carving of theater out of the void and  their proof that rowdiness and art are not necessarily contradictory terms."  </P> <P> The award winners were:  </P> <P> DIRECTOR: Craig Noel, "The School for Scandal," Old Globe Theatre  </P> <P> ACTOR: Paxton Whitehead, "The School for Scandal," Old Globe Theatre  </P> <P> ACTRESS: Sada Thompson, "Driving Miss Daisy," Old Globe Theatre  </P> <P> PRODUCTION: "The Misanthrope," La Jolla Playhouse  </P> <P> SUPPORTING ACTOR: Mike Genovese, "Breaking Legs," Old Globe Theatre  </P> <P> SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Sue Giosa, "Breaking Legs," Old Globe Theatre  </P> <P> CHOREOGRAPHY: Don and Bonnie Ward, Starlight Musical Theatre  </P> <P> SOUND DESIGN: John Kilgore, "Down the Road," La Jolla Playhouse  </P> <P> NEW PLAY: Keith Reddin, "Nebraska," La Jolla Playhouse  </P> <P> MUSICAL: "She Loves Me," Lawrence Welk Resort Theatre  </P> <P> ROAD SHOW: "Dangerous Games," co-production of the American Music Theater  Festival in Philadelphia, Spoleto Festival, USA and La Jolla Playhouse at the  LaJolla Playhouse  </P> <P> SPECIAL AWARDS: La Jolla Playhouse and Sledgehammer Theatre.  </P></p>

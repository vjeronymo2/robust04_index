			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric ``Panorama'': ``EU </F> International Conference in the Caspian Sea Problems'']    [Text] Several days ago Baku was visited by a delegation  from the Hydrological Institute of Denmark, which is doing  preparations for a project to deal with the Caspian Sea problems  within the framework of the European Union's (EU) TASIS program,  which provides technical assistance to CIS countries. As Fikret  Dzhafarov, the chief of the department of planning for natural  resource utilization of the Azerbaijani State Committee on  Ecology, told ANS-PRESS, this project envisages beginning in the  nearest future work on organizing an international conference on  the Caspian Sea problems, in which CIS member countries will  participate. According to Fikret Dzhafarov, a preliminary  agreement already has been reached on Azerbaijan's participation  in this forum. Baku is a possible site for the conference. The  staff of the Azerbaijani State Committee on Ecology refuted  information that Armenian leadership intends to insist on  holding this conference in Yerevan, as well as ensuring  participation of this country, along with the Caspian coastal  countries, in this forum. However, as ANS-PRESS learned from  reliable sources close to the Russian Government, such  initiative on the part of Armenia has indeed taken place and it  has been prompted by the fact that the EU underwrites all  expenses on organizing and conducting this event.    At the same time, at the recent press conference Paolo  Lembo,  head of the UN Development Program in Azerbaijan, remarked that  it is Baku that should become the center of research on the  Caspian Sea problems. On 2 May, William Nikoff [as  transliterated], a UN Development Program adviser, is expected  to visit Azerbaijan; he will also look into the Caspian problems  reflected in the London report of the UN Development Program.</p>

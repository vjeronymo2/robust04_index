			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> ANIMAL CONTROL AGREEMENT  </P> <P> Negotiators for the city and the Pomona Valley Humane Society are hammering out  an agreement to settle their dispute over funding for animal control services.  </P> <P> The proposal would allow the humane society to collect more money from user  fees, thus reducing its subsidy from the city's budget.  </P> <P> City Administrator Julio Fuentes said details are still being worked out, but  he plans to submit the proposal to the council at its meeting Monday night. The  council and the humane society have been at odds over the cost of animal  control services, with the city refusing to pay a proposed increase of $66,000  per year.  </P> <P> Although the new proposal would cut the cost to the city through the increased  user fees, Fuentes said he does not know whether the council will accept the  plan.  </P> <P> William Harford, executive director of the humane society, said that his  agency, which earlier had notified the city that it would terminate animal  control services in Pomona on Dec. 31, has agreed to continue providing  services while a new contract is negotiated.  </P></p>

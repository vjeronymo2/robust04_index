			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report under the "Parliament" rubric: "State </F> Duma Heeds Lukin. Law on International Treaties Passed in First  Reading"]    [Text] Yesterday the State Duma considered and passed in  the first reading the draft Law on International Treaties of the  Russian Federation. The draft of the same name once sparked a  lengthy discussion at the Supreme Soviet, which was centered  primarily on whether the parliament is entitled to ratify and  annul international treaties at its discretion or whether it has  necessarily to wait for the executive branch's presentation. At  the time, the Supreme Soviet effectively agreed for the first  time to look for a compromise with its opponents from the  Foreign Ministry and the presidential main political  administration, but then came 21 September.    Yesterday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov told  deputies about the main provisions of the draft law: for  instance, about Article 15, which contains a list of  international treaties subject to mandatory ratification, and  Article 16, which describes the procedure for making proposals  regarding ratification, and so forth.    The deputies' questions to the deputy minister focused for  the most part on a period of time within which draft laws on  ratification must be submitted to the State Duma. An attempt  was also made to find out why a number of treaties (START-2 and  the Treaty with Georgia), which were signed, but not ratified,  have effectively been not adhered to.    Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International  Affairs Committee, delivered a co-report, saying that after some  additional work on the draft law it can rather be considered a  parliamentary than presidential one. Mr. Lukin recommended that  the draft be approved in the first reading.    He noted, however, that the draft does have drawbacks: Since  the act of ratification must be formalized by a law, other  authorities aside from the president and the government, the  State Duma for instance, can also sponsor them; it has not been  specified who in Russia can object to reservations made by other  signatories to the treaties (Mr. Lukin made sure that the  Federal Assembly must have the right to do so); the list of  treaties subject to mandatory ratification is also far from  complete.    Mr. Lukin pointed out that all his concerns can be met by  four amendments that the committee proposed to approve in one  vote together with the draft law, which is what the State Duma  did without further debate, although State Duma members who  formerly were Supreme Soviet deputies vainly attempted to  provoke a discussion and to raise its temperature.</p>

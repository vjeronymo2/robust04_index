			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian court drops restraint on tin mine A BRAZILIAN high court suspended on Tuesday a restraining order that was preventing the Ebesa mining group from initiating tin exploration at Bom Futuro, an open-cast site in the Amazon state of Rondonia. Ebesa is a seven-company joint venture headed by Paranapanema, the world's largest tin exporter and Brazil's largest private mining company. Ebesa holds the mining rights to Bom Futuro. The court order had been issued in response to a suit filed by wildcat miners operating at the site. Under the terms of Tuesday's decision, these miners will be forced to abandon their operations. Mr Samuel A. Hanan, director-vice president of Paranapanema, said the company will demand that clandestine firms leave the area. He said individual wildcatters might be hired to work for Ebesa at the site. Some 500-600 employees would be needed when the mine was fully operational. Mr Hanan said that Ebesa would have a small plant in place within 10 days, but he could not predict when the mine would be in full production. Output should not exceed the 8,000-10,000 tonnes a year now extracted by wildcat miners. Those independent miners extracted 81,500 tonnes between 1987, when operations began, and last year.</p>

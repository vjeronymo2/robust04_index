Thus he rejected media speculations that Nixon decided to  cut  short his visit after President Boris Yeltsin and some other top  officials refused to meet him.    The refusal came after Nixon's extensive contacts with  opposition leaders including former Vice President Aleksandr  Rutskoy amnestied last week.</p>

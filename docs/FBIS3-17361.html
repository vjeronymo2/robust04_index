			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Mar 24, BNS -- Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman Grigori Karasin, speaking today at a briefing in  Moscow, claimed the attitude of the Estonian leadership toward  the Estonian-Russian border issue is shortsighted.    The Russian diplomat accused Estonia of "stubbornly clinging  to a line that is inconsistent with the CSCE principles and  leads to a dead end, not recognizing the borders shaped in this  part of Europe as a result of post-war developments."    The Estonian Government on March 17 approved and passed for  consideration in the parliament a bill on borders. The document  defines the Estonian-Russian border in accordance with the 1920  Tartu Peace Treaty. The treaty designated as belonging to  Estonia a number of territories which in 1944-45 passed under  the jurisdiction of Russia's Leningrad and Pskov regions.    Karasin reminded that at last week's hearings in the Russian  parliament "the arguments of Estonian MP's [member of  parliament] that Estonia's territorial claims on Russia are  legitimate were decisively refuted as unconvincing from the  point of view of international law."</p>

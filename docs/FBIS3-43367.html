			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The minister of justice and attorney general has  refused to receive a memorandum from the Malawi Democratic  Party, MDP, which required the president to retire. In a press  release issued today, the minister of justice and attorney  general said he had refused to receive the memorandum because he  thought the document was not only irresponsible but also  undemocratic and unconstitutional.    The press release said it is the view of the minister of  justice and attorney general that the president of this country  can only be elected into office or removed from office by all  the citizens who are eligible to vote through the ballot and not  by the MDP alone, through what he called unorthodox means. The  press release added that if the MDP wants the president to be  removed from power it should go to the countryside and campaign  for the forthcoming general elections so that it is voted into  power through the ballot box.    The press release, therefore, advised the MDP not to deliver  such documents to the attorney general who, it said, had no  power whatsoever under the constitution or any of the country's  laws to ask the president to retire.    Meanwhile, our reporter says police in Blantyre today  stopped  a march organized by the MDP to deliver the memorandum to the  government (?through) the attorney general. Our reporter says  the march, which had about 100 participants, and was led by the  MDP secretary general Mr. Kondowe started at 1000 this morning  from the clock tower in Blantyre. In the ensuing incident Mr.  Kondowe and his driver were taken to the Southern Division  Police headquarters. Latest reports say Mr. Kondowe and his  driver have since been let free.</p>

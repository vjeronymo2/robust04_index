			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: 'Snake' may lessen ERM's difficulties (2) Sir, No-one yet seems to have made the connection between the suspension of the ERM and the debate which took place earlier this year in the FT's letters column and 'Personal View' column over the desirability of an independent central bank. The episode provides excellent ammunition for both sides. Those who are pro-independence can point out that only an independent central bank could possibly have withstood the massive political pressure on Germany to sacrifice its low inflation record for the sake of European unity. Those who are anti-independence can point out how inflation is not merely a simple 'technical' issue, but a deeply political one, and can argue that it is wrong that the (unelected) Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, can overturn the desire of (elected) politicians to move towards greater European unity. You pays your money and you takes your choice. Daniel Oppenheimer, Hanakoganei 3-12-23, Kodaira-shi, Tokyo, Japan</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Reduced costs help Church to Pounds 0.24m LOWER INTEREST charges and sharply reduced exceptional costs helped Church, the shoe maker and retailer, lift profits in the first half of 1992. The Northampton-based group, which has 162 shops worldwide, made Pounds 244,000 pre-tax, against Pounds 14,000, on turnover of Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 31m). Operating profits declined to Pounds 820,000 (Pounds 902,000) in 'extremely challenging' trading conditions. This resulted in small losses at A Jones, the UK retailing company, in the Canadian and French operations and in Hong Kong, where the company has a 25 per cent stake in a shoe retailer. The remaining group companies were profitable, including the 17-shop US operation, previously in loss. However, because of lower rates, interest charges shrank to Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 703,000). Exceptional items, relating to redundancy and other rationalisation costs, fell to Pounds 27,000 (Pounds 185,000). The group was 'cautious on retail expansion', though in March it set up a Japanese joint venture with Otsuka Shoe, Church's distributor, and Stock &amp; Zenock, a men's clothing manufacturer, to promote the Church name on non-footwear products. Church has a majority stake. Earnings were 1.9p (0.4p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3p, again uncovered. A Jones, which has 100 UK shops, reduced pre-tax losses to Pounds 26,000 (Pounds 117,000) on turnover of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 13m).</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese in its "Sunday Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) program at  0025 GMT on 26 June begins broadcasting a 21-minute live  interview with Komeito (Clean Government Party) Secretary  General Yuichi Ichikawa on Prime Minister Hata's resignation  announcement, formation of a coalition with the Social  Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), and the future political  situation. The program is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi  Yamamoto at the NHK studio in Tokyo. Participating in the  interview is commentator Naoki Tanaka.    Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Ichikawa: "You said  that the coalition will step down (geya). Do you mean to say  that Komeito will become an opposition power without trying to  come back into power?" Ichikawa responses by explaining: "If  there were only two major parties, or if it were a bipolar  political world, then what I said would really mean that we will  step down from power. However, the current political world is  made up of three major political powers. It is tripolar  politics. Therefore, what I meant by stepping down (geya) is  that we have no intention of actively calling on other party  members to form a new government or try to unify the 180 people  who were members of the ruling parties to form some kind of  political power." He reiterates that Prime Minister Hata made  the decision for the cabinet to resign and to see what the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the SDPJ will do to deal with  the political situation. He rules out the possibility of  holding policy meetings with the SDPJ to form a new coalition.  He says his party will become an opposition party if the LDP  and the SDPJ join hands to become a political power.    Tanaka also asks Ichikawa if his party really has no  intention of remaining in power. Ichikawa answers: "We will not  remain in the government by being power-mad." He adds that his  party will cooperate with other parties or groups -- who share  the same basic policies as Komeito, want to legislate political  reform bills, and support the idea of not dissolving the lower  house under the current system. Ichikawa then explains the  policy differences on various issues, including the consumption  tax, between his party and the SDPJ. Asked whether an agreement  will be reached on tax reform at a policy meeting with the SDPJ,  if they are resumed, Ichikawa says that the SDPJ flatly rejected  our compromise proposals.    When asked if he thinks the current tripolar politics will  change in the future, Ichikawa replies: "One reorganization of  the political world will not be enough. I think reorganization  of the political world will take place several times." "After  all, I do not think there will be a stable government unless we  form a majority group by surpassing the barriers of the party  framework and joining hands with other groups whose policies are  same as ours."    Going back to the tax issue, which was the major obstacle in  coalition-SDPJ negotiations on the SDPJ's return to the  coalition, Tanaka says there was no need to insist on setting a  deadline for tax reform. Ichikawa explains the reason the  coalition and the SDPJ, when they held negotiations before the  prime minister's resignation announcement, needed to reach  agreement on the details of tax reform before September. He  says that the tax issue will be shelved for a long time if no  deadline is set, because lawmakers do not want to talk about  raising taxes before elections.    Asked if he thinks the LDP and the SDPJ will agree to  cooperate with each other in winning power, Ichikawa answers:  "They have a big policy gap. The gap between the SDPJ and the  LDP is larger than the gap between us and the SDPJ. Also, I  doubt that supporters of the LDP and the SDPJ will approve of  the formation of a coalition between the two parties."</p>

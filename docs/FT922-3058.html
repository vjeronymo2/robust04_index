			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Big shortage fears SHORT rates in the sterling cash market closed firmer yesterday as traders positioned themselves for the very large shortages expected next week. A large number of the Bank of England's repurchase agreements are due to expire next week. Analysts guess that there could be shortages of between Pounds 5bn and Pounds 7bn over the next five trading days. As a result, short term rates ended the day a little firmer, looking into next week rather than to this side of the weekend. In the morning, money had been inexpensive after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of only Pounds 250m. But by lunchtime, 3-month money was already firming up to 10 per cent, even though the overnight rate was down at 8 per cent. That was the tight tone on which the day ended: the 1-week rate ended at 10 1/4 per cent from a previous close of 9 1/2 per cent, and everything from 1-month money to 3-month closed at 10 per cent from a previous close of 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank of England's operations were light. The Bank did not operate in the market in the morning. The shortage forecast was later revised to around Pounds 200m. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 150m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 39m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 15m. Futures trading responded to the tighter money conditions around the short dates. The June short sterling contract dropped 3 ticks on the day to close at 89.97. This suggests that 3-month sterling libor next week, when the contract expires, will be at 10.03 per cent. The September contract dropped one tick to close at 90.22. This suggests that 3-month sterling libor in the Autumn will be at 9.78 per cent. Analysts said that yesterday's retail prices inflation for May, which was unchanged at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent, had little impact on the market. 'The RPI was better than expected,' said one dealer, 'but people had already revised their forecast downwards in the run-up to the news.' Instead, the market was gloomier after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, said that there was no scope for a lowering of German interest rates.</p>

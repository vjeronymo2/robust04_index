			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Berisford presses bid on Clark BERISFORD INTERNATIONAL yesterday pressed its Pounds 184m bid on shareholders of C&amp;J Clark warning of 'potentially disastrous consequences' for the company if the offer is turned down. It said that if its offer failed, Clark, which is a private company, would sink back into the 'dissension and acrimony which have damaged their (shareholders') interest for years'. The proposal of selling the business to Berisford will be voted on at a special meeting of Clark's shareholders tomorrow. Members of the Clark family hold 70 per cent of the shares. Clark's board has said that the offer from the property and agribusiness company, of 213p a share in cash or securities plus approximately 26p of deferred cash, is 'fair and reasonable'. Seven of the 11 directors have urged shareholders to accept, but a group of dissident shareholders, supported by three directors who did not recommend the bid, has argued against it. This group, which has adopted the acronym Shoes, has put forward a plan for a shareholder council and a flotation of the company within five years. Mr Brian Smith, a non-executive director of Berisford, told shareholders and employees of Clark at a meeting last week that 'the Shoes proposals for a shareholder council with board representation is likely to mean that the present internal anarchy will be translated into a more formalised open warfare'. Berisford is offering two seats on its board to Clark directors if the offer succeeds. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said yesterday, 'Clark's cannot float in five years or even ten years unless and until the family disagreements which have split the company for the last decade can be solved, and the Shoes campaign starkly demonstrates that this is unlikely'. Clark has been plagued by arguments between shareholders, which culminated in an acrimonious extraordinary meeting last October when shareholders agreed to look for a bidder. Schroders, Clark's merchant bank, contacted over 40 companies seeking offers and a committee of the board chose Berisford's as the best.</p>

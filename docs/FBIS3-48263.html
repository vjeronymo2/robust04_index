These people are  suspected of involvement with human trafficking and other  serious crimes, a police source said yesterday. The Chinese  were mainly from China but some were from Taiwan.    The Chinese who were granted business licences would later  name themselves managing directors and then seek permission to  bring in their Chinese "colleagues" to fill other positions such  as foreign affairs managers, quality-testing officials and  overseas coordination officials, the source said.    Police suspected these people would then smuggle into  Thailand Chinese who wanted to resettle in third countries  before making overseas trips, mostly to the United States, when  they would take the illegal immigrants with them, he said.  Several Chinese have already been arrested in the provinces in  connection with drug trafficking, evasion of criminal charges in  their countries and killing of their business partners.    Police investigators were focusing on five cases where eight  Chinese aliens were all shot to death with .38 revolvers, the  source said.    In the first case, Nakhon Pathom police found the bodies of  two Taiwanese men, Chuen Si Yuan and Lin Tong Huan, in Nakhon  Chaisi district on July 9, last year. The second case occurred  on August 10 last year, in Phetburi's Tha Song Yang district,  where local villagers heard three gunshots before finding Siew  Si Tong and Lai Sun Kiang, both from Hong Kong, had been killed.    Also on the same day, Phetburi's Muang district police found  Li Chang Ho and So Seng Liang, who came from China, were shot to  death.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay: "The IDF is Taking an </F> Aggressive Approach"]    [Text] Yesterday's attack by Israel Air Force [IAF] jets  against a Hizballah training base in Lebanon's al-Biqa' was the  strongest blow dealt to the organization in the past eight years.    Even before they had time to recover from the abduction of  Mustafa al-Dirani, the leaders of the Hizballah lost dozens of  their youngest fighters in the heart of their "security zone" in  al-Biqa', under the nose of the Syrians and their antiaircraft  missiles.    The two latest actions reflect a new, far more aggressive,  approach recently adopted by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  against hostile elements in Lebanon with the government's  approval. In light of the deadlock in the negotiations with  Syria, Israel has no reason to show the restraint and passivity  which have characterized the IDF's activity in Lebanon until now.    In the absence of a better response, Hizballah resorted to  the familiar: launching Katyusha rockets at towns in the  Galilee. Judging from experience, this is not the last word.  One can safely assume not only additional Katyusha volleys over  the next few days but also a concentrated effort by Hizballah to  attack IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] outposts and patrols in  the security zone. There may be also be attempts to kidnap SLA  and IDF soldiers. The situation may deteriorate in a way  similar to the exacerbation that preceded Operation  Accountability [July 1993].    The difference is that this time, the IDF is taking the  initiative while the Hizballah is only reacting, to a large  extent out of helplessness. Another difference is the  increasing effectiveness of the IDF offensives.    The IAF has attacked in Lebanon dozens of times in recent  years, but only in rare cases has it managed to inflict a real  blow on the terrorist organizations. Most of the benefit of  these air raids lay in their deterrent effect and in their  disruption of preparations for terrorist operations. Now, the  fighting capabilities of the fundamentalist organization are  increasingly being undermined.    Judging from recent operations, the IDF has acquired some  intelligence information that enables it to strike at the root  of the problem; or in other words, Hizballah's fighting corps.  One can also discern an improvement in the IAF's capability to  carry out surprise attacks against distant targets, despite the  threats along the way (Syrian antiaircraft fire). This  improvement in the IDF's "long arm" enables it to refrain from  striking at the civilian populace which supports Hizballah, as  was the case in the past.    Yesterday's IDF operation did not violate the understandings  reached in the wake of Operation Accountability in July 1993.  The target attacked, 'Ayn Zarzarah, was not a village but a  major Hizballah training base several kilometers from the Syrian  border. In any case, it does not matter whether or not Israel  violated the understandings. Hizballah cannot allow itself not  to retaliate against the recent attacks. The question is which  form this reaction will take and how powerful it will be. It  will also serve as a test for the new Israeli strategy. If the  reaction is tolerable, and does not lead to a serious  exacerbation, then the Israeli gamble has paid off and the  recent operations have achieved their goal. But if we again  find ourselves in a situation where Israel has to ask the  Americans to mediate for a cease fire, with the help of Syria,  then both the gamble and the new strategy have failed.</p>

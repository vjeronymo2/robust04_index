Robert Riley, commander of the  Rampart station. No violence between warring gangs has been reported since the  task force of 40 officers moved in on Monday, he said. The officers have made  more than 60 arrests involving assault, drug possession, burglary and auto  theft, Riley said. About 80% of those arrested belong to gangs, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: VW back on the road Having forecast break-even in 1993, only to lose DM1.9bn (Pounds 800m), Volkswagen is understandably cautious about its predictions this year. Yesterday's first-half figures suggest it will cruise past the official break-even target after recording a net profit of DM133m (Pounds 55m) in the second quarter. Although its important German and Italian markets are still sluggish, the efforts of Messrs Piech and Lopez to cut VW's costs are coming through strongly. The group's domestic workforce was cut by 9 per cent last year and it aims to save over Pounds 1bn this year by introducing a four-day working week. The pain was rewarded by a mere 2.7 per cent increase in operating expenses in the first half against a 6.4 per cent increase in turnover. Deliveries were only slightly higher at 7.8 per cent, indicating that pressure on prices may be easing. VW did not break out the loss from Seat in Spain but the marque's deliveries jumped 23 per cent and, following the recent award of Pta40bn in state subsidies, it would be no surprise if the annual loss came in well below the DM900m the market has been led to expect. Although July's German car figures were poor, VW is getting increasing help from its markets. With new model launches coming up, it should be able to maintain good sales growth through next year. It is also going against the industry trend by taking contracted out activities back in house. Nevertheless, it is hard to see it generating enough work for many of its 30,000 surplus staff in Germany and it may find it more difficult to sell further job cuts as its finances improve.</p>

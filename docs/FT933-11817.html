			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Japnese Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission JAPAN'S Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, finally showed its teeth yesterday as prosecutors arrested an alleged leading stock speculator and a finance company official for alleged stock price manipulation, writes Emiko Terazono. The Tokyo district public prosecutors' office arrested Mr Makoto Araya, a stock speculator, and a former executive of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, an unlisted financing subsidiary of Sumitomo Realty and Development. Mr Araya is suspected of ramping the stock price of Nihon Unisys, the 32 per cent owned Japanese affiliate of the US computer group, during 1990 and 1991, through loans totalling some Y55bn (Pounds 344m) from Mr Hiroshi Kimura, former senior managing director of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance. The SESC conducted a raid on the offices of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance last December. On the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, fears that investigation by the prosecutors may spread to Sumitomo Realty and Development depressed its share price, which fell Y14 to Y706.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / NUM claim that threatened pits could make a profit ALL 10 mines that are threatened with immediate closure are 'capable of making a profit', the National Union of Mineworkers said yesterday. Mr Arthur Scargill, the union president, said that a new study of the pits, which employ 6,817 people, proved 'beyond any shadow of a doubt' that the pits were viable. 'They have extensive coal reserves and all of them are capable of making a profit or a financial contribution,' he said. The study showed that the 10 pits had a lifetime of between three years for Vane Tempest in the north-east and 150 years for Betws, in south Wales. The Markham Main pit near Doncaster had 115.6m tonnes of coal reserves. The other seven collieries that are faced with closure are Grimethorpe, Houghton Main, Silverhill, Trentham, Parkside, Taff Merthyr, and Cotgrave.</p>

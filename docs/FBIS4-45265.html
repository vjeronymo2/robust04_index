			<p>U.S.   Radar Operations   <F P=102> PA0206185794 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 31 May  94 pp 1a, 11a </F>  <F P=103> PA0206185794 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Since the Cartagena Agreement was signed on 15  February 1990 on the struggle against drug trafficking--which  includes the United States, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia--never  has such a tense situation been generated among the signatory  nations as the one observed last weekend between the United  States, Colombia, and Peru.    One month ago, the Pentagon issued an order to suspend  operations of the two radars that detect aircraft. These radars  operate in Colombia as a result of that agreement. The same  decision was made regarding the radars that operate in Peru.    This decision--labeled by high-ranking Colombian Government  spokespersons as "not consulted, untimely, unilateral, and  discourteous"--has not been officially communicated to the  authorities by the U.S. Government which has preferred to remain  silent.    The incident began on Sunday, 1 May. On that day, the  Colombian Air Force officer in charge of radar operations in  Aracuara and Leticia (Amazonas), officially communicated to the  Defense Ministry that--without any explication--the passing on  of information on flights from the radars was being suspended by  the U.S. military.    Since then and up until now, the two Colombian radars have  not been operating.    The order was issued by the Pentagon to the soldiers through  the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. A high-ranking government  official said: "The news was baffling although at the beginning  it was said that the suspension was only for eight days."    The following day, a Colombian Government official contacted  the embassy, which had no official information. At that point  President Gaviria decided to request a formal explanation for  what was happening. That was 28 days ago, and no reply has been  received yet.    In Colombia, the matter was handled with confidentiality,  until Sunday, when U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST reported that  Colombia and Peru "would take reprisals" against the United  States as a result of its decision to suspend operations of the  four radars. Those "reprisals" would be the decision to ship out  of the country two 30-year-old radars that were used in the  Vietnam War and which have been of no use in the struggle  against drug trafficking for the past month. A government  spokesman said that of course the removal of the radars would  also be accompanied by "a cordial invitation" to the U.S.  soldiers and experts in charge of their maintenance to leave the  country. No government official has confirmed or denied that  decision. A government spokesman consulted by EL TIEMPO,  however, said that "it is obvious that if the radars are  useless, there is no sense in keeping them or their technicians  in Colombian territory."    Meanwhile, the authorities know that drug traffickers'  illegal flights have been on the rise in the past month due to  the total absence of control in that Amazon area. This is where  drugs from Bolivia and Peru enter Colombia.    The official report on the illegal flights indicate that in  1993, in that area, 375 aircraft were detected and up until 1  May this year, 200 flights were reported. This past month an  average of one illegal flight per day has been added.    The government's final determination on the U.S. decision  will only be adopted when the United States gives a formal  explanation of what is occurring. In the meantime, it is only  known that the suspension of radars operations was decided by  the Pentagon, apparently without the blessing of the State  Department or the Justice Department.    What some government officials fear is that an explanation  will never be received, therefore Colombia will have to make a  decision.</p>

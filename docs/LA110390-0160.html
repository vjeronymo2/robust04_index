			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST CHAMBER PROGRAM;  </P> <P> UNUSUAL INSTRUMENTAL COMBINATIONS DOMINATE A REFRESHINGLY ECLECTIC PROGRAM IN  CHAPMAN COLLEGE'S SALMON RECITAL HALL.  </P> <P> The Southwest Chamber Music Society apparently doesn't want to know about the  word routine. That was the impression left by its refreshingly eclectic program  Thursday night in Chapman College's Salmon Recital Hall (and repeated Friday at  the Pasadena Library).  </P> <P> Unusual instrumental combinations dominated this outing, beginning with Max  Reger's delightful Serenade for flute, violin and viola, Opus 141a, a dashing,  rambunctious, richly harmonized piece that ought to be better known. Flutist  Dorothy Stone, violinist Peter Marsh and violist Jan Karlin checked in with a  rough yet lively reading that often tumbled headlong through Reger's difficult  writing.  </P> <P> Next were two demonstrations of sheer compositional genius with a minimum of  means in Benjamin Britten's quirky, humorous, sometimes self-absorbed "Six  Metamorphoses After Ovid" for solo oboe, and the amazing contrapuntal interplay  within Mozart's Duo for violin and viola, K. 424. Oboist Stuart Horn displayed  a firm, liquid, legato tone in Britten's soliloquy, and he was undaunted by a  beeper that went off in the audience in the middle of the piece. In the Mozart,  played by Marsh and Karlin, one could almost overlook Marsh's frequent lapses  in intonation, for the two were carrying on a joyous musical dialogue where  feeling triumphed over technical shortcomings.  </P> <P> In contrast with Britten's inventiveness with solo winds, Alexander Goehr's  Paraphrase on Claudio Monteverdi's "Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda"  for clarinet was a typically loose-jointed, rambling exercise that quickly  exhausted one's patience. Clarinetist Michael Grego ably coped with its angular  writing, frequent pauses and fashionable tapping of the keys.  </P> <P> But Goehr's arid landscape was quickly washed away by Prokofiev's wonderfully  savage Quintet in G minor, a product of the early 1920s that reminds the  listener of the acidic Second Symphony.  </P> <P> With its odd instrumental lineup (oboe, clarinet, violin, viola, bass),  abrasive drones and lurching rhythms, the piece can't help but summon images of  Stravinsky peering over Prokofiev's shoulder.  </P> <P> Here, double bassist Paul Zibits joined Marsh, Karlin, Horn and Grego in a  zesty performance made all the more effective by its rough edges.  </P></p>

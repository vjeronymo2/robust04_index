			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Profits revealed at JC Bamford JC Bamford, one of the UK's largest privately owned manufacturing companies, more than trebled pre-tax profits last year and is considering building a new factory at Cheadle, Staffordshire, to cope with rising demand. The company, Britain's biggest producer of construction equipment, will tell its 2,700 employees this week that pre-tax profits surged to Pounds 26.6m last year from Pounds 8.3m in 1992, as sales rose to Pounds 398.4m from Pounds 359.8m. JCB, founded by Mr Joe Bamford in 1945, has traditionally said little about its overall financial performance. But his son Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman, has revealed for the first time details of the company's recent profits record. The figures show that JCB's pre-tax profits dipped to a low point of Pounds 8.3m in 1992. But it is one of the few construction equipment producers in the world to have come through the recent recession without making an annual loss. Sir Anthony said all the company's divisions were profitable last year, except its wheeled-loader business, which had just launched long-awaited new products, and its three-year-old excavator joint venture with Japan's Sumitomo Construction Machinery. The joint venture, JCB-SCM, shares a factory in Uttoxeter with the JCB Special Products company, which makes small machines. Sir Anthony said the factory was 'bursting at the seams', partly because the strong yen had increased the need for local content in the venture's Japanese-inspired products. JCB's intention was to move Special Products to the 91-acre site of a former opencast coal mine at Cheadle, which the company bought two years ago. The move, said Sir Anthony, would be 'positive' for employment, but JCB had yet to make a final decision. The company has added 400 jobs this year, and produced 4,000 machines in the first quarter, up 68 per cent from a year earlier. Sir Anthony said profits this year should rise further to Pounds 30m-Pounds 40m. Analysis, Page 18</p>

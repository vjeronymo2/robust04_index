			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Text] Witbank Jan 28 SAPA--National Party [NP] leader F.W.  de Klerk, on the election campaign trail in the Eastern  Transvaal, was given a heated reception by African National  Congress [ANC]-supporting youths during a trip to Witbank's  Mooiloop township on Friday [28 January] morning.    But there was also a friendly welcoming from a quiet but  curious crowd--mostly elderly folk and young children--who  followed him on a short walkabout through the township and into  a local spaza shop.    The protesters--who followed the De Klerk entourage at a  distance -- toyi-toyied [protest danced] and whistled, shouting:  "Hamba [go away] De Klerk," "This is our country--go away," and  "This place belongs to Mandela."    Mr de Klerk gave a short speech in which he condemned  political intolerance and criticised the pulling down of NP  flags before his arrival in the township.    In the spaza shop, the last stop of Mr de Klerk's Mooiloop  tour, the NP leader bought fruit gums for three young boys who  had followed him into the premises. By this time the ANC  supporters had grown into a noisy crowd and Mr de Klerk, looking  calm, retreated to his armoured limo and left for the next stop  -- Lynnville, another central Witbank township.    The trip to Hoalanikhale (Mooiloop) started with a visit to  three men wearing men NP paper caps standing by their metal  shanty.    Mr de Klerk spent some time speaking to them and addressing  the crowd from their small yard. "Tonight they (the local NP  supporters) die," an ANC supporter was heard to say.    An NP organiser said this was standard ANC reaction and that  the party would rely on the local peace committee to help their  supporters.    At Lynnville, Mr de Klerk made a short stop to visit Theresa  Mathemba whose tiny quarters in a converted hostel was too  cramped to allow reporters to enter.</p>

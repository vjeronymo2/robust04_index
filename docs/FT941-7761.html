			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Unilever restructuring foods and detergents Full-year figures from Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, were dominated by unexpectedly large restructuring costs of Pounds 490m. Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said the charges would be concentrated on foods and detergents, with North America carrying a disproportionate share. Of the total, 57 per cent will be incurred in Europe and 37 per cent in North America. By product division, 37 per cent will come in food, 37 per cent in detergents, 14 per cent in personal products and 11 per cent in speciality chemicals. In operating profit terms, Europe showed a full year increase of 4 per cent to Pounds 1.33bn, before restructuring charges and at current exchange rates. Sir Michael said this was despite a distinct slowdown in sales in southern Europe in the second half of the year. Sales in central Europe had doubled to Pounds 300m, and were profitable. Operating profits in North America were ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 427m, but down 6 per cent at constant exchange rates. Sir Michael said the launch of liquid detergents 'had not lived up to expectations', and that marketing changes and cost reductions were being carried out accordingly. He denied that Unilever was at the mercy of Procter &amp; Gamble, the market leader. 'Unilever is at the beck and call of nobody', he said. 'What we may do is choose not to take a bloody nose in the plains, but move to the hills.' Overall, Lever US had remained in profit for the year, he said. In the rest of the world, sales expanded 31 per cent to Pounds 7bn and profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 668m. Though much of this was due to acquisition, Sir Michael said, the momentum of earnings growth from the developing world was undiminished. In Japan, sales volume grew by 15 per cent, and a profit was made for the first time in a number of years. In divisional terms, much the strongest performance came from personal products, where operating profits at current exchange rates was 33 per cent higher at Pounds 419m. In food, profits were 8 per cent higher at Pounds 1.19bn. Detergents were up 6 per cent at Pounds 489m and speciality chemicals up 14 per cent at Pounds 277m. After net interest payable of Pounds 147m (Pounds 148m), pre-tax profits after exceptionals and at current exchange rates were Pounds 1.94bn (Pounds 2.03bn). After tax of Pounds 580m (Pounds 686m) and minorities of Pounds 67m (Pounds 52m), net profits were static at Pounds 1.3bn. Following dividend payments of Pounds 542m (Pounds 473m), retained profits were Pounds 754m (Pounds 818m). Net debt rose by Pounds 300m to Pounds 1.4bn, after expenditure on acquisitions of Pounds 590m. Gearing was 21 per cent (19.5 per cent) at the year end. In the fourth quarter, at constant rates of exchange, operating profits before exceptionals were up 6 per cent to Pounds 606m on sales up 4 per cent at Pounds 6.77bn. Net profits before exceptionals were 7 per cent up at Pounds 394m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     UNILEVER: 1993 OPERATING PROFITS*                    (percent change over previous year)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Foods  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Oil and dairy products                            Speciality chemicals Pounds 404m (+22.0%)                              Pounds 277m (+14.5%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ice Cream, beverages and snacks                   Personal products Pounds 360m (+2.6%)                               Pounds 419m (+33.4%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Meals                                             Detergents Pounds 273m (-5.9%)                               Pounds 489m (+6.1%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Professional markets                              Others Pounds 150m (+13.6%)                              Pounds 55m (-27.6%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Unilever Group  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Before exceptional items  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

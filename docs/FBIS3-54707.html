As from the beginning of 1994, oil prospecting, which will  contribute to bringing the country out of the energy crisis, is  planned to be carried out with the participation of foreign  firms in the territory of the Republic of Georgia. In order to  secure order at geological survey sites at the oil fields:    1. Full responsibility for the security of people engaged in  work at the oil fields and the establishment of order in the  corresponding areas will be given to the Georgian Ministry of  Internal Affairs. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the  state Georgian Petroleum will sign an appropriate agreement and  create proper conditions for police sub-units to carry out the  assignment.    2. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will prevent any  attempts  by armed formations to obstruct establishment of proper order at  oil- prospecting sites and refining installations.    3. The Georgian Ministry of Justice and the Procurator's  Office will examine the state of the management of security at  the installations and submit propositions about appropriate  amendments to be introduced in the legislation to the Georgian  parliament and the Georgian head of state.    [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Figures in a landscape - German drawings SO wrote the young German artist Philip Otto Runge at the dawn of the 19th century. Where this widely-shared conviction of freedom and new beginnings was to take German art is the theme of Neo-Classical and Romantic: German Drawings of the 18th and 19th Centuries at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. These drawings, which come from a German private collection, have in the past two years also been shown in Hanover and Lubeck under the title Goethezeit und Romantik. It will be a good marker of how far this country's re-education into pre-20th-Century German culture will have gone when Goethezeit is no longer felt to need a gloss. The beautifully-printed, hardback catalogue is good value at Pounds 18. This is an exhibition which takes a lot of looking, packed as it is with beautiful drawings and watercolours from the period 1760 to 1860. Among the famous names are Angelica Kaufmann, Josef Anton Koch, Runge himself (a sheet of lively sketches for the portrait of the artist's parents in Hamburg), Caspar David Friedrich, Overbeck, Moritz von Schwind, Goethe's great friend Tischbein, and Goethe himself. Landscape predominates, satisfyingly, because, in the eyes of Runge and his circle, it offered modern artists the chance to excel both antiquity and the artists of the high Renaissance. In Koch's sepia drawing (a very popular medium at this period) of the Schmadribach Waterfall in Switzerland, he includes a modern-dress Judgment of Paris in the foreground, with peasant goddesses in straw hat and mob-caps. However, the point of this exercise was anything but whimsical. Koch, born in the Tyrol, knew his mountains and the interesting claim is made for him as 'the first artist to capture in his painting the powerful emotions evoked by mountains.' Painstakingly exact and yet dramatic, monumental drawings like these were intended to thrill viewers' souls with the philosophic spectacle of creation in all its rugged grandeur. The exhibition is on the whole quiet-toned; most of the watercolours are very restrained in their palettes. However, for virtuoso brilliance it is hard to beat Thomas Ender's mountain view. His technique of combining little strokes of paint with areas of paper left blank, creates a dazzling impression of trees, mud, rock, and sunshine and shadow striking on the snowy summit. Imaginary vistas of heroic landscapes alternate with the sort of tranquil studies of the Italian countryside around Rome in which accomplished draughtsmen continued to pay homage to Claude. The figures who wend through these landscapes are often pilgrims, such was the keen interest even northern Protestants now took in the spectacle of Catholicism. Either that, or they are medieval knights, hunters, hermits, or the kind of Romantic wanderer made so familiar by Schubert. A storm-wracked landscape by Johann Christian Rheinhart is the backdrop to Macbeth's meeting with the witches. Like Koch's comical Teutonic god sitting on a waterfall, it is a useful reminder of the intensely literary preoccupations which still underlay people's approach to landscape in art. To make this point sink in all the better and to tie in the English to the German experience, make sure not to miss the Tate Gallery's enthralling exhibition Turner and Byron (until 20 September: sponsored by TSB). In the final room, which is largely given over to the revivalist movement of the Nazarene Brotherhood, figures become as important as landscape. The Nazarenes' admiration (political as well as aesthetic) for the art of Altdorfer and the Rhineland school shows itself clearly in Moritz von Schwind's drawing of a hermit wading along a stream through the depths of a forest which is, with its grappling tree roots and ivy, extraordinarily alive. Von Schwind and his Nazarene friends also looked to legends of the heroic middle ages, as in his large drawing showing a crusader returning home with a baptised Saracen princess who was to become his bigamous second wife. But for all the attractive discoveries to make - a study of medlars by Horny, Richter's Rest on the Flight into Egypt, the fairy-tale idylls by Schnorr von Carlsfeld - it is the German Romantic artist almost everyone has heard of who still steals the show. There are four landscape sketches by Caspar David Friedrich, two of them not seen before. They take us from the artist's youth through the period of fame and relative fortune, into his sad old age. A sepia landscape near Teplitz, painted in recollection, is one of the last efforts by a man whose strength had ebbed almost to nothing. And yet it is a miracle of subtlety and pathos, something to hold a viewer spellbound and humbled. Neo-Classical and Romantic at the Fitzwilliam, Cambridge, ends on 13 September: closed on Mondays.

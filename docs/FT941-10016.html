			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Perhaps the UN ought to have designated a Day Of The Family rather than a Year: those not sick to death of the family before the year began are pretty sure to be by the time television has finished with it. Today C4 begins Faces Of The Family, a series in which Mavis Nicholson interviews various members of one extended family. She begins with Pauline Crabbe, a black social worker who is on her third husband. Clearly an expert (8.00). With television nothing succeeds like excess. Last Friday Alexei Sayle was the main guest on The Unpleasant World Of Penn And Teller, a conjuring show (10.30 C4). Yesterday BBC2 gave us 'The All New Alexei Sayle Show'. At 8.50 this evening BBC1 brings us Drive with Alexei Sayle telling us how to make the roads safer. Then, at 9.30, BBC2 gets Alexei Sayle to launch the BBC Design Awards 1994. Why not just give him John Birt's job and have done with it. BBC2 ends its rerun of Series 1 of Red Dwarf at 9.00. Then, at 10.00 BBC2 repeats an unforgettable episode of Blackadder II.</p>

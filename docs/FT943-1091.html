			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / NatWest may bid for Irish bank National Westminster Bank is likely to be allowed to make an IPounds 110m (Pounds 108m) bid for TSB Bank in the Republic of Ireland as part of an effort by the Irish government to create a 'third force' in the banking sector to rival Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. The government is expected to allow NatWest to bid against National Australia Bank for TSB. Although the trustees of TSB have agreed to be acquired by NAB, the government is likely to intervene to ensure that it receives the highest price for the state-owned bank. The government is due to receive a report next month prepared jointly by SKC Corporate Finance, NM Rothschild and William Fry outlining a framework for a TSB auction. The successful bidder may also be required to buy Industrial Credit Corporation, the state-controlled finance house. NatWest has been given the financial data to allow it to make a financial assessment of TSB, which had IPounds 1.23bn in assets, and capital reserves of IPounds 57.5m, at the end of 1993. NatWest has said it is willing to make a higher bid than NAB, which is thought to have offered IPounds 102m. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said he believes that NatWest was now more likely to be allowed to bid for TSB. 'The door is rather more open than it was because, although NAB had a head start, the position is being looked at and other options evaluated,' he said. Lord Alexander said that by combining TSB with Ulster Bank, NatWest would be able to achieve 'considerable further development' of its Irish banking operations. 'It would be an even more serious presence, and what might be described as a true third force,' he said. Challengers jostle in the queue, Page 19</p>

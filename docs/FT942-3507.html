			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Mixed reception for Swiss move on bonds in yen The Swiss National Bank's announcement that it will allow bond issues denominated in yen, or linked to yen, to be launched in the Swiss market was given a mixed reception from bankers yesterday. The move follows lobbying by the Swiss subsidiaries of several Japanese securities firms, according to Swiss bankers. Some Japanese companies are keen to issue equity-linked debt in yen rather than in Swiss francs, to avoid foreign exchange risk. By issuing such unlisted bonds in the Swiss market, it is possible to avoid the stricter rules on documentation and on secondary market trading, which are enforced in the eurobond market. Such issues - known as Alpine bonds - are already permitted in US and Canadian dollars, and Ecus, but the market has been slow to develop. 'The move is driven by borrowers rather than investors,' said one Swiss banker. 'The question is whether any retail investors will be interested.' Another banker in Zurich expressed concern that the move could encourage the Swiss market to be seen as a route for selling second-rate bonds. 'We don't want to regain the reputation we had in the late 1980s as a junk bond market with triple-A pricing,' he said. A SFr100m convertible issue for Hosiden Corporation, which has already tapped the Swiss market, could be the first of the new genre. The deal would be redeemable in yen, if the bonds were not converted by maturity.</p>

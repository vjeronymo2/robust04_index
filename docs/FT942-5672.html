			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / People: Engineering a career at WS Atkins The engineering design and consultancy firm of WS Atkins has appointed Helen Stone, who first joined the company in 1972 as a graduate engineer, as managing director of WS Atkins Structural Engineering (one of some 25 divisions within the company). She will be responsible for its engineers in the UK and overseas. WS Atkins has a history stretching back to 1938, when William Atkins - who died in 1989 - first registered the firm as WS Atkins Partners. Mostly engaged in defence contracts during the war years, the firm's first real coup was to be awarded the contract to design and supervise the building of Britain's first large post-war steelworks at Port Talbot. Today, the company is one of Europe's largest design consultancies, with some 4,000 staff employed on contracts in more than 40 countries. It has taken a significant part in the construction of the Channel Tunnel, advising the banks on progress of the project and also conducting safety audits. Stone was elected a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1991, the third woman to receive that recognition. She says she is 'not in favour of positive discrimination but I am conscious that I have a responsibility to break down inappropriate barriers which prevent women engineers from making progress. The difference between men and women does not extend to their ability to make engineering calculations, or take engineering decisions.' Stone's dislike of positive discrimination in engineering circles stems from a rational basis: 'It's still a profession where men predominate, and if you come across a female engineer the general assumption is 'she must be pretty good to have got so far'. I'm worried that if we start introducing positive discrimination that those very high standards will start to get lower.' She replaces Chris Symonds, who moves to be managing director of WS Atkins Building Management Northwest.</p>

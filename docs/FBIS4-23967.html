			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by C.B.: "Four Years of Military Cooperation </F> Between Paris and Kigali"]    [Text] It was after the outbreak of war in October 1990  that France virtually ousted Belgium as a close partner of the  [former Rwandan President] Habyarimana regime. It was at that  time, when Brussels was simply evacuating expatriates and  suspending deliveries of ammunition already paid for, that Paris  sent a company of paratroopers to Kigali. The French soldiers,  who increased in number to 680 men, remained in Rwanda until  December 1993, their departure coinciding with the arrival of  the first UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] Blue Helmets.    Officially, their mission was to reassure and protect the  expatriates, particularly French nationals. However, it was  clear to everybody in Rwanda that the French military  involvement went much further than this: Lieutenant Colonel  Chollet, dispatched by the French Defense Ministry, was an  adviser to President Habyarimana. Also, members of the four  French companies sent to Rwanda were present at checkpoints and  were involved in identity checks on the Rwandan population.    Two companies were deployed in the north of Kigali, where  the  threat from the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] was likely to come  from. French military advisers also trained Rwandan troops,  increased from 5,000 to 40,000 men following the outbreak of  war. French advisers did not only create training centers but  were also, according to many reports, directly involved in  fighting by the government army to halt the RPF advance.    At the time of negotiations that led to the Arusha accords,  when there was talk of sending a UN force to Rwanda, France even  suggested transforming its units already present in Rwanda into  Blue Helmets, a proposal rejected by the RPF that considered  that Paris had been the strongest ally of the Habyarimana regime.    In addition to this military assistance, Paris also supplied  the regime with arms and ammunition, and a report published at  the beginning of 1994 by Human Rights Watch, a U.S.  nongovernmental organization, stressed that France, together  with Egypt and South Africa, was the principal arms supplier to  Rwanda. Human Rights Watch also affirmed that [French Bank]  Credit Lyonnais had guaranteed Rwanda's purchase of arms worth  $6 billion from Egypt. The bank subsequently refuted this  information, stating that it was simply a transfer of funds.    Although France's political and military support for the  Habyarimana regime was evident, many questions remain as to the  reasons for this involvement. The official argument always put  forward, in addition to defense agreements concluded between the  two countries, has always been the excellent relations between  President Mitterrand and the Rwandan president. Rwanda, where  fewer than 10 percent of the population speak French, has always  been seen as part of the French-speaking world, compared to  English-speaking Uganda and Kenya.    At first sight, it is not the natural resources of this  overpopulated little country that could have explained its  importance for Paris, but rather its strategic location: Rwanda  makes it possible to monitor the eastern flank of the huge and  very rich Zaire and France had allegedly planned to establish a  military base there linking Bangui and Djibouti.    Information given by the "Geopolitical Drugs Observatory" in  its 1994 report speaks of French soldiers involved in cannabis  and heroin trafficking.    It was only after the outbreak of the present tragedy that  France attempted to transfer the Rwandan issue to the United  Nations until [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, due to the  slowness of the UN procedure, decided to go ahead and launch  humanitarian aid more than two months after the start of the  massacres. But this tardy initiative is meeting with a hostile  response from the RPF which, given the past events, refuses to  believe in the good intentions of Paris.</p>

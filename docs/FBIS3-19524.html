In this case "spinning"  has nothing to do with purring contentedly before the open fire,  but everything to do with a public relations (PR) machine which  is overwhelming the press with one-sided information. In this  case about the president's economic plans.    The occasion was the two day G-7 meeting on employment. At  the invitation of President Clinton, the finance, trade and  labor ministers from the seven richest countries had gone to  "Motown" to meditate openly and behind closed doors about  fighting unemployment.    This international setpiece was intended to distract  attention from Clinton's problems in Washington. There he is  being pursued by the call for more openness and hearings in the  Whitewater affair. In Detroit and during other events in the  country he could finally concentrate on his policies again. For  a brief moment he was out of the snake pit.    To ensure that the media understood that too, Clinton's PR  machine provided the exclamation points. The U.S. treasury  secretary called Clinton's ideas "amazing." The commerce  secretary said he found them "exciting." The top economic  advisor spoke of "remarkable" plans. Vice President Al Gore  called the conference "an important turning point in the postwar  dialogue between the United States and other industrialized  countries."    The rather less exuberant comment by the British  representative that he had been to "other dull meetings like  this one" could not temper U.S. enthusiasm. The message was  intended for the U.S. public and not for foreigners who, after  all, do not have votes.    But things went wrong. Clinton's speech on Monday [14 March]  was to have sent out the signal to the masses that the President  is keeping an eye on the interests of the average worker and  unemployed person, despite healthy economic growth. On Monday  morning that seemed to still be working, but the fun was spoiled  a little later by Webster Hubbell. Hubbell is a friend of the  Clintons and a former colleague of Hillary Clinton. On Monday  he resigned as a highly placed member of staff at the justice  department. Hubbell is suspected of charging excessively high,  unjustified bills to his clients while working as a lawyer in  Arkansas.    So Clinton's comments took a back seat. Once again the  President was plagued by questions about his cabinet, scandals,  ethics and the departure of his friends from Washington. A week  earlier Bernard Nussbaum, the top lawyer in the White House and  another friend of the Clintons, had resigned because of  Whitewater. In the morning in Detroit Clinton was still proud of  his policies, in the afternoon in Boston he was back at the  beginning.    And what about the conference itself? The participants  called it a success, of course. They would "take the comments  with them" to the G-7 summit in Naples this summer. However,  the ministers reached no conclusions and announced no moves.    In any case the participants have learned one thing. They  have seen with their own eyes what happens in a city plagued by  11 percent unemployment with virtually no social safety net.  Their limousines, escorted by a noisy police escort, shot past  boarded up houses along dilapidated streets. The Detroit-based  car industry may have risen from its slump, but it is robots and  cheap labor elsewhere which does the work.</p>

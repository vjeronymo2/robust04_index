			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ex-head of Skanska finance unit jailed MR LEIF Ottosson, former head of the financial subsidiary of Skanska, Scandinavia's biggest construction and property company, was jailed yesterday for one year by a Stockholm court on charges arising from a SKr518 (Dollars 66.4m) loss incurred by Skanska last year on foreign currency dealing. Mr Ottosson, 37, was suspended as president of Skanska Kapitalforvaltning last August when the loss came to light. His speculative spree helped precipitate the resignation of Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson as chairman and chief executive of Skanska. Skanska accused Mr Ottosson of illegal currency speculation during the summer when internal security measures were not fully enforced due to the absence of other senior executives on holiday. It said he admitted distorting reports to the board and changing figures in Skanska's computer. The police were called in and Mr Ottosson was eventually convicted on charges of breach of trust. The currency loss contributed to Skanska's SKr3.53bn loss last year.</p>

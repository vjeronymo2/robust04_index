			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sanyo Securities plans Y20bn rights issue Sanyo Securities, the troubled Japanese broker, yesterday announced it would raise Y20bn (Dollars 198m) through a rights issue to its three leading creditor banks - Nippon Credit Bank, Bank of Tokyo and Daiwa Bank - and Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder. A total of 41.7m shares at Y480 each will be issued with payment set for the end of this month. Of these, 33.8m, or 81 per cent, will be allotted to Nomura Land Building, a property subsidiary of Nomura, raising the company's stake to 16.3 per cent from 5.3 per cent. Nippon Credit Bank and Bank of Tokyo will each take 2.7m shares, raising their stakes to 5 per cent from 4.8 per cent, while Daiwa Bank will purchase 2.6m shares, raising its holding to 4.7 per cent from 4.5 per cent. The funding is part of Sanyo's restructuring programme, announced last March, which the broker is carrying out under the supervision of the three banks and Nomura. Sanyo, one of Japan's 10 medium-sized broking houses, has been hit by Y70bn in non-performing loans at its finance affiliate. Last month, the three creditor banks reduced their interest rates on loans to Sanyo's affiliates to 1.25 per cent. Other city banks also lowered their rates to 2 per cent, said Mr Takashi Ikeuchi, Sanyo president. Interest rates on loans from other banks and insurance companies were cut to 2.5 per cent, with those from non-bank finance companies lowered to 3 per cent, he said. During the late 1980s, the broker had ambitions of becoming a large financial conglomerate with stockbroking and banking as its main pillars. After the collapse in asset prices in 1990, Sanyo's affiliates were left with mounting bad loans, which squeezed the parent company's profit margins. Sanyo was hit by the bad loan burden and declining revenue due to the slump on the Tokyo stock market.</p>

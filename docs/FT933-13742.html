			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Importance of know-what Sir, Michael Dixon rightly distinguishes 'know-how' from 'know-what' ('Jobs', July 7). We find that graduates vary in these respects and that employers could sometimes do more to help themselves when making appointments. They could, for instance, take tutorial advice about the qualities required of applicants, although that is no longer fashionable. And, in the now-confusing educational jungle, they should identify degree courses most likely to produce graduates with practical flair. In business studies, such students may well be focused on one sector. They should be challenged from the start with difficult tasks, with rigorous deadlines and a high workload. They should be given presentational skills. There should be easy access to staff for consultation. Sandwich placements may add an important dimension. Students should be assessed in various ways but exams should not demand feats of memory. None of that need detract from academic standards or the wider benefits of student life.

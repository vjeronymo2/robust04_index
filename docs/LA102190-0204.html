			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: YOUR BEST PROTECTION IS TO FIND A STRONG INSURER  </P> <P> Mounting woes among the nation's life insurers have triggered concerns about  whether the industry might become the next big financial crisis. The industry  insists that it will avoid a debacle on the scale of the savings and loan mess,  but it's nonetheless prudent that you check the financial strength of your  insurer before investing.  </P> <P> The problem in a nutshell is that many insurers -- seeking to offer high  returns in their insurance, annuity and other products -- invested during the  1980s in riskier assets, including commercial real estate and high-yield junk  bonds.  </P> <P> Accordingly, there is a "significant risk" that a severe economic downturn or  decline in major investment markets could result in the insolvency of one-fifth  of the nation's major life insurers, according to a recent report by IDS  Financial Services, a unit of American Express, which owns a life insurance  company.  </P> <P> Signs of troubles are mounting. Failures of life insurers -- mostly smaller  firms -- are increasing, and industry-administered guaranty funds have been  paying out enormous amounts to policyholders and others in insolvent firms.  Some experts fear that a collapse of one giant insurer could trigger a domino  effect among others.  </P> <P> What does this mean to you as a current or potential policyholder?  </P> <P> No one knows for sure what could happen because a big insurer has never  collapsed. But if insurers become insolvent or go under, you or your  beneficiaries could lose your death benefits, annuity payments or cash buildup  in your policies. Or, more likely, you or your beneficiaries may be forced to  wait months or years before getting that money, says Glenn S. Daily, an  independent insurance consultant in New York. Holders of annuities in  now-defunct Baldwin-United, for example, had to wait years before getting their  money.  </P> <P> California recently joined a number of states with laws creating so-called  guaranty funds designed to protect policyholders in cases of insolvency. That  would be similar to how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. protects savers in  the event of bank or S&amp;L failures.  </P> <P> California's fund (which is actually called a guaranty association) will become  effective next January and will protect eligible consumers for up to $250,000  in death benefits and $100,000 in cash value, says Mark Rakich, legislative  counsel for the state Department of Insurance.  </P> <P> But California's program is more restrictive than those of many other states,  limiting even further how much it will actually cover, Rakich notes.  </P> <P> California's plan and other programs carry many other limitations as well, says  Joseph M. Belth, professor of insurance at Indiana University and a leading  expert on life insurers. For example, they generally provide only for the  collection of assessments from insurance companies after an insolvency, Belth  says. Also, they may not pay residents outside their states, so that if you  hold a policy from an out-of-state insurer that fails, you may not get  anything. And they don't have federal backing like the FDIC.  </P> <P> "The real question is what would happen if there's an insolvency of a major  company," Belth says. "If that happens, it's not clear if the arrangements  would work. It's possible that the assessments would be so large as to bring  down other companies."  </P> <P> Thus, the best protection is to make sure you do business with financially  strong insurers.  </P> <P> The simplest way to do that is by checking the ratings of insurers by the four  major rating agencies: A. M. Best, Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's Investors  Service and Duff &amp; Phelps.  </P> <P> Many major public libraries carry A. M. Best's guide, "Best's Insurance  Reports, Life-Health Edition," containing its ratings and reports on insurance  firms.  </P> <P> Reports from the other rating agencies also may be available at libraries with  extensive business-reference collections (you could get them directly from the  rating agencies, but that tends to be expensive and is not generally advisable  for the average consumer). You may have better luck getting this information  from your insurance agent.  </P> <P> But ratings are not foolproof. And it's also possible that your policy may have  been transferred to another insurer, so that your original due diligence has  become moot.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, experts say, it's still worth checking the ratings. If you are  most conservative, stick with only those insurers with the top ratings. For A.  M. Best, the top rating is A+; at Standard &amp; Poor's, it's AAA; Moody's,  Aaa, and Duff &amp; Phelps, AAA.  </P> <P> Belth notes that about 270 life insurers enjoy Best's A+ rating. About 190 have  carried the A+ rating for 10 straight years, he says. To get a list of those,  plus other information on insurance ratings, send $10 to Insurance Forum, P.O.  Box 245, Ellettsville, Ind. 47429. Ask for the September, 1990, issue of  Insurance Forum.  </P> <P> What if you already have a policy with a firm with financial woes? That has  been the dilemma facing policyholders of Executive Life Insurance Co., the life  insurance unit of Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp. News about the firm's  ailing junk bond portfolio have caused many customers to terminate their  policies, incurring surrender charges in the process.  </P> <P> If you have a term life policy (one that provides for only a death benefit,  without a savings or cash-value component), you can switch to another insurer  when it's time to renew the policy after you've had it for a year.  </P> <P> But the decision is tougher if you have a cash-value policy, annuity or other  long-term product. Then the decision can depend on a number of factors,  including the financial strength of the insurer, the surrender charges and your  state of health. Replacing the policy might be in order if the cost of new  insurance will be lower than your current policy and you can make the switch  easily and cheaply.  </P> <P> Because the decision can be difficult, Belth suggests consulting with a trusted  and knowledgeable insurance adviser (not necessarily your agent).  </P></p>

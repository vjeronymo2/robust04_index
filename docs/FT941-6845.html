			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Arts: Curtain up on a first class show of initiative - A look at the plight of dance and theatre students in search of a grant Last week I got the chance to adopt Martin Scott Gilmore. He seems a nice lad from his photographs, even if he does spend most of his time covered in make-up and pointing a toe. Gilmore is a student at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, and like most drama and dance students these days he does not get a grant from his local authority. He gets by by persuading a group of patrons to pay his rent, livings costs and fees, and wants more backers to see him through his final year. In return for cash you get termly progress reports and a warm glow. Friday afternoon another drama student, Richard Knight, who is at LAMDA, was chairing a discussion at the Duke of York's Theatre involving Stephen Fry, Derek Jacobi and Brian Blessed. Apart from the fascination of the conversation, the ticket revenue from the event should enable Knight to complete his course. In the second year at LAMDA only two of the 24 students are on full grants. These are just two examples of how drama and dance students must use their initiative to keep going. Local authority grants are disappearing fast, and most tyro actors and dancers are forced to get an evening job, or rely on the generosity of their parents to see them through their courses. To rub salt in the wound, they rarely qualify for student loans - either because they are not taking degree courses, or because they can hardly guarantee being employed, and thus able to repay the money, after completing their studies. The figures speak for themselves. In 1987, 83 per cent of the students at the leading drama schools were receiving full awards from their local authorities; in 1993 only 39 per cent were in this happy situation. Dance students are in the same boat. By a twist of history, music students, thanks to the influence of Ted Heath when prime minister, and art students, considered to be potential contributors to the nation's craft and design skills, can usually rely on grants from their councils. The government's remorseless capping of local authority expenditure has forced them to limit the size and number of grants, or stop them altogether. Even cities basking in the glory of patrons of the arts, like Birmingham and Manchester, have stopped making grants, along with inner London boroughs, like Lambeth, Haringey and Brent, and counties like Worcestershire and Warwickshire. This puts terrible pressure on the drama and dance schools. They maintain that they still offer places to auditioning students on merit, but they know that, at the last minute, some will not receive a grant and will fail to arrive for classes. It makes planning very difficult. The Drama Centre, for example, with an intake of 30 last year, wanted nine students who failed to make the course for financial reasons. And two more students dropped out after starting lessons because of money problems. It is not only the students that are frustrated. In many cases parents take out a second mortgage or sell off grandmother's jewellery to finance the course. Then unemployment, or some other calamity, strikes and the whole family faces penury. Worries about paying the fees as well as the rent inevitably takes its toll in the performance of students, who are often exhausted after spending their evenings working in bars and restaurants. The colleges do their best by building up scholarship funds, and looking to board members and sponsors to make donations. They can often find money for students from obviously under-privileged groups, like the ethnic minorities, but there is never enough available. Successful actors and dancers are under constant pressure to respond to appeals from students at the drama and dance schools which nurtured them. If they help out one, they are inundated with more requests. Richard Ralph, of the London Contemporary Dance School spells out the problems. 'Good students are not coming forward because they fear they will not get a grant. Of last autumn's first year intake of 50, a half had funding problems. For the first time ever more of our students are paying for themselves than are getting a grant.' And over 40 per cent are from abroad. There are alternative courses in the new universities, like Middlesex, which offer practical training as part of more academic courses in drama and dance, but the hours spent on the bars, or in performance, are much fewer. And some colleges like Rambert, which is linked to the West London Institute, and the Royal Ballet School, have more secure financial supports. But for many of the most famous schools, like Guildhall, and Central, and Laban, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. Peter Brooke, the National Heritage Secretary, is aware of the crisis. He does not want the professions to become the preserve of the middle classes, foreigners, or students who by chance live in a favoured part of the country. He understands that without decent grants the next generation of Kenneth Branaghs and Michael Clarks will not emerge, and the contribution of the arts to the well-being of the nation will be weakened. Last week discussions took place with the Education Secretary John Patten, who has responsibility for student funding, and the inevitable report was commissioned. There does at last seem to be the will to resolve the matter. The problem is the Treasury. It does not want to sanction a new central source of funding students with a tendency to grow like Topsy. What will probably happen is that a list of approved drama and dance schools will be drawn up, and students awarded places by these institutions can be confident of grants. With annual fees rarely topping Pounds 7,000 this should cost the government only Pounds 3m or so a year. But with auditions well under way for the next academic year action is needed swiftly to prevent another crop of talent withering to dust.</p>

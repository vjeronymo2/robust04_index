			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHUNG TRADES SERIES FOR CHANCE AT MOTHERHOOD;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: CBS NEWSWOMAN POSTPONES HER NEW MONDAY NIGHT PROGRAM BUT WILL STILL  DO SIX NETWORK 'SPECIALS.'  </P> <P> In one of the more unusual developments in network television, newswoman Connie  Chung declared Monday that she is postponing her new CBS magazine series while  she and her husband, TV journalist Maury Povich, try to have a child.  </P> <P> The program, "Face to Face with Connie Chung" -- a retooling from her Saturday  night show of last season -- was scheduled to begin a regular run in September  at 10 p.m. on Mondays.  </P> <P> But CBS News announced on Monday that she will only do six as-yet-unscheduled  "specials" through December, and will continue anchoring the Sunday night  edition of "CBS Evening News."  </P> <P> CBS Entertainment then announced that it will fill the Monday night slot with a  new Sharon Gless series, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," in which the actress  will play an upscale Beverly Hills corporate attorney turned public defender  for downscale clients. The executive producer is Barney Rosenzweig, who also  ran "Cagney &amp; Lacey," in which Gless co-starred.  </P> <P> The new series will debut Sept. 17 during the network's premiere week.  </P> <P> A CBS News publicist said that the weekly "Face to Face With Connie Chung"  series will be started "as soon as possible." But there was no estimate of when  that might be.  </P> <P> "Maury and I have reached an important point in our lives," Chung said in a  prepared statement released by the network. "We want very much to have a child.  Unfortunately, time is running out for me when it comes to childbearing. I will  be 44 next month."  </P> <P> Povich anchors the daily syndicated magazine series "A Current Affair,"  although he is leaving when his contract is up next summer to develop a talk  show for Paramount Domestic Television.  </P> <P> Chung said that after consulting her doctors last week, she felt that she  needed "to take a very aggressive approach to having a baby."  </P> <P> She asked the network "to lighten my workload" and said that the network was  accepting her decision "wholeheartedly."  </P> <P> "This was an extremely difficult decision for obvious reasons," she went on. "I  have always kept my private life just that. It's difficult to publicly reveal  such an important private moment. But I want to be honest with everyone. I look  forward to returning to a weekly prime-time series as soon as I can."  </P> <P> The network also released statements from CBS executives saying that they  supported Chung's decision and would welcome her back when she is "ready."  </P> <P> A CBS News spokeswoman in New York, Catherine Upin, said that there has been no  discussion at this point about adjusting Chung's contract.  </P> <P> During a press conference July 14 in Los Angeles at the annual summer interview  tours for TV writers, Chung was asked if she wanted to co-anchor the nightly  newscasts with Dan Rather.  </P> <P> "I have my plate full," she said emphatically. "I mean, I'm doing just fine  with . . . I have a lot of work to do. I'm very old" -- she laughed -- "and  it's hard to keep up with all this traveling around."  </P> <P> Upin related Chung's schedule that week: Monday interviews in New York, Tuesday  interviews in Washington, Wednesday and Thursday interviews in a small  California town, Friday interviews in L.A., Saturday the press conference and  the last flight to New York for the Sunday night newscast, then Monday back to  L.A. for two stories.  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Rate cuts help Paris to stage tentative recovery - But the market will need further reductions to absorb planned privatisations The French stock market has shaken off its currency crisis nerves and has staged a tentative recovery over the past few weeks, mainly thanks to reductions in official interest rates. The CAC-40 index touched 1,611.04, its low for the year early in October, as the Banque de France fought to defend the franc from the heaviest speculative selling in years. With the currency crisis over, the index has since inched back, albeit in thin trading, to reach 1,796.80 yesterday. The index now stands 1.8 per cent above its level at the start of the year, but is still 13.5 per cent down on the May high of 2,077.49. Turnover has been moderate, between FFr2bn (Dollars 377m) and FFr3bn per day during the past week, as many investors have turned away from equities to take refuge in safer and more profitable Sicav money market funds, yielding at least 10 per cent, compared with the mere 3.9 per cent average dividend yield on shares in the CAC-40. The two cuts in official interest rates since the start of November will continue to support the market in the month ahead, possibly pushing the index up towards 1,950, analysts say. Another helpful factor has been the launch on September 14 of the government's popular equity savings plan, the Plan d'Epargne en Actions (PEA). The plan, which offers tax breaks for private investors, has so far generated FFr7bn of new equity purchases, much less than had been expected because of the unfortunate timing of its arrival. But PEA savers are expected to become a big new source of demand for equities, including privatisation issues, in brighter times. The dollar's recent recovery provided support for share prices of companies with sizeable US earnings, Saint-Gobain or Pechiney, for example, and for those which receive their income in dollars, such as the aerospace suppliers and oil groups. But this week Saint-Gobain has fallen on poor nine-month sales and comments by its chairman that trading conditions could continue to be difficult in 1993. Construction shares have been boosted over the past week by the announcement by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, that Brussels is planning to issue cheap loans for infrastructure projects in a bid to stimulate economic activity. Strong gains have been registered in Spie Batignolles, Bouygues, Poliet and SGE, on hopes that they could profit from this. However, analysts see little else to underpin the market's modest recovery, on the grounds that the general outlook for earnings is gloomy. Few analysts believe that the recent rate cuts are enough to kick life back into the flagging economy, which Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, says is heading for 2 per cent growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, easing to 1.7 per cent in 1993. The Socialist government's budget forecast of 2.6 per cent growth in GDP next year looks less tenable by the day, but neither it nor the right-wing administration expected to take power after next March's legislative elections, plan to ease France's tight monetary policy. 'There is a growing consciousness that Europe is entering a recession,' says Mr Bruno le Chevallier, head of equity strategy at James Capel's Paris office. During the currency crisis, business confidence fell to its lowest since the Gulf war, according to Insee, the state statistics institute. Now that the crisis is over, the franc's strength against the UK, Spanish and Italian currencies is expected to produce a decline in export orders to those countries, which represent nearly 28 per cent of French exports, according to Societe Generale. The continuing stream of disappointing interim company results has prompted many analysts to downgrade their earnings forecasts, in some cases for the third time this year. Credit Suisse First Boston France (CSFB) highlights the results from Elf Aquitaine and Total, representing 12 per cent of the CAC-40's capitalisation, and from banks and insurance companies with heavy investments in the declining Parisian property market, such as UAP, Suez, Paribas and Compagnie Bancaire, which account for nearly 20 per cent of the index. CSFB now forecasts flat earnings for the CAC-40 companies in 1992, down from the 6.3 per cent annual growth it was predicting at the start of October and the 13.7 per cent it expected at the end of July. James Capel forecasts a 6 per cent earnings decline for the CAC-40 this year and warns that it might have to revise down its forecast of a 15 per cent earnings recovery in 1993. This is clearly not an ideal environment for the French government's latest partial privatisation, the sale of up to FFr4bn worth of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, originally scheduled to take place by year-end. That, however, is chicken feed compared with the right-wing opposition's plans for privatisation sales of between FFr40bn and FFr70bn per year, an important part of its strategy for curbing the budget deficit. The amount of cash stored up in Sicav funds and the banks' aggressive marketing of the new equity plans suggests that there should be enough liquidity to support future privatisations. So far this year, the market has only had to absorb FFr10bn from the partial sell-offs of Total and Elf Aquitaine, plus FFr7.8bn of other equity issues. Yet analysts agree that the earnings outlook is so poor that more cuts in interest rates will be needed to ensure a good reception for further privatisation issues.</p>

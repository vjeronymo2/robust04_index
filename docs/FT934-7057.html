			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Yorkshire miners agree pit closure Miners at Bentley Colliery near Doncaster in South Yorkshire have accepted management plans to close the pit next month, British Coal said yesterday. The National Union of Mineworkers had accepted an improved redundancy package and production would cease on December 3. It said miners would receive redundancy payments of up to Pounds 44,000 each. The pit, which employs 450 people, is one of 12 for which the government announced a reprieve in March. Bentley's pithead stocks of 600,000 tonnes are equivalent to more than six months' production. Silverdale Colliery in Staffordshire will stop production on December 3, subject to the agreement of its 400 miners.</p>

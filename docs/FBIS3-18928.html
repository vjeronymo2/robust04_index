As an example, he cited the  discussion about the bugging of private residences, which is  possible in all other European countries. "In Brussels, our  great Europeans suddenly turn into completely narrow-minded  people who insist on national competences," Stoiber stressed at  a news conference in Brussels today, referring to the negative  attitude of the Free Democratic Party on the issue of the  bugging campaign.    Stoiber accused Kinkel of preventing a standardization of  the  export regulations for goods that can be used for military and  civilian purposes. Germany is the only country to reject that.  Thus, there is the danger that German industry might transfer  its activities to other countries of the European Union.    A corresponding guideline for the so-called dual-use goods  is  currently under discussion. Since Germany has the strictest  export regulations within the European Union for such products,  Bonn insist on relative strict export regulations but is ready  for concessions vis-a-vis other countries, experts have stated.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Sweden mired in recession SWEDEN remains deep in recession with a 1.2 per cent drop in gross national product in the first half of the year, figures published yesterday show. The economy is expected to show negative growth for the second successive year. In 1991, Sweden's gross national product declined by 1.1 per cent. The country has now experienced seven consecutive quarters of negative growth. There was a 1.9 per cent drop in GNP in the first quarter followed by a more modest 0.5 per cent decline in the April-June period. Gross fixed investment declined by 6.5 per cent in the first six months, with industrial investment down 8 per cent. Local authority investment fell 5 per cent. In 1991 gross fixed investment fell 7.3 per cent. Industrial production declined by 1.5 per cent with a 4 per cent fall in manufacturing. This follows a 5.4 per cent decline in industrial output for the whole of last year. Manufacturing plant capacity use was down to 81.7 per cent in the second quarter of 1992. There was a 3 per cent decline in the total number of hours worked and a 4 per cent contraction in employment during the first half of the year. The slump is also hitting living standards. Households had a 0.5 per cent decline in disposable incomes and there was a 1 per cent drop in private consumption after a 1.2 per cent improvement last year. There was a 16 per cent drop in car sales in the first six months and there was also a sharp 8 per cent decline in the acquisition of household goods such as furniture and home electronics.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Iwao Ono of YOMIURI SHIMBUN's political desk; </F> part three of three-part series entitled "North Korea's  Suspected Development of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure":  "The United States Is Dubious About Japanese Readiness"]    [Text]As tension mounts over the DPRK's suspected nuclear  arms development program, worries about "Japan becoming an  ostrich" are spreading among Japanese and U.S.diplomatic circles.    THE WASHINGTON POST of the United States last autumn made a  satirical comment on Japan's indifference to the security  matters in connection with the North Korean problem: "When  confronted by danger, a coward ostrich digs its head into the  sand and pretends not to have seen the danger." With this  comment in mind, I am concerned whether "Japan's domestic  readiness is all right," as debates at the UN Security Council  [UNSC] are now going in earnest.    Japanese Foreign Ministry sources consider that it will  "require some time" before the UNSC comes up with certain  measures. Toward the end of the current Diet session scheduled  on 29 June, situations are looming that the head-on clash  between the ruling and opposition parties over the presentation  of a no-confidence vote in the cabinet and the last-minute  decision of the measure in relation to the North Korea problem  will have to be made at almost the same time.    Because of this, not only overseas but also within the  Japanese Government, there are persistent apprehensions whether  or not the minority Hata regime is fully prepared to act when  sanctions against the DPRK are imposed.    Prime Minister Hata's North Korean strategy can be  summarized  as: first, to make the utmost diplomatic efforts to settle the  problem peacefully; second, to insist on a gradual enforcement  of sanctions under a UN resolution, when sanctions become  inevitable; and third, to commit Japan to independent sanctions  in concerted efforts of three nations -- Japan, the United  States, and the ROK -- even devoid of a UN resolution. However,  it became apparent that the three nations are not necessarily in  monolithic unity when they met 4 June.    Japan's Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign  Ministry Consolidated Foreign Policy Bureau, made an opening  proposal to adopt "a resolution of warning before anything  else." To this, Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of  state, and Kim Sam-hoon, ROK ambassador for nuclear problems,  showed strong irritation, saying "such time has already gone,"  and demanded Japan stop remittances from Japan to North Korea,  quoting the concrete amount to be "500-600 million yen."    As a matter of fact, the Japanese Government has completed  checks on ministry ordinances to make possible an immediate  response to concrete sanctions, while pursuing dialogue. With  reference to two precedents of past sanctions on the DPRK and  the recent one on Iraq, the government finished working out the  measures, except restriction on the reentry of temporary  visitors to the DPRK in view of human rights. Foreign Ministry  sources say: "The present ordinances are sufficient in view of  the past experience of economic sanctions."    For Japan, however, it really needs a just cause -- a UN  resolution. At the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs  Committee on 3 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa was asked  what sort of measures Japan, the United States, and the ROK will  take if the United Nations failed to adopt the sanctions  resolution. He indicated Japan's intention of making maximum  efforts to cooperate and listed stopping remittances to the DPRK  from Japan and trade between the two countries as concrete  measures to be taken. At about the same time, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai replied: "It is improper to comment  when there is a possibility of having a dialogue," when he was  asked the same question at the House Cabinet Committee. He was  said to have frowned at hearing the foreign minister's answer:  "How can he answer like that while I was trying to make it as  ambiguous as possible."    As for stopping remittances, sanctions effectiveness will be  greatly hampered without a UN resolution, because money can be  sent through third countries. The Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] is certain to oppose such measures if a UN  resolution does not come along. With the political situation  getting more and more fluid, Prime Minister Hata, who wishes  SDPJ's eventual return to the coalition can hardly decide on the  North Korean problem that may delicately affect his future plan  of reshuffling the cabinet.    The Japanese Government has not made its position clear on  the matter of logistic support, such as fuel supply, of U.S.  Navy ships on the sea blockade mission to insure the  effectiveness of sanctions, because it foresees an inevitable  controversy over the constitutionality of the rights to  collective self-defense. Comments are being made about the  possible amendments to the Self Defense Forces and Commodities  Control Laws, but Defense Agency sources see the situation as:  "The hurdle to be cleared is high and the political situation  does not attest to entering into debates on the subject."    The 7 June HERALD-TRIBUNE of the United States made a severe  comment on that matter: "The Hata cabinet's vulnerability makes  us dubious about Japanese cooperation to make the sanctions  effective. The Hata regime has its hands full of domestic  problems." Despite debates based on the past experience of  ministries that imposed sanctions, it is doubtful if a unified  cabinet program can be worked out.    The crisis management over the neighboring Korean peninsula  carries incomparably heavier weight than that during the Gulf  War days. Though a minority government leader, Prime Minister  Hata cannot escape from reality.</p>

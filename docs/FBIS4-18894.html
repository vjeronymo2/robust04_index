			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Senator Francesco </F> Speroni by Gianfranco Ballardin; place and date not given:  "Speroni: Silvio Must Not Consider Himself the Only Leader"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Ballardin] Is it true,  Mr. Speroni, that your demand to have a League prime minister is  only a preliminary tactic?    [Speroni] There is also a tactical element, but the essence  of the matter is the following: [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi cannot claim to be the only leader in the coalition,  overshadowing [League Secretary] Bossi. We have reminded him  that the League is the number-one political force, at least in  the lower house.    [Ballardin] Therefore, we are only at the preliminary  tactical stage: You are raising your voice on the prime  minister issue so as to make your partners swallow the  federalist hot potato.    [Speroni] Let me speak very frankly: Between the issue of  the prime minister and that of federalism, I think it is more  important to break through on the latter. We suggested to  Berlusconi creating a governmental committee which would prepare  a constitutional reform -- in a federalist direction -- within a  two-month period. Then the government would approve it, and  would submit a constitutional bill, which would have to be  approved after a double reading in the two houses.    [Ballardin] In brief, what competences would the central  state have?    [Speroni] Defense, foreign policy, monetary policy, and,  partly, justice. Berlusconi listened to us and promised to  reply by next Wednesday [13 April], after having consulted  [National Alliance leader] Fini, who is continuing to send out  contradictory messages: One day he is open to federalism, and  next day he is against.    [Ballardin] Fini is saying that he does not want to  jeopardize national unity.    [Speroni] We are not aware that in the United States,  Switzerland, or Germany federalism has given rise to this sort  of risk.    [Ballardin] Let us consider now the senior institutional  positions, in the upper and lower houses. For the Senate,  [former President] Cossiga is being mentioned.    [Speroni] Is Cossiga a League member? No. Is he a Forza  Italia member? No. Is he a National Alliance [AN] member? No.  Not only has he not won the elections, he also represents the  old regime, having joined the government 20 years ago, under the  DC [Christian Democratic Party] banner. As you know, I am  standing as a candidate for the post of Senate speaker.    [Ballardin] What about [Italian Republican Party (PRI)  member] Spadolini?    [Speroni] It cannot be that I win, and then find someone  like  Spadolini as the Senate speaker, just like before. Therefore,  Spadolini must go home.    [Ballardin] [Center Union member] Biondi for the lower  house?    [Speroni] Biondi is part of the winning coalition, but he is  certainly not a new face. Still, he may pass.    [Ballardin] What about the anti-Mafia commission? What about  the services control committee?    [Speroni] The same applies. Enough with people like  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Senator] Violante and  Pecchioli [PDS member, chairman of the parliamentary secret  services committee]! For the senior administrative positions,  as well as for those in the state partnerships, we must partly  introduce the "spoil system" in our own country. In the United  States, when a new president takes office, over 10,000 civil  servants, appointed by the previous administration, get fired.    [Ballardin] What about the minister sweepstake? We have not  yet discussed any ministers' names, except two cases, [Clean  Hands public prosecutor] Di Pietro and [former Clean Hands  judge] Parenti. In Di Pietro's case we decided "no." As far as  Parenti is concerned, she will not have the justice portfolio.    [Ballardin] What about [Radical leader] Pannella as foreign  minister?    [Speroni] We have not discussed this possibility.    [Ballardin] What about [President] Scalfaro?    [Speroni] Someone who has been president during the First  Republic cannot be president in the second, unless he is himself  the ferryman.    [Ballardin] However, Berlusconi said that Scalfaro could  retain his position, because he managed to stay "above the  contending parts."    [Speroni] We do not agree. Scalfaro is a conservative, and  if everything changes, as we want it to change, he is the first  who must leave. Perhaps not from one day to the next, among  other reasons because the present Constitution does not provide  for this situation, unless something new comes up on the [former  Sisde chief] Broccoletti and company front. We hope that he  will be sensible enough to leave of his own accord.</p>

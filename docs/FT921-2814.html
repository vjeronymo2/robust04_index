			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / No queues form outside Syria's newly opened door: In spite of appearances, the fundamentals of the Assad regime remain the same LAST November Syria took what was, for it, quite an unusual step: it inserted a four-page advertising supplement in The New York Times extolling the virtues of a new 'open door' policy. Syria, readers were informed, was open for business. Foreign investors were welcome, the tourism industry was 'ready, willing - and waiting', and water from the new Euphrates dam was helping to turn the desert green. Why did Syria, which does not have all that much foreign currency to throw around, choose to advertise its wares in such a way, at such a time, and in a paper that it has tended to regard as hostile over the years? The answer lies partly in Syria's desire to 'clean up its image in the West', as one Damascus-based western official put it, and partly in Damascus's almost certainly mistaken belief that the very limited economic reforms it has undertaken will indeed prove a magnet for investment. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the pre-eminence of the US in regional affairs, and Syria's need for assistance to modernise its crumbling infrastructure, are all factors that pushed Damascus towards a reappraisal of its place in the world. Syria's participation in the US-sponsored Middle East peace process is one consequence of this 're-positioning'; so, too, was its decision in 1989 to normalise relations with Egypt and subsequently its active involvement in the anti-Iraq alliance. But for all the appearance of change, there are certain fundamentals that remain much the same. In spite of the sweeping liberalisation in eastern Europe, there is precious little sign of a political thaw. President Hafez al-Assad's reaffirmation in a referendum last December in which he secured an improbable 99.8 per cent of the vote struck an oddly discordant note, even among Syrians used to such sham exercises in democracy. Indeed the referendum, accompanied by 'spontaneous' street demonstrations involving, among others, the local Jewish community, has spawned an underground black humour in Damascus. In one joke, Syrians were given two choices in the ballot: either vote 'yes' or 'inform next-of-kin'. Local observers saw all the fuss over Mr Assad's reaffirmation as a sign not of strength but of insecurity. 'In spite of all his apparatus of repression, he still feels he needs to fake that degree of support,' said one such observer. Signs that Mr Assad may be seeking publicly to advance prospects for his son, Basil, an army major, are also viewed with some bemusement locally, since the young Assad does not strike people as a man 'likely to succeed'. One of the more curious postscripts to the leadership referendum were the posters that appeared in Damascus congratulating Mr Assad with the words Mabrook, Abu Basil - Congratulations Father of Basil. Syria's apparently contradictory impulses - it is talking peace with Israel while acquiring more sophisticated intermediate range missiles in collaboration with Iran - are entirely consistent with Mr Assad's approach over the years of seeking to keep open as many options as possible. It also almost certainly accords with his scepticism about a successful outcome to the present round of peace talks. Thus the Syrian leader, while seeking to improve his country's standing in the west by joining peace efforts and siding with Egypt and Saudi Arabia against Iraq, clings at the same time to what one western official in Damascus described as 'his dog-eared cards': his enhanced relationship with Iran; his backing of militant Palestinian groups; his tactical thaw with the mainstream Palestinians of Mr Yassir Arafat; his support for the Kurdish Worker's Party, the PKK, which is allowed bases in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in Lebanon (this support infuriates Turkey which is battling Kurdish separatists in its south-east); and also his links with Iraqi opposition groups which are given the run of Damascus, but are not taken very seriously. Syrian officials say they are intensely disappointed over the lukewarm international response to their efforts to deal with misgivings about its support for terrorism, and its dismal human rights record. They point to the fact that since the 1986 Hindawi affair, in which Syrian intelligence was accused of masterminding an attempt to smuggle a bomb on an El Al flight from London, no serious terrorist incident has been linked to groups operating from Syria. They also complain that the west and the US in particular, which continues to place Syria on the list of countries supporting terrorism, thus denying it American aid, has not given Damascus credit for the release last year of some 3,000 political prisoners (international human rights groups note 10,000 remain in custody). The officials say they were especially disappointed by the decision of the European parliament late last year to block much-needed EC assistance in protest at Syria's human rights record. Syria, whose population numbers about 15m, is burdened by a 3.7 per cent rate of population increase, one of the world's highest, and is in need of all the assistance it can get. Damascus is closely watching domestic developments in Israel where an election is due on June 23. While Syrian officials say that as far as they are concerned there is little to choose between Mr Yitzhak Shamir and his challenger, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, this does not mean they are not interested in the outcome. On the contrary: officials have been consulting western embassies in Damascus on whether the suspension of peace talks pending the election would help or harm Mr Shamir. The clear implication is that Syria would like to give encouragement to an alternative who might be more flexible on the 'land for peace issue', although Mr Rabin has not in any way encouraged a belief that he might be willing to yield the Golan Heights, seized from Syria in the 1967 war. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak yesterday pressed his Syrian counterpart, Hafez al-Assad to stay the course in Middle East peace talks, writes Tony Walker in Cairo. The two leaders met in Cairo to review regional developments and to discuss Arab tactics towards the talks with Israel launched amid much fanfare in Madrid last October. Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel, is most anxious that negotiations should continue between the Jewish state and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian-Palestinian team. Mr Assad and Mr Mubarak seem likely to have focused on whether peace talks should resume before Israeli elections in June. The fourth round concluded in Washington earlier this month without agrement on the time or venue for the next session.</p>

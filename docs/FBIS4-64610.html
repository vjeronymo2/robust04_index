			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos by </F> Vanna Vannuccini in Athens; date not given: "Pangalos Against  Everyone: `Europe Weak and Divided'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Vannuccini] Minister, do you  believe that the dispute between Athens and Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is moving toward a  solution after the meeting between Andreas Papandreou and  President Clinton?    [Pangalos] I was not one of those who expected much to come  from this trip. Bilateral relations have improved, and that is  a good thing. But the basic question is: What policy does the  United States want to take: a policy of relationships of force,  or a policy of principles? Initially, Clinton looked more like  he wanted to go the second way, but.... To put it clearly, a  policy of relationships of force means oil, particular attention  to Islam, and hence a search for solutions, the principal  criterion of which is the relationship with Islam. In the  Balkans too. We in Greece have very bitter experience of  American policy of relationships of force. The aggression in  Cyprus was tolerated, if not even organized, by the United  States. Hence, when one talks of the "dangerous Serb precedent"  in Yugoslavia, we agree, certainly, but ethnic cleansing and the  violation of human rights and of borders is something we have  known in Cyprus for 20 years now.    [Vannuccini] This is why you do not trust the Europeans on  the Skopje question?    [Pangalos] Look, the problem of Skopje exists, and it is not  we who invented it. They tell us that it also existed before.  But previously Macedonia was not a state. There were two  provinces, a Macedonian province in Greece and a Macedonian  province in Yugoslavia. I do not question that Skopje is a part  of geographic Macedonia. But now that they are a state, it  seems to me that they are the true Macedonians. And this poses  a problem. It Tessin [southern Swiss province bordering on  Italy] declared itself independent and called itself the state  of Lombardy, this would create a problem for the Milanese, would  it not?    [Vannuccini] Probably also for the inhabitants of Skopje,  who  have considered themselves to be Macedonian for the past 50  years. Assuming another name is a problem.    [Pangalos] No, and I will explain to you why. First of all,  they do not see themselves as Macedonians, but as Yugoslavs.  Yugoslavia was something real, even if today we speak of it as  if it had not existed. Moreover, a third, and possibly more of  the inhabitants considered themselves, and continue to consider  themselves, to be Albanian. Of the other two-thirds, one  minority saw itself as Macedonian, and another believed itself,  and still believes itself to be Bulgarian. Just think that the  second largest party in Skopje has its headquarters in Sofia.  Things are not simple. Greece is afraid of political  instability. And this is something very real. The Skopjans  have problems with the Serbs, with the Albanians, and with the  Bulgarians. The Albanians have problems with the Serbs, with  the Skopjans, and now they are trying to create problems with us  as well. Everyone has problems with everyone else. Not to  mention Turkey. Greece wants to stay out of the Balkan game.  For this reason I wish to solve the question rapidly, so that  there are no future claims of any kind. Why are the Skopjans  insisting on their positions? Answer me.    [Vannuccini] Probably because a name based on geography is  less risky for a country with so many different ethnic groups.    [Pangalos] Is this why they are insisting also on the  articles of the constitution and pretend to have a "droit de  regard" [a right to oversee] our Macedonians, whom they view as  "compatriots who speak Greek." The rule in the Balkans has  always been that whenever a regime fails to resolve the problems  of its own people, it creates problems outside. If you do not  know that, you understand nothing about the region.    [Vannuccini] Can you please recapitulate the Greek position  for me. What did Papandreou say to Clinton?    [Pangalos] We told [FYROM President] Gligorov that,  simultaneously, we would lift the embargo and he would remove  the Vergina sun from the flag and make a declaration that the  articles of the constitution have no further meaning than a  historical text. We would guarantee our existing borders to each  other -- we are also prepared to guarantee Skopje its borders  with the other neighboring countries -- and at the same time we  would remove our veto to their entry into the CSCE and adopt the  economic aid program. Two things are still left out: They say  that it is a Macedonian minority in Greece, and on this item we  can refer to the Council of Europe rules. And then there is the  question of the name: Here we can admit the existence of a  reciprocal right, and begin negotiations. We expect the  Europeans to place pressure on Skopje. But Europe does not care  less about Greek concerns. There is a total distance. Greeks  can only record this and draw from it very negative conclusions.    [Vannuccini] Which?    [Pangalos] Europe is divided and weak. There are countries  which make policy and countries which are subject to policy. Do  not fool yourself that Italy has a policy. Look, we have no  intention of playing this game to the bitter end.    [Vannuccini] Are you referring to the recognition of the  former Yugoslav republics?    [Pangalos] It seems to me that the Germans themselves are  becoming aware that the recognition of Bosnia was premature.  The Greek Government should have exercised its veto. It was  clear from the outset that the Serbs would not have accepted a  Muslim Bosnia. To imagine a minority of Catholics and Orthodox  accepting a Muslim power is to be unacquainted with the Balkans.  When the Balkan peoples say Muslim, they mean Turk, and Turkish  power is still alive in their mind. Because it was an  indescribable power. It is not comparable with the Austrian  occupation of Italy or the Swedish occupation of Denmark, as my  Danish colleague suggested, demonstrating how little he  understood of the situation. The Turkish power was barbarian.  It was not Islam, mind you, but a Mongol power. Attila,  Tamburlaine. Perhaps the Turks do not yet consider them as  heroes? A Turk was allowed to rape children whom he met on the  street, to kill whomever he wanted. The Greeks never ceased  combating them. I belong to a Greek Albanian-speaking minority  from an area of Mount Parnassos, in Attica, where the Turks  never managed to set foot.    [Vannuccini] Greeks often see things less in terms of errors  of judgment by certain European countries, and more in terms of  obscure designs of political and economic penetration. Do you  share this analysis?    [Pangalos] I do not think that these designs are dark at  all.  They are extremely clear. Certain people preferred to have weak  and easily influenceable countries in the south of the Balkans.  Divide and conquer.    [Vannuccini] What type of solution do you see then for  Bosnia?    [Pangalos] We need to turn to the European level. The  territorial status quo. With small changes, but without losing  more time seeking to change it substantially.    [Vannuccini] Leaving the Serbs with more than 70 percent of  the territory?    [Pangalos] What does 70 percent mean? This figure includes  the mountains. And what then is the alternative: to arm  everyone and hope for a Muslim victory? And then impose a  Muslim state on the Serbs? There are no military paths, only  the path of negotiation.    [Vannuccini] But did you not say that one must reject  relationships of force?    [Pangalos] The situation here is different, because we have  recognized Yugoslavia's internal borders as international  borders. We need to redraw the borders, respecting  nationalities, and then seek to remake Yugoslavia -- a  confederation, something which will enable these people to live  together. I know that what I am saying can appear absurd, but  it is less so than it might seem.    [Vannuccini] Greece has a bad image in Europe, also because  of its financial mess, but it has done nothing to remedy the  situation.    [Pangalos] We have an austerity plan, and we need to apply  it  with firmness. Certainly Greece poses problems for Europe  because it will not allow the Maastricht Treaty to go ahead.  But it is not alone. Is Maastricht possible without Italy? I  do not think so. And in any event, it is not, as some people  say, that the money is going out of the pockets of North  Europeans who work and into the pockets of Greeks who do  nothing. I have had a balance sheet prepared of the give and  take in 15 years of Community membership. And I can assure you  that these calculations are difficult to do: money transfers can  be calculated because they are visible sums, but other  parameters are difficult to put into figures. Greece is a major  importer of Northern European products. The transfers are for  investments, three-quarters of which return to European  industry. If the calculations are done, we will have some  surprises.</p>

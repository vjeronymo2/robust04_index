			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact comes into operation A new five-year cocoa agreement went into force yesterday, even though membership by consumer countries was short of requirements. Brazil's completion of membership formalities means that producer countries in the pact represent nearly 87 per cent of world exports, well above the required 80 per cent. But consumer membership represents only 54 per cent of world imports, short of the necessary 60 per cent. Pact members are expected today to give countries a new deadline of the end of the cocoa year in September to join up. Portugal is expected to do so shortly, with Ireland, Italy and Slovakia following. But Russia, representing just over 2 per cent of imports, gave no indication yesterday about joining. The agreement will aim to balance supply and demand.</p>

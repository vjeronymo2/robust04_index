			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Foreign architects look to heavenly image for redesign of Berlin's Reichstag all by foreign architects - to convert the war-scarred Reichstag building in Berlin into the new German parliament were chosen yesterday. One of Britain's foremost architects, Sir Norman Foster, proposed a 50-metre high canopy over the building (left). The cloud-like shape of the structure won the immediate nickname 'Himmel uber Berlin' (Heaven over Berlin), the title of the Wim Wenders film known in English as 'Wings of Desire'. Sir Norman said the pavilion created a sense of 'grand arrival' but still left a social gathering point at the site of momentous developments in German history. His design reflected 'an image of Germany today. . . We are not in the 19th century, and German democracy is looked up to now'. Spaniard Santiago Calatrava proposed a glass dome over the building, while Dutch architect Pi de Bruijn suggested a more modest design. The Reichstag, opened in 1894, was burnt out in an arson attack in 1933. In 1991 the Bundestag decided to transfer parliament to Berlin.</p>

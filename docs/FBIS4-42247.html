			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Carsten Steno report: "`Wise Men' Warn Lykketoft"] </F>   [Text] While Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft says in a  new report that everything is going "well, as we might expect,"  for the first time in months the government yesterday had to see  important aspects of its policy attacked by economic experts.    In their semi-annual report the so-called economic wise men  said that while it is true that we are experiencing a recovery,  there are still major problems that remain unsolved -- not least  on the labor market where thousands are being kept out of  employment because minimum wages are too high.    According to the wise men, there is also the prospect of a  significant fall in the balance of payments surplus that is  under great pressure because we Danes have begun to spend money  in earnest and are consequently boosting imports. At the same  time the new vacation arrangements could -- if they are made  permanent -- give rise to a need for tax increases or public  spending cuts. Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft rejects the  wise men's objections.    "The wise men take too gloomy a view of the Danish economy  and it looks to me as if the report is based on figures that are  too pessimistic and data that is outdated when compared with the  data made available by the government," Mogens Lykketoft said.    The wise men's report comes as a welcome helping hand for  the  nonsocialist opposition that will use its conclusions in the  Folketing session's closing debate today to attack the  government's economic policy. "The government is squandering  the economic recovery," Liberal Party deputy chairman Anders  Fogh Rasmussen commented. He is backed by Conservative People's  Party leader Hans Engell who believes that the wise men have  documented some serious holes in the government's economic  policy.    Chief economist Jorgen Damgaard of the Jyske Bank shares the  wise men's concern over developments:    "The wise men had to call for adjustments in financial  policy  for a long time. Now I hope that they will not have to call for  as long for a tightening-up of financial policy," he commented.</p>

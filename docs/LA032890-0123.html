			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> DAY-CARE OPERATORS ASSAIL NEW PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Citing a lack of customers, operators of small, private day-care centers said  Monday that they fear an ambitious plan to provide additional child care in the  city will force them out of business.  </P> <P> The Anaheim Family Care Plan, adopted last week by a consortium of city,  business and school district officials, would provide up to 80 spaces at a  renovated train station and up to 125 spaces in a new building by 1991.  </P> <P> "It scares us," said Grace Romo, owner of Happy Days and La Palma Preschools in  the city.  </P> <P> Although licensed for 75 children ages 2 to 6, the Happy Days school has  enrolled only 20 children, Romo said.  </P> <P> "We are empty. It's true of everybody around here," she said. "If they build  these new schools and they'll be open in 1991, we will be out of business."  </P> <P> About a dozen day-care and preschool owners in the area are scheduled to attend  a meeting at 10 a.m. Thursday at Romo's center to talk over the problem.  </P> <P> Romo said city researchers were misinformed about the need for day care in  Anaheim. "Where are they getting their information for slots they can't find?"  Romo asked.  </P> <P> Steven Swaim, Anaheim's director of community services, said a city study last  year showed that child care was among the top concerns of residents. Using raw  census data, a consultant projected that there will be between 15,474 and  24,000 children up to age 4 in the city by the year 2000, he said. There are  now 16,000 children in this age group.  </P> <P> Based on those figures and on testimony given at four public forums, Swaim said  consortium members figured that there was at least a "potential need" for child  care in the city.  </P> <P> Janet Calderon, director of Li'l Toots Preschool in Anaheim, said she also saw  a need for after-school care but noted that "we've always had too many schools  in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "If anything, the money should go to supplying child care for those children  who can't afford it," Calderon said, "certainly not building two huge schools  like that. "  </P> <P> She said she has 35 children enrolled and is licensed for 44. She charges $59 a  week for up to 10 hours a day with lunch.  </P> <P> Romo said she charges $68 for a 40-hour week with a hot lunch at Happy Days and  La Palma Preschool. LYNN SMITH  </P></p>

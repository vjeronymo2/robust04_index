			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyubov Tsukanova: "Legislators of the Whole </F> Country Unite"]    [Text] The Federation Council held a conference 10-11 June  with leaders of organs of representative power in Russian  Federation components -- republics, krays, oblasts, and  autonomous formations. Taking part were the leaders of the  parliament's chambers, Federation Council and State Duma  deputies, representatives of the government, and heads of  representative organs of power in Federation components.    In connection with the recently widespread story that a  "power party" of regional leaders is maturing within the depths  of the Federation Council (a nonformalized but influential  party, needless to say) the conference can be regarded as a kind  of organizational event: This is the first time that the top  leaders of the Federal Assembly have met specially with their  colleagues from the regional parliaments, legislative  assemblies, oblast dumas, etc. A parallel involuntarily  suggests itself with last year's clear attempt by the Supreme  Soviet to create a legislative vertical to counterbalance the  executive -- something for which neither the previous nor the  current Constitution incidentally make provision.    However, just as the political situation has changed over  the  year, the tasks facing the chambers of the Federal Assembly as  regards regional representative power have also changed  considerably. Let us start with the fact that, even if it were  planned, the formation of a vertical has been complicated by the  federal parliament's "division in two": Notwithstanding the  fact that the upper and lower chambers ultimately have common  objectives (the formation of federal legislation) the Federation  Council's and State Duma's tactical goals and behavior patterns  differ considerably and the contradictions between them are too  marked to presuppose any unity of will as regards "government"  and even as regards coordinating the activity of all  representative bodies in the localities. What is more, the  Federation Council, which developed in the absence of local  legislative organs in most regions, comprises to a considerable  extent republic presidents and the heads of kray and oblast  administrations, i.e. representatives of the executive, whose  interests differ considerably from those of the representative  branch (although this fact may be an additional incentive for  the Federation Council to cooperate with local legislators). Be  that as it may, Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko  considers the talk of a "power party" futile and insists that  the parliament needs to work with Federation components in order  to further develop the principles of Russia's federal system.  The task now is no longer and not so much to reallocate powers  between the center and the regions, he said, as to establish  normal relations between the actual components of the  Federation. In this process the upper chamber is in his view  designed to defend the interests of Federation components --  both in their relations with the center and in cooperation among  them.    As for the State Duma's objectives, they were expressed  fairly clearly during the parliamentary hearings 9 June devoted  to the principles of coordinating the legislative activity of  organs of state power. With regional representative organs'  acquisition of legislative functions (under the new  Constitution) the question arises of systematizing all lawmaking  activity, without which legal chaos, or at the very least  disagreements that may destroy the country's unified legal and  economic area, are inevitable. State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin  has of late repeatedly spoken of Russian legislation lagging  behind the requirements of economic reform. This considerable  deficiency, he believes, must be overcome, and as quickly as  possible. According to the organizers of the State Duma  parliamentary hearings and the Federation Council conference  that has just opened, cooperation in this sphere may be good for  the cause.    At any rate (and this has also been pointed out in the  declaration regarding the joint work of the State Duma and  legislative bodies) the conference will result in the creation  of a coordinating body to formulate a unified strategy in the  sphere of legislation and the creation of an informational  system extending to Federation components to keep track of and  coordinate all stages of lawmaking activity.</p>

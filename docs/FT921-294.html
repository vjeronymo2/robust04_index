			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / O&amp;Y calls off banks meeting Olympia &amp; York, the financially strapped property developer, has postponed a meeting which it was due to hold in London today with its bankers and other participants in the Docklands Canary Wharf project. Canadian-based O&amp;Y said last night that 'the time is better spent in Toronto' preparing for a meeting on April 6 at which the company will present interim proposals for restructuring its CDollars 20bn (Pounds 9.6bn) debt. The London meeting was to have been attended by Mr Tom Johnson, O&amp;Y's new president, and by its financial advisers. However, some European banks which Mr Johnson was to have met are understood to have been represented at a meeting in Toronto last Friday between O&amp;Y and about 20 of its key creditors. No new date has been set for the London talks. In a separate development, Canada's Reichmann family, owners of O&amp;Y, have injected more than CDollars 30m into their company by buying the property developer's stake in Camdev Corp, the company once controlled by fallen real estate developer Robert Campeau. Details of the transaction emerged last Friday as the company announced that it had asked lenders to freeze principal repayments on its debt pending the presentation of the April 6 restructuring plan. Meanwhile, inquiries by the Financial Times have shown that 17 per cent of the Toronto-based company's US portfolio, which comprises 29m sq ft of offices, is empty. Its 12m sq ft Canadian portfolio has a 12 per cent vacancy rate. In New York, where O&amp;Y is the largest office landlord, 18 per cent of its 23.6m sq ft is empty. Shaken empire Page 11</p>

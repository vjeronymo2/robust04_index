			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> A PLUM: Why did Gov. Deukmejian assign Orange County's brand new senator to  carry his mandatory earthquake insurance bill, one of the biggest bills of the  session? . . . According to one Sacramento insider, it's an effort to help  Republican Frank Hill get a strong foothold in the upper chamber. . . . Hill, a  four-term assemblyman before election to the Senate, is close to Deukmejian,  and carrying the bill is bound to make points for Hill in his new district,  which includes Whittier, site of the destructive 1987 quake.

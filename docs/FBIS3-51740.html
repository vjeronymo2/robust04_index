The document, which will be valid for three years, was  signed  by Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina and Hidipo  Hamutenya, Namibian trade and industry minister.    According to the agreement, the contracting parties will  make  all payments in freely convertible currency and in accordance  with the laws of both states.    However, the signatories may adopt other forms of payment to  promote the rapid development of commercial ties, the document  said.    Robaina and Hamutenya agreed that this bilateral accord will  create new ways to identify other areas of cooperation.    The Havana and Windhoek Foreign Ministries last Wednesday  signed another agreement to eliminate visa requirements for the  citizens of both nations.    Robaina today concludes a three-day visit to Namibia, the  last leg of a two-week tour of Africa, which also took him to  Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.    Before leaving for his country, the Cuban foreign relations  minister will speak to Namibian President Sam Nujoma, to whom he  will present a message from President Fidel Castro.</p>

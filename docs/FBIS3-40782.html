			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 17--The Election Commission has  decided to ensure that candidates for Rajya Sabha elections  contest only from their respective States. In other orders, the  commission has modified the format for filing the election  expenditure incurred by candidates and an intensive revision of  Delhi's electoral rolls.    The Chief Election Commissioner [CEC], Mr T.N. Seshan, told  a  `meet the press' programme of the Press Club of India here on  Friday that the commission would ensure that such candidates  give their correct residential address in the nomination and not  merely as `C/O The Chief Minister'. The measure was intended to  check the "backdoor entry" into the Rajya Sabha, he said.    To this end, the Election Commission had asked the Chief  Electoral Officers (CEOs) of States to be alert while  registering known political personalities in the electoral rolls  as voters. The advisory suggests a double check on the "normally  resident of the area" clause in the Representation of the People  Act to check fraudulant enrolment in the voter list, which in  turn enables the personality to contest an election to the  Council of States.    Answering a question on the common practice of providing a  fictitious address for enrolment in the voters' list,  particularly by politicians wishing to contest a Rajya Sabha  seat from a State where they are not normally resident, Mr  Seshan said the commission was aware of it and had moved in the  direction of checking it. "Nobody will be able to get away with  giving a `care of' address in any State," he said.    The Election Commission has modified the format for filing  the election expenditure incurred by candidates and directed  them to file "correct" accounts. The commission order has called  for submission of accounts of election expenditure by contesting  candidates in the recent Assembly elections also.    Mr Seshan said that the district election officers, before  accepting the revised proforma from the candidates on the  election expenses should conduct an inquiry, if necessary, to  ensure that these were in accordance with the law. The modified  format requires the candidates to show day to day accounts as  also total expenditure with details, he said.    The candidates have been asked to keep correct account of  all  expenditure from the date of nomination till the declaration of  results. Mr Seshan expressed concern over the "increasing role  of money power" in elections. The government was yet to take  action on his recommendations on checking the menace, he added.    Mr Seshan said he had also ordered "special intensive  revision" of electoral rolls in Delhi not only following  complaints but also because he felt things were at variance with  ground reality.    Answering a wide range of questions on the changes he is  trying to bring about in electoral practices and procedures, Mr  Seshan agreed that a one-day poll all over the country even for  Lok Sabha elections was the ideal. The commission, however,  could not rush in that direction ignoring the constitutional  directive to ensure a "free and fair" poll. The commission would  complete the polling process in one day, provided the government  extended the necessary police personnel to make the poll free  and fair.    He, however, did not foresee such a situation developing in  the near future. Mr Seshan said the commission sets up nearly  6.5 lakh polling stations for a parliamentary poll in all the  543 Lok Sabha constituencies. At the rate of just two policemen  at each booth, the commission would require 13 lakh personnel.  The government could not go one beyond 60,000 personnel in the  November round of Assembly elections. With those numbers, he  would be able to deploy just one policeman for ten to twelve  polling booths, which was hardly conducive to a free and fair  poll, he said.    On the question of photo-identity cards to all voters by  January 1, 1995, Mr Seshan said the matter was discussed at a  meeting of all CEOs in September, where all the 32 CEOs saw no  problem of any kind in making this possible by the set date. Now  some States were raising the question of resources which was not  his look-out. It had to be sorted out between the States and the  Centre, he said while declining to comment on the stand taken by  the Advocate-General of West Bengal that insisting on identity  cards for voters was violative of the constitutional provision  of adult franchise.    The question of election expenses of candidates was engaging  the close consideration of the commission, which was trying to  find ways of enforcing the available legal provisions in this  regard. He, however, said there was little that the commission  could do if Parliament, in its wisdom, did not arm it to deal  adequately with the issue.    Similar was his stance on barring persons with a criminal  background from contesting the polls.    Another aspect which the commission is looking seriously  into  is the exit polls conducted by some organisations, which find  their way into newspapers. These exit polls had the potential to  influence the voting pattern in other areas, he admitted.    Mr Seshan, even as he declined to answer a question on why  restrictions were imposed on the entry of media persons into  polling stations, on the ground that the matter was pending  before a court, said one reason he could share with the press  right away was that of overcrowding in polling booths. With an  average of 50 candidates in one constituency, there would be as  many poll agents inside a polling station. There would also be  the average six polling staff and if journalists also went  inside in good numbers, there would be no room left for the  voters, he said. The CEC, however, promised that reporters would  not be given scope for complaining the next time round.</p>

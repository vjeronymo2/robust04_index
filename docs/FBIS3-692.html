Elias] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Right-wingers have been  acting against media covering their arrival in Mmabatho to back  the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] in a bid to prop up the  government of President Lucas Mangope. They moved into  Bophuthatswana under cover of darkness on Friday morning, with  the apparent knowledge of the BDF.    An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] aerial  camera crew were surrounded by heavily-armed khaki-clad men when  they landed at an airfield near the capital to refuel.    A camera crew from the British-based ITN news network had  their four bulletproof vests taken from them, as well as all  video cassettes. ITN crew member Nick Mhlahlehle said a large  crowd of Mangope loyalists surrounded their car outside the  University of Bophuthatswana at 9.30 AM and pulled them out.    STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek was assaulted and his film  confiscated, as was Cape Town freelance photographer Fanie  Jacobs.    An AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE [AFP] news team went to an air base  near Mmabatho where the right-wingers have set up headquarters,  but their car was surrounded by a group of men and they were  told to leave the area. "There were about 100 of them and as  soon as they said that we got out of there," said AFP  photographer Walter Dhladhla.    An informal meeting of journalists was held in the lobby of  the Mmabatho Sun Hotel to devise a way of getting photographic  coverage of the sealing off of the town by the BDF and the 5,000  loyalists now patrolling both the capital and the nearby  historical town of Mafikeng. During the meeting, a  representative of the International Red Cross arrived at the  hotel to co-ordinate activities with members of the Red Cross  already in Mmabatho.</p>

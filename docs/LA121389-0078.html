			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> GOING UP: It may be the happiest place on earth, but it isn't the cheapest:  Ticket prices are up again at Disneyland (D7), where a $2 increase brings the  cost of adult admission to $25.50. Kids now pay $20.50 and parking is up a  dollar to $4. . . . Will this hurt attendance? Not likely, say industry  experts. Dana Parsons  </P></p>

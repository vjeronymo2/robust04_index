			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shen Anran (3088 1489 3544) and Liu Liedong </F> (0491 3525 2639) of the China National Cereals, Oils, and  Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation: "Impact and  Countermeasures to the Reentry into GATT on China's Cereals,  Oils, and Food Trade"]    [Text] With the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of  negotiations, there will be greater liberalization of  agricultural product trade and various types of interference,  such as subsidies, tariffs, quotas, and monopolies, will all be  converted to tariffs, thereby bringing measures that affect  market entry and export competition under stronger and more  effective tariff and trade regulations and laws. At the 14th  symposium on China's entering the GATT held in May of this year,  China made an announcement regarding agricultural policy. China  announced that it would no longer seek special exceptions for  agriculture, and would implement its agricultural development  policy within the scope of current GATT regulations, and would  actively participate in the Uruguay Round negotiations on  agricultural product concessions.  <H5>  I. Principal Affects </H5>   1. Improved capability of earning foreign exchange for the  state to help to expand cereals, oils, and food exports. China  is a major agricultural country and from the founding of the  country, cereals, oils, and food have always been major exports.  With China's industrial development and the constant improvement  in the mix of export products, the share of cereals, oils, and  food in China's exports has constantly fallen, but the total  value of these exports has risen from year to year. For  example, China's food exports had an average annual increase of  10.5 percent from 1980 through 1988. Its share of the total  value of world food exports rose from 1.5 percent in 1980 to 2.5  percent in 1989. In 1992 cereals, oils, and food exports made up  12.4 percent of the total value of national exports. The natural  component in China's cereals, oils, and food production is  great, contamination is great, and the prices are low, and they  have a certain competitiveness on the international market. The  foreign price for wheat is 52 percent higher than the domestic  price and that of polished round-grained nonglutinous rice is 16  percent higher, live hogs are 56 percent higher, eggs are 27  percent higher, and corn is 39.6 percent higher. After the GATT  agreement on agricultural products is reached, with reduction of  various countries' domestic production supports, further  curtailment of export competition measures, improvement in  market entry conditions, and environmental and hygienic  standards, huge subsidies of various nations that lead to  distorted prices in international agricultural product trade  will be further rectified. Reform of the foreign trade policy of  major agricultural product and trading nations, especially the  United States, Japan, and the European Community, could cause a  general rise in world agricultural product prices. The prices of  such agricultural products as rice, sugar, corn, wheat, pork,  and beef will more than double. In another respect, after  developed countries eliminate some domestic agricultural  production supports, because domestic production costs will  increase and the volume will decrease, exports will decrease and  imports will increase, thereby conceding some of the  international market and the domestic market. With China's  "reentry into GATT," discriminatory anti-dumping and  anti-subsidy suits encountered in cereals, oils, and foodstuffs  exports will be eliminated as demanded by GATT regulations. This  is an excellent opportunity for China to expand it cereals,  oils, and foodstuffs exports and will help to further stabilize  and develop the cereals, oils, and foodstuffs export market that  we already have and continuously open new markets, increasing  foreign exchange earned from exports and improving the ability  to compete.    2. Numerous cereals, oils, and foodstuffs markets will  suffer  impact. China's agricultural businesses will implement the  system of contracted household responsibility linked to output,  a high degree of business diversification, a rather low level of  productivity, and state investment in and subsidization of  agriculture far short of developed countries. These  characteristics have determined that China's agriculture is  comparatively fragile and unable to endure the impact of  liberalized trade in agricultural products. After "reentry  into GATT," while being able to use tariff reductions and  exemptions and elimination of nontariff barriers to increase  cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports, China also must use the  same conditions to permit the entry of foreign cereals, oils,  and foodstuffs products. Despite the fact that China presently  has some cereals, oils, and foodstuffs for which they have  certain price advantages or other advantages on the  international market, there also are a great many cereals, oils,  and foodstuffs where they are clearly inferior in such respects  as quality, variety, and designs and colors, as well as  transportation conditions, production costs, packaging, and  storage. Not only will it be difficult for these products to  capture the international market, but their domestic market also  will be impacted to various degrees.    3. State foreign trade companies specializing in cereals,  oils, and foodstuffs import and export trade will be totally  oriented to the market. After "reentering GATT," China first  must trim tariffs and reduce nontariff restrictive measures. Not  only is China's current average tariff higher than developed  countries, it is also higher than developing countries. A  large-scale lowering of tariffs cannot be avoided. In addition,  some Chinese nontariff restrictive measures are contrary to GATT  regulations and nontariff restrictive measures must be reduced  or even eliminated. The licensing system especially must be  gradually eliminated, and complicated administrative revision  and approval procedures must be reduced. This means that the  market will be further opened and enterprises will lose  government protection. The legal monopolies and privileges that  state foreign trade companies engaged in specialized cereals,  oils, and foodstuffs import and export trade are granted will be  limited or even eliminated. Faced with the challenge of  competition and selection, they must seek their own survival and  development. Such situations as "multiple external relations,  forcing up prices and rushing to purchase, lowering prices and  competing for sales, and killing each other off," currently  present in cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports, will shortly  become more serious.  <H3>  II. Initial Impact of "Reentry Into Gatt" on Various Major  Types of Chinese Cereals, Oils, and Foodstuffs Import and Export  Trade </H3>   1. Cereals. Generally speaking, in the initial stage  "reentry  into GATT" will not have too great an impact. But it could have  a different impact on different varieties at different times. As  regards exports, it will help rice, corn, soybeans, and some  other small grains to further expand exports. As regards  imports, if the developed countries, mainly the United States,  trim their subsidies of export cereals or further lower the  foreign exchange rate, the prices of imported cereals,  especially wheat, will surely rise. If the rise of domestic  grain prices is higher than import prices, it could stimulate  excessive grain imports, impacting the domestic market.    2. Vegetable oil. In recent years, Chinese imports have been  greater than exports and the scope of imports has been very  great, seriously impacting the domestic market. After "reentry  into GATT," imported oil with price, variety, and quality  advantages will have an even greater impact on the domestic  market. For China's traditional export products, such as tung  oil, peanuts, and sesame, because they have a resource advantage  and comparatively low domestic prices, "reentry into GATT" will  help to expand exports and further open foreign markets.    3. Meats. This situation involves three issues: (1)  permission to enter the market; (2) elimination of subsidies;  and (3) health and quarantine standards. China is the world's  largest meat and egg producing nation. Pork and beef are  traditional Chinese bulk export commodities. Supplies are ample,  prices are cheap, and the export potential is very great, but  actual exports are limited, and they still have not penetrated  the markets of such developed countries as the United States,  Japan, Korea, and the European Community. The reason is that  they are restricted by various countries' health and quarantine  standards. In regard to chicken, in recent years the European  Community has eliminated subsidies to the chicken industry and  European Community countries one after another are turning to  China to buy chicken, but exports are affected by excessive drug  residue in chicken meat. China's leading export to the European  Community, frozen rabbit meat, also had pesticide residue in the  feed leading to a sudden decline in exports. GATT signatories  could unify the health and quarantine standards stipulated for  these commodities. After "reentry into GATT," linking up with  international standards will help China's meat exports.    4. Canned goods. Canned goods are an important foreign  exchange earning commodity for China. Western nations,  especially the European Community, all have a growing demand for  such Chinese canned goods as asparagus and mushrooms. But some  Western countries have implemented nontariff barriers against  China's canned goods exports. The domestic production price of  galvanized tin used in canned goods packaging is high, largely  relying on imports. After "reentry into GATT," GATT signatories  must remove nontariff barriers against China, which will help to  expand the volume of Chinese canned goods exports.    5. Sugar. International sugar production has increased very  rapidly, but consumption growth has slowed. World sugar reserves  have increased and sugar prices have fallen. A number of  countries with lower sugar production costs than China have  adopted high tariffs or quantitative restrictions toward  imported sugar and have subsidized the price of domestically  produced sugar to protect their own country's sugar market.  After "reentry into GATT," if China does not adopt protective  measures, it will seriously impact the domestic market.    6. Aquatic products. In 1992 China's total aquatic product  output was 13 million tons, becoming the world's largest fishing  nation. China's aquatic products have a certain competitiveness  on the international market because of cheap prices. Because  they lack special new varieties and profound processing  technology to keep them alive and fresh, the added value of the  products is low.    7. Fruits and vegetables. If the quality of China's fruit  does not remarkably improve, after "reentry into GATT," fruit  exports still will not sharply improve and high quality foreign  fruits will constantly flow into China's coastal cities. China  has ample vegetable resources and the prices are cheap. After  "reentry into GATT," it will be helpful to expand exports to  neighboring countries.    8. Alcoholic beverages. After "reentry into GATT," it will  be  helpful to the export of alcoholic beverages produced in China,  but foreign alcoholic beverages will have an even greater impact  on the domestic market. China has a single variety of beverages  and the quality is not stable. It is very hard to compete with  foreign beverages. After "reentry into GATT," foreign beverages  could seriously impact the domestic market.  <H3>  III. Grasp Opportunities, Meet Challenges, and Accelerate  the Development of China's Cereals, Oils, and Foodstuffs Import  and Export Trade </H3>   1. Further accelerate the commercialization, grouping, and  internationalization of cereals, oils, and foodstuffs import and  export trade companies. The expansion of China's cereals, oils,  and foodstuffs import and export trade is based on the formation  and growth of multinational companies. At the same time, because  much of international cereals, oils, and foodstuffs trade is  large-scale primary product trade, wholesale markets, futures  markets, and commodity exchanges occupy a major position in  large-scale primary products and their trade. China must  accelerate the development of high-quality markets---wholesale  markets, futures markets, and commodity exchanges and related  markets, and link up with world markets.    2. Fully utilize the advantage of China's agricultural  resources and improve production, processing, and sales of  traditional cereals, oils, and foodstuffs. We should strive to  tap the demands of the international market and strive to expand  the foreign market for traditional products most appropriate to  the export products that China produces (such as medicinal  foods). We should actively develop high production value  agriculture, for example, by exploiting coastal and inland  aquatic resources and expanding the export of seawater products;  fully utilizing agricultural and pastoral region resources to  develop livestock product exports; and concentrate on the  vegetable and fruits requirements of neighboring countries to  develop garden crops. In the future, cereals and oils trade  should have imports and exports and in ordinary years cereals  and oils import and export values should maintain an overall  balance. Utilizing the low grain prices on the international  market in recent years, we should appropriately import some to  make up for grain and oil deficits that can be brought on by  adjustments in the structure of the domestic market. At the same  time, we should gradually establish a cereals, oils, and  foodstuffs reserve system capable of adjusting the domestic  market so that we will not have any regrets when international  trade competition intensifies.    3. Diversify the cereals, oils, and foodstuffs export  market;  utilize the opportunities conferred by GATT and promptly exploit  international markets and make an all out effort to expand  exports. We should fully utilize the advantage of low labor  costs and fully utilize favorable conditions conferred by being  a signatory to GATT, speed up entry into signatory markets and  turn around unreasonable market structures as much as possible  to make for diversified and multilateral export product sales  markets. At the same time, we should participate extensively in  domestic market competition and further expand domestic markets.    4. Diversify means of competing. At the current stage,  Chinese cereals, oils, and foodstuffs export products basically  use price competition, that is, they compete for markets by  commodity price concessions. Because international market  competition is becoming ever more intense, non-price competition  is currently the main means of competition on the international  market. After "reentering GATT, China should take the use of  nonprice competition seriously and gradually make thoroughly  processed cereals, oils, and foodstuffs the main objective,  while enhancing product advertising and improving product  quality, including varieties, standards, and external design and  packaging and strive "to succeed by quality." We should change  our orientation from mainly price competition to mainly nonprice  competition.    5. Avoid forcing down prices to compete for sales and reduce  transshipment trade. China is a vast country and after "reentry  into GATT," the same types of cereals, oils, and foodstuffs  products will be exported by numerous companies and numerous  ports. If all the companies and all the ports, to increase the  foreign exchange earned from exports, adopt the method of  forcing down prices to compete for foreign sales, it will become  ever more intense. We must strengthen controls and insure that  the "profits" do not run off. In the 1980s, one third or more of  Chinese cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports were made through  transshipment channels. According to international market price  calculations, this made China lose 30 percent to 50 percent of  the profits. "Reentry into GATT" will facilitate the development  of direct trade.    6. Become proficient at using GATT provisions to enhance  self-protection. We should increase investment in agriculture  and expand supports to cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports.  GATT has a number of types of preferential treatment for  developing countries. Various types of direct supports for  agriculture by developing countries are permitted. But in name  the supports are to increase agricultural productivity and  improve farmers' livelihood, and it should not in name support  earning foreign exchange from exports to avoid producing the  suspicion of direct export subsidies. Becoming proficient in  using some GATT preferential treatment regulations for  developing countries can become an efficient instrument in  China's developing cereals, oils, and foodstuffs import and  export trade. In addition, for the easily impacted varieties  where China does not have the ability to compete  internationally, in accordance with GATT exceptional provisions,  we can demand that the government give the necessary protection.</p>

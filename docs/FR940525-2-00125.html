This amendment would: (a) Clarify the requirements for operation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System and Motor Driven Feedwater Pump System, (b) increase the surveillance intervals for testing the steam turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pumps and the electric motor driven pump, and (c) modify requirements relative to stationing an individual locally, during associated surveillance testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because no change is being made to any accident initiator. The proposed changes are clarifications and the incorporations of either the recommendations of Generic Letter 93&hyph;05 or the guidance provided by NUREG&hyph;1430. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed changes do not invalidate accident conditions or assumptions used in evaluating the radiological consequences of an accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the proposed changes do not change the way the plant is operated. No new types of failures or accident initiators are introduced by the proposed changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety, nor has any limiting single failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. No different accident initiators or failure mechanisms are introduced by the proposed changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed changes continue to ensure the availability of the Auxiliary Feedwater System and the Motor Driven Feedwater System when called upon to perform their functions and will not adversely impact any safety analysis assumptions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> University of Toledo Library, Documents Department, 2801 Bancroft Avenue, Toledo, Ohio 43606. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jay E.

Specifically, the proposed changes would modify the pressure/temperature operating limitations during heatup and cooldown and the Low Temperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOPS) pressure setpoints and temperatures for NA&hyph;1&amp;2. Also, the proposed changes include revised Limiting Conditions for Operation, Action Statements, and Surveillance Requirements for the Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) and block valves to address the concerns discussed in NRC Generic Letter 90&hyph;06. Additionally, the proposed changes include several editorial/administrative changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NA&hyph;1&amp;2 Reactor Coolant Systems (RCS) are protected from material failure by the imposition of restrictions on allowable pressure and temperature, and on heatup and cooldown rate. The LTOPS ensures that material integrity limits are not exceeded during the design basis overpressurization accidents. Equipment operability requirements are imposed to ensure that the assumptions of the accident analyses remain valid. The operating restrictions, setpoints, and equipment operability requirements must be revised to extend their applicability to a higher cumulative burnup, and to improve operational flexibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current pressure/temperature operating limits and LTOPS setpoints are valid to 12 Effective Full-Power Years (EFPY) and 17 EFPY for NA&hyph;1&amp;2, respectively. According to the most recent estimates, the burnup applicability limits will be exceeded by NA&hyph;1 in the spring of 1996. The NA&hyph;2 pressure/temperature operating limits and LTOPS setpoints remain valid well into the year 2002. The proposed NA&hyph;1 TS include revised pressure/temperature operating limits valid to end-of-license. Although the NA&hyph;2 pressure/temperature operating limits are not being changed, the NA&hyph;2 LTOPS setpoints and associated reactor vessel integrity protection philosophy are being changed. The reactor vessel integrity protection philosophy which supports the proposed TS changes provides improved operational flexibility while maintaining an adequate margin of safety as demonstrated by the safety analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

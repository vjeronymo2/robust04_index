			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / South-east housing cost 'hits the young' THE COST of housing in the south-east of England is forcing young people to remain living with their parents and to put off starting a family, according to a report published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. In a survey of people aged 18 to 35 in the south-east, one in seven said that they had stayed with their parents for longer than they wished because of concerns about the cost of a home. One in nine had delayed parenthood and a similar number had delayed setting up home with their partner. Of those with a mortgage, 60 per cent were paying more than Pounds 400 a month. Those living with parents tended to pay only nominal rent. The survey shows that only a minority of young people will get help from their parents with housing costs. Less than a fifth of those who had left home received any help. The median amount was Pounds 1,000.

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US unions bring first charges under Nafta The US National Administrative Office, established to handle labour complaints under the North American Free Trade Agreement, has scheduled its first hearings on two complaints that US companies are violating Mexican workers' rights. Both complaints relate to alleged company attempts to obstruct the organisation of unions independent of Mexico's governing party. United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America has lodged a complaint against General Electric of the US, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has accused Honeywell, the electronics manufacturer. US labour unions have considered the cases a test of administration resolve to deal with examples of worker abuse in Mexico since Nafta was created. President Bill Clinton has been a vocal advocate of tying workers' rights and the environment to trade liberalisation agreements. The unions are now concerned that the hearings, to be held this month, threaten to become 'mere political window dressing' and claim that the NAO is making it 'as costly as possible for Mexican workers and their representatives' to testify. The Honeywell complaint dates back to late November. Just days after Congress ratified Nafta. Honeywell sacked 21 production workers from its electronics parts plant in Chihuahua, Mexico. According to the complaint, 'Honeywell is part of an employers' association, which uses spying, electronic surveillance, locked-door interrogations, threats and firings to keep out independent union groups.' The workers are paid the minimum Mexican wage of 15 pesos a day - about Pounds 29 a week. In its response, Honeywell did not deny the charges but argued against the hearings on technical grounds. The complaint is not covered by Nafta, which requires hearings only on 'a pattern of non-enforcement by Mexico of Mexican Labour law'. Furthermore, the actions predate January 1 1994, the effective date of Nafta. Mr Ron Carey, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, has implied that the NAO is trying to avoid adverse publicity for the companies by holding the hearings at the end of August when 'members of Congress are vacationing along with many representatives of the media'. Mr John Hovis, president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, also said: 'We are extremely disturbed about the location and manner in which the hearing will be conducted. . . Simply stated, it appears intentionally designed to be as ineffective as possible.' A third complaint, against Sony Electronics, is to be filed next week. It alleges 'persistent violations of workers' rights particularly in the area of freedom of association'. It says Sony has violated Mexican labour law, and Mexico has persistently failed to enforce it.</p>

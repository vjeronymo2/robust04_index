			<p>BFN     [Text] Poland does not want to turn its back on the east  and wants to maintain good relations with all of the countries  that have emerged since the demise of the Soviet Union, Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski said at the opening of a two-day  conference on Poland's eastern policy in Warsaw. Minister  Olechowski emphasized that the building of democratic structures  in the east is a lot more difficult and that delays in the  process are inevitable.    When asked by journalists whether certain developments in  the  situation in Russia could constitute a danger to Poland,  Minister Olechowski replied:    [begin Olechowski recording] From that direction--often say  this--neo-imperialism, if it was stepped up; we do not  overdramatize this in any way [sentence as heard]. We can also  see very positive signals coming from that direction. One  should mention, for example, Russia's role in the recent  Ukrainian conflict or the role played in the internal Ukrainian  difficulties. One could mention the Latvian-Lithuanian Treaty.  We are awaiting a similar treaty for Estonia. It will be an  important litmus test for us.    Chaos and further economic disintegration are certainly bad  for us. If the situation were to deteriorate even further, it  would obviously make our lives very difficult. [end recording]</p>

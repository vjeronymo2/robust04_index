Since the beginning of 1993, industry and commerce  administrative departments at various levels have stepped up  efforts to construct infrastructural hard facilities for  markets, actively nurturing and perfecting markets and  strengthening market supervision. Last year, the region spent a  total of 11.62 million yuan to build, in a systematic and  planner manner, 23 markets of various kinds, covering 32,788  square meters of ground space. As of the end of December, there  were 99 markets with a total of over 100,000 square meters of  ground space in Tibet. They have, to a certain extent, improved  the appearance of narrow streets crowded with open-air stalls  and peddlers. Last year, transactions from urban and rural  trade fairs totaled more than 900 million yuan, representing a  21.6 percent increase over 1992 and accounting for 47.36 percent  of the total volume of the region's retailed sales. Lhasa's  Chongsaikang Comprehensive Market, the largest market in Tibet,  set a record 300 million yuan in transactions.    Along with improved infrastructural facilities for markets,  the variety and structure of markets have gradually developed  from trade fairs and specialized markets to capital goods and  comprehensive markets. Street stalls and peddlers now have  permanent operational sites and facilities; and markets, which  used to be run by individual traders, are now owned by the  state, collective, private, and individual sectors of the  economy. An open and comprehensive new system of market  networks with local characteristics has taken shape.    Last year, the industry and commerce administrative  departments also actively introduced an enterprise registration  system in a bid to help state enterprises change their operating  mechanisms and promote their healthy development. The  establishment of a legal independent registration system was a  major breakthrough achieved by the administration for industry  and commerce. As of the end of December, 3,485 state and  collective enterprises had completed registration with a total  of 3,944,020 yuan [figure as published] in registered capital.  Of these, 855 enterprises with 829,540 yuan [figure as  published] in registered capital completed registration in 1993,  up 31.3 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively, over 1992. The  number of foreign-funded enterprises increased from six in 1992  to 27, with a total registered capital of $24.75 million; and  129 foreign firms were approved to set up offices in Tibet, an  increase of 370 percent over 1992. Last year, Tibet accepted 20  applications for trademark registration and approved the  registration of five trademarks. So far, there are nine  registered trademarks in Tibet. More than 260,000 advertisements  were published, and their total business volume exceeded 1  million yuan for the first time, reaching 1.13 million yuan.    Last year the individual sector of the economy expanded  steadily while private-owned enterprises multiplied. As of the  end of December, there were 41,830 industrial and commercial  units run by individuals; and the number was basically the same  as the preceding year. They employed 65,579 people and had a  total of 174.46 million yuan in registered capital, up 73.9  percent and 71.64 percent, respectively, over 1992. There were  60 registered privately-owned enterprises and their registered  capital was 13.31 million yuan, representing a 330 percent and  230 percent increase, respectively, over 1992 and showing a  strong momentum of continued fast growth. Revenues from  industrial and commercial units run by individuals in Tibet last  year are expected to reach 26 million yuan.</p>

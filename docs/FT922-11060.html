			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (6): Banking on a reduction agreement - Debt IT WILL soon be a whole generation since communist Poland, then led by Mr Edward Gierek, and petrodollar-flush western banks went on a more than Dollars 20bn lending and spending spree. Much of the money was spent on industrial modernisation which never generated the export earnings needed to service the resulting debt. Twenty years later, however, western observers are now looking with the greatest interest at the plants which were built or refurbished in the 1970s. One example is the Pollena detergent plant in Bydgoszcz, bought last year for Dollars 20m by Unilever. The plant is now in private hands but the foreign debt will continue to burden Poles into the next century. Partial relief has come with last year's unprecedented debt reduction agreement which covered 50 per cent of Poland's official hard currency debt owed to 17 governments represented by the Paris Club. Bilateral agreements arising out of that accord are now in their final stages. Talks have been completed with 13 governments and still in train with a further four of which Italy, which is owed Dollars 1.64bn, is the largest creditor. The Paris Club agreement, however, still leaves Poland owing some Dollars 30bn to the 17 and awaiting a further 20 per cent reduction in 1994. But this will take place only if Poland retains IMF approval for its economic programmes. The next task is to wring a debt reduction agreement out of the 500 or so western commercial banks who are owed a further Dollars 11.4bn. Of this, Dollars 1.8bn arises from interest arrears which have piled up since the autumn of 1989 when Poland ceased to service its commercial debt. Ideally Warsaw would like a debt reduction from the banks to match their Paris Club agreement which gave a 50 per cent reduction of net present value of the outstanding accumulated debt. The hope is the reduction will be accomplished on the lines of the Brady plan. This could include debt buybacks financed by IMF and World Bank funds as well as from Poland's own reserves, and conversion of debt into medium-term bonds as well as debt forgiveness. The banks are unhappy about the demand. They have not said no but suggested that Poland should pay Dollars 500m towards interest arrears before serious talks can start. A full meeting of the so-called London Club is expected in June once parliament has passed this year's budget and the agreement with the IMF, suspended last year when Poland failed to meet its targets, is back in place. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the new finance minister has decided to take personal charge of the negotiations. It will be up to him to decide what to do about the banks' demand for the up-front payment. Certainly if he decides to make the payment it will have to come from Poland's foreign currency reserves. These stood at Dollars 6.5bn at the end of 1991 and are set to grow by Dollars 666m this year. This is because this year's budget only allows Dollars 900m to be spent on servicing debt while another Dollars 600m will come as a loan from the foreign currency reserves. That should cover Poland's current debt service commitments which are written into the planned balance of payments as Dollars 1.16bn in interest and Dollars 398m in capital payments. These compare with the Dollars 888m in interest payments and Dollars 456m in capital which was repaid in 1991. However, a deal this year with the banks will be a mixed blessing. It should increase much needed credit flows into Poland but will put pressure on the country's official financial outlays in a year when the budget is tighter than ever before. Politically, as Mr Ryszard Michalski who handles the finance ministry's foreign operations notes, 'we are having to explain why we are paying money to the banks when we lack the means for hospitals, schools and pensions'. Ms Dorota Wysznikiewicz, an economist, has meanwhile come up with some grim predictions if things go wrong on the debt front. Her most pessimistic scenario, published in the Gazeta Bankowa recently, assumes that a mere 10 per cent of export earnings a year is spent on debt servicing, that no further reductions can be had from western governments or banks and that GDP in the 1990s would grow by a mere 1 per cent annually. On this basis she calculates the foreign debt in 2000 would reach Dollars 91.4bn or five times that year's export earnings to give a debt service ratio of 107.5 per cent. At best, if Poland were to get the debt reductions it is asking for and devote 20 per cent of export earnings to debt servicing in the 1990s against a background of 2 or 3 per cent GDP growth, then debt would still be Dollars 30.4bn, 85 per cent of annual end-of-century exports but producing a manageable debt service ratio of 23.9 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb 22 (UNI)--Parliament on Tuesday  approved the promulgation of President's rule in the  northeastern State of Manipur on new year's eve.    Both Houses of Parliament approved the statutory resolutions  through a voice vote.    Replying to the brief debate, in the Lok Sabha, the Union  Home Minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, made it clear that secessionist  activities in the northeastern region would not be tolerated,  but at the same time, the government would leave no stone  unturned to remove the feeling of neglect and alienation among  the people.    The Minister of State for Home, Mr P.M. Sayeed, who replied  to the debate in the Rajya Sabha informed the members that  integrated approach to tackle the problem of insurgency in the  region was the need of the hour.    The Home Minister, Mr S.B. Chavan assured the Lok Sabha that  every effort would be made to remove the feeling of neglect and  alienation in the North-East, but at the same time any  secessionist activities would not be tolerated.    "The government is prepared to give any amount of money for  the socio-economic development of the northeastern region,  provided they utilise the money properly," Mr Chavan said while  replying to the debate on the approval of the proclamation of  President's rule.    The recent meeting of the North-Eastern Council had promised  all assistance to the growth and development of the region,  although non-plan expenditure was required.    Mr Chavan said he had separate meetings with Chief Ministers  and Governors of all northeastern States. Several projects which  had been taken up during the fifth and sixth plans were still  not completed.    The government had now decided not to recover any loan  sanctioned for any projects in the N-E States, he said.    "We have made just a beginning," Mr Chavan said and told the  House that several sectoral meetings were being planned to  monitor the development.    Referring to secessionism, Mr Chavan said the government's  priority was to win over the hearts of the local people. The  government would not hesitate to take action against those  indulging in secessionism, the Home Minister asserted.    He said complaints of corruption would be looked into and  severe action taken against those involved.    Participating in a debate, Mr Jaswant Singh (BJP [Bharatiya  Janata Party]) said if the government had intervened in time in  Manipur, the killing of a number of people could have been  avoided.    The substantial funds provided for the economic development  of the North-East was not properly utilised. Corruption was one  of the major factors for the alienation of the people, he added.    Mr Mohan Singh (JD [Janata Dal]) urged the government to  curb  the activities of Pakistan which through Bangladesh was  providing assistance to extremist forces in the North-East. Prof  M Kampson (Cong-I [Congress (I)]) urged the government to take  an initiative for promoting a dialogue to solve the problem of  insurgency in the North-East.    Mr Uddhab Barman (CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist])  demanded that the State Assembly should be dissolved and the  political process initiated so that a popular government could  be installed at the earliest. Extortions, drug trafficking,  smuggling and killings were rampant in Manipur. AIDS was also  spreading in a big way, he added.    Mr Kabindra Purkayastha (BJP) said the State government had  no control over the hill district which was under the sway of  insurgents and extremists. The insurgency in the North-East was  a major threat to national integration. The insurgents had camps  and training facilities in Bangladesh, he said.    Mr Sriballav Panigrahi (Cong-I) said there was nothing wrong  in keeping the Assembly in suspended animation. According to  him, there was improvement in the law and order situation in the  State. Political parties should help strengthen law and order so  that normalcy could be restored in Manipur.    Mr Viswanath Shastri (CPI [Communist Party of India]) said  the police forces in Manipur should be reorganised to restore  the peoples confidence. He stressed the need for fulfilling the  aspirations of different groups of people there.    Mr George Fernandes (JD) said unemployment, drug addiction  and AIDS were serious problems facing the northeastern region  and the government would have to adopt suitable measures to  overcome them.    Mr Kirip Chaliha (Cong-I) said unlike other parts of the  country, the northeast people had no caste barrier. They were  very much alive to the practical problems and would remain in  the mainstream.    Mr Chitta Basu (FB [Forward Bloc]) said N-E should get  special attention of the government and reminded that forces of  secessionism was growing in the region.</p>

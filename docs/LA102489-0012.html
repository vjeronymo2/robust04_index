			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOSSILIZATION OF DARWIN'S PET;  </P> <P> EVOLUTION: SURELY THE CURRICULUM COMMISSION IS AWARE THAT MORE SCIENTISTS ARE  OPENLY CRITICAL HIS THEORY.  </P> <P> It's very odd that the California Curriculum Commission has voted to recommend  to the state Board of Education that evolution be taught as uncontested fact --  just when more scientists than ever before are contesting it.  </P> <P> By claiming that "there is no scientific dispute that evolution has occurred  and continues to occur," the members of the curriculum commission are showing  remarkable ignorance. Surely they can't be unaware that more and more  scientists are openly critical of Darwinism.  </P> <P> One among many is Australian biologist and agnostic Michael Denton, who claims  that not one single discovery since 1859, when Charles Darwin published "On the  Origin of Species," has supported Darwin's theory. Denton calls evolution "the  great cosmogenic myth of the 20th Century."  </P> <P> Where were the members of the commission in 1981 when Colin Patterson, senior  paleontologist for the British Museum of Natural History, told biologists at  the American Museum of Natural History in New York that belief in evolution is  as much a commitment of faith as is belief in creation?  </P> <P> "I woke up and realized that all my life I had been duped into taking  evolutionism as revealed truth in some way," Patterson told his colleagues. He  said that no real transitional forms have ever been found anywhere in the  fossil record and "I don't think we shall ever have any access to any form of  (evolutionary) tree which we can call factual."  </P> <P> He challenged other scientists to tell him one thing they knew for sure about  evolution. "I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in  the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I  got there was silence for a very long time and eventually one person said, 'I  do know one thing -- it ought not to be taught in high school.' "  </P> <P> Still, the members of the curriculum commission are apparently so rigidly  committed to the dogma of evolution that they are insisting that it be taught  to the next generation anyway.  </P> <P> Perhaps the commission members have not read Denton's book, "Evolution: A  Theory in Crisis." In it, he asks, "Is it really credible that random processes  could have constructed a reality, the smallest element of which -- a functional  protein or gene -- is complex beyond our own creative capacities, a reality  which is the very antithesis of chance, which excels in every sense anything  produced by the intelligence of man."  </P> <P> The commission must have missed the comment by Murray Eden, professor emeritus  at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that Denton's book "should be made  required reading for everyone who believes what he was taught in college about  evolution."  </P> <P> Maybe they have not read "The Mystery of Life's Origins: Reassessing Current  Theories," by Charles B. Thaxton, Walter Bradley and Roger Olsen, former  evolutionists with doctorates in chemistry, geochemistry and materials science,  which concludes that a "creator beyond the cosmos" is the most plausible  explanation for life's origin.  </P> <P> Where has the curriculum commission been? Are the members blind and deaf to  what is happening in the scientific community? Are they determined to maintain  the status quo regardless of the facts, determined to make evolution true by a  show of hands? Or, more likely, are they afraid of the theories that may have  to be seriously considered if evolution doesn't have center stage?  </P> <P> What if the best explanation for the data turns out to include a supernatural  origin? Aren't we big enough to handle the possibility that truth may not fit  within our pre-conceived and arbitrary naturalistic confines?  </P> <P> Throughout the history of science, the most danger has come not from outside,  from non-scientific theories, but from within, from the fossilization of  attitude. As soon as science says, "our pet theory doesn't work, but we're  going to advocate it anyway," or "well, the data may indicate we go in a new  direction, but we refuse to because it may lead to something we don't like,"  then truth has been irreparably compromised.  </P> <P> What the curriculum commission has done seems to confirm what evolutionist Dean  Kenyon of San Francisco State University wrote after reading "The Mystery of  Life's Origins," that many scientists hesitate to admit or study the theory's  problems because they "would open the door to the possibility (or the  necessity) of a supernatural origin of life."  </P> <P> And we couldn't have that, could we?  </P></p>

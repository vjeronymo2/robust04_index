			<p>BFN     [Text] Our forces, defending unity, democracy, and  modernization, have continued their heroic resistance and  constitutional steadfastness against the forces of the  adventurist gang of the al-Ahmar clan, who are continuing their  artillery and rocket barrage and engaging in successive attacks  on the former eastern border areas, these being Ga'tabah,  al-Dali, al-Rahidah, Karish, al-Bayda and Mukayras. The forces  of the bloody military gang of al-Ahmar have continued to direct  artillery, rocket, and aircraft fire on al-Dali and the villages  around it, and to confront our forces, who are supported by the  citizenry.    For the ninth time, units from the Republican Guards, the  central security forces, the 8th Independent Armored Brigade,  and the al-Hamzah Brigade have attacked, in an attempt to break  through the our forces' defensive positions -- they were  repulsed and sent back to where they came from. Members of  these units surrendered and joined our forces, having realized  the falsity of the slogans concerning the defense of  constitutionality and unity being prattled by the influential  al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa.    In Qa'tabah and Karish, our heroic defending forces repulsed  the forces of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan, which had continued  its efforts to break through our forces' defensive positions,  directing intensive artillery and rocket fire against the  villages and houses of innocent civilians. This was an attempt  to erode the high morale characterizing the heroic defenders and  the masses of the people of Karish, known for their outstanding  role in the struggle during all stages of the revolution, and in  the defense of unity.    In the capital of Abyan Governorate, units from the Amaliqah  forces have suffered repeated defeats and have surrendered, with  many of their men joining the ranks of our forces. Our forces,  after reinforcing the encirclement of their positions, succeeded  in storming their positions, even after they sought shelter in  the houses, schools, and fields of citizens. At noon today the  commanding officer of the 54th Battalion of the Amaliqah forces,  Colonel Ahmad Salim al-Nahmi, surrendered, together with what  was left of the officers and men of his battalion. They joined  the ranks of our forces which, supported by the sons of  Zinjibar, Ji'ar, and the surrounding villages, are continuing  their operations to take full control of the situation in this  governorate.</p>

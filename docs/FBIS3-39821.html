That is not just the responsibility of Israel  and the Palestinians, but of the whole international community.  That was the message of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat during a  visit to The Hague on Friday [18 February].    Prime Minister Lubbers was therefore requested amicably but  urgently by 'Arafat to offer a helping hand, although it  remained open what the Netherlands -- or the European -- role in  the Middle East should be. Accordingly it was also important  for 'Arafat, under the spotlight of the international press, to  meet his "friend and brother" Nelson Mandela.    "Rabin always repeats that no date is sacred," an indignant  'Arafat said in a sober room of De Wittenburg, a castle in  Wassenaar. "What does he mean no sacred dates? Haven't we  signed an agreement?"    "We have the United States and Russia as witnesses,  President  Clinton gave his blessing, the whole international community is  behind the agreement," 'Arafat said. "It is not just an  Israeli-Palestinian agreement, it is an international agreement."    'Arafat made it clear that as far as he was concerned there  was a sacred date -- 13 April, when the Israeli Army is supposed  to have withdrawn from Gaza and Jericho under the literal text  of the agreement in principle. Therefore both parties would  have to reach agreement in a month. Was it likely? "I hope  so," he said. "If there is no agreement, then the peace is in  danger."    The PLO leader said that it would not be his fault if no  agreement was reached. "I did my best in my three meetings with  Prime Minister Peres," he said. "It was clear to everyone that  the Palestinians were adopting a positive attitude. We took  courageous decisions. Now the other side has to prove that  peace is wanted. If not, then the peace process will lose its  credibility."    The "courageous decisions" referred to by 'Arafat are the  concessions from the Palestinian side, including such areas as  the border passages with Jordan and Egypt, which will continue  to be checked by Israel, the extensive powers which the Israeli  Army will keep in Gaza and the limited size of the Jericho  enclave. The concessions have earned 'Arafat the usual  criticisms in Palestinian circles and therefore it is high time  that Israel makes gestures.    The release of Palestinian prisoners could be such a  gesture.  'Arafat made it clear that he had received promises that some  prisoners would be released during Ramadan, the Islamic month of  fasting now taking place. Does this include the prisoners who  were held because they used violence? "Both parties committed  crimes," he said. "Many Palestinians were murdered, do not  forget that. But peace means peace. For both peoples. For our  children and their children. We cannot make a final agreement  without having a guarantee that all our prisoners will be  released."    The growing opposition in the occupied territories to  'Arafat's policies -- from the Islamic Hamas, pro-Syrian  organizations and even in his own Fatah movement -- led to a  rumor that the PLO leader would not be so fussy about his  promise to organize elections this year for the administrative  council in the future autonomous area. Could the PLO leader  guarantee that the Palestinian elections would be held?    "We are already busy preparing for the elections," he said.  "Three months ago I signed a decree for the establishment of a  special committee. We agreed on elections in Washington, that  is settled." And what would happen if Hamas or a coalition of  opposition groups won the elections? "That is democracy," he  said. "Are you against that? We are proud of our democracy."    Was Hamas a threat to the peace process? "No one can hold  back history," 'Arafat said, adding neatly that Hamas had  already asked to take part in the elections.    However, things have not yet reached that stage and on  Friday  'Arafat was mainly preoccupied with gaining international  support. ANC [African National Congress of South Africa] Leader  Mandela promised to visit him in Jericho before visiting Israel.  "We have a very close relationship," 'Arafat said. "We are  fighting the same struggle for peace, in South Africa and the  Middle East."    But the PLO leader's talks with Economic Affairs State  Secretary Van Rooy and a group of Netherlands business people  were the most concrete discussions. They covered not only  Gaza's harbor, but also cooperation in agriculture, road and  house building and tourism. It was decided to establish a  Netherlands-Palestinian business council.</p>

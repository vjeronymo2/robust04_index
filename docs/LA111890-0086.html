			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEKING, AND FINDING, THE ROMANCE OF MEXICO IN MODERN GUADALAJARA  </P> <P> Mariachi music was born in Guadalajara, and the rollicking, foot-tapping tunes  of Mexico's popular folk minstrels still dance through the historic city's  cobbled streets as if every day is a fiesta. Listen to the music, and you may  quickly succumb, as I did, to the city's old-fashioned charm.  </P> <P> We tourists often travel in search of illusions, and in Guadalajara, I found  the romantic Mexico of my imagination.  </P> <P> One lazy afternoon, my wife and I lunched in a flower-scented garden where  peacocks begged crumbs and the waiter plucked ripe sweet guavas for us from the  tree shading our table. I awoke daily to the sound of the cathedral bells,  pealing their morning greeting as they have for almost four centuries.  </P> <P> We peeked into the loveliest of the city's many Spanish-colonial buildings,  invariably finding quiet courtyards where fountains splashed in a profusion of  bougainvillea, oleander and bright red hibiscus.  </P> <P> Twice we all but got lost in the crowded passageways of the city's sprawling  Liberty Market, where we had gone in search of the decorative pottery for which  the region is famous. At sunset, we lingered over tequila sours at a sidewalk  cafe or joined the crowds strolling the city's splendidly formal plazas.  </P> <P> Magicians, folk dancers and other street performers entertained. On our last  night, we took a long horse-drawn carriage ride through the old city, waving at  Mexican families who waved back at us from their carriages.  </P> <P> My favorite memory, though, is the Saturday afternoon we chanced upon a  mariachi concert in Tlaquepaque, a picturesque little village within  Guadalajara's borders that is noted for fine pottery and other handicrafts. We  had just emerged from a shop when I heard the unmistakable chorus of blaring  trumpets and squealing violins.  </P> <P> I'm a great fan of mariachi music, so off we went in pursuit of the boisterous  sound, joined by almost everybody else on the street. A fiesta was in the  making, and we weren't about to miss it.  </P> <P> Guadalajara is perhaps an unusual destination for a Mexican getaway, since it  is nowhere near an ocean beach. The nearest beach resort is Puerto Vallarta, a  long and arduous drive away.  </P> <P> I was intrigued more by Guadalajara's lively colonial history and a reputation  as Mexico's "most Mexican" city -- an indication that I would see more local  folk than fellow Americans on the streets. The fact that the latest edition of  the Encyclopedia Americana -- a good resource I always consult before I travel  -- calls it "one of the most attractive of North American cities" clinched my  decision to go.  </P> <P> Guadalajara sits in a high, sweeping valley about 300 miles northwest of the  capital of Mexico City. At an elevation of 5,141 feet, it enjoys a dry,  pleasantly mild climate throughout the year.  </P> <P> Although we visited there on a long weekend in August, we left our hotel  windows open at night to enjoy the cool breezes -- which, of course, is why I  heard the cathedral bells at dawn.  </P> <P> The cathedral's anthem was politely followed -- in deference to its age perhaps  -- by the ringing echoes of first one and then another of the city's other  churches. I found the bells a gentle enough alarm clock.  </P> <P> Guadalajara is Mexico's second-largest city, but this statistic can be  misleading. Mexico City is swamped by a population that may exceed 20 million.  Guadalajara's is only a quarter of that, at 5 million, and so far the city has  managed to escape the oppressive congestion of the capital.  </P> <P> Indeed, in the historic colonial district, where traffic is banned from some  streets and few structures rise above two stories, you might easily imagine  yourself in a small (though sophisticated) village.  </P> <P> It is a very old city and a historical one, founded by the Spanish  conquistadors in 1542, a good 78 years before the Pilgrims established Plymouth  Colony in Massachusetts.  </P> <P> A regional capital, it was the jumping-off place for the Spanish exploration of  California and other Spanish colonies in what is now the United States. Father  Junipero Serra, who founded the first nine of California's 21 Franciscan  missions, made his departure from Guadalajara in 1767.  </P> <P> Much of Spanish Guadalajara has disappeared, but in the past decade city  officials have acted to preserve the colonial integrity of the historic  district -- an area of several square blocks in the heart of the city.  </P> <P> We picked our hotel, the comfortable little De Mendoza, because of its location  within the district. It's nestled against one of the city's finest old chapels,  the ornate Santa Maria de Gracia, a popular choice for weddings. I caught  glimpses of at least three formal bridal processions from my third-floor  window.  </P> <P> Large parts of the historic district are off-limits to vehicles, which makes it  ideal for sightseeing on foot.  </P> <P> I found it an impressive place, a sort of architectural garden where a  collection of handsome gray stone buildings and baroque-style churches are  displayed amid broad plazas and well-tended gardens.  </P> <P> A modern element in the district that enhances rather than detracts is the  seven-block-long Plaza Tapatia, an inviting pedestrian mall completed eight  years ago. It is graced with arcades, fountains, hand-wrought iron lamps and  statuary -- monumental and whimsical alike.  </P> <P> The plaza is an attractive link between two of Guadalajara's historical  treasures, the cathedral and the Cabanas Cultural Institute. On our way from  one to the other, we stopped for apricot-flavored ice cream cones at Helados  Bing, a modern ice cream parlor tucked into one of the arcades -- yet another  of the charms of Plaza Tapatia.  </P> <P> The 16th-Century cathedral, its twin towers decorated in tiles of blue and  yellow, dominates the western edge of the historic district near the  intersection of two major shopping streets, Avenida 16 de Septiembre and  Avenida Juarez.  </P> <P> On the eastern edge, about a dozen blocks away via Plaza Tapatia, is the  Cabanas Cultural Institute, occupying a former orphanage that was the largest  colonial structure ever built in the Americas. It's a delightful, six-acre  sprawl that hides -- by official count -- 23 charming patios. In one, we  watched a group of eager youngsters learning local folk dances to mariachi  tunes.  </P> <P> We spent most of a full day exploring the historic district, ate traditional  Mexican meals within walking distance of the hotel and joined the evening  crowds promenading on the Plaza Tapatia and the other adjacent squares.  </P> <P> Guadalajara's handsome 19th-Century theater, the Degollado Theater, overlooks  one of them, the Plaza de La Liberacion. One night, the theater drew a  glamorous tuxedo- and gown-clad crowd to a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet,  which was visiting. The group added to the elegance of the colonial structures  around us.  </P> <P> We found it easy to poke our noses into most of the old buildings, many of  which house government offices. Built mostly of gray stone, they present a  solid, imposing exterior.  </P> <P> But it's all a bluff. Inside, the buildings are far more inviting than they may  seem. Arched walls encircle delightful gardens and cool, quiet courtyards  decorated with sprightly fountains, wrought-iron balconies and tiled walkways.  Orange trees, a local symbol, flourish among palms and other semitropical  foliage. I liked to sit for a moment and soak in the aura of earlier centuries.  </P> <P> In our rambles, we inevitably reached the Government Palace, a large  18th-Century colonial structure that faces the neatly manicured Plaza de Armas.  We stepped inside, anticipating more of the pleasant courtyards that so  appealed to us.  </P> <P> Instead, we were all but stunned by a massive and fiery mural sweeping across  the ceiling directly above us. It is the work of Jose Clemente Orozco, Mexico's  famed artist.  </P> <P> Completed in the late 1930s, it depicts Father Hidalgo, a Mexican revolutionary  who in 1810 proclaimed the end of slavery from this very building. Carrying a  burning torch, Father Hidalgo glares down in unrelenting anger -- probably  well-justified by the injustices of Mexico's colonial past.  </P> <P> The Regional Museum of Guadalajara, on the north side of the Plaza de La  Liberacion, occupies yet another fine old colonial building, once a seminary. I  don't know whether I was more taken by its quiet, pillar-ringed courtyards or  the exhibits of colorful Indian costumes on display.  </P> <P> That evening, we would chance upon a group of folk dancers dressed in similar  attire performing for the street crowds on the plaza.  </P> <P> We concluded the day's history lesson with lunch at Cafe Sandy, a second-floor  restaurant with balcony tables overlooking the museum entrance and the colorful  street scene.  </P> <P> Guadalajara is famed for its traditional dishes -- tacos, tostadas, gorditas  (meat pies) and pozole, a hominy soup -- most of which were on Sandy's menu. I  opted for a chicken tostada and hot sauce. A large lunch for two, including  beer, cost about $14, reflecting the generally moderate prices in Guadalajara.  </P> <P> Afterward, we headed for Liberty Market, reportedly the largest public market  under one roof in Latin America. About three square blocks in size, it stands  just outside the historic district at its eastern end, easily within walking of  the Hotel De Mendoza.  </P> <P> The place is intimidating at first, a vast and confusing arena jammed to  overflowing with individual shops selling almost everything from fresh fruits  and meats to sombreros and hand-crafted guitars. We went in search of  hand-painted pottery, which we found in overwhelming array. We had been advised  to bargain, but the prices were so low already I didn't have the heart.  </P> <P> On our last day in Guadalajara, we ventured beyond the historic district to  visit two nearby artisans' villages, Tonala and Tlaquepaque.  </P> <P> We might have gone by bus or taxi, but instead we hired a licensed guide with a  car for the morning at about $12 an hour for four hours -- a reasonable charge,  and not much more than what a taxi would have cost for the same trip. The  villages are each about a 25-minute drive from the center of the city and  perhaps 15 minutes from each other.  </P> <P> Unlike Tlaquepaque, Tonala has not yet been gobbled up by growing Guadalajara.  To reach it, you ride through a bit of open countryside, where cattle graze in  green fields.  </P> <P> By outward appearances, Tonala is a typical country village. Adobe buildings,  painted in pastel shades, line dusty, cobblestone streets -- all of which seem  to lead to the central plaza and the community church.  </P> <P> But Tonala is noted for its numerous, small family-run pottery factories, which  produce a variety of colorful ceramics -- plates, animal figurines, tall vases  and deep bowls. Much of the work is quite good, though some of it obviously is  junk.  </P> <P> Tonala is popular with the local folks, our guide told us, because prices are  inexpensive. She shopped for a small gift for a friend, while we toured the  shops to see what they offered. On Thursdays and Sundays, vendors from  surrounding communities flock to the village, displaying handmade baskets and  other handicrafts on blankets spread on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> There is homespun authenticity to the pottery trade in Tonala. But the best  ceramics in the region are found in Tlaquepaque, a considerably more upscale  neighborhood that once served as a country resort for wealthy families of  Guadalajara.  </P> <P> Several shops along Calle Independencia, an attractive pedestrian promenade,  occupy the former homes of these aristocrats. Many of the buildings enclose  pleasant gardens. We toured the shops as much to see the interior of the old  homes as the merchandise. A hand-painted vase, signed by the artist, may cost  several hundred dollars, although much cheaper pieces also are available.  </P> <P> One of the region's finest restaurants, the No Name Restaurant, is just a few  steps off Calle Independencia, and we sought it out for a late lunch after  dismissing our guide.  </P> <P> At least, we thought we were eating late at 1:30 p.m. Actually, we had arrived  early by Guadalajaran standards. The restaurant really didn't fill all its  tables until about 3, when we were leaving. With time on their hands, the  waiters picked guavas from the trees, sharing them with us.  </P> <P> I couldn't help but like the restaurant. It was the romantic Old Mexico of my  dreams. We dined outdoors in a tiled garden courtyard shaded by banana trees,  bamboo and other lush foliage. Peacocks strutted past, and a guitarist  serenaded us.  </P> <P> The table was set with ceramic ware from a prestigious shop next door. To all  appearances, we had stepped back into the 18th Century. Lunch was as satisfying  as the setting. I ordered a small grilled steak topped with sweet pecan sauce.  A complete lunch for two, with beer, came to about $40.  </P> <P> Afterward, we strolled the streets of Tlaquepaque for awhile longer, reluctant  to leave. I ducked into a ceramics shop to buy a souvenir of our visit, and  when I emerged I heard the mariachi band warming up in the plaza. The concert  was just getting under way in a large, tree-shaded plaza ringed by more  open-air restaurants.  </P> <P> All the restaurants had tables, maybe hundreds of them, spilling at random  almost to the edge of a circular bandstand, which commanded the center of the  plaza. On stage, a large mariachi group in traditional bolero jacket, tight  black pants and silver trim played with the robust spirit the music invites.  The tables filled quickly.  </P> <P> Mostly, the concert was a family affair -- large multi-generational families  taking a dozen seats or more around the tables. Waiters scurried, carrying  trays heaped with spicy dishes, steins of good Mexican beer and fruit drinks.  Youngsters in fancy party clothes skipped to the beat, and the grown-ups called  for their favorite pieces and applauded enthusiastically.  </P> <P> I sipped my beer, listened to the tunes and watched the happy crowd around me.  </P> <P> Mariachi is the music of Old Guadalajara, and I was in the mood for a fiesta.  If you travel with romantic dreams, why wake up before you have to?  </P></p>

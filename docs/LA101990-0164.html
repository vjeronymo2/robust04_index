			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> MODEL MAYOR'S OBSESSION ENDS IN MURDER;  </P> <P> BAD DESIRE BY GARY DEVON, RANDOM HOUSE, $18.95, 326 PAGES  </P> <P> Henry Slater would be a shoe-in for any public office he chose. Young,  energetic, articulate, independently wealthy and married to a charming and  public-spirited woman, he seems wasted as mayor of a small California city.  </P> <P> From all appearances, he should have his eye on the White House, or at least  Sacramento. Why would a man of Slater's talents settle for grappling with  parking zoning ordinances when he could be making laws for everybody?  </P> <P> Gary Devon answers this question on Page 13 of "Bad Desire," after you've seen  this paragon of civic virtue meet another man in a seedy bar far from the  pleasant plazas of Rio del Palmos.  </P> <P> There, in a dim back booth, the two conspirators write terse messages to each  other in spilled sugar, tipping the canister onto the table, then sweeping the  grains away for the next line. They never speak, but by the time they leave,  money has changed hands and you know something horrid will happen before  midnight Saturday.  </P> <P> Henry Slater is insanely in love with Sheila Bonner, a 17-year-old high school  junior. They met when she was a child of 10, living with her grandmother,  Rachel Buchanan, after her mother's death.  </P> <P> Slater watched the pretty child grow to luscious adolescence. Though the  Slaters now have a lavish estate on the opposite side of town, he hasn't lost  touch. The mayor continually cruises in one of his three cars, trailing Sheila  from school to cafe to mall, spying on her day and night.  </P> <P> So far, Sheila has been accommodating, thrilled to have a secret admirer and  delighted with his gifts of jewelry. Unfortunately, these treasures stay hidden  in her closet. Her grandmother doesn't approve of the relationship, and has  forbidden her to see Slater alone. The meetings are furtive and increasingly  unsatisfactory for him. She now has a boyfriend, a football star acceptable to  her grandmother, and she's beginning to tire of the dangerous game with the  mayor. The boyfriend has made Slater not only impatient, but desperate. If the  grandmother could only be eliminated, he thinks, all obstacles to his union  with Sheila would melt away.  </P> <P> The crucial difference between a mystery and a psychological thriller is that  in the latter you know the villain at once. The excitement must come from  watching him enmesh himself ever more deeply in evil as the clues accumulate  and suspicion heightens.  </P> <P> In "Bad Desire," neither the police chief nor the betrayed wife act upon their  knowledge, effectively depriving the novel of the villain's only antagonists.  Without them, tension dissipates like the morning fog over Rio del Palmos.  </P> <P> Given his druthers, Slater would have preferred the murder of Rachel Buchanan  to be a neat shotgun job by the hired assassin. But when the hit man is killed  in a bizarre accident before he can fulfill his assignment, Slater takes  matters into his own hands.  </P> <P> Rachel Buchanan is amateurishly but gruesomely killed, and, as Slater had  hoped, Sheila turns to him for the consolation he's so eager to provide. The  trinkets escalate into major gifts; the brief encounters stretch into  passionate afternoons in Henry's secret house, a remote property he bought  under a false name for just this purpose.  </P> <P> We soon learn that Slater is an expert builder of sophisticated explosive  devices. From his cushy office in City Hall, he detonates these all over town,  then calls emergency council meetings to deal with the crisis.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, a trio of escaped convicts has been terrorizing the coast,  distracting the police chief and remaining at large long enough for Slater to  complete his metamorphosis from model citizen into serial killer.  </P> <P> For a few weeks, Slater enjoys his idyll with Sheila, all the while keeping up  a busy social schedule with his wife and working overtime at his mayoral  duties.  </P> <P> But honeymoons eventually end -- some gradually, others abruptly. Slater's is  the second kind, and when it's over, it turns out that Henry Slater isn't the  only person in Rio del Palmos to suffer from sexual obsession. But this one  won't come as any surprise, either.  </P> <P> Next: Carolyn See reviews "Possession: A Romance" by A.S. Byatt (Random House).  </P></p>

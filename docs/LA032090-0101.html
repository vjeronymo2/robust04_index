			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIALIST BACKING GRADUAL UNITY WILL OPPOSE KOHL;  </P> <P> WEST GERMANY: THE STATE PREMIER IS CHOSEN AS CANDIDATE FOR CHANCELLOR. HE HINTS  THAT HE'S IN FAVOR OF CUTTING NATO TIES.  </P> <P> Oskar Lafontaine, the 46-year-old premier of the depressed West German state of  Saarland, was chosen Monday to lead the opposition Social Democratic Party in  the election for chancellor against incumbent Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> Lafontaine was named in a secret party ballot only a day after the allied  Social Democrats of East Germany were badly beaten by a center-right coalition  of parties aligned with Kohl's Christian Democrats in the first free elections  in that nation.  </P> <P> The West German national elections are scheduled for December.  </P> <P> Lafontaine has been the opposition's leading candidate since January, when he  easily won reelection over the Christian Democrats to the premiership in the  coal-and-steel state along the French border.  </P> <P> On a personal basis, the intellectually inclined Lafontaine tops Kohl in public  opinion polls, but his party is running only even with the ruling Christian  Democrats.  </P> <P> When the exodus of East Germans to West Germany began last fall, Lafontaine won  widespread attention, and some support, by arguing that the federal republic  could not easily underwrite all the newcomers and calling for them to remain at  home.  </P> <P> However, the other major parties quickly took up this position and Lafontaine  could no longer claim it as his own.  </P> <P> Rather, he has lately been urging a gradual transition to German unity instead  of the faster pace pushed by Kohl -- which was apparently supported by East  Germans in Sunday's election.  </P> <P> Lafontaine said Monday that he is in favor of a "cautious transition" to a  common currency with East Germany while ensuring that a social welfare net  remains in place.  </P> <P> But it is the issue of European security that brings him into sharpest conflict  with Kohl's Christian Democrats and with the members of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization.  </P> <P> At various times, Lafontaine has called NATO an "anachronism" and advocated  that a united Germany leave NATO's military structure while remaining  politically bound to it.  </P> <P> On Monday, he hedged, calling for a "European security system that should come  from military cooperation," adding that his aim is "to overcome the  confrontation between the blocs and create a European system to replace  existing military alliances."  </P> <P> Earlier, at a meeting of the Socialist Party in France, Lafontaine suggested an  "all-European defense," which he said would consist of both NATO and Warsaw  Pact troops under a joint command.  </P> <P> "Armies under a common high command can hardly march against one another," he  declared.  </P> <P> This is an idea that puts him at odds with NATO allies and a large body of  current West German opinion, as well as some leaders of his own party.  </P></p>

The residents climbed on rooftops and other high places to  follow the actions of the three airplanes and a helicopter in  this location where the presence of guerrillas had been unknown.    The rebels responded to the bombing with submachine-gun  fire.  The number of casualties is unknown. The action occurred about  10 km from the center of San Cristobal, a town which the EZLN  members maintained under their control on 1 January.    The battle site is alongside the highway linking San  Cristobal with Ocosingo, toward which the guerrilla forces are  reportedly pulling back after issuing a "declaration of war"  against the Mexican Government and Army on 1 January.</p>

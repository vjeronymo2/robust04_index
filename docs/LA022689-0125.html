			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FORMER TRUANTS TRAIN FOR MARATHON;  </P> <P> STUDENTS PUT LIVES ON NEW TRACK  </P> <P> Aliso High School senior Cesar Morquecho said he only used to run when he was  being chased. Even then, he couldn't run far. "I used to smoke cigarettes," he  said.  </P> <P> Now, Morquecho and five classmates -- all former truants and identified as  incorrigibles -- are running out of bad habits. Instead of ditching school,  these continuation high school students are putting in extra hours training to  run in the Los Angeles Marathon next Sunday.  </P> <P> Compared to the marathon, "getting a diploma is a piece of cake," said  Morquecho, 18, a Reseda resident.  </P> <P> "Their attitudes have changed tremendously," said Paul Trapani, an Aliso High  School social studies teacher who has directed the students' marathon training  since fall. "They are more positive, more supportive and much more  cooperative."  </P> <P> Most of the 100 or so students at Aliso High in Reseda enter as potential  dropouts. They've left their regular high schools because of academic and  behavior problems, Trapani said. At continuation schools, students get more  individual attention in academic subjects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conditioning Class  </P> <P> Last summer, Trapani said, he decided to add running to the curriculum. He  talked nearly a dozen students into signing up for a conditioning class that  started in September.  </P> <P> Trapani, who teaches history, economics and government, wrote a contract for  each of his students pledging them to attend twice-a-week workouts and to  complete two 5-kilometer runs and one 10-kilometer run. The students earn five  elective credits if they finish the course; the marathon is optional.  </P> <P> Since the class started, several have quit, two have been injured, but only one  of the remaining students has decided not to try the marathon, Trapani said.  </P> <P> "The idea is to develop self-awareness, that if you set out with a goal, you  have to work to complete it," Trapani said.  </P> <P> Six of Trapani's students, five boys and one girl, will get a chance at  completing the 26.2-mile run.  </P> <P> Trapani's students said they never thought much of running and still find it  hard to believe that they are in the race.  </P> <P> "The first time we had to run a mile, it was incredible torture," said senior  Nick Merelle of Reseda. "Now I can run 12 to 15 miles."  </P> <P> To reach that kind of mileage, the students have been running as a group after  school and on weekends.  </P> <P> Getting them into the proper frame of mind was as tricky as getting them into  running shoes.  </P> <P> "Before I came here, my counselor said to me, 'There's no way you're going to  graduate,' " said Merelle, 18. "The teachers here said, 'Yes, you can.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defeatist Attitude  </P> <P> Students have usually adopted a defeatist attitude by the time they transfer to  continuation high school, Trapani said. So, he said, he started his runners  slowly, over short distances, so they would stay with the class long enough to  see some progress.  </P> <P> "A lot of the reason some of them are here is because they are quick to start  and have a hard time finishing," Trapani said. "The idea is not to compete but  to complete; I didn't want them to get frustrated."  </P> <P> To encourage his students, Trapani persuaded a shoe company to donate expensive  running shoes and a sporting goods store to give them discounts on other gear.  An insurance company donated $4,000 to pay for uniforms, first aid kits and  entry fees.  </P> <P> Since then, the students have finished three 5-kilometer runs and one  10-kilometer race.  </P> <P> Sylvia Herrera of Canoga Park, a 17-year-old sophomore who was kicked out of  one high school and then quit another before enrolling at Aliso, said she plans  to run the first six to 10 miles of the marathon before walking a little. She  said she is planning on finishing the course.  </P> <P> "All this running was new for me," said Herrera, who along with Morquecho has  quit smoking. "Most of my friends just like to sit around."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Become Close Friends  </P> <P> The students say they have become close friends after enduring many miles of  workouts together. Along with Trapani, teachers Eric Spears and Annette Small  have also been training with the students and plan to complete the marathon.  The teachers do not collect extra pay for the time spent training.  </P> <P> "This is part of our commitment to teaching," Trapani said.  </P> <P> Jodah Jensen, a 17-year-old junior from Northridge, said he considered quitting  about two months ago while experiencing some personal troubles. He said he was  not getting any sympathy from the group at the time.  </P> <P> "I felt that they didn't care about me," Jensen said. "But they were pushing me  hard for a reason."  </P> <P> Jensen said he has since learned that "I can endure physically and mentally. .  . . Every mile is hard, but it's well worth it."  </P></p>

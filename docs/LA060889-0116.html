			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA IN TURMOIL;  </P> <P> CHINESE LEADERS REPORTEDLY FLED TO MILITARY BASE  </P> <P> On Monday morning, a convoy of 40 limousines and minibuses, guarded by six  tanks and several more armored personnel carriers, rolled out of the Chinese  leadership compound at Zhongnanhai in central Beijing and headed west.  </P> <P> Some sketchy details about this convoy were provided in a Communist  Party-affiliated newspaper here, and brief footage of the convoy appeared on  Chinese television.  </P> <P> Western analysts here now believe that convoy contained virtually the entire  top political leadership of China, vacating the complex adjacent to the  Forbidden City from which the Communist Party has ruled the nation for nearly  40 years.  </P> <P> "We think they went to a military compound in the Western Hills outside  Beijing," said one source here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zhao's 'Limousine Arrest'  </P> <P> Included in the entourage, this source said, were ousted Communist Party  General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili, a member of the Standing Committee  of the Politburo -- both men brought along under guard in what might be called  "limousine arrest," a traveling version of house arrest. The two are believed  to have lost their posts because they opposed the imposition of martial law  last month.  </P> <P> Chinese President Yang Shangkun and other hard-line leaders took Zhao and Hu  along "in order to keep an eye on them," said one analyst.  </P> <P> None of these leaders has been seen in public for as long as two weeks and it  is unknown which of them is ascendant at the moment. In Washington, President  Bush's spokesman said Wednesday that the Administration remains confused about  "the structure of the government . . . or who is making decisions."  </P> <P> "We don't know where they are. We simply surmise that based on historical  patterns that there have been some of the leaders which have gone to other  locations within the city or to the outskirts of the city," press secretary  Marlin Fitzwater said. He said U.S. officials have been unable to make contact  with any "any of the top leaders."  </P> <P> Thus there is considerable speculation now about what is going on inside that  compound in the Western Hills.  </P> <P> (Western analysts insist they do not know exactly where this military command  post is located.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who Is Boss Now?  </P> <P> Who is the most influential official in the compound? Is Chinese leader Deng  Xiaoping, unseen since May 16, there? And what persons or units are providing  security for the leaders during this political crisis?  </P> <P> The question of security -- that is, of who provides protection for the leaders  -- has proved important in recent Chinese history.  </P> <P> After the death of Mao Tse-tung, a special palace guard unit called the "8341"  unit helped arrange the arrest of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and other radical  leaders allied with her.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, there were reports that Premier Li Peng had been shot and  wounded in the thigh by one of his guards. Western diplomats here have not  confirmed that the incident took place. But the report serves as a reminder  that the outcome of the current power struggle could well hinge on who has the  best and the most loyal security protection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Current Palace Guard  </P> <P> The current version of the old 8341 unit, the palace guard for China's  leadership, is called the Central Guard Unit. It is run by the General Office  of the Communist Party Central Committee.  </P> <P> From 1984 until recently, this unit was run by an official named Wen Jiabao, a  protege of Zhao. Like his mentor, Wen is now believed to be under some form of  house arrest.  </P> <P> This guard unit is also supervised by an older, semi-retired military figure  named Yang Dezhong, who was for years the personal bodyguard to Chinese Premier  Chou En-lai.  </P> <P> "If Deng Xiaoping is alive and in that complex, he'd go with the old and  reliable Yang Dezhong for his security," said a Western analyst.  </P> <P> No one in the West knows for certain if Deng is alive -- and if he is, no one  is too sure whether he is serving as commander, captive or medical patient  inside the Western Hills compound. For a decade, Deng has been called China's  "paramount leader," and the common assumption has been that as long as he is  healthy, he will be the dominant figure in Chinese political life.  </P> <P> But that assumption is now being called into question. Another Western analyst  interviewed here said he believes that within the command post in the Western  Hills, President Yang is now a more powerful figure than Deng.  </P> <P> "Yang has more direct control over the military than Deng Xiao-ping does," he  said. "Over the past two years, Deng has had to drop his own two proteges  (Communist Party General Secretaries Hu Yaobang and Zhao). That's a sign of  weakness. In a power struggle, Yang's got more influence in the inner circle  than Deng."  </P> <P> However, another government analyst here disputed that theory. He said he  believes Deng is healthy and gave the military orders that led to the massacre  last weekend in Beijing -- but that Deng has stayed out of sight so that he can  avoid being blamed for what happened.  </P> <P> Western analysts here are also trying to figure out whether there is some  centralized command post for the military units that have been seeking to take  control of Beijing away from those units that invaded the city last weekend.  </P> <P> One possibility is that each of these units is operating independently -- each  unit motivated by revulsion over the massacre and over the harm it has done to  the image of the People's Liberation Army.  </P> <P> The other possibility is that there is a broader factional struggle within the  Chinese military, and that those units seeking to recapture Beijing are working  closely together.  </P></p>

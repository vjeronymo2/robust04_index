			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: A share of Brazilian equity action - Life is becoming easier for foreign investors BRAZIL'S macroeconomic changes are moving slowly by the standards of some of its Latin American neighbours - but capital market reforms, particularly for equities, are accelerating fast. Foreign institutional investors can trade directly in Brazilian equities; a 25 per cent tax on stock profits has been eliminated for foreigners; institutional investors from abroad but registered in Brazil can trade currency and gold futures, and invest up to 25 per cent of their portfolios in domestic fixed-rate debt. As a result, from a modest base, foreign portfolio investment in Brazil has begun to rocket. During the first four months of 1992, some Dollars 2.3bn entered the country, with Dollars 1.4bn going into equities. This compares with Dollars 1.5bn in the whole of last year, of which Dollars 760m was in shares. In 1990, overall foreign investment was Dollars 688m, and in 1989, Dollars 333m. The road to reform can be traced to Mr Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho, who in 1990 assumed the top spot at the CVM, Brazil's regulatory watchdog. He moved the commission out of its old headquarters in the financial backwater of Rio de Janeiro and relocated in Brasilia, the political capital. He then outlined proposals for change in a January 1991 blueprint. Mr Mattos Filho implemented many of the plan's 50 points before leaving the CVM. Mr Roberto Faldini replaced him in March. Coincidentally or not, the last significant changes in capital market regulations were announced in January, when the definition of foreign institutions permitted to invest in Brazil was widened. Mr Faldini seems more cautious than his predecessor. A former official of Abrasca, the association of public companies, and a director of Metal Leve, the car parts manufacturer, he is considered more sympathetic to company owners and management. On taking office at the CVM, he voiced his opposition to Mr Mattos Filho's proposal to force Brazilian companies to issue higher proportions of voting stock. Owners of Brazilian companies generally prefer to offer non-voting shares, leaving stockholders few options for influencing policy. This is encouraged by a requirement that Brazilian pension funds hold at least 25 per cent of their portfolios in equities, providing a captive market for non-voting stock in the narrow Brazilian bourses. Many companies argue they do not offer voting shares because the secondary market is too small. Mr Mattos Filho, however, believed liquidity was lacking precisely because companies offer so few voting shares. Mr Faldini is opposed to plans, laid down by the former CVM chief, aimed at breaking this vicious circle through regulatory reform. Mr Alvaro A. Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa), which accounts for 70 per cent of the country's trading, advocates eliminating the pension fund investment floor but letting companies determine the mix of their offerings. Since the terrain was opened to foreign institutions last year, reformers have been calling for an invitation to individuals from abroad. Mr Vidigal favours the immediate introduction of these investors. Mr Faldini publicly defends a gradual approach, first including citizens from Brazil's partners in the proposed Mercosur common market: Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. That move is expected later this year, when the final touches are put on an agreement that will give investors from Mercosur countries equal footing with native citizens in each of the four countries. First, however, negotiators must resolve the issue of capital gains tax, which exists in Brazil, for instance, but not in Argentina. Meanwhile, Bovespa wants to guarantee greater openness. One step has been to adopt electronic trading. It is also strengthening self-regulation. In May, its administrative council upheld an earlier ruling to punish directors and market operators of Banco Garantia, who were charged with selling stocks at below market price to bring down the exchange's Ibovespa index. The offending shares were primarily those of Telebras, the state-controlled telecommunications company that accounts for over half of trading. The individuals were suspended for one year and fined Dollars 25,000 each, the maximum by law. Bovespa is now investigating Garantia (as opposed to individual directors and employees), and may bring charges against the bank.</p>

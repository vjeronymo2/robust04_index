			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Arts: Boris Godunov FOR an opera rich in panoply and set in a variety of imposing locations, Boris Godunov is seen in concert form with surprising regularity. Musorgsky's historical narrative must be thought sufficiently strong to stand alone with minimal sets and costumes to provide further adornment. Although Boris Godunov itself has visited the Proms before, the performance of the opera on Tuesday marked the first appearance in any Promenade season of Opera North. The company was bringing the production which has served it well over the last three years. For the purposes of this outing it had two specific advantages: this was the shorter 1869 version (easier on the feet of those standing) and it was being sung in English. The latter is a point of some importance. The details of Russian history, often expounded in lengthy passages of narration, need to be grasped easily by listeners new to the opera. A decent proportion of the sung words was audible at this performance and the rest could be filled in by looking at the complete text printed in the programme. It also sounded as though the conductor, Paul Daniel, was striving to allow his singers to be heard. He galvanised the English Northern Philharmonia into more dynamic and accurate playing than it had managed for the company's recent Tchaikovsky double-bill. The Chorus of Opera North made a strong impact. The cast was much the same as for the revival earlier this year. Matthew Best was a dignified Pimen, wanting a degree of verbal bite. Ann Howard and Brian Bannatyne-Scott did not overplay the humour of the scene between the Hostess and Varlaam. Melanie Armitstead and Ann Taylor-Morley, as Xenia and Feodor, were the two refreshing women's voices. Graeme Broadbent and Stephen Gadd were notable among the basses. Above all, however, dominated the Boris of John Tomlinson, a voice and a personality several times larger than any other on stage. After a summer at Bayreuth, he arrived with Wotan still in his soul and it was sometimes difficult to reconcile his outgoing and physically active Boris Godunov with that of tradition. Every word, though, so forcefully declaimed, must have carried to the furthest reaches of the Albert Hall.</p>

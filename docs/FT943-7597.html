			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Stockholm The nerve-wracked Swedish equities market is looking for some good news right now and the string of interim reports due out this week from a number of the country's leading industrial and financial groups might just supply it, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The big day is Tuesday when two of the country's leading banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Handelsbanken, the insurer, Trygg-Hansa, and the pulp and paper group, Stora are all due to report. Wednesday will bring results from two of the big cyclicals, engineering groups Atlas Copco and Sandvik, while Thursday features Investor, the key Wallenberg holding company, Trelleborg and Bilspedition. Hopes of strong profit gains have been fuelled by better than expected figures from Electrolux, Ericsson and SKF over the last two weeks. In the case of the banks, the main influence is likely to be reduced loan losses, while the cyclicals will be favoured by krona weakness, cost-cutting and rising demand in key US and European markets. Unibank in London expects Sandvik profits to rise to SKr1.33bn from almost SKr1bn a year ago. For Atlas Copco it is looking for a rise from SKr661m to SKr805m.</p>

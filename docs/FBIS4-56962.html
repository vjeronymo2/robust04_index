			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Marcio Moreira Alves] </F>   [Text] The idea that only leftists demand the right to be  heard about the programs and actions of their parties is a  wrongful prejudice that is shared by journalists, intellectuals,  and some politicians. Centrist and rightist politicians and  voters also want to be heard.    The PFL [Liberal Front Party], whose leadership has been  pressured because of the alliance with the PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party], could find an exhaust valve in Deputy  Gustavo Krause's "Principles and Main Targets for a Program of  Government," a study that the deputy has coordinated for several  months. The document, which was drawn up by a commission made  up of Daniel Dantas, Mauro Salles, Nilton Molina, Paulo Guedes,  Roberto Procopio Lima Netto, and Thomaz Pompeu Magalhaes, was  submitted to Jorge Bornhausen on 4 May, and will be released to  the 3,000 party executive boards, 18,000 party councilmen, and  to the deputies, senators, and governors in order to listen to  suggestions and to introduce changes into it.    The 83-page PFL document is as thick as the 112-page PT  [Workers Party] report. The main difference is that it attaches  much more importance to economic and financial problems, and  that it proposes more concrete solutions, especially in those  fields. This emphasis has been caused, first, by the fact that  the economy has preponderance over politics in a country that  has been plunged into chronic superinflation; and second by the  number of economists on the commission, beginning with the  coordinator.    The study identifies five phases of the crisis: the  political  crisis, with the operational difficulties of democracy and  inefficiency of the state; the currency devaluation crisis; the  misery and starvation crisis; the ethical crisis; and the crisis  of confidence. The study says: "Even though these are  different phases, the fate is the same: an impasse. The  political sector has proven to be extraordinarily incapable of  creating a minimum consensus in the search for a solution to the  impasse. Everyone has opposed everyone in this search."    The principles of a political alliance and of a joint  program  of government "should be: A) the reform of the political system;  B) the reform of the state, which should be politically strong  and managerially efficient; and C) a development pattern based  on: the reorganization of the economy and the expansion of the  market, which should become increasingly global, competitive,  and specialized; on the promotion of human rights; on the  preservation of natural resources; and on increasingly  expeditious and creative managerial standards, both for the  public and private sectors."    Economic stability is a precondition that the PFL sets  before  anything else. The study says that "no income-generating  sector, including the state, is powerful enough to curb  inflation. The fight against inflation is fought by the entire  nation."    In the operational part -- in addition to the well-known  position favoring an independent, strong Central Bank that  preserves the currency; an end to monopolies; an end to  discrimination against foreign capital; privatization with  strong participation by social funds; and a smaller state with  the implementation of a new federal pact -- the program raises  an innovative proposal: the reconciliation of the debts and  credits that the Union and the state and municipal governments  are demanding from one another, in a Credit Clearing Chamber  that might operate through National Social Treasury Bonds  (Osins). Such bonds could also be used as currency for  privatizations. The document also makes interesting proposals  for fiscal reform, advocating an end to the revenue allocations  provided for by the Constitution. The proposal to adopt a  single 10 percent income tax proves that the document is  ideologically based on Reaganism.    There are also encouraging positions on public security,  science and technology, and regional policies for the Amazonas  and for the northeastern region. Summarizing, the PFL study is  serious and is worth reading. It is actually a pioneering,  innovative effort for conservative parties, a document that  seeks to compete with the ideas of the leftist parties.</p>

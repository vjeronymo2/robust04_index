			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Collaborate to innovate and survive - Alan Cane examines why electronics companies are joining forces to share costs Electronics companies that were once bitter enemies are forming unprecedented alliances aimed at cutting research and development costs and improving effectiveness. Collaboration has become the name of the game at an international level, as companies find themselves squeezed between spiralling research costs and revenues forced down by recession and price competition. For example, Unisys, one of the largest US computer manufacturers, has abandoned its own semiconductor operations, saving itself Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) a year. The advanced chips for its new large machines will be made by International Business Machines, the world's largest computer company and still a fierce competitor. Unisys, marginally profitable after several troubled years, spent Pounds 348m on R&amp;D last year, well down on the Pounds 505m spent in 1990 but still equivalent to 6.65 per cent of sales. Many large companies in the electrical and electronics sector have found it necessary to cut R&amp;D spending in line with reduced revenues. Siemens of Germany took premier place in the sector last year with spending of almost Pounds 3bn, a decline of 8 per cent on the year before. IBM, formerly the world's R&amp;D powerhouse, was a whisker behind, but cut its spending by 13 per cent. Bill O'Riordan of Imperial College, London, who is also head of research and advanced technology for ICL, the UK-based computer company owned by Fujitsu of Japan, says there are two reasons why collaboration has taken on a new importance. First, no single company can afford the costs of building and managing systems of today's complexity without help. ICL benefited greatly throughout the 1980s from an alliance with Fujitsu which gave it privileged access to the Japanese company's semiconductor technology. It was an appreciation, however, of the funding level necessary to stay at the forefront of innovation that led the company to takeover by Fujitsu. Today, ICL, at Pounds 208m a year, spends substantially more than any other non-listed UK company; ICL's R&amp;D represents 7.96 per cent of its Pounds 2.6bn sales. Second, unless companies collaborate, their ability to respond quickly to change deteriorates. The value of the experience built up by their scientists and engineers withers in a rapidly changing environment unless they are exposed to fresh stimuli. O'Riordan says: 'When you collaborate, you innovate; when you don't, you invent.' For many companies, collaboration has become an essential feature of corporate restructuring. Amdahl, a US company which pioneered plug-compatible mainframe computers, functionally identical to IBM's, seemed in trouble a year ago. Sales were stagnant as customers turned away from mainframes towards apparently more cost-effective networked computer systems. R&amp;D spending was, at Pounds 226m, 19.9 per cent of sales, the second highest in the global ranking. Amdahl's business plan called for the company to move down from sales of Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 1.5bn. R&amp;D spending had to be brought in line. The solution was a technology collaboration with Fujitsu, owner of a minority stake in the company. Amdahl abandoned ECL (emitter-coupled logic) circuitry, which is fast but pricey, in favour of Fujitsu's cheaper CMOS (complementary metal oxide silicon) alternative. Fujitsu now designs and builds the computer; Amdahl builds in the features which enable the machines to compete directly with IBM. The leading semiconductor companies, Intel and Motorola of the US, have pushed up R&amp;D spending by 24 per cent and 16 per cent respectively as they battle to maintain their chip designs as industry standards. Even they are finding collaboration with other companies essential. Motorola, Apple and IBM are working together on a design called 'Power PC'. Last week, Intel and Hewlett-Packard announced they were working together on a new generation of microprocessor chips which could dictate the direction of computer technology into the next century. Software companies are, for the moment, an exception to the trend. SAP of Germany spends 25 per cent of its Pounds 428m revenues in developing R3, a highly successful accounting package. Quality Software Products of the UK has spent Pounds 16m over the past few years in developing a competitive product. Bigger software companies often buy smaller ones to add an attractive software product to their catalogue without incurring R&amp;D costs. The pressure to spend on R&amp;D has in no way diminished. In the future most companies will be able to survive and advance only by sharing costs.</p>

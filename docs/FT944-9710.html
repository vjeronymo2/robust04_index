			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Lottery sells 7m tickets in 12 hours: Major tells launch party all will benefit and country will be richer Camelot, operator of the UK's first national lottery for more than 150 years, said it was 'absolutely delighted' with sales of more than 7m tickets in the 12 hours since yesterday's 7am launch. The total was nearly three times as much as its estimates for the first day. In some places, people queued outside retail outlets selling the Pounds 1 tickets. More than 10,000 outlets had on-line computer terminals, and a further 2,500 are expected to be connected before Christmas. The lottery hopes to raise Pounds 32bn over seven years, with an estimated Pounds 9bn going to causes such as charities and the arts. It was launched in London in a marquee in the grounds of the Tower with the help of a string octet, a group of Morris dancers and a fireworks display. Mr John Major, the prime minister, pronounced it 'a people's lottery'. He said everyone would benefit. At exactly 7am Sir Ron Dearing, the Camelot chairman, pushed a wooden plunger, apparently to initiate ticket sales around the country. The plunger was precisely that - and not connected to anything. Early morning Guests in the grounds of the Tower - there were also official launches in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh - could not, however, buy tickets. As a result Mr Major had to be driven to a newsagent in central London, where he spent Pounds 5 and promised to donate the more than Pounds 2m jackpot to Mencap, the mental health charity, if he won. Mr Stephen Dorrell, secretary for the national heritage, the department responsible for the National Lottery, also promised to buy tickets and to give any winnings to Age Concern. Mr Dorrell warned he had no early plans to change the rules on how money for the arts - one of the five beneficiaries - from the proceeds of the lottery should be used. Mr Chris Smith, shadow heritage spokesman, welcomed the launch but wanted to see the benefits felt in every community. The main questioning voice came from the Salvation Army, which suggested that punters should give all their lottery stake to charity rather than the 28p in the Pounds 1 that the lottery will give to good causes.</p>

			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Telephone companies may offer personal numbering THE DAYS of not daring to leave the office for fear of missing a vital telephone call are nearing an end. British telephone users may soon be able to have their calls follow them wherever they go. Several companies, including Mercury Communications and BT, are considering launching services as early as next year which would give subscribers lifelong 'personal' numbers, on which they could be called at any telephone in the country. 'Rather than have a telephone number associated with a place, it would be associated with a person,' says Mr Jeff Maynard, development director at Mercury, which hopes to launch its service next summer. Mercury plans shortly to test-market the service, for which it would charge a small initial fee and a subscription of a few pounds a month. Users would not necessarily have to subscribe to Mercury's telephone network. A user of a personal numbering service would tell a central computer where and when to direct calls by dialling a special code into any available telephone. The services could be instructed in advance to transmit calls regularly to a particular telephone at a specified time of day. Callers trying to reach someone with a personal number would be told automatically whether they had to make a long-distance call to do so. Mr Maynard expects the market for personal numbering services to exceed Pounds 100m in five years. At present, Mercury plans to offer its service only in Britain but is exploring the possibility of delivering calls internationally. Backers of personal numbering say it would have advantages over mobile telephones, because calls could be received on telephones of any kind. The planned services would also be much more flexible and easier to use than existing computerised call-forwarding services. Mr Stanley White of IIISS, a US group which plans to offer a personal numbering service in Britain, says it will be 'the darling of the 1990s, as cellular telephony was in the 1980s'. US telephone companies recently began offering personal numbering on a limited basis.</p>

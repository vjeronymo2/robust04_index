			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chon Yo-ok] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection team, led by its team chief (Hainamen), arrived in  Beijing this morning and received visas from the North Korean  Embassy there. The inspection team will enter Pyongyang via  North Korea's Koryo airliner tomorrow afternoon.    The IAEA inspection team chief, (Hainamen), said at the  airport that, according to the IAEA policy, he could not make  any comments other than the fact that the inspection team will  enter Pyongyang tomorrow.    As soon as it arrives in Pyongyang tomorrow, the inspection  team will see if nuclear fuel rods at a 5-megawatt reactor in  Yongbyon have really been replaced.    The IAEA policy is that if it determines that North Korea  replaced the nuclear fuel rods after removing the seals of the  reactor, the IAEA will regard [kyujong] this as a serious  incident [simgakhan satae] and will cancel its entire inspection  plan and pull out the inspection team earlier than scheduled.  However, if North Korea has only begun preparations for the  nuclear fuel rods replacement, such as the suspension of  operating reactors, the IAEA team will carry out its inspection  activities, such as additional inspections of the radiochemical  laboratory, the replacement of surveillance equipment, and the  checking of the seals at major nuclear facilities until 24 May.    Thomas McLarty, chief of staff at the White House, said on  15  May that the United States would watch the IAEA team's  inspections of North Korea before deciding whether to increase  its pressure on North Korea in connection with the North Korean  nuclear issue.    Noting that the fuel rods have regularly been replaced,  McLarty said: The United States, however, is definitely  concerned about their replacement by North Korea. The United  States will consider all possible choices, including sanctions,  if the IAEA inspection team's report on its activities in North  Korea is different from what is expected.    Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate warned that the beginning of the  replacement of nuclear fuel rods without the presence of the  IAEA is a serious act that may lead to economic sanctions by the  United Nations.    U.S. Senate leaders of the Democratic and Republican Parties  said the above in an interview with NBC TV and stressed that the  United States should prepare countermeasures against the North  Korean action in cooperation with the ROK, Japan, and China.</p>

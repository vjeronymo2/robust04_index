			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Staff at LWT to collect shares Staff at London Weekend Television, the ITV company in the throes of a hostile takeover bid from Granada, are finally to benefit from a management share scheme that made millionaires out of the top group of LWT executives. All 640 full-time and contract staff employed on November 1 1991 and still with the company, will be told tomorrow that they will collectively receive shares worth around Pounds 2m. Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of LWT and a multi-millionaire as a result of the management share scheme, wrote to the other 52 beneficiaries in September seeking voluntary contributions. The members of the scheme, who collectively put up Pounds 3m to buy management shares as a result of a restructuring, were asked to donate between 5p and 14p a share, depending on the size of their stakes. It is believed that all members of LWT management agreed to make a donation for the rest of the staff. There have been delays created by negotiations with the Inland Revenue over tax arrangements covering the share issue. At one stage it was being suggested that staff would be taxed on the shares, although the managers had already paid tax. It has now been agreed that the staff will not have to pay tax on the shares as long as they hold them for five years. The deal could end a feeling of bitterness at the ITV company between staff and management. More than 550 staff have signed a petition calling for a proportion of the profits from the share scheme to go to them.</p>

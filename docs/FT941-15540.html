			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Confederation of British Industry Meanwhile, Elizabeth Haywood, the European affairs manager at the WDA, is moving to the Confederation of British Industry in Wales to succeed Ian Kelsall, its long-serving director. At the WDA she has a team of 12 people developing and co-ordinating the agency's policy on Europe and has been responsible for programmes to increase the involvement of small and medium-sized Welsh enterprises in European markets, especially by encouraging strategic alliances. Before joining the WDA four years ago, Haywood, who is 38, worked for the European parliament in Luxembourg and Brussels and gained a doctorate in French politics at University College, Swansea. She will take up the post in March. 'My aim is to ensure a strong identity for Welsh business and industry, and I plan to further the already strong links between CBI Wales and the WDA to achieve this,' she says. Kelsall decided to retire last autumn after 28 years as director, during which time he became one of the best-known businessmen in Wales. On a half-time basis, he has since become director of Merthyr Tydfil Business Centre, which has been set up to encourage the town's economic growth.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Degussa tumbles 26% to DM121m at nine months DEGUSSA, the metals, chemicals and drugs group, yesterday warned there would be no recovery in group profits in the last quarter of the financial year as it reported a fall in pre-tax earnings by 26 per cent to DM121m (Dollars 70.3m) in the nine months to the end of June. The group blamed the decline on reforms in the German healthcare sector, combined with the effects of the worldwide recession on its metals businesses. It said there was no way it would be able to catch up the shortfall in profits in the rest of the financial year. In contrast to the fall in earnings, group sales rose strongly, up by 13 per cent to DM10.7bn. But Degussa said that the bulk of the increase was due to sharply increased precious metals trading and sales together with changes in the companies included in the consolidated figures. Stripping out these factors, turnover would have been just below the level of the comparable period last year, Degussa said. Losses in the metals division - which accounts for just over one-third of group turnover excluding precious metals - were 'markedly higher' than last year, Degussa said, reflecting weak demand amid the recessionary environment. There was a slight improvement in profits from the chemicals division.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Argentina announced  today its "firm intention" to place at the disposal of the  United Nations some 1,500 troops for rapid deployment in  peace-keeping operations.    During a meeting at the United Nations, alternate Argentine  Ambassador Raul Alberto Ricardes said a final decision on this  issue will be made soon. Negotiations are being conducted at  the United Nations by which member countries specify the number  of units and elements they might contribute to the United  Nations, at short notice, for peace-keeping operations.    Ricardes said the conditions, methods, and other specific  points on Argentina's participation will be negotiated between  his country and the United Nations.    Ricardes said the units that might be placed at the disposal  of the United Nations include two infantry battalions, a  logistics battalion, an engineering company, a communications  company, 40 military observers, and 35 civil police.    The materiel would include a missile-launching corvette,  four  patrol boats, a transport plane for troops and cargo, a  transport ship, a field hospital, a mobile air traffic control  unit, and two terminals for airfields.    Argentine diplomatic sources noted that the ceiling for the  Argentine participation in peace operations is 1,500 troops, in  addition to the 150 troops recently offered for participation in  Bosnia at the request of the United Nations to strengthen the  ceasefire agreements in Sarajevo and central Bosnia.    Ricardes' statement today apparently refers to these 1,500  troops.    Those responsible for UN peace-keeping operations announced  today that 18 of the 184 UN member countries have so far offered  a total of 28,000 people for the rapid deployment system. They  hope for additional commitments in the near future that might  increase this total to about 70,000 people.</p>

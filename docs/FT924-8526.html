			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 2: In search of full protection - Katharine Campbell on new products to help manage risks MOST corporate treasurers are by now at least broadly familiar with the staple building blocks of treasury risk management - with forward rate agreements (FRAs), swaps, caps, and foreign currency options. So the trick for banks is to devise new combinations of the standard instruments - approaching the elusive goal of the ideal risk management product which is, roughly, full insurance protection, at no cost, with maximum flexibility. Below are some of the new products available: FRA's are now widely accepted as one of the most powerful ways of hedging interest rate risk, so it is no surprise that bankers have experimented with a similar concept applied to the world of foreign exchange. Generically known as Safes, or synthetic agreements for forward foreign exchange, these products were first applied in the interbank market some years ago to reduce settlement risk. Treasurers are just getting interested, says Perry Power, director and head of risk management at Mitsubishi Finance International in London. There are two types of Safe, the exchange rate agreement or ERA which protects the purchaser against a change in the forward foreign exchange spread; and the forward exchange agreement (FXA) which protects against a change in the spot rate as well as the forward spread. Suppose the pound is trading at Dollars 1.55 against the dollar for spot delivery two days from now, and a treasurer wishing to buy pounds for dollars in a month's time is quoted a spread of 65 points, meaning a rate of Dollars 1.5435. It may not fit into his strategy to do an outright forward - he may, for instance, as is often the case with FRA users, be hedging a contingent liability. With an ERA or FXA he can protect the spread without exchanging principle, and without using up bank credit lines and so on. With an ERA he could lock into a spread, say for three months starting in one month's time. Traditionally that same effect could only be achieved by a so-called forward forward, buying pounds for dollars in four months' time and selling pounds for dollars in three months. An FXA is more like an outright forward. The treasurer gets or gives the difference between the FXA rate agreed for, say, an outright 3-month rate in one month's time and the actual 3-month rate in a month. So if the 3-month outright is at Dollars 1.55, and the 3-month FXA was Dollars 1.5435, he gets or gives the difference, depending on whether he is a buyer or seller of pounds. Differential or 'diff' swaps are designed to exploit the inverse relationship between two yield curves - until recently for instance between the negatively sloped D-Mark curve and the positive US dollar interest rate curve. A US dollar-based investor could index the coupon of his dollar floating rate note to D-Mark rates. So instead of receiving, say, a coupon paying low dollar Libor rates, he can still receive dollars, but calculated instead using the D-Mark Libor rate - 8.5 per cent, say, minus a spread of 2 per cent. The investor hence incurs no foreign exchange risk, but pays a premium, included within the 2 per cent deducted. The FRN issuer, meanwhile, will not want to incur a D-Mark liability, and so enters into a swap with an intermediary bank - which assumes the foreign exchange rate risk on the differential between US dollar Libor and D-Mark Libor. Another play on the yield curve: the investor hopes US dollar rates will not rise as quickly as the yield curve suggests or that D-Marks will not fall as quickly. If everything happens as the yield curve predicts, he gets no net saving - and runs the risk that rates move higher in the US and lower in Germany than expected, market moves that would actually cost him money. A newish twist among an array of interest rate products is the swap where Libor is set in arrears, a product well suited to an environment with a steeply positive yield curve, as has been seen in the US. It is used by borrowers of fixed rate dollars who are swapping back into floating rate for a portion of the term to take advantage of short-term rates. The libor-in-arrears swap gives added exposure to variable rates. Normally interest payments on a swap, as on other instruments, are set in advance and paid in arrears, whereas in this case they are set in arrears as well. So, if the interest period falls quarterly, and interest is due between March 31 and June 30, a treasurer would make the three-monthly payment on June 30 at the Libor rate on that day rather than at Libor on March 31. This essentially appeals to those who do not believe that rates will rise over the term of the swap as much as the slope of the yield curve implies. 'It is not a structure for the timid,' explains John Walker of J C Rathbone Associates, the financial risk consultants. Another product J C Rathbone, among others, has been developing recently is the combination of a fixed rate swap with a floor. This is a risk-averse structure that will work with either a positive or negative yield curve. Essentially, it offers borrowers the chance to fix a rate but also to benefit if rates stay the same or fall. The procedure, in a recent example, would be for the treasurer to fix his 5-year dollar borrowing cost at 6.05 per cent, and simultaneously to buy a floor 50 basis points below that, at 5.5 per cent. This would cost 3.14 per cent, says Mr Walker. Current 6-month Libor is 3.56 per cent, so he is giving up 2.5 per cent immediately, but, because of the floor, he will achieve a reduced cost of borrowing if rates fail to rise up to 5.5 per cent. For instance, if in the first six months rates stay the same, he will receive an immediate rebate of 1.99 per cent; if at the next payment date interest rates have edged up to 4 per cent, he still receives 1.55 per cent back. Another dimension of flexibility is that, if he wants to avoid paying the premium upfront, he may negotiate with the provider of the instrument to pay the premium over time, thus increasing the fixed rate by 0.72 per cent. The danger is rates rise more quickly than implied by the shape of the yield curve, in which case the borrower will not recover his premium - though he remains protected by the swap which will have increased in value. With a negative yield curve, the process is similar, except the treasurer gets his benefit not immediately, but when rates start to go down.</p>

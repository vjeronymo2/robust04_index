			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "Growing Readiness for Bundeswehr </F> Missions"]    [Text] Readiness is growing within the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] to allow the participation of the  Bundeswehr in UN peacekeeping missions in the former Yugoslavia.  At the same time, leading CDU politicians have been trying to  put the statement by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that German ground  troops must not be deployed in the Balkans because of the  historical burden in proper perspective. One day before the  arrival of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in Bonn, the  CDU presidium discussed the war in Bosnia. Considerations  apparently also played a role that the debate on the  participation in UN operations might lead to a clear  delimitation vis-a-vis the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] during the election campaign.    After CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group  leader  and deputy chairman Karl-Heinz Hornhues, Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe, too, seems to have adopted a different attitude on this  issue. In an interview that was distributed at the Defense  Ministry, Ruehe stated: "If a peace plan were to be  implemented, we should be able to go to the limits of our  capacities."    In the past, Ruehe spoke only vaguely about a commitment on  the fringes of the conflict zone -- at NATO airports in Italy,  for example, and by establishing a field hospital in Croatia.  He now only excluded participation in operations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the interview, he stated: "German  soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina would rather be part of the  problem and not of a solution because their commitment and their  work would not be supported by all parties to the conflict.  Thus, the deployment of German soldiers there is not  realistic." Defense Ministry officials have pointed out that,  with his statements, Ruehe has increased the range of  possibilities. It would be conceivable for pioneers to  participate in the reconstruction of the country and for  transport troops to resupply the UN troop. However, German  soldiers will not monitor peace with weapons in their hands as  long as the Constitutional Court does not pass a ruling on the  deployment of Bundeswehr soldiers outside the NATO area.    Bundestag group chairman Schaeuble stressed two weeks ago  during a visit to Washington that, "basically," the government  will participate in a UN mission to safeguard peace in the  Balkans. NATO cannot sustain a peacekeeping mission if Germany  refuses to participate, he added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Before leaving Pale, Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy  of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, assessed the latest events:    [Begin recording] [Churkin] This was a very good night. I  slept very well. As of this morning, the Russian battalion is  in its place. Things are stable and under control. I am  pleased and I am going back to Zagreb. I will return to  Sarajevo, however, if anything should go wrong.    I had a long conversation yesterday with some Bosnian Serb  leaders and generals. They assured me that they are going to  completely fulfill the promises they gave us on the basis of our  agreement. Our troops are stable, the weapons have been  removed, and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is in control.  There are good relations between the Serbs and UNPROFOR, as well  as among us, UNPROFOR, and the Bosnian Serbs. This is a secure  network and everything is heading towards peace.    [Unidentified correspondent] What do you think of the Muslim  wish to nevertheless bomb the Serbs?    [Churkin] If they are disappointed by the lack of strikes  and that there are no more battles, then they have some  psychological problems. We are talking about wrong things here.  However, honestly speaking, I do not think that this mood  prevails in the Muslim government. I think that they do realize  what this city and country mean and that they need more peace  than war. I think that they can be satisfied that arrangements  initiated by the Serbo- Muslim agreement were implemented at the  request of Russia and have not led to confrontation but to  cooperation.

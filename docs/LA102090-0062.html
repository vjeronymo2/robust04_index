			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONDS TARGET CHILDREN, VETS AND HOUSING  </P> <P> Three bond issues on the Nov. 6 ballot would raise a total of $755 million to  benefit a broad spectrum of low- and middle-income Californians -- except for a  share that could also reach the pockets of those in higher brackets.  </P> <P> Passage of Proposition 145 would authorize the sale of $325 million in bonds to  finance homes for first-time buyers and to provide housing assistance for a  range of low-income groups.  </P> <P> Proposition 142 is a $400-million home- and farm-loan measure designed to aid  military veterans.  </P> <P> Proposition 151 would raise $30 million to build and expand child-care centers.  </P> <P> Worked out in negotiations between Gov. George Deukmejian and Democratic  legislative leaders during the final days of the 1990 session, Proposition 145  would provide $200 million in low-interest loans and interest-rate subsidies to  5,000 potential first-time home-buyers who meet certain requirements.  </P> <P> The remaining $125 million would go for a variety of programs designed to  assist low-income renters, farm workers, homeless people and those living in  buildings that might become unsafe during a major earthquake.  </P> <P> "Proposition 145 will make home ownership a reality for many families again,"  Deukmejian said. "Housing prices in California have doubled in the past 10  years. Many families, even with both parents working, are unable to become  homeowners.  </P> <P> "Only one in five California families can afford to buy a median-priced home.  </P> <P> This is discouraging to young families just starting out and to employers who  want to bring more jobs to our state."  </P> <P> Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno carried the enabling legislation.  The housing aid measure is also supported by Senate President Pro Tem David A.  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and the California Assn. of Realtors.  </P> <P> Primary opposition to the housing plan comes from Assemblyman Dan Hauser  (D-Arcata), the chairman of the Assembly Committee on Housing and Community  Development.  </P> <P> It is a "yuppie" ballot measure, Hauser charged, because people who earn more  than $80,000 a year could qualify for low-interest home loans in some counties  where home prices are very high. Eligibility is tied to median prices, so a  family of three living in San Mateo or Marin counties and earning $83,000, for  example, could qualify, according to the state formula.  </P> <P> Hauser said it would establish "a policy which benefits the wealthiest  residents of our state while providing virtually no additional housing for  those in greatest need."  </P> <P> Proposition 142, the $400-million Cal-Vet home- and farm-loan bond issue, is  aimed at helping 3,200 additional military veterans obtain loans. It would  continue a state program that has been in operation for almost 70 years.  </P> <P> The Cal-Vet program is self-supporting because the interest and principal on  the bonds are paid back with money received from monthly loan payments made by  veterans.  </P> <P> Strongly backed by various veterans groups, the legislation to place the bond  issue on the ballot cleared both houses of the Legislature without dissent.  </P> <P> It was carried by Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield). B. T. Collins, the state's  Vietnam War Memorial commissioner, was a leading supporter.  </P> <P> Rogers described the Cal-Vet program as "an appropriate expression of our  appreciation for the sacrifices U.S. veterans of foreign wars make in defense  of our state and nation."  </P> <P> Ted Brown, chairman of the Los Angeles central committee of the Libertarian  Party, opposed the measure, warning that a recession could cause many veterans  to default on their Cal-Vet loans and leave taxpayers to pay off the bad debts.  </P> <P> Proposition 151, the $30-million bond issue to start up or expand child-care  centers for the children of working parents, is the outgrowth of a bill  sponsored by Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Senate  Committee on Health and Human Services.  </P> <P> The money would be used to fund low-interest loans to acquire, renovate,  construct or purchase equipment for child-care centers.  </P> <P> A nine-member Child Care Facilities Authority would administer the loan  program. Preference would be given to applicants who serve areas with  significant unmet child-care needs.  </P> <P> "Although many parents would prefer to stay at home and care for their  children," Watson said, "economic necessity is forcing them into the labor  force.  </P> <P> "This means that some form of child care is needed for a good part of the day.  For young people in their critical formative years, the type of care they  receive can affect their development and achievement later in life."  </P> <P> Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of the Select Committee on Children  and Youth, and Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills), chairwoman of the Select  Committee on Infant Child Care and Development, also support Proposition 151.  </P> <P> Opponents include John Vernon, former chairman of the Libertarian Party, who  argued that tax credits or tax deductions for working parents would be a better  way of providing assistance for child-care purposes.  </P> <P> Deukmejian recently urged California voters to choose carefully when voting on  the more than one dozen proposed bond issues that will appear on the general  election ballot.  </P> <P> "Without fiscal restraint by the voters this fall," he said, "we could find  ourselves too deeply in debt and jeopardize the fiscal health we have worked so  hard to achieve."  </P></p>

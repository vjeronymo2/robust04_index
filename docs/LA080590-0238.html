It's hot and  it fades my furniture. What can I put on the windows in the summer that won't  block the view or the winter sun for solar heating?  </P> <P> ANSWER: In addition to increasing your air-conditioning bills and making you  uncomfortable, the sun can do significant fading damage to your furniture and  drapes. The bright sun also often creates enough glare to force you to close  blinds and turn on a light. This wastes more electricity.  </P> <P> There are several window sun-control options to satisfy your needs. Standard  see-through tinted window film is the most effective method to block the sun's  heat and fading rays. Unfortunately, it is on year-round and it blocks some of  the passive solar heating rays in the winter.  </P> <P> There is a new type of durable non-reflective vinyl sun-control window film  that can be removed each winter and reused the following summer. Therefore, it  won't block the beneficial winter sun's heat. It is very easy to apply and  remove yourself each year.  </P> <P> This lightly-tinted vinyl film holds itself in place on the window by its  natural static electrical charge. This same type of clear film is used as  labels on new TVs and other surfaces. It feels like it is glued to the glass,  but it just peels off cleanly.  </P> <P> You can apply this new reusable static-cling vinyl film either on the inside or  outside surface of the window glass. To apply it, first clean the window  surface. While it is damp, lay the piece of vinyl on it and smooth it out. It  slides easily while it's still damp underneath.  </P> <P> The tinted vinyl film blocks more than 50% of the sun's heat and glare and 95%  of the ultraviolet fading rays. There is also an opaque (dark brown or ivory)  type of static-cling film that is perforated. This blocks much of the sun's  heat and fading rays, yet you can still see outdoors. It's like looking through  a coarse window screen.  </P> <P> Another option is the use of one of the indoor see-through tinted film  pull-down window shades. These use a tough, heavy-gauge polyester window film.  You can get either spring-loaded or rope-operated shades.  </P> <P> These are available in many colors and varying degrees of reflectivity. They  are very attractive and give you total control over the amount of light and  heat you want to enter your room. The polyester material blocks 95% of the  sun's fading rays and the various tints offer varying degrees of solar heat  rejection.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 286 listing the suppliers of  the new do-it-yourself static-cling window films and pull-down tinted film  shades, performance specifications, and a small sample piece of each to try on  your windows. Please include $1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope.

When I caulked my previous house, I had a problem keeping  an even bead. Any suggestions?  </P> <P> A: A good-looking and effective caulking job is an art and requires practice.  Select an easy-to-use caulk material, like siliconized acrylic latex, which  cleans up with water. True silicon is excellent caulk, but more difficult to  work with. Another option is getting a cordless electronically-controlled  caulking gun at a builders' supply outlet. You should be able to lay a perfect  bead of caulk with one on your first try.  </P> <P> Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may  be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,  Ohio 45244.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Take a rich sprinkling of serious chefs . . .  -Nicholas Lander gathers some tips from top professionals for entertaining throughout the year Melvyn Popham and Dennis Hawkes, Pophams, Winkleigh, EX19 8HQ, Devon. Tel: 0837-83767. Our kitchen is open-plan, tiny, 9ft x 9ft, and was neatly described by one customer as coffin-sized. To work in it requires organisation, careful preparation and staying within one's limits. It is like cooking for friends at home but we do it six days a week. Dishes need to be creative but simple to prepare with, crucially, little fuss at the moment of serving. And, because our customers are watching our every move, creativity moves both ways. One dish that a customer said he would be trying for himself came about after the delivery of some local smoked bacon. It consists of a plate of salad leaves topped with sliced avocado and finished with the hot, crisped smoked bacon and a walnut oil dressing. Easy and effective. Our much-praised dish with duck breasts came from a customer's suggestion. Thanks to her, we now marinate them overnight in honey, soy sauce, ginger and sherry vinegar and then bake them in the oven. The small size of the restaurant does at least allow us to overhear the compliments. One individual vegetable dish I prepare involves layers of aubergine and tomato baked in the oven. The aubergines are sliced, salted and left overnight so that the bitter juices run out. Pat them dry, fry in hot oil and pat dry again. Then in an individual gratin dish, layer the aubergine and slices of raw, skinned tomato, finishing with the tomato. Grate black pepper and add a drizzle of double cream, Parmesan, breadcrumbs and a nob of butter. Bake in a hot oven for 20 to 25 minutes. After one customer had devoured every morsel he asked for the recipe, only to be told by his wife: 'But you don't like aubergines]''</p>

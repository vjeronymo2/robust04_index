			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our team has just returned from a news conference  held after the first meeting of the government. Here is the  first news from the meeting held today.    [Begin recording] [Prime Minister Josef Moravcik] The  government, which had taken the oath, met for its first regular  meeting tonight. The agenda included organizational issues. We  clarified the nature and the style of our work and cooperation,  as well as the schedule of our meetings. Besides these general  matters, the government deemed it necessary to make one  personnel change. It has recalled the president of the police  corps as of today and appointed Mr. Lastovka to this post, as of  today. The government considered this inevitable in order to  ensure that the police corps operate with full efficiency.    Apart from that, the government has adopted a statement that  will be read now by Mr. Simko.    [Simko] Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present to you the  statement of the Slovak Government.    The government of the broad coalition is a government formed  by several political parties, by people with different political  opinions. It emerged due to the need to overcome the  authoritarian way of ruling and to create conditions for  respect, tolerance, and cooperation among citizens.    The government is resolved to do everything in its power for  the good of the Slovak Republic. The government honors and  respects the principles of a law-governed state and will act in  line with them. The government will focus on a realistic  transformation policy that will create conditions for economic  stability.    The citizens' conditions of life and certainties will become  the government's priority. The government identifies itself  with the appeal made by President Michal Kovac for civic,  political, and national reconciliation. In this spirit, the  government intends to take part in creating conditions for the  citizens of the Slovak Republic to freely express their will in  early elections.    [Moravcik] The selection of state secretaries will be  carried  out in a similar way to the formation of the government--that  is, it will be the subject of coalition talks, and a similar key  will be used. Individual ministers should have their say in the  matter. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] China has denied a report suggesting that capital  punishment would be restored in Hong Kong after 1997. The  report in The Sunday Times quoted Zhang Rongshun, from the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, saying that the  future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government might  restore the death penalty. But Zhang said: "I did not say  there was such a possibility. I just said it was for the SAR  government to decide whether there was a need to restore the  death penalty in Hong Kong."    Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the local office of  the New China News Agency (Xinhua), agreed. "What he said means  that it is a decision to be made by the SAR instead of the  central government," Zhang Junsheng said. "Of course, it cannot  be said that the death penalty can never be used in Hong Kong."    Simon Li, a retired high court judge and leader of the legal  sub- group of the Preliminary Working Committee, said the death  penalty was not discussed by the PWC. "I personally don't think  it really matters whether or not Hong Kong should have capital  punishment after 1997," Li said yesterday.</p>

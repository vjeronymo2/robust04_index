			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / China jails star village official CHINA has jailed one of its best-known businessmen for 20 years for obstructing justice. Mr Yu Zuomin, former chairman of the board of an entrepreneurial village near Tianjin, had been held up as a national model of the new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs until he fell from grace. Mr Yu's sentence coincided with the passing of death sentences in Beijing against four officials, including one from the Bank of China, for corruption. China launched a drive this week to root out corrupt officials whose activities had been fuelled by the economic boom. The execution of several hapless individuals had been expected. Chinese describe this process as 'killing a chicken to frighten a monkey,' meaning that lesser officials are being dealt with severely as an example to more senior cadres. Corruption has become a pervasive force in China, reaching high into the ruling Communist party. Top officials and their families are engaged in business activities from dealing in cars to speculating in real estate. Mr Yu of Daqiu village near Tianjin, which had become something of a national entrepreneurial shrine, was found guilty of harbouring criminals, obstructing justice, bribery, unlawful detention and unlawful control of people. Mr Yu's arrest followed the beating to death of a worker in his village, and his attempts to cover up the crime. His sentencing is certain to capture attention throughout China since Mr Yu had been hailed by party bosses for his money-making skills and elevated to the national parliament. He coined the slogan: 'Only by looking money-ward can you look forward.' Beijing yesterday threatened to reconsider its commitment to a key international missile control agreement in a furious protest against a US ban on the export of high-technology items to China. Mr Stapleton Roy, the US ambassador in Beijing, was summoned to the foreign ministry, to be told of Chinese anger over the US action which followed accusations that Beijing was exporting missile components to Pakistan. Mr Liu Huaqiu, China's vice foreign minister, told Mr Roy the US sanctions 'puts Sino-US relations in serious jeopardy'.</p>

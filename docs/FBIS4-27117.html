			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Guideline' for Military Intervention" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a  by-lined article Sunday says the "UN Peacekeeping Operation  [PKO] Guideline" published by the United States some time ago is  aimed at going ahead with military intervention and establishing  domination and control over the world by using the United  Nations, while evading losses in a more cunning way.    The article reads in part:    The U.S. president retracted the call for founding a "UN  standing Army" which he had made during his election campaign,  and worked out and published a new policy on the "UN PKO". This  is connected with their interests and also with the repeated  failures of U.S. Forces- led "UN peacekeeping operations" in  recent years.    The publication of the new "UN PKO Guideline" by the United  States does never mean that it has ruled out military  intervention against other countries or abandoned its ambition  to establish domination over the world.    The U.S. representative at the United Nations told a  congressional hearing that the basic purpose of the new policy  was to make the UN refrain from operations unacceptable to the  United States and help in such operations as the United States  wants. By such operations as the United States wants he meant  military operations needed for executing their aggressive  foreign policies.    That is why the United States is committed to keeping its  forces as part of UN Forces only in case its forces  participating in the "UN peacekeeping operations" shall not be  placed under the command of foreign forces but exercise  operational command like at the time of the Gulf war or the  Korean war.    The U.S. decision to drastically cut back its contribution  to  UN peacekeeping spendings was motivated, in the final analysis,  by its scheme to bring the UN under its control through  increased financial pressure and commit military aggression and  intervention against other countries by abusing the name of the  UN, if necessary.    The United States must discard the wild ambition to dominate  and control other countries with recourse to its policy of  "strength".</p>

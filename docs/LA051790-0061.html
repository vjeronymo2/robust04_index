			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Cannes Controversy: "Hidden Agenda," a film set in strife-torn Northern  Ireland, sparked a furor at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, as  journalists from right-wing British newspapers accused director Ken Loach of  pro-Republican bias. The film centers on a group of civil rights campaigners  investigating human rights abuses in Northern Ireland. The post-premiere news  conference turned into a wrangling match as the British reporters stood up to  denounce the movie and were shouted down by colleagues. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

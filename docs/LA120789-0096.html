			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> COMMITTEE ASKED TO DRAFT PUBLIC OFFICIALS' ETHICS CODE  </P> <P> The City Council has directed one of its committees to draw up a proposed  ethics code for public officials in Long Beach.  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote, the council Tuesday asked its Legislative Committee to  review ethics codes adopted by other cities or governmental agencies, as well  as a recent Los Angeles report written in the wake of controversies over Los  Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings.  </P> <P> The code could include standards governing travel, the acceptance of gifts and  outside fees and might also toughen financial disclosure requirements.  </P> <P> Mayor Ernie Kell raised the issue of a city ethics code, saying that while  state law covers campaign activities, there are few laws regulating officials  once they are elected or appointed.  </P></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Easier bullion price hits S African golds Gold and mining-related stocks closed slightly lower as the bullion price softened, while industrials were flat, with a stronger financial rand tending to cap activity. Industrials also continued to be depressed by fears about government spending and an upward trend in inflation, in spite of reassuring comments by President Nelson Mandela. Golds eased 9 to 2,288, the overall index lost 11 at 5,833 and industrials dipped 4 to 6,535. De Beers fell R1.50 to R103 and Anglos receded R1 to R259. Midwits went against the easier trend in golds, moving forward R1.50 to R15, while Loraine shed 50 cents to R21.25 and Kloof dipped 25 cents to R67. Randcoal ended unchanged at R24 after news that it would merge with Trans-Natal.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SAY ANGER AT VANDALISM LED TO SHOOTING;  </P> <P> OXNARD: THE SUSPECT, UPSET ABOUT REPEATED ATTACKS ON HIS PROPERTY, ALLEGEDLY  KILLED A BOY, 17, RIDING BY IN A PICKUP TRUCK.  </P> <P> For months, Angel Orona Rodriguez Sr. tolerated rocks and bottles being thrown  at his Geronimo Drive house by gang members, Oxnard police and neighbors say.  On Saturday, police said, his anger erupted into a fatal fury.  </P> <P> Rodriguez is accused of killing a 17-year-old boy in apparent retaliation for  the unrelenting attacks on his home provoked by his son's gang affiliation,  police said.  </P> <P> Detective Sgt. Denny Phillips said Sunday that a flurry of beer bottles hurled  at his house just before midnight Friday prompted Rodriguez to grab his  .22-caliber rifle and fire upon a passing pickup truck that he thought was  responsible.  </P> <P> "I honestly think he didn't know he hit anybody, that's the tragedy of the  whole thing," Phillips said. "He was the kind of father who stayed up waiting  for his children to come home."  </P> <P> Richard Louis Rodriguez Jr., unrelated to the suspect, was riding in the back  of the pickup being driven by his father. He was struck twice in the chest at  12:01 a.m. Saturday and died half an hour later at St. John's Regional Medical  Center.  </P> <P> Conrad Tories, who was in the bed of the pickup with the victim, said he heard  what sounded like three firecrackers, followed by moans from his friend.  </P> <P> "He said he was shot, and I thought he was just playing with me," said Tories,  18, of Oxnard. "Then he started crying and bent over in pain. I felt the blood  on his shirt when I hugged him. When he started bleeding from his nose and  mouth, I knew he was shot bad."  </P> <P> Police said they believe that Tories, the victim, his father Richard Rodriguez  Sr. and his uncle Steven Rayas were driving through the Lemonwood neighborhood  near the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Channel Islands Boulevard  seeking revenge for an earlier act of vandalism outside the victim's home in  the Loma Flats neighborhood of Oxnard.  </P> <P> Oxnard police said Saturday's homicide appeared to have been sparked not only  by tension between rival gangs in Lemonwood and Loma Flats, but also by a  broken teen-age romance between the suspect's daughter and a Loma Flats gang  member. Police said some of the vandalism may have been directed at the  daughter.  </P> <P> According to police and witnesses, the chain of events leading to the shooting  death began shortly after 11 p.m. Friday on East Birch Street, where the victim  lived with his grandmother.  </P> <P> Richard Rodriguez Jr., a high school dropout who frequently worked as a deejay,  was in the back yard when a bottle thrown over the rear fence shattered on his  arm, cutting his forearm and finger, said Wilma Ruelas, his grandmother.  </P> <P> After throwing the bottle, his assailants smashed the windshield and broke the  antenna on a 1991 white pickup truck owned by the victim's father, Tories said.  </P> <P> The combined affronts led the victim and the three others to set out in the  white pickup to find the assailants, who were in a red pickup truck, said  Rayas.  </P> <P> Angel Rodriguez Sr., meanwhile, had endured numerous acts of vandalism on his  home for months when the latest round occurred late Friday night, said Raul  Acosta, who shares the house with the suspect.  </P> <P> Acosta said unknown gang members slashed four tires and broke a window on his  1976 Pontiac Ventura, an act Acosta said was directed at the suspect's son,  Angel Rodriguez Jr., a 19-year-old member of the Lemonwood Chiques.  </P> <P> Acosta said Angel Rodriguez Sr. became particularly upset after hearing that  someone had hurled a rock at his son in the front yard while young children  were playing around him.  </P> <P> According to police, occupants of a passing vehicle threw several beer bottles  at the house next door to the suspect's house. Police said the suspect knew  upon hearing the shattering glass that the assailants had missed his house and  would be coming around again.  </P> <P> Police said they did not know who was responsible for the vandalism at either  of the houses, but their investigation was continuing.  </P> <P> The suspect, who is being held in Ventura County Jail on $250,000 bail,  allegedly lay in wait and fired upon the pickup as it passed his house. One  bullet struck the tailgate, and the other two entered the victim's chest, one  going first through his arm, Phillips said.  </P> <P> "The suspect said he was not aiming at anybody, and by all appearances, he  wasn't," said Phillips. He said that the shots were fired at such close range  that Angel Rodriguez Sr. could easily have killed both boys, and that there  were still bullets left in the gun.  </P> <P> The suspect was arrested at his home around 8 a.m. Saturday and surrendered the  rifle he allegedly used, Phillips said.  </P></p>

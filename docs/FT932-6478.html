			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Tireless fighter for miners: Obituary: Lord Gormley JOE GORMLEY, president of the National Union of Mineworkers from 1971 to 1982, died yesterday aged 75 after a long illness. During his stormy years as leader, Lord Gormley led the miners through two national coal strikes in the early 1970s, taking them back to the top of the manual wage earnings table after a long period of decline. But he always rejected the views of his union's vocal left-wing. He was prepared to fight for his members' interests but had no wish to confront governments. A hard-headed pragmatist, Gormley practised the art of negotiating. His canny bargaining skills were coupled with a sureness of touch in reading the often uncertain mood of the coalfields. But Gormley could not always deliver his promises, as Conservative prime minister Edward Heath learned to his cost in 1973, when he sought a deal to prevent a miners' strike. Gormley was unable to sell the deal to his executive, contributing to Heath's downfall in the February 1974 general election, fought partly on the issue of union power. Under Gormley the NUM became one of Britain's most powerful unions. In alliance with Coal Board chairman Sir Derek Ezra he lobbied successfully for massive investment and subsidies after the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973 seemed to restore coal's lost power as a strategic fuel. In his later presidential years Gormley found it difficult to contain his union's resurgent left. Born in Lancashire, Gormley left school at 14 and spent his next 28 years down the pit. He was elected to the NUM executive in 1957, and became north-west area secretary four years later. In 1971 he defeated the Scottish miners leader Mick McGahey to become NUM president.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Cardiff Bay barrage approved THE scheme to build a Pounds 152m barrage across Cardiff Bay was finally approved by Parliament last night. Ministers cut short the last stage of debate on legislation with a 'guillotine' timetable after five years' scrutiny. The barrage is designed to rejuvenate the derelict docklands area of south Cardiff. It has been opposed on environmental grounds because it would flood a 165-hectare freshwater wetland bird habitat. Work is expected to start soon. The scheme will control the tidal waters of the Taff and Ely estuaries, creating a 500-acre lake. Supporters claim it will attract investment of about Pounds 2.5bn and create 30,000 jobs.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOWDOWN LOOMS OVER WESTWOOD HOTEL PLAN  </P> <P> With the dust barely settled on a hard-fought development plan for Westwood  Village, homeowners who had agreed to allow construction of a hotel in the  village say they have found a glitch in the plan that could kill the project.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and the city's highest-ranking  zoning official insist that the discovery does not jeopardize the proposed  350-room hotel. The disagreement sets the stage for a showdown among the  homeowners, Los Angeles city officials, hotel developers and the owners of a  former UCLA dormitory that is at the center of the controversy.  </P> <P> This week, three Westwood homeowner groups hired an attorney and formally  appealed a ruling by Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard that allows the  hotel on a Glendon Avenue parking lot near Bullock's department store. The  homeowners argue that the hotel should not be permitted because it would  violate a cap on hotel construction included in the village plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under Zoning Code  </P> <P> The plan, adopted by the City Council in December after four years of  sometimes-stormy community debate, limits the number of hotel rooms in Westwood  Village to 350. Although it generally had been assumed that the provision would  allow Nansay Corp. to build a hotel on its Glendon Avenue parking lot, the  homeowner groups now say the room limit has already been surpassed.  </P> <P> They argue that a former student dormitory on Tiverton Avenue that was  converted in the early 1970s into a residential hotel for the elderly should be  considered a hotel under the village plan. The owners of the building, known as  Westwood Horizons, agree and have joined the homeowners in challenging  Eberhard's ruling.  </P> <P> "They absolutely consider them selves a hotel," said Kenneth B. Bley, an  attorney representing owner David Roberts. "It is now, and always has been, a  hotel under the zoning code."  </P> <P> There are conflicting claims as to the size of Westwood Horizons. The  building's 1966 certificate of occupancy lists 492 guest rooms, a number the  homeowners say is accurate. Eberhard's report states there are 294 rooms, and  Bley said the 13-story building has about 300 rooms. An aide to Yaroslavsky  said the number is closer to 390.  </P> <P> Regardless of its size, city officials say they never intended to include  Westwood Horizons in the calculation of allowable hotel rooms. Yaroslavsky said  "everybody knew" that the 350-room limit, which had been reduced from 700  during negotiations, was calculated with the Nansay project in mind.  </P> <P> "In the years we spent on the plan, no issue dominated the discussion as much  as the hotel site," Yaroslavsky said. "It was the most contentious issue of the  bunch. Now, for anyone to come forward and say we didn't mean a new hotel is  disingenuous."  </P> <P> Ryan Snyder, a member of the Westwood Design Review Board that must approve the  Nansay project, agreed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Question Mark'  </P> <P> "My understanding of the plan was that it would allow 350 new hotel rooms," he  said. "Even though I may not like the hotel, it was what we all agreed to."  </P> <P> Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, one of the groups challenging the  new hotel, said the homeowners did not raise the issue of Westwood Horizons  during negotiations on the plan because they did not know that it was a hotel.  Various city records, including the 1966 certificate of occupancy, classify the  building as a hotel.  </P> <P> "We had a question mark in our mind, and we let it ride," Lake said. "We can't  do everything. We are volunteers in this community and there are a lot of fires  to put out."  </P> <P> Lake agreed that the proposed Glendon Avenue hotel development "was one of the  sore points" in negotiations over the village plan, and she acknowledged that  she and other homeowners eventually supported a compromise allowing 350 rooms.  But the discovery that Westwood Horizons is a hotel has changed the picture,  she said.  </P> <P> "We said we would support a hotel, but if there is a hotel already, we are left  in a predicament," Lake said. "We don't want to be overdeveloped with hotels.  Our concern has always been not to get swamped. We felt the city was permitting  way too many rooms."  </P> <P> If Westwood Horizons were to convert to a conventional hotel operation, Lake  said the homeowners fear that the village could end up with two hotels with  double the allowable 350 rooms. Bley said Roberts has no plans to convert the  building "in the immediate future," but Yaroslavsky said Roberts told him that  he would like to convert it "at some point in the future."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ruling Allows Project  </P> <P> After being alerted to the dispute by Yaroslavksy, Eberhard issued a five-page  opinion on July 7 that argues the room limit in the village plan, known  officially as the Westwood Village Specific Plan, applies only to new hotel  construction. Eberhard's ruling allows the Nansay project to proceed and it  prohibits Roberts from converting Westwood Horizons without special city  approval.  </P> <P> Attorneys for both the homeowners and Roberts dispute Eberhard's authority to  rule in the matter, saying the city attorney's office should review it. But it  is Eberhard's opinion that they have formally appealed to the city's Board of  Zoning Appeals, which is expected to schedule a hearing in the next two months.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Eberhard said that Westwood Horizons is an "apartment hotel"  that rents on a monthly rather than daily basis and does not pay the so-called  bed tax that conventional hotels pay. If the building were converted, he said,  the new operation would be subject to city laws governing hotels, including one  that prohibits them within 500 feet of residential neighborhoods without  special approval.  </P> <P> Maria Hummer, an attorney for Nansay, said the Santa Monica firm is moving  ahead with the hotel project, which also includes retail shops and  condominiums. This week, the company began showing community leaders a model of  the tiered complex, which will cover four acres and extend as high as eight  stories.  </P> <P> "Nansay has spent a tremendous amount of time and effort to date in its  internal design competition to arrive at a project that is sensitive and  complies with both the letter and the spirit of the Westwood Village Specific  Plan," Hummer said.  </P> <P> Lake cautioned that it is too early to predict whether Nansay or Roberts will  prevail.  </P> <P> "When we supported the plan, we were supporting a first-class hotel in the  village," Lake said. "The question now is whose hotel is it going to be. This  is really a judgment call -- a legal question."  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Milan bourse sets date for launch of futures contract The Milan stock exchange intends to launch its long-awaited futures contract, based on the new MIB 30 index of leading Italian shares, on November 28. On the same day, the exchange will extend the close of share trading from 4pm to 5pm, and end the distinction between shares which can be traded only in the afternoon session and larger stocks which can be bought and sold throughout the day. Mr Ettore Fumagalli, a member of the exchange council, confirmed the launch date on Friday, although he added that it could be postponed until December 2, if necessary. 'I think we will have a flat phase at the beginning (of futures trading), with a limited number of contracts traded, but then I think we will have a real take-off,' he told journalists. The Milan stock exchange has been working hard to compete with other European exchanges, and to attract Italy's small investors, who have traditionally preferred to place their savings in government bonds. Today, the exchange is launching a regulated system for trading in small quantities of shares, which fall below the threshold for on-screen trading. 'To be complete, this has to be a market which allows everyone to operate,' Mr Fumagalli said. The new futures contract - known as the FIB 30 - will be promoted with a series of international road-shows, beginning in London at the end of this month, and will be traded between 9.30am and 5.30pm once the market is launched. The MIB 30 index, based on the 30 largest and most widely traded stocks, is to be compiled by the exchange from today.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (12): Credit comes to judgment - County court case registrations One of the most effective ways of preventing bad debts from arising is to carry out a thorough check on credit status before granting credit. Information on the credit status of another company is readily available from the main credit reference agencies such as CCN, Infolink, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Equifax. The service provided by these agencies has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years, as the information required by businesses trying to assess the risk of lending money, or supplying goods and services, has changed in response to the changing economic environment. Clients are much more specific about the information they want and what they are prepared to pay for, says David Coates, sales and marketing director of CCN Business Information. Five years ago most users bought full status reports on companies. These days, Mr Coates adds, the agencies have to break down reports and sell the information in different forms. The problem of judging the credit status of the 3m-4m businesses in the UK - mainly partnerships and sole traders - on which no audited financial information is available, has proved particularly acute during the recession. It prompted CCN to develop a database for unlimited companies and to begin adapting empirical scoring techniques long used in the consumer credit field, to help evaluate the credit worthiness of businesses. In addition to looking at an industry sector as a whole, the payment record of a company and any available financial data, an essential element in building up a picture of the creditworthiness of small businesses has been the development of a directors' database. CCN's directors' database contains information on 6m directors and company secretaries in the UK. With so many business failures during the recession, this information has proved invaluable in helping banks and other companies decide whether to lend or extend credit to start up businesses where often the only information available on which to make an assessment of the credit risk relates to its directors. Most agencies now offer their services through on line computer links. This has made checking credit information quick and simple. Furthermore, it has helped to reduce the cost to the end user. CCN charges Pounds 25 for a traditional full status report, but for users such as banks (which purchase the information in bulk) the cost of a full status report is discounted to under Pounds 10. A directors' database search costs Pounds 6 and a search of CCN's unlimited database costs Pounds 10. Prices charged by other agencies are comparable. The credit reference agencies' sources of information are Companies House, newspapers and, quite often with small companies, the company itself. But probably their most important source of information is county court judgments. Since 1990 most county court judgments are immediately entered on the County Court Register as soon as made by a court. Entries can be cancelled when a judgment is set aside or reversed or paid in full within one month. Judgments paid in full after one month can be noted on the register as 'satisfied'. All entries are automatically removed after six years. Since 1986 the register has been run by Registry Trust Ltd, a non-profit-making company limited by guarantee. The Register is divided into consumer judgments and commercial judgments against businesses. According to Malcolm Hurlston, chairman of Registry Trust, users of the register fall into one of four categories: Purchasers of the consumer file; Purchasers of the commercial file; Purchasers of the file by county or by court; Individual inquiries from the public, either by post or in person. When the Trust took over the running of the register from the Lord Chancellor's Department, it had a database of 6m pieces of paper and the cost of searching a judgment was 40p each. Through computerisation and the establishment of a dual system for keying-in the data, which has ensured the accuracy of the information stored, the cost of accessing the register has come down substantially. Purchasers of the whole file now pay the equivalent of 16p for each judgment. Purchasers of the file of commercial judgments - which make up 18.4 per cent of the whole file - pay Pounds 64,000 per annum. The commercial file is currently purchased by eight agencies. Purchasers of all the consumer judgments pay Pounds 250,000 per annum. There are currently four purchasers of the consumer file. The number purchasing the information by locality or by court has fallen from a low base of 30 in 1986 to just 8 in 1994. They pay 40p per judgment. Public inquiries cost Pounds 4.50 by post and Pounds 4 in person. There were 54,155 public inquiries in 1993, a fall of 11 per cent on the 1992 figure and some way below the peak of almost 70,000 in 1990. In 1993 there were just over 2m judgments registered or noted as satisfied on the register, a fall of 12 per cent on the 1992 figure - which in turn was a fall on the peak figure of 2.4m in 1991. The number of commercial judgments registered but unsatisfied on the register in 1993 was 332,265, 16 per cent down on the peak 1992 figure of almost 400,000. Information on High Court judgments is not available at present but would be useful if it could be accurately collated, says Aidan Breen, operations director of CCN Business Information. Gathering accurate information on High Court judgments is difficult, says Malcolm Hurlston, partly because of the large number of cases which settle out of court with the terms of settlement remaining secret. At best, any body (such as the Trust) which now undertook to record High Court judgments could only offer an incomplete picture. This would be of doubtful value to the main users of such information: the credit reference agencies. Irrespective of whether or not accurate information on High Court judgments becomes available in the short term, the scope of the information available to credit reference agencies, and to others who need assistance in deciding whether or not to lend or supply goods and services, is increasing all the time. The register, for example, has been extended in recent years to cover courts in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Jersey. The agencies have begun to collect information on individual and company schemes of voluntary arrangement (CCN will offer an information service on company voluntary arrangements from March 17). And through organisations such as Internet, a network of the main credit bureaux in Europe, information on the credit status of European companies can now be easily accessed by exporters anywhere within the EU. All these developments help to make pre-credit checking an increasingly attractive and effective way of preventing the problem of bad debts.</p>

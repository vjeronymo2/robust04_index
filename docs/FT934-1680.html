			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Observer: Unhealthy worries Who's going to replace National Health Service boss Sir Duncan Nichol? The question is causing increasing alarm in some quarters of the health service now that KPMG partner Sheila Masters, a non-executive member of the NHS policy board, has reached the final interview stage yesterday. Insiders are terrified that health secretary Virginia Bottomley will impose Masters on them again. A former NHS finance director, she frightened civil servants by her tough demands when crafting the 1991 NHS reforms. Alan Langlands, the current deputy chief executive, would be much more preferable to NHS types. He would continue Sir Duncan's capable management style while allowing ministers to hog the limelight. Alternatively, Ken Jarrold, chief executive of Wessex regional health authority, who is credited with having restored its reputation, would be another safe bet.</p>

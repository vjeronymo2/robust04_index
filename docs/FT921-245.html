			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York: Debt shakes a Dollars 20bn edifice to its foundations - The Reichmann brothers built a property empire on drive and debts. But O&amp;Y, headed by chief executive Paul Reichmann, faces a financial crisis. Next week, its bankers meet to bail it out MR PEN KENT is inured to companies running into difficulties. As a director of the Bank of England, his job is to prevent a corporate drama becoming a banking crisis. But even he was shocked by what he was told a fortnight ago by Mr John Crow, the governor of the Bank of Canada. Olympia &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer with debts in excess of Dollars 20bn, had run out of cash. The company, Mr Kent was told, had two immediate problems: Institutional investors were balking at being asked to repurchase hundreds of millions of dollars in commercial paper or debt securities, as they fell due for redemption; Cash was urgently required for the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project, Europe's biggest office development, in London's Docklands. A Pounds 40m first payment was due at the end of March for the Jubilee Line underground railway link extension to central London, crucial to the whole project. 'Until then, O&amp;Y's had funded all these cash demands from rents and assets sales,' says one banker. 'But it was having trouble selling assets. O&amp;Y was caught in a vice.' The alarm bells had started ringing on February 13, when Canada's Dominion Bond Rating Service downgraded the rating on one of O&amp;Y's commercial paper offerings. The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada were afraid of the consequences if O&amp;Y defaulted on any significant payments. If banks had panicked, the stability of the financial system would have been at risk, said to one regulator. The cash crisis was the result of years of relentless expansion by Toronto's secretive Reichmann brothers, who had transformed a small tile-importer into a property empire spanning two continents and financed largely by debt. It also underlined what many bankers seemed to have ignored: that the three brothers, famous for sealing their deals with a handshake, were not immune to the ups and downs of the marketplace. By the time the two central bankers spoke, O&amp;Y's debt had reached a staggering USDollars 20bn. The sheer scale of the debt came as a shock to O&amp;Y's banks. The fact that the Reichmanns kept their cards so close to their chests, once part of their mystique and perceived strength, may yet return to haunt the many banks and other institutions who lent them money. 'All the people who bought O&amp;Y's bonds and lent money did so without knowing the full story,' says one Toronto real estate adviser. Banks lent for specific property developments and were not given information on how much had been borrowed elsewhere for other projects. In the week following the first alert, Mr Kent and Mr Crow kept in constant touch. They also alerted the Federal Reserve in New York. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic were coralled into providing more than Pounds 100m in emergency loans to meet bills falling due in the coming month. Separate bank facilities were arranged to redeem the commercial paper. The bankers finally came to a startling realisation. A fundamental restructuring of O&amp;Y's debt was needed to tide the company over the deep property recession in the UK and north America. The reorganisation of O&amp;Y's borrowings will be the biggest corporate restructuring, dwarfing even last year's reorganisation of the Dollars 8bn of debt in Mr Rupert Murdoch's media business, News Corporation. As one banker puts it: 'O&amp;Y's debts are not so different from those of a medium-sized country.' The banks are bracing themselves for further shocks when they are supplied with detailed financial information on O&amp;Y once the restructuring process gathers pace. Some of them now suspect that O&amp;Y's assets, ravaged by the slump in property values, might not cover these debts. Three senior bankers estimated this weekend that O&amp;Y's mortgages in New York alone could be up to Dollars 1bn more than the current market value of the properties on which these debts are secured. The biggest surprise, according to one financier, may stem from O&amp;Y's off-balance sheet liabilities, in the form of interest and currency swaps - two sophisticated but risky financial tools much used by the Reichmanns. One O&amp;Y adviser notes that currency hedges are used in one of the mortgages for New York's four-building World Financial Centre complex. The principal was denominated in Japanese yen and the interest is payable in US dollars. That particular swap generated profits for O&amp;Y, but others are thought to have been less successful. Another undisclosed but significant form of O&amp;Y's borrowing is the so-called 'vendor take-back mortgage', under which those who sold properties to O&amp;Y provided loans to finance the deals. Bankers are hopeful that none of them will face financial difficulties. Mr Allan Taylor, chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, one of the company's biggest creditors, said last week: 'The O&amp;Y problem is not life threatening.' One executive with close knowledge of O&amp;Y's 100 or so banks, says that the biggest lender to O&amp;Y is the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with Dollars 1bn in debt. Royal Bank of Canada has Dollars 750m; Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Dollars 700m; Citicorp, the US bank, around Dollars 500m; Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, Dollars 350m; Bank of Nova Scotia, Dollars 300m; Bank of Montreal, Dollars 300m; and Chemical Bank, also of the US, Dollars 200m. For years, the Reichmanns commanded a level of respect - almost awe - bestowed on few other leading business figures. But how were they able to borrow so much when they shared so little information with outsiders? One US banker says: 'You have to understand that in the past, Paul Reichmann (O&amp;Y's chief executive) just had to make a telephone call. The man had a magic touch. He is very modest, very talented and a relentless salesman.' The Reichmanns' unobtrusive manner, their sobriety and their legendary reputation for always keeping their word - not to mention their spectacular early successes - fostered a rock-like confidence both in north America and abroad. Any deal with O&amp;Y was thought to be a safe deal. Living secluded lives in Toronto's Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood, near the intersection of Bathurst Street and Glencairn Avenue, Albert, Paul and Ralph Reichmann have never been social climbers, nor are they part of Canada's business mainstream. Their enormous houses are within walking distance of each other, although even the most senior executives of their non-real estate companies are rarely, if ever, invited to their homes. The scale of the Reichmanns' ambitions since they arrived in Canada from Tangiers in the late 1950s is, literally, monumental. Besides the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project in east London, - O&amp;Y owns about 40 office buildings in north America, with 40m sq feet of space. It is the largest office landlord in New York and Toronto. O&amp;Y also has a 35 per cent stake in Calgary-based Trizec Corp, north America's largest publicly-listed real estate company, and a minority interest in Catellus Development of San Francisco, a leading west coast housing developer. Trizec alone owns more than 300 buildings. Their 113m sq ft of rentable space would fill 25 complexes the size of the existing buildings at Canary Wharf. Trizec also owns 25 per cent of The Rouse Company, one of the US's biggest shopping-mall developers. The Reichmanns also have vast interests outside the real estate industry. The business from which it all started, Olympia Tile, has grown into one of north America's biggest tile and carpet distributors. The brothers own 82 per cent of Abitibi-Price, one of the world's biggest newsprint producers, and are the largest single shareholders in Santa Fe Energy, a US oil and gas producer, and Santa Fe Pacific, whose businesses range from railways to gold mining. The privacy of their home lives is replicated by an obsessive secrecy in their business dealings. O&amp;Y is a privately-held family company. The board consists of the three Reichmann brothers, their wives and four trusted lieutenants recruited from O&amp;Y's auditors more than 20 years ago. The driving force is Paul Reichmann. One businessman who knows him well says: 'Paul is a very likeable man - but behind the friendly exterior, there is a really tough man. He has enormous inner drive and commitment. He has no time for small talk.' Paul Reichmann insists on being consulted on the smallest decisions affecting parts of the business empire. One executive who worked with him says: 'Paul knew every detail. He knew the type of marble, the mouldings on the iron work, the design of the hall and shops, the terms of every funding structure. He really understands the nitty-gritty'. But his refusal to delegate may also be a weakness. 'He was taking too many decisions himself. There was no management structure in place,' says one executive. The Reichmanns made their mark in the late 1970s by paying rock-bottom prices for the so-called Uris package of eight buildings in Manhattan. The Dollars 320m portfolio grew ten-fold in value over the next decade, and the swelling cash flow from the buildings allowed O&amp;Y to diversify. Their star rose further with their far-sighted decision in the depths of the 1981-83 recession to press ahead with the construction of New York's World Financial Centre. The aura of invincibility created by these early successes has tended to overshadow later mistakes. In 1989, O&amp;Y lost millions by riding to the rescue of Campeau Corporation, the Canadian real estate company that had overstretched itself by buying two US retail groups. A former business associate says: 'The Campeau deal was a turning point. It was a deal Paul didn't want to do, he did it to help out a friend. It was a deal too far'. O&amp;Y also gambled on Olympia Place in Orlando, Florida, by building on the outskirts of the city. Today the building is 28 per cent vacant. Many of O&amp;Y's non-property investments have turned out to be less successful than the Reichmanns would have hoped. as the accompanying table shows. But at the heart of O&amp;Y's financial problems is what could turn out to be its biggest miscalculation - the Pounds 3bn project to develop the Canary Wharf office complex in east London's Docklands in 1987, just as the London property market was reaching its crest. The Reichmanns misjudged the severity of the London market's decline again in 1988 and 1990, when they bought stakes in the London developers, Stanhope and Rosehaugh. Canary Wharf remains a substantial cash drain. O&amp;Y wooed tenants to the 4.5m sq ft Canary Wharf complex with generous incentives. However, 40 per cent of the building is empty and may remain so for some time. Cash generated in north America has also been under pressure. As the recession has taken its toll, vacancy rates have risen. Perhaps the starkest example of this is ITT's former head office at 320 Park Avenue, New York. With the exception of a small BMW showroom on the ground floor, the black-and-grey steel tower, adjacent to the Waldorf Astoria hotel, is deserted . Generally, however, O&amp;Y has been astute in its choice of sites, and this may yet help the Reichmanns. As the figures above (compiled after extensive inquiries by the Financial Times in cities across north America) show, their record as landlords is no worse, and sometimes better than average. Mr John Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York who heads the group's US operations, says that, excluding the ITT building which represents their biggest failure so far, O&amp;Y's vacancy rate in New York averaged only 10 per cent last December. Even if no expiring leases are renewed this year, the vacancy level would rise to only around 15 per cent. But the bald figures tell only half of the story. As the market slumped, landlords were forced to cut rents to keep existing tenants, and to offer juicy incentives to attract new ones. Nominal asking rents may be Dollars 20 or Dollars 30 a square foot in rent, but concessions can mean that tenants get the first three to four years of a 10-year lease virtually rent-free. On top of that, the landlord also pays the service charges and taxes, which in New York can cost Dollars 15 per sq ft even before financing costs. Cash flow projections made two or three years ago have become meaningless. With rents under pressure, the Reichmanns have also found that they can not easily dispose of assets to raise cash. The New York property market remains flat, with values now 30 to 40 per cent below their 1987 peak. Most property investors and bankers predict that values will not recover for another three years. Even at depressed prices, there are few buyers for large, downtown office blocks. The same applies to O&amp;Y's non-property investments. The stake in Interprovincial PipeLine, which is being sold to finance the forced retirement of the commercial paper programmes, fetched a price below the prevailing market level. Until this latest crisis, the Reichmanns had been able to raise cash by seeking private partners for their projects. They did a deal late last year under which Hong Kong magnate, Mr Li Ka Shing will help finance the renovation of 60 Broad Street in New York, in exchange for a 49 per cent equity stake. At the time, a joint statement said the transaction signalled 'an important strategic alliance'. Mr Li may yet end up buying more O&amp;Y assets. But in the short term, the Reichmanns' fate depends on the progress of debt restructuring talks. Representatives of 20 big international banks will meet in Toronto on April 6 to discuss the debt restructuring. The banks will be forced to make sacrifices. In any restructuring, the banks will have to provide more money to O&amp;Y to allow the completion of developments such as Canary Wharf. They will be forced to defer interest payments until the property market recovers and O&amp;Y's rental income increases. If they become particularly pessimistic about O&amp;Y's prospects for generating income, they may have to convert some debt into equity. They may also find themselves owning some of O&amp;Y's buildings which would be hard to sell in the present slump. Although there is a risk that banks with small exposures will demand immediate repayment - which could sink O&amp;Y - most bankers, property investors and regulators agree that the property empire is probably safe. There will be immense pressure from regulators on all banks to toe the line. In one sense, O&amp;Y's weakness - the size of its debt - is also its strength. The collapse of the O&amp;Y empire would cause unbearable losses.

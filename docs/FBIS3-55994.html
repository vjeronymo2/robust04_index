NATO Is Not Approaching Russia's Borders at the Moment"]    [Text] The North Atlantic alliance summit has ended in  Brussels. The main subjects discussed were questions of  security in Europe and worldwide, which in practical terms took  the form of the problem of expanding the alliance by including  East European countries and certain former republics of the  Soviet Union.    On a U.S. initiative the NATO leadership adopted the  "Partnership for Peace" program, within which framework Poland,  the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia are invited to  collaborate with the North Atlantic alliance in creating a  collective security system, but not as full members. The  question of nuclear weapons on Ukraine's territory was discussed  equally intensively.    According to news agency reports, U.S. President Bill  Clinton  called the approval of the "Partnership for Peace" plan and the  fact that it proved possible to persuade Ukraine to adopt a  treaty stipulating that Kiev should give up nuclear weapons "two  gigantic steps in the direction of universal security."    It was not easy for Bill Clinton to press for precisely  those  results in the summit. As we know, proceeding on the basis that  "the Western defensive alliance is faced with the historic task  of extending the existing security system to East Europe," NATO  Secretary General M. Woerner expressed the opinion that NATO  should open its doors to all the former Warsaw Pact countries  "since they are culturally and historically closely linked with  the West and should restore these ties with it." But Russia, as  we know, objected to this pretty resolutely, and on the eve of  the meeting, Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  proposed that NATO and Russia should jointly guarantee European  security.    The U.S. president managed to incline his partners to  accommodate Moscow's wishes, although he had to take a fair  amount of criticism for adopting this stance. Covering the  results of the summit, the Western press was full of reproaches  against him on the premise that, although Russia continues to be  a great power despite its present economic weakness, the West  should not adapt ad infinitum to its interests alone in security  questions.    The question of the talks with Ukraine proceeded equally  dramatically. The Ukrainian president, unable to withstand the  combined pressure of the U.S. and Russian presidents, agreed to  sign a document on 14 January in Moscow on the complete transfer  to Russia of the nuclear weapons located on Ukraine's territory.    Beyond the shadow of a doubt, Leonid Kravchuk has decided to  ignore the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet decision dated 18 November  which de facto enshrined Ukraine's status as a nuclear power.  In all likelihood, on his return home from doing his Moscow  penance, he will come up against big problems in his  relationship with the parliament. But those are ultimately  Leonid Kravchuk's own problems.    The main event is happening elsewhere. The U.S. President is  arriving for a meeting with Boris Yeltsin today with big  achievements in his foreign political activity, which will  doubtless be very highly assessed in Moscow.    In a word, the first meeting between the Russian and U.S.  presidents promises to be very productive.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / HK airport talks fail to progress TALKS between China and Britain to break the deadlock over the financing for Hong Kong's new airport ended yesterday with no agreed date for a resumption, Reuters reports from Hong Kong. 'I'm sure that in due course we will resolve these problems, the airport will be built,' the leader of the British negotiating team, Mr Anthony Galsworthy, said after the meeting, the third this month. The talks were the first since a public war of words erupted over the airport and the running of the colony. China has objected to financing plans for the multi-billion dollar project, saying they will saddle the colony with huge debts. CNAC buys air cargo stake, page 23</p>

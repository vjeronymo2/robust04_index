			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> 3-6-9 SHANGHAI IN ANAHEIM IS FULL OF CHINESE FLAVOR  </P> <P> A good number of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Southern California  can be found in the San Gabriel Valley. Now, at long last, a little bit of the  San Gabriel Valley has surfaced in Orange County: 3-6-9 Shanghai, one of that  area's best Chinese restaurants, has opened a branch in an Anaheim shopping  mall. Along for the ride are nearly all the wonderful cold dishes, handmade  breads and savory dumplings that made the original restaurant such a hit.  </P> <P> 3-6-9 Shanghai makes no attempt to be Western. It is your basic, brightly lit,  Formica table-top, Chinese-style roadhouse cafe. Lily Liu, 3-6-9's owner, is  from Taiwan, but both her mother and father were born in Shanghai. Liu learned  to cook at an early age, and many of the dishes on her menu are family recipes.  </P> <P> Most of her customers zero in on those wonderful breads and dumplings. And  inside the glass deli case are several cold dishes -- exotically spiced meats  and vegetables -- which Shanghai cuisine is noted for. Perhaps the best known  is wine-marinated chicken. 3-6-9's version is mild and flavorful, one of the  easiest dishes to eat I know of.  </P> <P> Other options include Liu's pomfret fish, which she smokes with tea leaves and  sugar. The result is a grainy, slightly sweet fish -- much different than the  saltier smoked fish with which most Western palates are familiar. Liu also  smokes chicken, using a strongly flavored dry-textured preparation that I found  almost overbearing. Cold-pickled vegetables -- cucumber with red chile or  oil-soaked braised baby bamboo shoots, for example -- make good accompaniments  for the meat dishes.  </P> <P> The dumplings, 10 to an order, make an ideal second course. Indeed, 3-6-9's  Shanghai steamed dumplings, fat little pockets of dough that burst with juice  when you bite into them, are among the most irresistible dishes I have ever run  across. The filling, minced pork with spices, is soft and dense. Dip the  dumplings in rice vinegar and hot chile oil, then eat them with sliced fresh  ginger.  </P> <P> Boiled chive dumplings are another terrific variation, perfect for vegetarians.  The green-tinged, diaphanous pouches are filled with eggs, chives and  watercress.  </P> <P> Among the breads is something called fried sesame roll, actually a pan-fried  onion bread studded with white sesame. It's wonderful. Then there is the  million-layers cake, which the waitress will tell you is "Chinese pizza." It  looks like a cinnamon roll without the frosting, and you pull the layers out  from the middle as you eat it. It's an oily, simple bread that goes perfectly  well with the restaurant's vinegary, meat-rich hot-and-sour soup.  </P> <P> There are several hot pots and noodle dishes. These don't show off the  restaurant's best cooking, but they are generally fresh, honest and  well-prepared. The best is steamed pork with rice powder -- lean, tiny smoked  pork ribs coated in pulverized rice, braised and served atop a bed of steamed  pumpkin. The dish, outrageously cheap at $2.95, is served in a bamboo steamer.  </P> <P> I would also try to squeeze in some smoked pork with green garlic (the "green  garlic" turns out to be leek, a veritable mountain of it, in fact).  </P> <P> The roast catfish with garlic is delicious. But the infamous surimi,  artificially flavored pollock, is substituted for crab in the otherwise  appealing seafood soup. And fish head casserole, normally a staple in Chinese  kitchens, was so oily I couldn't eat it.  </P> <P> There also is a problem with monosodium glutamate (MSG) at this restaurant. The  kitchen here seems to use it liberally in the cooked dishes. Ask them not to.  That's the one aspect of authenticity most of us can do without.  </P> <P> 3-6-9 Shanghai is inexpensive. Dim sum and dumplings are 50 cents to $4.25.  Soups are $3.25 to $4.25. Cold dishes are $2.95. A la carte entrees are $4.95  to $9.95.  </P> <P> 3-6-9 SHANGHAI RESTAURANT  </P> <P> 613 N.

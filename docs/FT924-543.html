			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow modestly higher after erratic session Wall Street US MARKETS ended a see-saw day in positive territory yesterday as investors managed to achieve a modest pre-Christmas rise, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.64 at 3,321.10, below the day's best but well above its low for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.39 off at 440.31 and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.62 at 660.84, but rises outnumbered declines on the New York SE by 985 to 885 after heavy turnover of 250m shares. Buyers moved into the market at the start in anticipation of a year-end rally, lifting the Dow by 16 points in the first 30 minutes. Early sentiment was also aided by gains in overseas markets, where prices in London, Frankfurt and Tokyo all finished higher, and from another strong rise in bond prices. The market failed to maintain the upward momentum and by early afternoon was firmly entrenched in negative territory as some investors sold stocks to realise their 1992 losses for tax purposes. A late program trading-related rally, however, boosted prices just before the close. The day's only economic news - a downward revision in the third-quarter gross domestic product figure from 3.9 per cent to 3.4 per cent - was largely ignored by investors. Airlines were active after British Airways pulled out its proposed Dollars 750m investment in USAir because the US government was about to block the deal. Since the market had already discounted the deal's collapse, USAir firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 12 1/8 . Delta ended Dollars  1/2 up at Dollars 51 3/8 , AMR flat at Dollars 63 3/4 and UAL Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 123. Wal-Mart slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 in nervous trading ahead of a network television programme which was expected to be critical of the retailer's trading and import policies. Unisys receded Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 10 1/8 in turnover of 2.9m shares after Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'outperform'. IBM, Dollars 2 3/4 better at Dollars 51 5/8 , rebounded from recent losses, although it remained near historical lows. On the Nasdaq market, Heart Technology climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 18 1/4 after winning approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to restart commercial distribution of its Rotablator system used to treat atherosclerosis in leg arteries. Homestyle Buffet shed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 2 5/8 after warning that it would post a 'substantial' loss in the fourth quarter. Canada BLUE CHIP Toronto stocks ended virtually flat with a slightly firmer bias as earlier gains on Wall Street ebbed and pulled Toronto's heavier weighted shares and broader index down from initial gains. Gold shares, pinched by falling bullion prices, led losses on the Toronto SE. The TSE 300 index was finally 3.1 up at 3,313.5 and rises led declines by 343 to 316 after a large volume of 45.6m shares valued at CDollars 390m. The heavily weighted gold shares index fell 102 points to 5,123, led by losses in Placer Dome and Pegasus Gold. The latter shed CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 18 3/8 , additionally depressed by an analyst's recommendation to take profits on the stock.</p>

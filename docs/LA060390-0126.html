			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / MURRAY WEIDENBAUM: USING BENEFIT-COST STUDIES TO SET  REGULATORY POLICY  </P> <P> Proponents of tougher environmental regulation focus almost exclusively on the  benefits they hope to achieve, while critics seem concerned only with the high  costs they anticipate. The current debate on the Clean Air Act demonstrates the  shortcomings -- and also the validity -- of both approaches.  </P> <P> Surely, the air will be cleaner if the Clean Air Act is extended, and the  American people will pay a high price in the process. But given the importance  of a healthy environment, this is not an either/or question. When we strip away  the heated rhetoric that almost invariably accompanies discussions of  environmental issues, we find that the serious questions are in terms of "how  much" and "how." That is, what are the most effective ways of achieving cleaner  air, safer drinking water and other environmental goals?  </P> <P> Here, the economic approach to public-policy decision making has something to  offer. The basic economic questions facing government decision makers are  twofold: Are the benefits of a specific action worth the costs? Is there a  better way of achieving those benefits? Society's bottom line is not the impact  of regulatory actions on government or on business, but the effect on the  consumer, on the citizen.  </P> <P> Benefit-cost analysis has been used for decades in examining government  programs. It is neither a revolutionary new idea nor an invention of the far  right. It has been attacked by both ends of the political spectrum: by the far  left, because not every proposal for government intervention passes a  benefit-cost test, and by the far right, because benefit-cost analysis can be  used to justify government intervention.  </P> <P> The motive for incorporating such analysis into public-sector decision making  is to lead to more efficient use of government resources by subjecting the  public sector to the same type of quantitative constraints as those used in the  private sector. In making an investment decision, business executives compare  costs to expected revenue. If the costs exceed revenue, the investment is not  considered worthwhile.  </P> <P> The governmental decision maker does not face the same constraints. If the  costs to society of an agency action exceed the benefits, the situation does  not usually have an adverse impact on the agency. In fact, the administrators  may not even know about it. Requiring agencies to perform benefit-cost analyses  helps to counterbalance the strong attraction toward regulatory activity by  government agencies and their supporters. Otherwise, they can crow about the  benefits and ignore the costs that are passed through to the consumer by the  firms they regulate.  </P> <P> A basic relationship of costs and benefits holds for many regulatory programs.  Typically, the initial regulatory effort -- such as cleaning up the worst  effects of pollution in a river -- generates benefits significantly greater  than costs. But the resources required to achieve additional cleanup become  disproportionately high. At some point the added benefits are substantially  less than the added costs.  </P> <P> The pulp-and-paper industry spent $3 billion complying with a set of federal  clean-water standards and achieved a 95% reduction in pollution. But reaching a  98% reduction level cost the industry an additional $4.8 billion.  </P> <P> Benefit-cost analysis is a tool for identifying the optimum amount of  regulation. To an economist, "over-regulation" is not an emotional term; it is  shorthand for regulation for which the costs to the public are greater than the  benefits.  </P> <P> The indirect costs, often overlooked, can be great. One researcher estimates  that 30% of the decline in productivity growth in manufacturing in the 1970s  can be attributed to the regulations promulgated by the Environmental  Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  Analysts at Consad Research Corp. estimate that the enactment of the version of  the Clean Air Act now going through Congress will eliminate more than 200,000  jobs a year.  </P> <P> Regulation has adversely affected the pace of innovation in the pharmaceutical  industry, where "regulatory lag" has become well known. The cost of developing  new and more effective drugs, as a result, has increased substantially. The  most dramatic example of indirect costs of regulation occurs in the automobile  industry. Economists estimate that 2,000 to 4,000 lives are lost each year  because complying with fuel economy standards requires companies to build cars  that are lighter, and thus less safe.  </P> <P> When it is not feasible to put a dollar sign on the benefits, analysts can rank  the cost-effectiveness of alternatives. These studies help policy-makers  identify least-cost solutions to accomplish the same objective. This approach  is useful in programs to reduce personal hazards. Instead of dealing with such  an imponderable question as the value of a human life, the emphasis shifts to  identifying the regulatory approach that maximizes the number of lives saved.  </P> <P> The progress of the Clean Air Act reauthorization furnishes a good (or bad)  example of the need for cost-effectiveness analysis. Oil and auto interests  have been battling to see who will be required to control refueling emissions  that contribute to smog. Whether controls are required at service station gas  pumps, or canisters are required on new cars (on-board controls), the same  reductions in smog-related emissions are possible.  </P> <P> There are pros and cons accompanying each approach. The big advantage of  controls at the pump is that they produce immediate results, whereas placing  devices on new cars requires a complete turnover in the existing fleet of autos  to produce the same outcome.  </P> <P> On the other hand, it is much easier for government to regulate a relatively  few car manufacturers than thousands of gasoline retailers.  </P> <P> In any event, tighter controls on gas pumps, it is estimated, will reduce  hydrocarbon emissions in dirty air areas at a cost of $1,000 a ton or less,  whereas removing a ton of hydrocarbon using the on-board solution may cost  twice as much.  </P> <P> But Congress seems likely to avoid making a difficult choice by requiring both  sets of controls. That is the worst alternative. The combined strategy  significantly increases costs while producing no added benefits.  </P> <P> That would be comparable to the individual who simultaneously wears a belt and  suspenders to hold up his pants -- incurring two sets of costs to achieve one  set of benefits.  </P> <P> Critics offended by the notion of subjecting regulation to benefit-cost or  cost-effectiveness tests unwittingly expose the weakness of their position.  They must fear that their pet rules would flunk the test. After all, showing  that a regulatory activity generates an excess of benefits is a strong  justification for continuing it.  </P> <P> Benefit-cost analysis is neutral, giving equal weight to a dollar of benefits  and a dollar of costs.  </P> <P> Because resources available to safeguard human lives are limited, economists  become concerned when they see wasteful use of those resources through unwise  regulation.  </P></p>

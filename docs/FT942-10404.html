			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Japan stuck in economic mire Japan's economy continues to be generally sluggish, according to the latest monthly report of the government's Economic Planning Agency. The economic decline passed its 37th month in April, the longest downturn in post-war history, showing almost no change from the previous month. The economy 'is going through an adjustment phase, and showing an overall slump, though there are some bright signs,' said the EPA, using the same phrase as last month's report. The agency - over-optimistic about the recovery outlook last year - has in recent months become more pessimistic than some other official government forecasters, especially the Bank of Japan, which believes that the conditions for an upturn are falling into place. Among the bright signs highlighted by the EPA were the continued strength in housing starts at 1.5m per month, an apparent end to the decline in corporate confidence and an upturn in personal spending. However, Mr Yoshio Terasawa, the EPA's new director general, warned yesterday that the impact of the yen's recent rise was 'extremely severe'. Recovery prospects are weakened by the continued fall in corporate earnings, down four years in a row as the annual results season will confirm over the next few weeks. Industrial output continues to fall, though companies are making progress in cutting stocks of unsold goods, said the EPA.</p>

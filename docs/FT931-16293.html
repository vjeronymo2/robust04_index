			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Huge harvest tests strength of Chicago bulls - The supply of cheap feed grains is also fuelling a boom in US livestock production CHICAGO grain futures are starting the year burdened by the huge harvest that has just been completed and by the uncertain status of a key export market - the former Soviet Union. Still, poor harvests in other areas of the world and prospects for smaller US crops next autumn should provide ample speculative opportunities in the futures markets through the year, analysts say. The supply of cheap feed grains is also fuelling a boom in livestock production, a factor that is likely to weigh down Chicago cattle and hog futures prices as the year wears on. Mr Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers, says the very sharp drop in animal feed costs virtually ensures that total US meat output in 1993 will be a record. He projects overall production of US beef, pork, and poultry at 68bn lbs this year, 3 per cent above the 1992 record. Despite the output boost, Mr Levitt says prices will be lower, 'but there will be no train wreck'. Larger meat exports, lower retail pork margins and expanding meat processing capacity in the US will help to absorb the surplus. He projects prices for choice fed cattle on the southern plains at about Dollars 70 a hundredweight by the third quarter, about Dollars 4 below last year's price. For hogs, he expects average prices to be Dollars 1 to Dollars 3 below 1992 levels. The biggest event for US meat and grain markets in 1992 was the enormous US maize crop. The US Department of Agriculture is scheduled to release its final maize production figure on January 12, but for now the harvest is estimated at a record 9.3m tonnes. Despite reported crop losses in northern states, where foul weather delayed harvesting, prominent analysts say record yields in other states will cause the production figure to be revised upward, to about 9.4m tonnes in next Tuesday's report. If that happens, traders expect the price of maize for March delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade to drop below the current Dollars 2.14 1/2 a bushel contract low. However, Mr Dale Gustafson, senior grains analyst for Smith, Barney, Harris and Upham, believes the same report will show heavy US maize use. Despite its abundance, the 1992 maize crop has been low in protein, encouraging heavier consumption for livestock feeding. 'My bias is that next week's report will suggest more domestic maize consumption in the first quarter (of the crop year) than the trade perceives,' he says. Prices are already near the low for the year, Mr Gustafson points out, and he expects that domestic and export demand will gradually pull futures prices higher, though not much above the Dollars 2.30-a-bushel level. Analysts are not counting on Russia as an export market for US feedgrains in the first quarter, given its credit problems. Still, other importers are expected to fill the gap; South Africa, for example, is expected to be a net maize importer this year because of its own poor crop. With the US government requiring farmers to set aside 10 per cent of their maize acreage next year in order to receive price supports, the 1993 harvest is expected to be considerably smaller. Mr Dick Loewy, an analyst with AgResource, projects the yet-to-be planted 1993 maize crop at 8.3m bushels, about 1m lower than 1992's. Prospects for a smaller new crop could drive maize for December delivery up to Dollars 2.60 by the summer. An unusual aspect of the US maize situation is that most of the 1992 surplus is being held by farmers, rather than the government. Low market prices have discouraged commercial sales of the grain. In other years, farmers would have surrendered the grain to the government loan programme, but this year the loan price is so low that they have chosen to keep their maize - a factor that could prompt a flood of grain on to the market as prices begin their projected summer recovery, putting a lid on the advance. On the surface, the US wheat situation is more conducive to a rally. The USDA projects stocks of US wheat at a mere 498m bushels at the end of this marketing year, compared with more than 2bn bushels of maize. However, market watchers are enthusiastically recommending selling Chicago wheat futures for March delivery every time the contract bumps above Dollars 3.60 a bushel. 'I expect the (USDA) will have to cut their estimates for domestic wheat consumption and export demand. I think our carryout is moving closer to 600m bushels than 500m,' says Mr Warren King, an analyst with Cargill Investors Services. Although Canada had a poor wheat crop, and there has been talk of troubles with the Australian crop this week; China's purchases of US wheat have been disappointing; and Russia, on the of largest US wheat importers, is being counted out of the market at least until March, leaving about 2.5 million tonnes of projected demand in limbo. Russia is more than Dollars 120m in arrears on its US-backed loans, with refinancing dragging on in multinational negotiations. Unlike maize, wheat prices will get little solace from new crop plantings. Winter wheat sowed in southern plains states has received plentiful moisture and promises a bumper crop. More acres have been planted to wheat for 1993 than last year, because the government eliminated all wheat acreage set-aside requirements. Analysts are already projecting wheat futures for July delivery to trade at Dollars 2.85 a bushel or less, more than 30 cents per bushel below the present price. Analysts project some boom and bust pricing for soyabean futures and for soya oil and soya meal. Troubled Canadian, Chinese and European Community oilseed crops have left the US as the only global oilseed and meal supplier until southern hemisphere crops are harvested this spring. 'The EC upped its import volume to make up for its own poor harvest, plus the dollar was very weak and the protein in oilseeds was priced cheaper than its grain equivalents. All that resulted in frontloading (bringing forward) EC imports from the US,' says AgResource's Mr Loewy. As a result, 67 per cent of projected US soyabean exports has been sold only 4 months into the crop year. The export pace tailed off in November, but Mr Loewy and other analysts are projecting that US soyabean prices will rise to Dollars 6 a bushel or more by March. Very quickly after that, however, the realities of a record-breaking Brazilian crop are likely to stall any rally. Mr Loewy forecasts a 10.2 per cent increase in Brazilian soyabean acreage, with Brazilian officials estimating a crop between 2m and 3m tonnes higher than last year's 19.2m tonnes. Until the Brazilian harvest however, the markets will shift on every rumour of crop conditions, fuelling flurries in the Chicago soyabean futures pit.</p>

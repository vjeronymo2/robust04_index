			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Magicians of the little red box: Last Tuesday marked the end of the traditional March financial ritual. Malcolm Rutherford reflects on eight ex-chancellors who took the starring role THEY HAVE not formed a dining club, but there is a remarkable number of former UK chancellors around: eight altogether. Some were obviously more successful than others, although none was successful throughout and even the 'problems of success,' as Edward Heath called them, brought pain in their wake. Talking to the ex-chancellors leads to a sense of continuity. All have dealt with the weakness of sterling; nearly all have had difficulties in controlling public spending and, in varying degrees, they have all doubted the accuracy of the figures on which their actions are based. For some, the annual Budget and even the annual public expenditure exercise are not their central task. For much of the time, they are simply reacting to events. The most youthfully enthusiastic of the former chancellors is the oldest: Lord Thorneycroft, now 83. The most intriguing, historically, is Lord Barber  -if only because he has remained so silent since. The four most effective were, in different ways, Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson: two Labour men and two Tories. James Callaghan had to deal with circumstances beyond his control, but found the experience useful when he went on to higher things. John Major delivered only one Budget before becoming prime minister. Last Tuesday's was Norman Lamont's third. For what it is worth, recent precedent suggests that chancellors rarely resign and are sacked even less often. If you omit Iain Macleod, who died in 1970 after 31 days in the post, the average length in office, between the return of a Labour government in 1964 and Lawson's resignation in October 1989, was more than four years. Until Lawson departed over exchange-rate policy, the only post-war chancellor who resigned was Thorneycroft. No chancellor has been sacked since Selwyn Lloyd in 1960. Whether Thorneycroft achieved anything by going is still a matter of intense debate in the higher reaches of the Tory party. He resigned from Harold Macmillan's cabinet in early 1958 over public expenditure which he judged was - note the figure - Pounds 50m too high. Thorneycroft says that he has never had any regrets. 'Harold was a delightful man, but he was a big spender . . . I resigned when I knew that we couldn't go on continuously and regularly overstretching our resources.' He denies the rumour which emanated from Downing Street at the time - that he was put up to it by Enoch Powell and Nigel Birch, who went with him. It was his own doing, he insists. He and the prime minister agreed to put the public expenditure matter to the full cabinet. The prime minister won and the Treasury lost. That meant that the chancellor's authority was in danger of being undermined in all future spending arguments. It also illustrates a cardinal rule: if the prime minister and the chancellor are working well together, politics should be relatively smooth; if they are not, there is likely to be trouble. The Thorneycroft resignation remains of interest in other ways. 'I'm not a rich man,' he says, but when he looks around his Eaton Square flat you know that 'rich' means 'super-rich'. Very few modern ministers can easily afford to put principle first. Heath's first choice of chancellor was Macleod, who was ready to introduce value added tax. When Macleod died, he turned to Tony Barber, a successful former party chairman, and former treasury minister, then in the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy and just starting the negotiations on Britain's entry to the European Community. Barber remained chancellor for the rest of the Heath government. It was not a happy time. Heath and Barber never had that close relationship between prime minister and chancellor that seems essential at least to the appearance of good government. It was a period of sudden policy lurches: from Selsdon Man and economic laissez-faire to prices and incomes control, and Heath tended to rely on senior civil servants such as Sir William Armstrong rather than on ministers. 'It was even more of a 'yes man' cabinet than Mrs Thatcher's,' says Lawson. Barber admits now that he thought more than once of resigning. He 'hated' the prices and incomes policy, but was persuaded, as were many other free-market Tories at the time, that there was nothing better available. What prompted thoughts of resignation was the continuing rise in public expenditure, but he remembered Thorneycroft and concluded that his resignation had not achieved anything. Nevertheless, the Barber stewardship was eventful. He introduced VAT in his 1971 Budget, but did not heed the advice of good friends in Europe: two youngish finance ministers called Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt. Giscard advised him to set a uniform rate as high as possible straightaway, with a minimum number of exemptions. That was the way to avoid storing up trouble for the future. The chancellor replied that it was not practical because Britain had no history of a sales tax. Possibly he had an eye for talent. When Barber left politics for banking in 1974, he chose as his bag carrier and personal assistant an almost unknown young man called John Major. And it was his determination to give up the House of Commons at the next election that perhaps helped him to stay calm as chancellor. In early 1973, Barber presided over an unprecedented year-on-year economic growth rate of 10.5 per cent. That was the Barber boom. By December that year, he was introducing a draconian programme of spending cuts. Healey, the Labour chancellor who took over from Barber, says that he left a mess like the Augean Stables behind him. Yet, by British standards, Barber had inherited an unusually healthy economy from Jenkins in 1970 with the first surplus in the PSBR since 1936-37 - though also the last until Lawson. Jenkins had become chancellor in late 1967 following devaluation and the departure of Callaghan. In his book Time and Chance, Callaghan describes the loneliness of it all: 'I have never experienced anything more frustrating than sitting at the chancellor's desk watching our currency reserves gurgle down the plughole day by day and knowing that the drain could not be stopped. I could not even share the misery with others.' Like Lamont with the 'green shoots of recovery,' there was a phrase he came to regret. 'We are back on course. The ship is picking up speed. Steady as she goes]' he said in his 1967 Budget. Devaluation came six months later. After that, there was never any question that he would stay on, nor did he wish to do so. Roy Jenkins succeeded him. Jenkins recalls now that he was 'totally indispensable' to the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson. 'I had the power of an H-bomb over him,' he says and sounds as if he wished he had used it. Certainly he regrets that he was not decisive enough with his first Budget. To gain the benefits of devaluation, he suggested bringing the 1967 Budget forward to mid-February and combining it with an announcement of expenditure cuts. All official advice was against him because the Treasury has never liked the idea of a unified Budget, and Jenkins allowed himself to be overruled. Besides, said the Treasury, it was impossible to construct a Budget without waiting for the short-term economic forecasts. Jenkins has less admiration for the Treasury mystique and conventions than most former chancellors. 'It's not the smooth purring Rolls-Royce machine that is often supposed,' he says. He found that there were better officials at other departments though he does single out for praise Sir Douglas Allen (later Lord Croham) as his permanent secretary and one or two others. He thought the secrecy was excessive and regularly ignored it. Once he lost the daily briefing paper on the gold and foreign exchange reserves that was for his and the prime minister's eyes only: he expected it to turn up in a newspaper, but nothing happened. 'In those days the Treasury was obsessed by those figures.' In Budget-making he took the unprecedented step of consulting some of his cabinet colleagues, once even including Tony Benn. What struck him most was how quickly the economy could turn round. In his stewardship the balance of payments went rapidly from deficit to surplus, but it can turn back just as fast. And if Jenkins had known the recovery would be so rapid, he would not have gone on raising taxes in the 1969 Budget after a record rise in 1968. Being chancellor breeds a weary cynicism about figures. Even when Jenkins took on the beginnings of monetary policy, he was careful to describe the theory as 'arcane.' By the mid-1970s, Healey was facing the same sort of currency and spending problems that had confronted Callaghan. Healey remains unrepentant, although his manner has mellowed with time. Thatcher used to speak of him as an 'amoral thug.' Nowadays, he is one of the few people to speak sympathetically of Heath. The only regrets he expressed were that he did not find it easier to work more closely with Jenkins (Jenkins, Healey and Heath were at Balliol College, Oxford, together), and that the government had not been more flexible in its incomes policy. Its 5 per cent norm led to the 'winter of discontent' in 1979. Healey remains scathing about Treasury numbers and forecasts: 'The figures are always wrong or out of date.' The estimate for the public sector borrowing requirement which led to the loan from the IMF was far too high. But he is still glad he went to the fund because it 'put the seal' on cuts he wanted to make, anyway. The IMF episode led to a notable change in Budget-making: for the first time, all cabinet ministers debated the contents in advance and secrecy seemed to have been abandoned. The change did not last. Healey's innovation was the gradual introduction of monetary policy. He says he learned in the army that 'you can't work without a plan, but you must know that the plan will work. You must take money seriously.' He was perhaps the first chancellor to do so. Like Jenkins after devaluation, he was surprised by how quickly the economy turned round after the IMF loan. For the rest, Healey remains convinced that the root British problem is the class system. It was Callaghan as prime minister in 1979 who noted that the tide had turned against high taxes, and Labour duly lost office. Howe, as the new Tory chancellor, recalls that after cutting the top and standard rates of income tax in his first Budget he was cheered by the British Airways crew when he flew to the Tokyo summit and applauded by Labour councillors in his constituency, in spite of having raised VAT. It was his 1980 Budget, however, which set a new discipline. The medium-term financial strategy then introduced 'imposed a framework from which I could not have escaped even if I had wanted to.' The stir over the MTFS was as nothing compared with the Budget in 1981. Howe raised taxes at a time of recession. Thatcher was 'shattered,' but he did it because the government's fiscal position was getting out of hand. At the same time, Howe predicted an average economic growth rate of only 1 per cent for years. Yet, by mid-1982 the recession was over and the forecasts had been shown to be wrong again. For the 1982 Budget, he made an innovation that has stuck. Early in the new year, he called treasury ministers and officials to Chevening, a government residence in Kent, for Budget discussions; this has become the norm. Only after that do the weekly discussions between chancellor and PM get under way. Lawson's Budgets are sufficiently recent not to need a summary save to say that he would have been even more of a reforming chancellor if Thatcher had approved more of his proposals earlier. He is the perfect example of the rule that when relations between chancellor and prime minister go well, it is good for the government - and also of the reverse. Up to the 1987 election and slightly after, they were satisfactory. Afterwards, they went into sharp decline, leading to his resignation in 1989. But he found a novel way of telling the PM of his initial Budget thinking: he and and his wife would invite Thatcher and her husband to an informal dinner around the end of January. Yet, Lawson's own initial approach was remarkably prudent: one penny off the basic rate of income tax in 1986 (a decision taken only a few days before the Budget), and two pennies in 1987. 'What a lot you got]' said The Sun. The bigger cuts came after the 1987 election. Other reforms, such as the broadening of VAT and the phasing-out of mortgage interest relief, were limited by Thatcher, who had more of an eye for voters than an efficient tax system. Lamont, who was for several years Lawson's chief secretary, thinks that his old boss left a lot still to be done. In particular, he has a hankering for the negative income tax, which combines taxes and benefits, that was much studied by the Heath government. Before Lamont took over, there was the brief interlude of chancellor John Major. He presided over only one Budget, but could have made a permanent mark with the introduction of Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) which are a Treasury favourite for further development. Major says that the ideal qualities for a chancellor are 'a long view and a thick skin.' One fact about Major might surprise: he is an advocate of total Budget secrecy, which this year has been tighter than ever. There is no intention of loosening the secrecy when the government moves to the unified Budget in November. Can that be viable? Nobody knows. The process of preparing and presenting tax and spending proposals together will involve much wider consultations and, therefore, leave room for arguments and possibly leaks. Most former chancellors are, at best, lukewarm about the idea. Lawson is against it. He thinks tax must be seen to be handled separately, and that unification will lead to huge administrative problems in the Treasury. But something on which everyone agrees is that the determination to press ahead with unification has come from the present chancellor. 'The merit does not lie in the originality of the idea,' says Lamont (it was proposed in the Armstrong Report of 1980), 'but in the fact that it is being implemented.' Not all former chancellors regard the Budget as their most important act. They like the mystique, they want to be popular and take credit if their name is attached to a lasting reform. But most of the interesting developments take place between Budgets. Remember the remark by Macmillan: 'Preparing a Budget is like using last year's timetable to catch a train.' Then there is the forthright advice from Thorneycroft. 'A government needs one main objective. This year, it should be how to deal with unemployment.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Peter Thorneycroft, 1957-58, Days in office: 359  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ACHIEVEMENT: resignation on a point of principle - public expenditure WEAKNESS: had lost the battle KEY BUDGET: only one Budget - reduced purchase tax WENT ON TO BE: other government roles, and to be chairman of the party,   chairman of Pirelli UK and chairman of Trusthouse Forte QUOTE: 'I'm not a rich man.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- James Callaghan, 1964-67, Days in office: 1,139  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ACHIEVEMENT: opposed devaluation as long as he could; introduced betting   tax WEAKNESS: should not have resisted so long KEY BUDGETS: 1965, introduced corporation tax. 1966, introduced   selective employment tax WENT ON TO BE: home secretary, foreign secretary, prime minister QUOTE: 'We are back on course. . .Steady as she goes.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Roy Jenkins, 1967-1970, Days in office: 933  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ACHIEVEMENT: turned economy round after devaluation WEAKNESS: none on the economic side KEY BUDGETS: 1968, raised taxes by pounds 923m - a record, leading to   government surplus by 1970 Went on the be: President of the European Commission, leader of the SDP QUOTE: 'I had the power of the H-bomb over Harold Wilson.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tony Barber, 1970-74, Days in office: 1,319  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ACHIEVEMENT: year-on-year growth of 10.5% WEAKNESS: failure to stand up to Ted Heath; legacy of inflation KEY BUDGETS: 1971, foreshadows value added tax.

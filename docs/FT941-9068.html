			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barbadian sugar industry to be restructured The ailing Barbadian industry, now being managed by Booker Tate of the UK, is to be restructured to allow it to meet export quota obligations in the European Union and the US, writes Canute James in Kingston, Jamaica. Production of 54,000 tonnes last year was the lowest in 40 years and forced the government to import sugar for the domestic market while trying to fulfil its quotas from local production. The industry, which is heavily indebted to a government-owned bank, is receiving Dollars 11.5m in new loans from the Caribbean Development Bank to help the restructuring, which will include the establishment of a new company to oversee all aspects of the industry. The intention is to lift production to 75,000 tonnes a year in five years, says Mr David Bowen, the island's agriculture minister. This will allow Barbados to meet its European and US quotas, and domestic demand.</p>

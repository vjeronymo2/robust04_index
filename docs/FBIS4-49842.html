			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Deng Pufang, president of the Chinese </F> Federation for the Disabled and chairman of the Preparatory  Committee for the Sixth Far East and South Pacific Games for the  Disabled; Zhang Baifa, executive vice chairman of the  preparatory committee and vice mayor of Beijing; and Wan Siquan,  secretary general of the preparatory committee, with foreign and  domestic correspondents in Beijing on 10 May, hosted by the  State Council Information Office -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] A ZHONGGUO  XINWEN SHE correspondent asked Deng Pufang for his comments  about the first gathering in Beijing of disabled athletes from  both sides of the Taiwan Straits as well as from Hong Kong and  Macao.    [Deng] Both comrades from the Preparatory Committee and  myself are delighted that athletes from Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan will be participating in the games. On the one hand, the  Preparatory Committee will try its best to serve them and make  them feel at home. On the other, I wish them good results. I  shall be as delighted if they achieve good results as I shall be  if mainland- based disabled athletes do the same.    [Announcer] Taibei's [Taipei] CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY would like  to ask Deng two questions. The first is whether you have any  plans to visit Taiwan in the near future. The second is what  expectations you have regarding exchanges between disabled  athletes from the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.    [Deng] I very much hope to visit Taiwan because Taiwan is  part of China's territory. I am now seeking an opportunity to  visit. Once conditions are right, I will definitely visit  Taiwan. We also have had many contacts with Taiwan's disabled  in recent years. We will continue such contacts and exchanges.  In my opinion, contacts between the disabled are least  susceptible to interference and influence from other factors.  My disabled friends in Taiwan and myself share this common  understanding and wish. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Javier from the "QAP Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The latest report issued by the OAS Human Rights  Committee focuses on the Colombian judicial system. It is not  as harsh as the Amnesty International report, but it  nevertheless leaves Colombia in a poor position regarding the  defense of human rights. In a 400-page document, the OAS Human  Rights Committee reports on the state of human rights in  Colombia from 1990 to the present.    It concludes that the public security laws, the faceless  judges, and secret witnesses and evidence harm the citizens'  rights to defend themselves. The regulations regarding the  state of emergency, which were recently approved at the National  Congress as permanent legislation, violate international human  rights agreements that Colombia signed and agreed to abide by.  Military courts trying members of the Armed Forces, as a rule,  hand down biased rulings. Torture is not a crime, according to  Colombian legislation, and it is not prosecuted or punished.    The OAS Human Rights Committee recommends the following for  the Colombian Government: In order to guarantee the human  rights of all individuals, the secret justice system must be  reformed. The government should enforce a state of emergency  only in extremely serious situations. To ensure more just  rulings, the civil justice system should try all those members  of the Armed Forces who have been charged with a crime.  Military immunity should be lifted in cases of torture, extra  judicial executions, and disappearances.    [Begin Leo Valladares, member of the OAS Human Rights  Committee, recording] We hope our report will serve to correct  many of the mistakes we have found. [end recording]    The report concludes by criticizing Colombia for not  following the human rights recommendations the OAS made in 1987.</p>

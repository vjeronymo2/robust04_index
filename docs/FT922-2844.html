			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Brooke Tool Brooke Tool Engineering remained in the red in the six months to March 31 1992 with a loss of Pounds 1.57m, against Pounds 1.42m in the second half of 1990-91, and a corresponding profit of Pounds 122,000. Mr Bernard Friend, chairman, said the result reflected sharply lower sales volumes and inadequate margins. On top of that there exceptional charges of Pounds 308,000 for redundancies and relocation and Pounds 200,000 for goodwill on disposal of businesses. Turnover at Pounds 9.6m was 29 per cent down on the opening six months of 1990-91 and 18 per cent lower than the second half. That was partly the result of the sale of some businesses, but largely the falling off in order books. Mr Friend said action had been taken to eliminate losses and bring the loss-making businesses into profit. Results of individual divisions were mixed but most had shown an improving trend recently. Losses per share were 3.5p (earnings 0.2p). No interim dividend is being paid (0.25p).</p>

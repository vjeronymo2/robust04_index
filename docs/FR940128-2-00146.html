			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The MCHB places special emphasis on improving service delivery to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women and children from culturally identifiable populations who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been disproportionately affected by barriers to accessible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care. This means that projects are expected to serve and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately involve in project activities members of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethnoculturally distinct groups, unless there are compelling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programmatic or other justifications for not doing so. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bureau's intent is to ensure that project interventions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcomes are of benefit to culturally distinct populations and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insure that the broadest possible representation of culturally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinct and historically under-represented groups is supported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through programs and projects sponsored by the MCHB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will review applications for funds under the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned categories as competing applications and, with particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attention to inclusion of women and persons from culturally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinct populations, will fund those which, in the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view, best meet the statutory purposes of the HIV Demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families and address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievement of the Healthy People 2000 objectives related to HIV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Review Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Applications for grant categories will be reviewed and rated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective review panels using the review criteria specified below,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as appropriate.

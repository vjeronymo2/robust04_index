			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES RAISES PARKING FEES, BUSINESS TAX  </P> <P> Business tax is going to be 10% of gross receipts. That is a big number!  </P> <P> What is also "gross" is that the same package includes ". . . a doubling of a  special levy that pays for trash trucks."  </P> <P> New trash trucks with hydraulic arms are going to be bought to replace all of  the present trucks under a new law that mandates use of 60-gallon trash  containers. That must be more than a million containers that must also be  purchased!  </P> <P> Present trash collection is quite satisfactory, thank you. Why spend all this  extra money on new trucks and back-breaking containers? How about spending it  on more needy causes or, golly, a smaller tax increase?  </P> <P> FRANK ATHA  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

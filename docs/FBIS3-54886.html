Turkmen-Russian Agreements on Dual Citizenship and  the Protection of Migrants' Rights Could Become a Model for  Other CIS Member Countries"]    [Text] Ashgabat -- Actually, even before, it was not  necessary to flee from Turkmenistan: The problem widely termed  "the problem of the Russian-speaking population in nearby  foreign countries" in several of the former Union republics did  not exist here. "But," Turkmen President S. Niyazov stressed in  an interview with IZVESTIYA, "it would be arrantly superficial  not to see or understand that, for many reasons, the growth of  national self-consciousness is everywhere, including in our  country, accompanied by negative tendencies..."    These "tendencies" are most commonly encountered at a  mundane  level. But now, the Turkmen government assures me, following  the high-level signing of agreements "On the Regulation of  Questions of Dual Citizenship" and "On the Regulation of the  Process of Resettlement and the Protection of the Rights of  Migrants," the situation around Russians could radically change  for the better, and people will feel completely at ease.    "Each side" -- I am reading from the text of the first  document -- "recognizes its citizens' right to acquire the  citizenship of the other country without losing the citizenship  of their own...." "A person who is a citizen of both countries  fully enjoys the rights and freedoms, and also carries the  obligations, of the country on whose territory he resides  permanently..."    And this means that whether you are Turkmen or Russian,  Uzbek  or Armenian, no one will now prohibit you, if you currently live  in Turkmenistan, from obtaining a Russian passport. And the  same goes for those who, living in Russia, want to acquire  Turkmen citizenship: Just go to the Turkmen Embassy in Moscow  and get the green passport that denotes citizenship of  Turkmenistan. And, praise God, we already have an example of  this -- Boris Yeltsin was the first citizen of Russia, by  acquiring Turkmen citizenship, to receive such a document....    Migrants are another aspect of the question.    "Well, if you have made up your mind to go, at least do it  in  a civilized manner," Russian Ambassador to Turkmenistan Vadim  Cherepov says. "First register as a migrant, and then both  sides are obliged to assist you in privatizing and selling your  house, conveying all your domestic property to your new place of  residence in Russia, and transferring funds..."    Excluding all forms of discrimination against migrants on  political, socioeconomic, ethnic, or religious grounds, the  agreement on the protection of migrants' rights especially  stresses: "Migrants and their families have the right to convey  from the state they are leaving all movables in their  possession, with the exception of items that are prohibited  under the laws of that state. They can sell, bestow, exchange,  bequeath at their discretion, or otherwise dispose of property  in their possession...."    Few people are aware how difficult it was for officials of  the Russian Embassy in Turkmenistan and the Russian Federal  Migration Service to uphold these lines, without which the whole  document would not be worth a dime. Well, judge for yourself  how much protection migrants would have if they were forbidden  not only to sell their privatized apartments in Turkmenistan --  selling, exchanging, or bestowing them was forbidden by  presidential edict -- but even, given the harsh rules  restricting the exportation of objects and valuables, to take  with them to Russia the household chattels they had scraped  together here.    "When we discussed this question with the various  authorities," Vadim Cherepov recalls, "I constantly had to  remind our interlocutors: `Hundreds, even thousands of Turkmens  are privatizing their apartments in Moscow; moreover, many of  these apartments are in the capital's best apartment blocks. If  they have to, they later sell them, asking from 50 to 100  million rubles for them. No one objects to this or forbids them  to take their money to Turkmenistan. So what is worse about  Russians wanting to sell their homes in Ashgabat, Krasnovodsk,  or other Turkmen cities in order to go to Russia and buy  apartments there with the money. Come, I said, let us resolve  this problem at a bilateral level...'"    Much, I repeat, has been resolved. Even, it would appear,  such trivial points as the following:    "The sides guarantee migrants and their families freedom  from  all restrictions on importing or exporting their personal  property, and also from customs duties, taxes, and levies  associated with this process. Monetary funds and transferred  monetary deposits are exempted from levies..."</p>

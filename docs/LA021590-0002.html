			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> DELAY ASKED FOR CONDEMNED MAN  </P> <P> Attorneys for Robert Alton Harris formally asked the state Supreme Court to put  off their client's execution, set for April 3, while the court considers a new  appeal. In seeking a postponement, the lawyers said they wanted the court to be  able to consider the appeal without feeling time pressure.  </P> <P> Without a delay, they said they feared that the court, which set a March 12  deadline for the filing of legal papers, would produce a "rushed decision."  Harris, 37, convicted in 1978 of the murders of two teen-age San Diego boys, is  in line to become the first person executed in California in 23 years. Last  month, the U.S. Supreme Court flatly rejected a broad challenge to Harris'  death sentence.  </P></p>

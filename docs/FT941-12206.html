			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Tesco sheds 800 jobs in drive to cut overheads Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket group, is to cut about 800 full-time jobs among head office and distribution staff in the next six months. The announcement comes less than two weeks after the company said it was cutting back its store expansion programme, and provides further evidence of the growing pressures in the food retailing market. On Friday market leader J. Sainsbury shocked the City with news that profit margins and underlying sales had fallen. Tesco said the job losses followed an internal review of the company's structure, and were split roughly equally between head office and distribution functions. They would lead to a reduction of 10 per cent in affected departments. The company said it was attempting to achieve as many of the cuts as possible through early retirement and voluntary redundancy. But some staff at head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, would face compulsory redundancy. There would be a three-month consultation period, and Tesco would provide counselling and make every effort to help employees find new jobs within or outside the company. The company employs more than 86,000 people and will create about 5,000 jobs this year by opening 25 to 30 stores. The company said it was committed to improving its service to enhance customer loyalty, and that had to be funded from improved efficiency. 'We have got to pay for improved service in a very competitive environment. We have got to cut our overheads.' Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said it was in consultation with Tesco over the losses and it was 'well aware of the pressures facing retailers'. Those pressures include the approaching saturation of the market and the rapid growth of cut-price retailers such as the UK's Kwik Save and Shoprite, Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto. Tesco's job losses may be followed by others in the sector - J. Sainsbury has confirmed it has hired consultants to review head-office operations and staff cuts cannot be ruled out.

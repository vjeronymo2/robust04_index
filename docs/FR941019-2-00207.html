			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Undergraduate, graduate, and health professional school tuition expenses; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Other reasonable educational expenses required by the school(s) attended, including fees, books, supplies, educational equipment and materials, and laboratory expenses; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Reasonable living expenses, including the cost of room and board, transportation and commuting costs, and other living expenses as determined by the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Repayments will be authorized for direct payment to lenders, following receipt of (1) the supervisor's verification of completion of the prior period of obligated service and (2) lender verification of the crediting of prior loan repayments, including the resulting account balances and current account status. The NIH will repay loans in the following order unless significant savings would result from repaying loans in a different priority order: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) other loans guaranteed by the Federal Government; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) other qualifying loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following loans are NOT repayable under the Clinical Research LRP: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Loans not obtained from a Government entity or commercial or other chartered lending institution, such as loans from friends and relatives, or other private individuals; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Loans for which contemporaneous documentation is not available; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Loans, or those portions of loans, obtained for educational or living expenses which exceed a ``reasonable'' level as determined by a review of the standard school budget or additional contemporaneous documentation for the year in which the loan was made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for other programs which provide loans, scholarships, loan repayments, or similar awards in exchange for a future service obligation, the NIH will NOT repay any sums that may result from failure to serve as required or conversion of the obligation to a loan under these programs. This includes, but is not limited to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Physicians Shortage Area Scholarship Program (Federal or State); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) National Research Service Award Program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Public Health Service and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Programs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Armed Forces (Army, Navy, or Air Force) Health Professions Scholarship Programs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Indian Health Service Scholarship Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, payments will not be made under the Clinical Research LRP for loans which participants have already repaid, delinquent loans, loans in default, loans not current in their payment schedule, or loans for which promissory notes have been signed after the program eligibility date. During lapses in loan repayments, due either to administrative complications or a break in service, Clinical Research LRP participants are wholly responsible for making payments or other arrangements which maintain loans in a current payment status such that increases in either principal or interest do not occur. Penalties assessed participants as a result of NIH administrative complications may be considered for reimbursement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium glut talks 'positive' Multilateral talks on the problems of the world aluminium market had generated 'positive' momentum but were likely to end with no more than a 'broad framework' for easing the current oversupply, the head of a US industry group said as government delegates prepared to complete a two-day session here, reports Reuter from Washington. Mr David Parker, president of the Aluminum Association, added that another session of talks would probably be held during the next six weeks. Speaking after a closed-door briefing by US government negotiators, Mr Parker added that, 'there's been no discussion of formulas or numbers'. And he thought no such discussion was likely yesterday. Government officials from the US, Russia, Australia, Canada, Norway and the European Union met on Wednesday to discuss ways of resolving the world aluminium glut, following talks earlier in the day that included industry representatives. The meeting was continuing yesterday. Mr Parker noted that a number of factors made a quick agreement unlikely, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and the coming parliamentary elections in Russia, the main source of the flood of aluminium that has undermined the western market since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He nevertheless expressed satisfaction with the talks so far, which were scheduled as a follow-up to multilateral talks held in Moscow in late October. 'The momentum that was generated at (Wednesday's) discussion we find to be positive,' he said. He added, however, that the urgency of the issue was such that governments would be placed under pressure to find a solution.</p>

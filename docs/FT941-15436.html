			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: TSB strong The banks sector was electrified by much better than expected preliminary figures from TSB, the first of the UK high street banks to report this year. TSB shares, which have consistently underperformed the sector and the market, surged ahead as the profits and dividend news hit the market, ending 15 stronger at 267p, after touching a record 273p. Turnover of 47m shares almost matched the stock's debut in October 1986 when 50m changed hands. The activity was boosted by a placing of 9.3m shares at 264p, said to have been executed by NatWest Securities. Blocks of TSB shares were placed at 266p as the market closed. Dealers said the driving force behind the share price was the 20 per cent dividend increase, which outstripped the market's best expectations of around 9.5 per cent. Analysts said the market was now expecting dividend rises of 10 per cent in subsequent years. Current year forecasts were hoisted to between Pounds 440m and Pounds 450m, and for 1995 to around Pounds 550m. The TSB figures were seen as indicating a sector-wide rerating of banks, with Abbey National the main beneficiary. Abbey shares leapt to 510p before closing 21 ahead at 507p on turnover of 11m. A banks analyst said: 'Abbey responded to good news from its Scottish Mutual business, the widespread feeling that the recession is over and perceptions that it is more geared to the recovering housing/mortgage market.' He added that the market had upgraded its dividend expectations for Abbey following the TSB figures.</p>

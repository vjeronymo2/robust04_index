			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue rises Printing group De La Rue was one of the few shades of blue on dealers' screens in early trading after turning in a solid set of full-year results. Underlying profits jumped 20 per cent to Pounds 123.3m, with analysts moving their forecasts for the current year by around 8 per cent to a range of Pounds 133m to 140m. The shares strengthened to close 16 up at 859p on 1.5m traded. Speculation over how the company intends to spend its cash pile, particularly in the wake of the failed talks with Portals, was prominent among dealers, although they added that criticism over De La Rue's handling of the affair had adversely affected City opinion. Portals' shares continued to suffer from the fallout of the aborted merger talks, dropping a further 10 to 643p.</p>

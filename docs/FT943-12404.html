			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / German exchange investigates insider trading The German stock exchange has launched an insider trading probe in the wake of criminal investigations into suspected tax evasion by a group of Frankfurt stockbrokers. The exchange inquiry was ordered yesterday following weekend press reports that a ring of about two dozen German brokers had allegedly conspired in a highly profitable 'front-running' operation through a Geneva-based investment firm. Front-running is stock market jargon for traders who profit by using prior knowledge of large 'buy' orders from clients to purchase shares on their own account and sell them later as prices rise. The exchange investigation, which will examine whether a voluntary code of practice has been breached, is separate from the criminal investigation into tax evasion, which is being conducted by the Frankfurt public prosecutors' office. It is understood that data relating to the Geneva firm's account with the Frankfurt branch of investment bank Merck Finck &amp; Co were the target of a search by federal tax investigators at the bank on July 13. The trading account is believed to have been active for more than 10 years and dealt almost national financial centre. Ironically, the start of the latest investigations virtually coincides with the introduction in Germany - two years later than the European Union's proposed deadline - of new laws making insider trading an offence punishable with a jail sentence of up to five years. Insider trading does not become illegal in Germany until August 1. Under the current voluntary code of practice the most severe sanction is the loss of a broker's trading licence.</p>

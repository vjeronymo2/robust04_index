			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A press communique faxed to us by the spokesman of  the Romanian Presidency reveals that, today, President Ion  Iliescu received letters signed by the presidents of the  National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD] Corneliu  Coposu, the Civic Alliance Party [PAC] Nicolae Manolescu, and  the Liberal Party '93 Horia Rusu. In those letters, the  signatories express the wish that the respective parties should  participate in the talks initiated by President Ion Iliescu,  within a joint delegation of the Democratic Convention of  Romania [CDR].    On the same issue, Romania's president also received a  letter  signed by Mr. Emil Constantinescu, president of the Democratic  Convention of Romania, in which he announces the composition of  the delegation. In connection with these letters, the communique  notes the following:    Since the invitations for participation in talks were sent  out, Romania's president showed readiness to meet with the  political parties represented in the parliament in the way the  respective parties decide to choose. Initially the president of  Romania intended to arrange a meeting with all these parties.  Considering that the political parties that are included in the  CDR expressed their wish to come individually to the talks, the  president agreed to organize the talks in this way, proposing  that the talks should take place before 1 January 1994.  However, most parties that are CDR members preferred to come to  talks after New Year's eve. In the past days a false fuss has  been created about the participation of parties included in the  CDR to the talks, the invoked pretext was the declaration of the  president's spokesman made on 7 January 1994. The respective  statements referred to the bantering declarations made by Mr.  Constantinescu about the talks initiated by the president -- the  CDR president anticipating the sure failure of those talks --  blended with offending statements about the head of the state.  Such declarations are even more difficult to understand since  they come from a person who aspires to play a certain role in  the country's political life and considering that they show  disregard for an elementary rule of democracy, namely the  respect due to the institutions of the state. As a mater of  fact, those assessments lack any politeness and are rude even to  the parties that are included in the convention and had already  accepted talks with Romania's president.    The received letters indicate a change of position of the  parliamentary parties that are included in the convention, as  far as the formula of participation in talks is concerned. The  president does accept the new formula but does not accept the  pretext invoked for this change of position. The exact date of  the meeting will be convened by the Presidency's adequate  department, reads, in conclusion, the press communique received  by the Radio from the Romanian Presidency's spokesman.</p>

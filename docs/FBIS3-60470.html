There's the Smell of </F> Plague in the Air"; first paragraph is URALSKIY RABOCHIY  introduction]    [Text] A dramatic rise in the number of rodent-borne  diseases has been noted in the oblast.    According to data of the Oblast Sanitary and Epidemiological  Oversight Center, 148 cases of pseudotuberculosis (including 4  outbreaks in children's preschool institutions) and 56 cases of  intestinal yersiniosis in the first 6 months of this year. Let  us note, for the sake of comparison, that 8 and 15 cases of  these diseases, respectively, had been reported for the same  period last year. Fresh vegetables that stored for some time at  rat-infested warehouses of trade bases and stores are  increasingly often the source of infection.    As we know, rodents are also involved in the spread of  tick-borne encephalitis. Fortunately, there is still no  tularemia, God forbid, or plague, yet these most dangerous  diseases are also transmitted by rats and mice.    Wherein lies the cause of the unprecedented surge in  morbidity? Specialists believe that it is not a matter of  natural growth of the rodent population (in this sense, the  situation is quite usual this year), it is simply that people  have virtually stopped controlling this long-tailed filth.    Deratization, i.e., extermination of rodents, has been  always  the concern of disinfection and prevention stations and  departments, which are paid for their work on a contractual  basis. At present, many enterprises have more important things  to think about than rats, and for this reason all the necessary  conditions for reproduction and improved diet are provided for  these animals. And the disinfection and prevention service is  falling apart before our eyes, people are quitting because of  the low wages, there are not enough modern poisons,  transportation, needed materials and bait.    Payment for rodent extermination work from the local budget  is the logical solution for this situation. After all, the  Moscow city council adopted a decision that provides for  comprehensive, regularly scheduled deratization (rats must be  exterminated everywhere, in the residential sector, developed  areas, and who is to pay the expense?). The authorities in the  capital have allocated considerable budgetary funds, and have  made it incumbent on all enterprises, regardless of forms of  ownership, to conclude contracts with disinfection-prevention  stations; they have implemented a number of measures to furnish  this service with everything it needs, as well as for  technical-engineering protection against rodents.    Moscow was the first to come to its senses. But the people  of  the Urals are maintaining an aloof calmness: they are not  worried, so be it....</p>

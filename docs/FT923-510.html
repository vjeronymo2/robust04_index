			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / South Africa's third man rattles the troika: As de Klerk and Mandela resume talks, Chief Buthelezi has served a reminder of the problems ahead When Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi - every inch the Zulu prince in his leopard-skin skirt and spear - rose to address yesterday's gathering of Zulu warriors in Durban, he had only one message to deliver: that no deal on a post-apartheid constitution can be made without him, and that he will extract a high price from anyone foolish enough to try. It was a sobering reminder of the central fact of South African politics: that the country has not just two warring leaders, but three: Mr F W de Klerk, the president, who represents most whites, many coloureds and Indians; Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), who commands most black support; and Chief Buthelezi, who probably has the support of a large chunk of the 7m-strong Zulu nation, and represents, at the very least, a significant spoiling force. Chief Buthelezi, whose public speeches have tended towards the hysterical in recent weeks, made clear yesterday that he was enraged by Saturday's peace deal between Messrs de Klerk and Mandela, by far the most powerful leaders in this troika. Government, he said, was conniving with the ANC to stitch up a political deal excluding other South African leaders (he is the only one with significant support). They would do so at their peril. It was a chilling spectacle: every one of the 7,000-odd men gathered at a sports ground in the ANC-controlled KwaMashu township carried several 'traditional' weapons - the spears and clubs, sharpened sticks and hatchets that are to be banned under an agreement reached on Saturday between the government and the ANC. Mr de Klerk had tried to placate Chief Buthelezi by arguing for a clause in the agreement permitting traditional weapons to be carried for cultural occasions, with special permission from a judge. Chief Buthelezi indicated what he thought of that concession: 'I will never ever under any circumstances ever ask anybody for permission to carry a Zulu cultural weapon.' His supporters left the stadium after yesterday's rally - staged to commemorate King Shaka, the belligerent Zulu potentate who subdued much of southern Africa by war - in marauding bands, contained only with difficulty by police. Local residents were terrified. The rally was the culmination of a week of commemorative events for King Shaka, during which Chief Buthelezi has warned of civil war with the ANC if the movement carries out its stated aim of marching on the capital of the Zulu homeland, Ulundi. He compared the planned ANC march with the 1879 British invasion of Ulundi - and promised a bloodbath. Zulu spokesmen said they were ready for a new 'washing of the spears' at Ulundi. In one sense, Chief Buthelezi's angry rejection of Saturday's peace deal should come as no surprise: two key provisions of the deal - those covering traditional weapons, and measures to fence off and patrol single-sex township hostels (where Zulu inhabitants predominate)  - are directly aimed at his supporters. Yet he was not present at the talks; and though the government insists he was kept informed of their progress, his consent was not sought before agreement. His rejection of the deal highlights the fragility of both South Africa's peace process and the deal struck on Saturday, which marked the resumption of constitutional talks between the government and the ANC, suspended since June. But it does not render the agreement meaningless. In the words of Mr Zach de Beer, veteran leader of the liberal Democratic party: 'Inkatha is an important organisation whose co-operation is highly desirable . . . However, the work must go on whether or not Inkatha takes part.' Nevertheless, Inkatha must be brought back on board, and that delicate task will fall largely to Mr de Klerk, whose government created the KwaZulu homeland as a 'self-governing state' (with Chief Buthelezi as chief minister) and whose Treasury funds its budget. Because of those links, many ANC leaders take the view that Chief Buthelezi will do as he is told by Pretoria, being no more than a glorified South African civil servant. But this ignores the fact that Chief Buthelezi commands significant political support (at least in his home base of Natal) and, more importantly, that Mr de Klerk relies on the politically conservative Zulu leader to deliver as many as 1m votes to a moderate electoral coalition headed by the ruling National party. So Mr de Klerk can push the Zulu leader, but only so far. For the sake of his own political prospects - and, many would argue, for the sake of avoiding civil war - he cannot afford to alienate Chief Buthelezi totally. To that end, Mr de Klerk has demanded in previous constitutional talks that South Africa be ruled by a revolving presidency in the transition to full democracy: three men - he, Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi - would rule in a government of national unity, and there would be strong devolution of power to give regional leaders like Chief Buthelezi a guaranteed power base. The ANC rejects such a troika arrangement, and opposes anything but limited devolution. Now the ANC and the government have agreed to resume talks, this and other problems will resurface. While the two sides claim to have made some progress on constitutional issues in recent months (despite the fact that contacts were officially suspended), bottom-line issues such as how to share power are unresolved. Chief Buthelezi's performance yesterday underscores such difficulties. At least the ANC and the government have demonstrated a will to compromise, which has absent recently. After four months spent trading insults and blame, South Africa's two most important leaders are again trading polite conversation - and political concessions. The government made costly compromises on Saturday, which it had insisted only days before were impossible. It agreed to release three ANC members who had killed white civilians in terrorist attacks, and acknowledged that security force members would have to admit crimes committed against the ANC before receiving amnesty. The ANC, for its part, offered to re-examine its campaign of mass protest action, which has seriously disrupted the economy and led to violence. Critically perhaps, South Africa enters the new round of negotiations under heavy international pressure to settle. If nothing else, the past three months' stand-off has achieved an expanded role for the international community in monitoring violence, and new government openness to international mediation. But after two and a half years spent stumbling from massacre to massacre, from breakdown to bust-up, South Africans will not easily be persuaded that expressions of renewed goodwill between Messrs Mandela and de Klerk will be enough to propel them past the many obstacles in the way of a democratic South Africa. Now for the hard part.</p>

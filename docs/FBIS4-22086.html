			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 25 (AFP) -- Police on Monday shot dead  an Islamic militant leader and nine other fundamentalists during  raids in Cairo and southern Egypt, an interior ministry  spokesman said.    Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the head of the al-Jama'ah  al-Islamiyah's armed wing, and five other militants were killed  in a dawn clash with police at Hammam's apartment in northeast  Cairo, the spokesman told AFP.    A military court in December 1992 sentenced Hammam, who has  been wanted since 1989, and six others to death in their absence  for belonging to a terrorist group bent on overthrowing Egypt's  secular government.    All seven were reported to be veterans of the war in  Afghanistan.    The raid came two weeks after the police chief heading the  battle against the militants, General Ra'uf Khayrat, was  murdered in Cairo. Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said it carried out  the attack.    In Asyut police killed four militants suspected of  involvement in last Wednesday's killing of the head of security  forces in the southern city, which is a militant stronghold.  They were all students at Asyut University.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: PLEASURE BARONS GIVE FANS 3 HOURS OF PLEASURABLE MUSIC  </P> <P> The Pleasure Barons are no robber barons. Fans on hand Friday at the Palomino  got their money's worth and then some from the 13-piece aggregate formed and  fronted by local lights Dave Alvin, Mojo Nixon and Country Dick Montana. With  more than three hours of well-rehearsed music, "leave 'em wanting more" was not  the operating maxim.  </P> <P> Alvin is one of Los Angeles' best songwriters, and this big band pushed him  through barnstorm renditions of favorites like "Marie Marie" (from his Blasters  years) and "4th of July" (from his X stint). The evening's tone, however, was  set by Montana (on leave from the Beat Farmers) and Nixon (on permanent leave  from his senses), who serve up slapstick leaning toward the risque and  irreverently sociopolitical.  </P> <P> Dominant music modes: R&amp;B, country, Vegas.  </P> <P> The last motif was reinforced by a mural of the Strip, tuxes for all (save for  the outdoorsy Montana, who looked ready to go hunting), and such choices as a  rockin' "Take a Letter Maria" and a Tom Jones medley.  </P> <P> Amid all the campiness, it might've been nice to hear more of Alvin's sober  songs and less of Nixon's overbearing mock-Pentecostal preaching. But then,  restraint was hardly the buzzword for this pleasurably generous, if  overwhelming, hedonistic revue. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

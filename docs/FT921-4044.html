			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Duty increases expected to hit sales - Alcohol INCREASES in duty on spirits, wine and beer provoked disappointment and anger in the drinks industry. The increases - adding 28p to the retail price of a bottle of spirits, 5p to a bottle of wine and more than 1p to a pint of beer - would do nothing to reverse declining sales at home, said industry leaders. The chancellor's move also widened the tax gap between the UK and other EC member states instead of moving towards a harmonisation of rates in preparation for the advent of the single market next year. Mr David Jenkins, chairman of the Wines and Spirits Association, said, 'There is not even a gesture towards harmonisation. The much lower taxes on spirits and wine in France will encourage more people to hop on a ferry to buy their drinks across the Channel. 'From January next year they will be allowed to bring back nine cases of wine and a case of spirits. Even if the customs manage to prevent bootlegging, it is going to have a damaging effect on the trade in the UK.' One driver could bring back a year's average supply of wine and spirits for four people, he estimated. UK excise on spirits was nearly five times that in Spain and Portugal, two and half times that in France and more than double that in Germany and the Netherlands. Denmark, in contrast to the UK, had started to reduce its tax rates to bring them closer to the level of most other EC countries. Mr Anthony Tennant, chairman of Guinness, said he was 'shocked' by the budget increases on spirits duty. 'It was very curious of the chancellor to say that he sought to end distortions in the tax system and then add one more by hitting spirits. This will send all the wrong signals to Europe by risking a discriminatory tax on spirits.' Mr Lamont told the Commons that he would not accept any EC proposals for tax harmonisation that allowed some states to levy no duty on wine but high duties on spirits. Mr Tony Hales, chief executive of Allied-Lyons, and Mr Colin Gordon, president of IDV Europe, the GrandMet drinks division, welcomed that 'positive statement' but said they were discouraged by the chancellor's increases. The Scotch Whisky Association, which has been pressing for measures to prevent any further widening of the tax differential, said: 'The chancellor's actions send all the wrong signals to Europe and undermine his negotiating credibility.' Mr David Coxon, trading director of the Victoria Wine chain, said: 'This further round of duty rises will hit drinks retailers again'. Over the past year, customer choice had been pushed down the price scale. 'This budget will constrain consumer choice.'</p>

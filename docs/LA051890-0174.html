			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALANCED BUDGET MAY HIDE PAINFUL CUTS TO COME;  </P> <P> FORECASTS: PROJECTED STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING CUTS COULD MEAN A COUNTY  SHORTFALL IN HEALTH AND WELFARE PROGRAMS.  </P> <P> At a glance, Ventura County's $653-million budget for the fiscal year beginning  in July appears benign.  </P> <P> Released Thursday, it shows a spending increase of $41 million, provides  another 190 workers, virtually maintains current levels of service and is  balanced.  </P> <P> But the budget is based on optimistic forecasts of state and federal funding,  said the analysts who prepared it. And almost surely it will be pared by  painful cuts in health and welfare programs before the Board of Supervisors  approves it in early August.  </P> <P> "Where we are headed in the immediate near future is to a large degree  determined by the federal and, even more so, state government," Chief  Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said in a report to the supervisors.  </P> <P> "That direction, much to our dismay, is definitely downward," he added.  </P> <P> A state budget deficit now estimated at $3 billion for the 1990-91 fiscal year  could mean a county shortfall of $1 million in its health and welfare programs,  Budget Manager Bert Bigler said.  </P> <P> Mandated cuts in the federal budget could mean additional losses in a variety  of social programs next fall, he said.  </P> <P> "This is bad news," Bigler said. "The fact is that there aren't sufficient  funds to deal totally with what we feel are ongoing needs and requirements. And  it doesn't deal with state reductions either."  </P> <P> Nor does the budget provide much money -- a total of $14 million -- to be kept  in reserve or spent on a long list of proposals that county department heads  say are essential.  </P> <P> Collectively, the departments want equipment and 328 new employees at a cost of  $46 million. For the long term they also say they need at least $50 million to  build new structures and to keep existing ones in repair.  </P> <P> "The dollar magnitude of these issues is far beyond any financial means the  county has of addressing them," Wittenberg said. But he said the needs are  real.  </P> <P> For example, county social services needs $1 million more to meet current  demand for welfare payments. The General Services Agency needs $4.9 million to  upgrade its computer systems and the Municipal Court needs $246,000 to hire new  judges to catch up with a backlog of cases.  </P> <P> Also needed, but not in the budget, is $630,000 for emergency and foster-care  services for children, $60,000 to continue assistance for the frail elderly and  $29,000 for a full-time dogcatcher to enforce the county leash law in Meiners  Oaks, Oak View, Mira Monte and the Ventura beaches.  </P> <P> A district attorney's program hailed for its success in spotlighting repeat  juvenile lawbreakers has lost its state grant and needs $63,000 to continue.  </P> <P> When considering these requests, the supervisors say they will have to make  their toughest choices.  </P> <P> The department heads "say they can't live without all of this," Chairwoman  Madge L. Schaefer said. "We say, 'Here's a red pencil, start prioritizing.' It  is painful for everybody. Some of these choices are just awful."  </P> <P> For example, Schaefer and Supervisor John K. Flynn disagree over whether the  county should commit $600,000 to a $4.5-million Camarillo housing project for  the homeless mentally ill.  </P> <P> Flynn, who has worked on the project for three years, is trying to gain the  commitment before budget hearings. Schaefer and Supervisor Maggie Erickson have  insisted on weighing that project against others at budget hearings.  </P> <P> At the same time, pressure grows to protect the county's buildings by paying  for maintenance that has been put off for years, Wittenberg said.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Wittenberg presented to the board a five-year building and  maintenance plan that ranked by need 97 projects that would cost $132 million.  </P> <P> In his budget summary, the chief administrator asks the supervisors to restrict  new hiring, to increase the county's construction and maintenance budgets and  to set up a $3-million fund that would pay the debt on construction bonds.  </P> <P> "We've got to do more toward preserving our assets," Wittenberg said. "We have  roof problems and computers that have to be maintained. There is less money for  personnel costs, so we are asking the board to limit these things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY PRELIMINARY BUDGET  </P> <P> APPROPRIATIONS (in thousands)  </P> <TABLE

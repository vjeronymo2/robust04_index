			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> INTEREST RATE JITTERS SEND DOW DOWN 29  </P> <P> The stock market lost another round in its battle with higher interest rates  Monday, sliding for the fourth straight session as bond yields continued to  rise.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks dropped 29.28 to 2,666.67,  extending its loss since last Tuesday to 99.10 points.  </P> <P> In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 1  in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 328 up,  1,229 down and 425 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume retreated to 136.15 million shares, from Friday's 174.26  million.  </P> <P> Analysts said fears of rising interest rates kept a dominant influence on the  mood of investors.  </P> <P> Bond prices fell steeply last week -- pushing their yields to the highest  levels in a year -- on worries of rising inflation and talk that Japanese  investors were big sellers of U.S. bonds. As bond prices fall, their yields  rise.  </P> <P> The selloff in bonds has pummeled stocks.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson heightened concerns when he  said inflation remains a problem here and abroad. Traders interpreted his  remarks to mean the Fed may tighten credit, forcing rates higher still in an  effort to choke off inflation.  </P> <P> Among individual stocks, Time Warner, which posted a first-quarter loss,  slipped 1 3/4 to 92 5/8. King World Productions slumped 1 3/4 to 35 1/2, which  some traders attributed to disappointment that takeover rumors surrounding the  stock haven't panned out.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas, which reported disappointing first-quarter results after the  close Friday, slid 3 7/8 to 51 1/4. A number of analysts cut earnings  estimates.  </P> <P> Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also closed lower Monday in dull trading.  The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues fell 156.37 points to close 29,679.07.  </P> <P> In Frankfurt, the DAX index plunged 2.5% to 1,837.50, in part a reaction to  growing militancy on the part of the country's largest union, traders said.  Share prices were also lower on London's Stock Exchange amid worries over  interest rates. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 27.9 points to end the  day at 2,159.2.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Drop in Cautious Trading  </P> <P> In the credit markets, bond prices slipped in light trading, echoing declines  overseas as the market awaited economic reports due later this week.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7/32 point, or about $2.19 per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.96% from  8.94% Friday.  </P> <P> The last time the yield on the 30-year bond was as high was last May 11, when  it stood at 9.07%.  </P> <P> The 30-year bond has plunged more than $41 per $1,000 over the past seven  trading days in response to signs of increasing inflation, a stronger economy  and worries about upcoming bond issues, including the Treasury's quarterly  refunding set for next month.  </P> <P> There were few forces acting on the bond market Monday except for a softness in  prices in overseas trading before U.S. trading began, said William V. Sullivan,  director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds.  </P> <P> Today, the government is scheduled to release reports on durable goods orders  for March and the employment-cost index for the first quarter, while the first  report on the gross national product for 1990 is set to be announced Friday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Climbs as Mark Heads Lower  </P> <P> In foreign exchange trading, the dollar rose against most major currencies,  benefiting from the West German mark's weakness.  </P> <P> Speculation that U.S. interest rates will continue to move higher as the  economy continues to expand also encouraged dollar buying, dealers said.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mixed, rising in New York after falling in some overseas  markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for April delivery  settled at $378.90 an ounce, $2.30 higher than Friday's close.  </P> <P> Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer at Harris Trust in Chicago, said the mark  was sold heavily amid worries about the consequences of planned German  unification.  </P> <P> The governments of East and West Germany have said they will merge their  economies on July 1 as a prelude to full unification, expected next year. But  the governments haven't reached a final pact on linking their currencies.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 157.55 Japanese yen from 157.60 yen at  Friday's close. Later, in London, it was unchanged. In New York, the dollar  settled at 157.55 yen, up from 157.50 yen on Friday.  </P> <P> The British pound rose to $1.6365 in London from $1.6357 late Friday. Later in  New York, sterling dipped to $1.63565 from Friday's $1.6388.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Pork Bellies Rise the Trading Limit  </P> <P> Prices of most pork belly futures contracts surged the permitted daily limit of  2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after an Agriculture  Department report showed smaller supplies than traders had anticipated.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, hog futures rallied while cattle futures were  mixed; orange juice futures fell sharply; oil futures advanced; cotton was up;  precious metals were mixed, and grain and soybean futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Frozen pork belly futures settled 1.1 to 2 cents higher, with the contract for  delivery in May up 2 cents at 64.32 cents a pound.  </P> <P> The run-up in the belly market had been expected since late Friday, when the  USDA released a monthly report showing 97.5 million pounds of the raw bacon  meat in the nation's commercial freezers at the end of March.  </P></p>

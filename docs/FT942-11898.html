			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Ekostahl sale under threat IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, and Riva, the Italian-owned private steel company, are locked in an eleventh-hour dispute which could disrupt the privatisation of Ekostahl, eastern Germany's largest steel mill. The dispute centres on the composition of Ekostahl's supervisory board after privatisation. The purchase contract, scheduled for signing last Monday, was postponed after the union and the family-owned Italian company failed to reach a compromise. The 11-strong supervisory board will be equally divided between IG Metall and Riva, with the remaining member holding a neutral position. However, according to union officials, Riva opposes IG Metall's nomination of Mr Hans Apel, a social democrat and former federal finance and defence minister. The dispute has astonished officials principally because it took the Treuhand privatisation agency more than two years to find a buyer, and protracted negotiations with the European Commission, to back a DM1.1bn (Pounds 440m) restructuring programme which Riva will undertake.</p>

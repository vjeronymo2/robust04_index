The former  president of the Iranian Republic, Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who  came to power in 1981, only to be deposed by the parliament 18  months later, rants and raves in his own particular manner,  [which is] both oriental and Parisian. Without dropping his shy  smile and virtual whisper, he said: "The government is  respecting neither its laws, nor the European extradition  treaty. Not so long ago, it was committed to `terrorizing the  terrorists.' Who said this is the country of human rights?"    Not just anybody who so desires can gain access to the large  white building, but the excessive zeal is out of place. In  front of the railings there is a police car. Behind them, in  the garden, there is a CRS [state security police] bus,  converted into a spartan antechamber, for security checks.  Visitors are always searched, but the few policemen and CRS  officers guarding the former president confirm that neither the  numbers of personnel nor the security precautions themselves  have been stepped up. A secretary wearing jeans comes to fetch  visitors on the steps, ushers them through a small door, and  guides them along the white corridors into a bare lounge. The  windows, in front of which two frozen cypress trees sway in the  wind, give out onto the Jewish cemetery. "During the 10 years  we have been here," the secretary assures me, "we have grown  used to the cold and solitude."  <H5>  Hypothesis </H5>   The master of the house, who was granted political asylum in  France, presses on angrily. How can the French government's  refusal to extradite Mohsen Sharif Espahani and Ahmad Taheri to  Switzerland be explained? Bani Sadr evokes the choice between  fear of a new wave of terrorist activity and deliberate  complicity. "Fear? I do not think so. Every time a government  gives in to a terrorist state it is encouraging acts of  violence. When Naccache was sent back to Iran they assassinated  Bakhtiar. And look at Algeria. No. There is some form of  complicity between the Iranian regime and the French  government." He then goes on to describe Iran as the "only  country in the world whose foreign policy can be summed up as  [being characterized by] terrorism, arms purchases,  indebtedness, and large-scale corruption."    But what complicity? Continuing his argument cautiously,  Bani Sadr, his gaze fixed on the floor, calls to mind Gorbachev,  abandoned by Europe, while the Iranian regime, [which is]  "greatly weakened and highly indebted, and which is only being  propped up by foreign support," has received $30 billion in  short-term aid over the last four years. "It is facilitating  the task of these governments in the Muslim world. It stands  for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. It is serving to  supplant the threat of communism and generate fear."    The revolt of Bani Sadr, [who remains] motionless, is  visible  only on his face. He interrupts himself while tea is served,  then puts forward a hypothesis: "If the French Government  committed the despicable act of sending back the two accused,  then it did so because something happened regarding Algeria.  Perhaps France obtained an undertaking from the Iranian regime  that it would stop providing military and financial aid to  Algerian terrorists. If terrorism effectively ceases in  Algeria, then France will be able to say that it scored a great  victory."    Was sending back the two accused the gift offered by France  to appease the Iranian anger provoked by the return to France of  Mariam Radjavi, wife of the leader of the People's Mujahidin and  the "future president" enthroned by her followers? For the  former Iranian president, the fury of the Mullahs' press, which  denounced French complicity with the "terrorists" of her  calibre, was only superficial and "was unleashed just after  Charles Pasqua [minister of interior] had started to chase the  Algerians out of France." More precisely, "when France consents  to send back the assassins of the Muslim Brotherhood, then it  must consider this group to be finished. The arrival of  Radjavi's wife did not inconvenience Iran; on the contrary. It  indicated the defeat of the Mujahidin."    Not a man to mince his words. He seems unaware of the danger  hanging over him. "They say that Rushdie and myself are facing  the greatest danger. However, others have written worse things  than he, and his case cropped up at the right time to deflect  public opinion from the defeat in the Iran-Iraq war." And what  was the greatest sin committed by Bani Sadr? "Representing a  democratic alternative for Iran, a unique case in the Muslim  countries. I am not afraid. Liberty for Iran calls for a  struggle."</p>

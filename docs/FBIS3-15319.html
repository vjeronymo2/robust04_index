			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Shakhnoza Ganiyeva report over video from Tashkent, </F> including recorded interview with Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian  deputy minister of foreign affairs; from the "Utro" program]    [Text] The situation on the southern borders of the CIS  countries, and primarily on the Tajik-Afghan border, is cause  for concern among many world politicians. Our correspondent  Shakhnoza Ganiyeva reports on the efforts of Russia and  Uzbekistan in the peaceful settlement of this conflict.    [Ganiyeva] Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian deputy minister of  foreign affairs, has arrived in Tashkent for a short visit.  After a series of meetings with leaders of the foreign policy  department of Uzbekistan he departed for Dushanbe. Before his  visit to Tajikistan, during an interview for viewers of this  morning program, Anatoliy Adamishin said that Russia pays very  serious attention to what is happening in this region,  particularly on the Tajik-Afghan border where the collective  peacekeeping forces are deployed today.    You will recall that according to an agreement existing  between Russia and Uzbekistan on cooperation regarding certain  international issues, these two countries are exerting every  effort in order to ease by political means the tense situation  on the Tajik-Afghan border, which in fact is the southern border  of the CIS countries.    [Begin Adamishin recording] Well, generally this is not a  very easy task, and of course it is not close--not close--but it  seems to me that gradually we are nevertheless moving towards  this matter, maybe not as fast as we would like. Presently the  most realistic option for talks are talks which can be held  under the sponsorship of the United Nations, under the UN  Secretary General's special representative Piris-Ballon. There  is an agreement in this regard both with the government of  Tajikistan and with the Tajik opposition. We are now talking  about selecting a venue for these talks.    It is our shared view with the Uzbek government and the  Tajik  government too, to begin these talks as soon as possible and  finally determine what we will talk about. But unfortunately  the Afghan groups are interfering in this matter. The  fundamentalist and extremist forces of several Muslim countries  are interfering in this. Of course, if this factor of external  interference were removed I think the Tajiks would more easily  find a common language with one another. [end recording]    Peace talks are the only possible and realistic choice. If  goodwill is demonstrated by both sides this could remove the  tension along the border, or at least alleviate it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nika Stark report under the "A Meeting with Industrialists" </F> rubric: "President Checks His Course"]    [Text] After a lengthy and difficult conversation with  Viktor Chernomyrdin about the state of the Russian economy on  Monday, Boris Yeltsin decided to hold a meeting with industry  chiefs to sound them out on a number of draft economic edicts  which have been prepared for signing. The meeting took place  yesterday -- it started in the Kremlin and finished up in a  presidential city residence. The fact that the president  decided to personally check out the views of the industrial  bosses shows that Yeltsin's displeasure with the progress of  reform has really reached a critical point.    More than a dozen industrialists were invited to attend the  meeting. According to information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY  from the presidential press service, they included Vladimir  Kadannikov, general director of the AvtoVAZ car plant; Aleksandr  Dondukov, general director of the Yakovlev Design Bureau; and  Aleksey Sharkov, general director of the Uraltransmash plant.  Although initially it was expected that the Russian government  would be represented at the level of deputy prime ministers, the  premier himself arrived in the Kremlin.    The meeting focussed on three main subjects: centralized  credits, mutual nonpayments, and bankruptcies. Boris Yeltsin  started the conversation by stating that the political situation  in Russia is getting more stable and that normal conditions for  investment have already been created. These words, however, did  not elicit great enthusiasm in the audience.    The Russian industry leaders who have managed to live  through  reform were asked to familiarize themselves with eight draft  edicts on "improving economic health" that the president is  going to sign in the near future. The edicts deal with what  Boris Yeltsin sees as the three most important problems of the  Russian economy. In addition, KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned, they  also cover matters concerning relations between the president  and the government. Initially, the president planned to sign one  blanket edict as early as 19 May, but after the meeting with  Viktor Chernomyrdin he decided to split it into a number of more  specific documents.    Presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told  journalists even before the meeting began that Boris Yeltsin  opposes centralized credits: "Given on a large scale, they lead  to inflation." According to Kostikov, Yeltsin also believes that  bankruptcies cannot be avoided altogether because supporting the  enterprises that are "obviously unviable would be to burdensome  for the state."    How the edicts "ran by" the industrialists is not known yet.  It is clear, however, that the president's turning to them for  advice in itself, which does not look like a simple political  gesture (otherwise a statement on its results would certainly  have been adopted), proves that Yeltsin is seriously  dissatisfied with the government's performance, although  excluding Viktor Chernomyrdin personally, Kostikov said.  <H5>  Commentary by the Economic Policy Department </H5>   The last official meeting Boris Yeltsin held with Russian  industrialists took place in the fall of 1991. At the time, on  the eve of price liberalization and a drastic change in economic  policy, the president's guests included members of the  Industrial Union deputy faction, which was made for the most  part of state enterprise directors. KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondents who attended the largely symbolical meeting noted  how confidently the president felt among economic managers, who  demonstrated to him their political conformism, apparently the  last trump card of the old economic elite that retained some  vestiges of political clout thanks to the existence of the  Congress of People's Deputies.    At the end of 1991, the president and Yegor Gaydar, a rising  political star, needed to insure themselves against resistance  from directors when discussing what was then the main question  of economic policy: granting the president extra powers to  carry out economic reform. Without them, the Gaydar team's  plans could not be put into practice. Having won the confidence  of provincial economic managers, Yeltsin subsequently also  received the requisite powers at the Fifth Congress.    What is it that the president and his new star, Viktor  Chernomyrdin, are trying to insure themselves against this time  around? Evidently, the key question for them is post-voucher  privatization and the related tide of bankruptcies that will  engulf the largest manufacturing enterprises in the first place.  Without drastic layoffs they do not stand any chance of  surviving. In this situation, the president would like to make  the directors his allies, not an enemy who, as ZIL director  Yevgeniy Brakov once remarked, are ready "to bring people onto  the streets under any banner." Both the Kremlin and the White  House fear that this could happen once the edicts on resolving  the nonpayment crisis, described by spokesmen for the  authorities as "a tough, imperative document," go into force.  After all, all talk by the country's leaders with the economic  elite about "boosting investment activity," taxation policy, and  customs regimes boils down to one simple business principle:  "Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours."</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PANEL WILL URGE REPRIMAND FOR FRANK;  </P> <P> ETHICS: MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKER IS REPORTEDLY BEING GIVEN THE LEAST PUNITIVE  SANCTION BY HOUSE COMMITTEE FOR HIS TIES TO A MALE PROSTITUTE.  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee has decided to recommend that the House reprimand  Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) for actions related to his relationship with a male  prostitute, congressional sources said Thursday.  </P> <P> The decision, which will be announced today, was unanimous among the 11 members  of the 12-member ethics panel who were present. Rep. Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.)  was out of town Thursday, but he was expected to agree with the recommendation  to reprimand Frank, one of two openly homosexual members of the House.  </P> <P> A reprimand is the least punitive of the official sanctions that the committee  can recommend, but it must be put to a vote by the full House. Other more  serious official sanctions that require a House vote are censure and expulsion.  A vote on the Frank punishment is expected next week.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Frank said he would have no comment on the issue until the  Ethics Committee releases its report today.  </P> <P> The decision to recommend a reprimand centers on two actions Frank took on  behalf of the prostitute, Stephen L. Gobie, a convicted felon who was living in  Frank's home. Frank acknowledged that he fixed parking tickets Gobie received  while driving Frank's car and that he wrote letters on his congressional  letterhead to court officials supervising Gobie's probation from his conviction  on drug and sodomy charges.  </P> <P> In deciding to recommend a reprimand, the committee broke a months-long logjam  over the controversial case, which has been before the ethics panel since last  September. Committee Democrats had persistently sought to resolve the case by  issuing only a letter of reproval to Frank, but several GOP members of the  panel resisted, holding out for a stronger sanction that would require action  by the House.  </P> <P> Democrats on the committee ultimately gave in, sources said, to break the  deadlock and prevent a bruising floor fight in which their party could be  portrayed as defending homosexual conduct. Democrats believed that the House  would have ultimately increased the sanction from a letter of reproval to at  least a reprimand in any case and that it was better to deny conservative  Republicans a divisive election-year issue.  </P> <P> Sources said that Democrats favoring a letter of reproval had some GOP support  on the panel, but ultimately preferred not to issue a split decision that would  invite a battle to toughen the sanction on the floor. The recommendation, one  source said, "is much stronger now than if it were divided."  </P> <P> Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) has said he will ask the House to  expel Frank once the Ethics Committee concludes its investigation. A spokesman  for Dannemeyer said the Californian intends to make that motion, but Democrats  believe they can derail it and sustain a reprimand on the floor.  </P> <P> Frank's relationship with Gobie was disclosed last August in the Washington  Times. Frank then acknowledged that he had had a brief sexual relationship with  Gobie and hired him with personal funds to serve as an aide for a period of  about 18 months. Frank said he had hired Gobie in hopes of helping him to lead  a better life.  </P> <P> But Frank vehemently denied that he had sanctioned the use of his Capitol Hill  apartment by Gobie for prostitution, saying that he had fired Gobie after  discovering that he had used his home for prostitution. Though the Ethics  Committee received some testimony alleging that Frank permitted Gobie to use  his home for prostitution, witnesses, including Frank's landlady, disputed the  charge and the panel did not find it to be credible, the sources said.  </P> <P> Frank, a leading liberal Democrat in the House, has remained influential in the  House Democratic Caucus and faces a relatively weak reelection challenge this  fall in his Massachusetts district.  </P></p>

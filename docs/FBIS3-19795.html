Instead, a majority of Tory activists actually wants the  government's blocking powers to be increased.    The Central Office survey of 3,400 Tory party members across  Britain has been leaked to THE SUNDAY TIMES and its findings  sent to John Major and Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.    Further evidence of Tory opposition to any dilution of  Britain's remaining sovereignty comes from a poll of 70  backbench Conservative MPs, conducted by THE SUNDAY TIMES over  the past three days. This shows a 3-1 majority against any  change in the present voting system in the EC Council of  Ministers, the [European] Union's key decision-making body.    Both surveys will increase party pressure on Hurd not to  give  ground at a critical meeting of European foreign ministers in  Brussels on Tuesday [22 March].    This has been called to find a way out of the voting rights  crisis caused by the EC's pending enlargement from 12 to 16  countries following the accession of Norway, Sweden, Finland and  Austria scheduled for next January.    One leading Euro-sceptic MP said yesterday that Major would  be forced to resign as prime minister if Britain climbed down on  the issue. Major would be challenged for the party leadership  in November, he said.    "If this does not come out right, the bulk of the  Conservative party might feel that John Major no longer served  any useful purpose."    Britain has 10 votes out of 76 under the current system of  voting and 23 are needed for a blocking minority. When Austria  and the Scandinavian countries join, the total number of votes  will rise to 90 and the number required for a veto -- if Britain  yields -- will rise to 27.    Britain and Spain want the blocking minority to remain at 23  but are under intense pressure from the other 10 countries.    The cabinet has authorised Hurd to make some concessions  because, without unanimous agreement, accession of the four new  members will be at risk    The confidential Central Office report on 400 group  discussions on European policy records "a substantial majority"  in favour of larger countries, including Britain, having more  voting power at the expense of smaller countries. A small  majority favoured giving Britain "additional rights of veto."    Tory activists in Major's Huntingdon constituency said the  voting system should be based on financial contributions, giving  Britain and other large countries permanent membership on a new  governing body, reducing smaller countries to rotating  membership.    The survey was conducted by the Conservative Political  Centre, the Tory think-tank, to test grassroots opinion before  the European Parliament elections this June.    Surprisingly, Tory leaders are urged to minimise attacks on  Labour and fight a positive campaign. This reflects fears that  a negative campaign would result in a low turnout damaging the  party's prospects.    In THE SUNDAY TIMES poll 48 Tory MPs rejected any increase  in  the existing blocking minority, while 17 said it should be  raised in the interests of the Union's enlargement. There were  five "don't knows."    Tory MPs are reserving their judgment on whether they will  vote against the necessary legislation this autumn. Eight said  they would vote against the enlargement bill if Britain's right  of veto was reduced; 17 would support the bill, one would  abstain and 44 said they "could not say" at present.    Tory MPs who took part in THE SUNDAY TIMES survey said  preserving Britain's existing power of veto would prove popular  with the public. "We either make a stand or we will have a  federal Europe," said Sir Rhodes Boyson, a member of the 1922  committee executive.    John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, said: "The government has  got to stand absolutely firm at 23 votes. Any move from that,  even to 23.5 would be a defeat."    Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said: "The government is telling  us that it is standing firm at the moment. A lot of people are  very doubtful about that."    Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, denied  yesterday that the Tory party was split over Europe. He told  BBC radio: "What there is in every party is a debate, and it is  unthinkable with historic change of these proportions taking  place there shouldn't be a debate."    Tory sensitivity on Europe is shown by the refusal of party  managers to allow a debate at next weekend's meeting of the  party's central council in Plymouth.    Five local Tory associations have submitted motions to the  conference in defiance of a ruling that none will be accepted.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ZODIAC KILLER AGAIN A NO-SHOW  </P> <P> The Zodiac gunman was a no-show again.  </P> <P> Police ended their fourth dragnet of the summer today without catching the  shooter, who has killed one man and injured three others since March 8 and has  promised to strike again.  </P> <P> The Zodiac task force went out Wednesday night anticipating a possible pre-dawn  attack by the astrology-obsessed gunman, who apparently has not shot anyone  since June 21.  </P> <P> This morning was considered key because it was 63 days from the gunman's last  attack. The four shootings attributed to Zodiac between March 8 and June 21  have been on Thursdays at intervals of 21 or 63 days.  </P> <P> Also of possible significance: The astrological sign of Virgo began today. The  gunman has vowed in rambling letters to police and the news media to shoot one  person for each of the 12 signs of the Zodiac. So far, his victims have been a  Scorpio, a Taurus, a Gemini and a Cancer.  </P></p>

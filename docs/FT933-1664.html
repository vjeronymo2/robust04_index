			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / East German property law comes under fire A DRAFT law on compensating former property owners in eastern Germany is unconstitutional and the entire question will have to be reconsidered, according to Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony. The question of land compensation has plagued eastern Germany's five states for three years. Any further delay in resolving the dispute is likely to hold up investments in the states. Fewer than a quarter of the 1.2m claims on 2.63m titles have been resolved. Mr Biedenkopf's comments are likely to fuel the debate on compensation in Bonn. He said in an interview that 'efforts to legislate compensation for expropriation in eastern Germany went against the wall of constitutionality' because all property was not being treated equally before the law. Those who had property confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and by the Communists between 1949 and 1990 are entitled to full restitution and compensation. But those whose property was expropriated between 1945 and 1949, when eastern Germany was under Soviet jurisdiction, have no right to restitution and only limited compensation. Mr Biedenkopf's criticisms of the draft legislation follows a special hearing of 70 lawyers and associations of the Bundestag's finance and legal committee. During last week's two-day hearing, there were faint hopes a bill setting out how to finance those whose property was confiscated would be accepted. But several lawyers said it was unconstitutional and may be referred to the Constitutional Court if the Bundestag passes the legislation. The constitutional issue stems from the way compensation will be financed. The draft law states that those who have already got their property back must contribute to a special Compensation Fund totalling DM12.5bn (Pounds 5bn). The amount they are required to pay is a third of the rateable value of land in 1935. In addition, depending on whether the property is land, a house, or a shop, this sum will be multiplied, in some cases by a factor of 10. After five years, the claimant must pay that sum to the Finance ministry, otherwise the property might be sold. Those who have got their property back argue it is unfair they should be penalised by having to subsidise the compensation fund. But those seeking compensation are just as angry. They are entitled to receive the maximum of DM950,000 in compensation, regardless of the current market value of their property. They argue that this is unconstitutional because property is not treated equally before the law.</p>

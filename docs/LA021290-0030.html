			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR'S HEALTH PLAN  </P> <P> These days the amount and quality of health care an individual receives depends  on his monetary worth.  </P> <P> The governor's health insurance plan, which will theoretically cover 4 of the 5  million currently not covered, implicitly embraces a new model -- that health  care is a fundamental right -- not just for the lucky ones in the mainstream,  but for everyone.  </P> <P> The plan divides responsibility proportionally among government, employer and  employee. If we're willing to work at it this could be a giant step towards  health care for all.  </P> <P> NANCY JONES, R.N.  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

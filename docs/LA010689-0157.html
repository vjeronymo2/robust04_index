			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> PANEL GIVES PEGGY ANN BUCKEY APPROVAL TO TEACH DISABLED PUPILS  </P> <P> A state commission narrowly decided today to allow Peggy Ann Buckey, a former  defendant in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, to teach deaf and  learning-disabled children.  </P> <P> The Commission on Teacher Credentialing voted 7 to 6, with one abstention, to  restore Buckey's teaching credential, following the opinion of an  administrative law judge. There was no comment or debate.  </P> <P> Buckey, 32, had held a permanent teacher's position in Anaheim in 1984, when  she was one of seven defendants charged with allegedly molesting students at  the defunct Manhattan Beach school. All charges against her and four other  defendants were dropped in January, 1986, for lack of evidence. Only Buckey's  brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, remain on trial.  </P> <P> Judge's opinion, Part 2, Page 1.  </P></p>

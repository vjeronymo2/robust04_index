			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS TRY TO GET 2 IN LINE  </P> <P> The Chargers have turned tough with two of their holdout players, telling  starting offensive linemen David Richards and Broderick Thompson the team will  reduce its contract offers if they do not report by today.  </P> <P> The players were informed of the team's intent by letter, General Manager Bobby  Beathard said.  </P> <P> "We've gone as far as we can go with Richards and Broderick," Beathard said  Tuesday. "We're at the maximum."  </P> <P> Beathard said Friday the team had made its final offers to the two players and  linebacker Cedric Figaro. Figaro was expected to sign and report to training at  UC San Diego today, Beathard said.  </P> <P> The agent for Thompson, Jeff Irwin of Scottsdale, Ariz., said Beathard wrote  Thompson he will reduce the offer by $5,000 if Thompson does not report by  today.  </P> <P> Irwin, who plans to speak with Beathard today, said he still considers the  team's one-year contract proposal unacceptable.  </P> <P> "This doesn't make any difference at all," Irwin said of Beathard's approach.  </P> <P> Beathard said the letter warned of further reductions if the players let  today's deadline pass.  </P> <P> The news of the threat came on the same day the Chargers announced they signed  their first player in four days -- reducing to seven the number of unsigned  players. Cornerback Gill Byrd reported to the afternoon practice after signing  a three-year contract.  </P> <P> The contract is valued at $2.2 million, including bonuses, a source said. That  is a considerable raise from the $360,000 base salary Byrd reportedly made last  season.  </P> <P> "I'm comfortable," Byrd said. "This wasn't about looking around the league to  see who got paid what. I knew what I wanted for my wife and my two children,  what would make Gill Byrd and his family happy and satisfied. That is all that  matters."  </P> <P> The signing had been expected by Beathard since Saturday morning, but Byrd did  not sign until Monday night. Byrd said the wait had nothing to do with further  negotiations; he simply wanted to delay the rigors of camp.  </P> <P> "We had the deal done," Byrd said. "It wasn't a matter of money at all. I  really honestly was trying to stretch it out. They might be mad at me for  saying that. But now I'm wishing I should have been here Saturday. I really  need the work. I'm glad I didn't stretch it out any further."  </P> <P> Byrd is coming off what might have been his best season in seven years in the  league. He led NFL cornerbacks with seven interceptions, and his 14  interceptions over the past two seasons rank first at his position.  </P> <P> Even with Byrd, the Chargers still are without half of their starting  secondary. Free safety Vencie Glenn and cornerback Sam Seale remain unsigned.  </P> <P> Byrd said he felt a little strange on the field without two of his veteran  teammates, but he did have a reminder with him. At practice, he wore two white  towels from his belt. On one he wrote in black ink Glenn's number "25" and on  the other Seale's number "30."  </P> <P> "I can't forget them," Byrd said.  </P> <P> Beathard reported no significant progress in contract talks with Glenn and  Seale or the team's two other unsigned players, linebackers Leslie O'Neal and  Junior Seau, the Chargers' first-round draft choice.  </P> <P> Defensive tackle Lee Williams also is missing from camp. He walked out Saturday  because the club said it will not renegotiate his contract.  </P> <P> If Williams does not return to camp by Thursday, the team has notified him it  will consider imposing daily fines and has the option of placing him on the the  reserve/left camp list, which would make ineligible to play or be paid this  season by any NFL team.  </P> <P> Beathard said the team has not made a decision about what it might do if  Williams does not report back by Thursday.  </P> <P> Steve Feldman, the Newport Beach-based agent who represents Williams, said  Williams has returned to his home in Florida and has no intention of returning  at this time.  </P> <P> "Lee is staying right where he is," Feldman said.  </P> <P> Williams is upset, Feldman said, because Beathard will not honor what he said  was an oral agreement by Beathard's predecessor, Steve Ortmayer, to renegotiate  Williams' contract. Beathard has said he has found no evidence of such an  agreement and that he is not bound by any oral promises Ortmayer made.  </P> <P> Contract squabbles have become a part of training camp life, but Coach Dan  Henning is trying to keep his good humor about it.  </P> <P> Asked this week about the team's latest troubles with Williams, Henning wryly  replied:  </P> <P> "I've never had a player who has ever come back and said, 'I didn't have a good  year last year and need to give (money) back.' Now when I was (coaching) in  Atlanta one year, I mentioned that on a radio show and somebody called in to  say, 'Did you offer to give anything back after the year you had last year?' I  said, 'No, but I'm not holding out.' "  </P> <P> The Chargers leave Thursday morning for three days of practice with the Phoenix  Cardinals at their training site in Flagstaff, Ariz.  </P> <P> But because of runway restrictions at the airport in Flagstaff, the team is  using one plane to fly in and two to fly out. The Charger party is safe to land  in one plane, but too large to be allowed to take off.  </P> <P> And in a request that must do little to ease nervous passengers, everyone who  intends to be on the plane is being asked to provide his or her weight.  </P> <P> "I haven't had anybody ask me that in 20 years," Henning said. "It used to  worry me puddle-jumping around going to different schools. But you have to  understand, they're trying to be safe."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Outside linebacker Ken Woodard said he has been cleared to practice after  further tests revealed he did not have a heart ailment. Woodard was  hospitialized early Friday morning after complaining of chest pains and  shortness of breath. . . . Gill Byrd is not the only one keeping alive the  memory of teammates missing from training camp. On Monday, one of the blocking  sleds bore the No. 99 jersey of Lee Williams, the team's wayward defensive  tackle, on Tuesday, it had been replaced by the No. 91 of Leslie O'Neal, the  team's holdout veteran outside linebacker.  </P></p>

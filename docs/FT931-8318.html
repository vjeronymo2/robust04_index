UMW says government measures to curb consumer spending and control inflation, particularly restrictions on hire-purchase agreements, caused a sharp drop in vehicle sales and profits. UMW says vehicle sales are likely to pick up with the recent lifting of some of these restrictions. UMW, the listed subsidiary of state-owned Permodalan Nasional, is one of the main partners, along with Daihatsu of Japan, in Malaysia's recently-announced second national car project. The initial cost of the new car project is put at MDollars 400m. Malaysia already produces the Proton car in co-operation with Mitsubishi.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / US sees progress in talks with Kozyrev on Bosnia THE US and Russia are 'drawing closer together' on an approach to ending the ethnic conflict in Bosnia, according to Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. Mr Christopher sounded hopeful after two meetings in Washington yesterday with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, who has been pursuing a Moscow peace initiative. 'We have agreed on a series of matters we might discuss with our counterparts from France and Britain over the next several days,' Mr Christopher said. Mr Kozyrev, who earlier said he saw 'positive results' emerging from the latest round of talks, said the strategy under discussion was 'very concrete'. But neither disclosed any details. Mr Christopher is to meet Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, in Washington today, and Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, next week. Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, reaffirmed US support for deploying monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border to ensure Serbia kept its promise to stop the flow of arms and other supplies to Bosnian Serbs. It was thought that the plan to deploy about 500 monitors at dozens of checkpoints might be voted on by the United Nations Security Council last night, but the UN postponed a vote. Ms Myers conceded that the US was not 'comfortable' with the proposal to set up safe havens for Bosnian Moslems. 'We believe that is a reward for ethnic cleansing,' she said. But she reiterated support for a war crimes tribunal, a proposal first advanced by the Bush administration. Bosnian Croat troops meanwhile freed 1,800 Moslem civilians rounded up during recent heavy fighting in Mostar, a UN peacekeeping force spokesman said. But he said there were still some Moslems, apparently Bosnian government soldiers, detained outside Mostar. Moslems and Serbs accused each other of launching fresh attacks yesterday in northern Bosnia and the capital, Sarajevo, a day after the Bosnian Serb leadership said it had halted military operations.</p>

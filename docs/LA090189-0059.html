			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Rival forces in Cambodia are attacking each other's supply lines as a prelude  to more intense fighting after the failure of the Paris peace talks, a Thai  military spokesman said. Lt. Gen. Narudol Dejpradiyudh said Thailand had  deployed extra artillery along its eastern border with Cambodia in case  fighting spills over. Narudol said Cambodian troops were launching attacks near  refugee areas "to cut contacts and supply lines" between civilian supporters  and the rebels. At the same time, rebels were attacking troop areas, he said.  </P></p>

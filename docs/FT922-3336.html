			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Bonn wins exemption on chemical THE European Commission agreed yesterday that Germany could continue to ban the toxic chemical PCP on environmental grounds even though European Community rules allow limited use, Commission officials said, Reuter reports from Strasbourg. It is the first time the Commission has exempted an EC country from applying legislation designed to create a single market. It decided that Germany could opt out under an article of the Treaty of Rome allowing governments to impose national rules on grounds of environmental protection. Germany requested the exemption after the EC adopted legislation last year restricting the marketing and use of pentachlorophenol - a wood and textiles preservative.</p>

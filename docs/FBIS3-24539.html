Bakh, Russian  Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 579.87]    [Abstract] Enzymes produced by microorganisms have been  used in recent years to produce compounds such as epoxides.  Certain epoxides -- ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, in  particular -- serve as the raw material for the synthesis of  many polymer- chemistry materials. An active enzyme system that  catalyzes the reaction of formation of those epoxides is found  solely in microorganisms that use gaseous alkanes as the carbon  source. Microorganisms that use propane and butane as the carbon  source, however, are little studied, although papers devoted to  propane- utilizing microorganisms first appeared in the early  1980s and, in the last two years, have focused on the study of  the metabolism of propane and various enzymes. Interest in the  distinctive properties of an enzyme system that effects a  reaction of hydrooxidation prompted the researchers here to  isolate strains of microorganisms that grow on propane, describe  the strains, and study the conditions underlying the cultivation  of the microorganisms to produce a biomass that can be used in  the reaction associated with the epoxidation of propylene into  propylene oxide. Out of 85 cultures studied, they managed to  produce a culture -- Rhodococcus erythropolis 3/89 --  that, when grown in an atmosphere of propane, evidenced an  active monooxygenase enzyme system in the cells of the  microorganisms, the system being capable of catalyzing the  sought-after epoxidation. The culture uses alcohols  (C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]4[/]), the monosaccharide  C[.sup]6[/], and disaccharides, as well as the salts of  certain organic acids. References 22: 2 Russian, 20 Western.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD BEACH-CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS UNIFY?  </P> <P> In the unification process, existing elementary and high school districts  consolidate to form one kindergarten through 12th grade system (K-12).  </P> <P> * The process begins with a petition in the city or cities that want to unify.  If signed by 25% or more of registered voters, the petition is reviewed by the  county Committee on School District organization and then the state Board of  Education.  </P> <P> * If the state board approves the petition, it will call an election in the  communities affected by the proposed unification. Unification succeeds if a  majority of voters approve the proposal.  </P> <P> The unification process generally takes one to three years.  </P> <P> There are two options available to city elementary districts in Redondo Beach,  Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach:  </P> <P> TOTAL UNIFICATION  </P> <P> All three districts would unify and take over the South Bay Union High School  District, which now operates two campuses for students in the three cities --  Redondo Union in Redondo Beach and Mira Costa in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> * Proponents say the 10,000-student, K-12 system would operate more efficiently  with one school board and one staff, and could provide a broader educational  program.  </P> <P> * Opponents say local control is more important and question the educational  and financial advantages of a larger system.  </P> <P> SPLIT UNIFICATION  </P> <P> Two K-12 districts would form along city boundaries, one in Redondo Beach and  one in Manhattan Beach. Each would absorb the portion of the high school  district within its boundaries. Thus, Redondo Beach would take over Redondo  Union and Manhattan Beach would get Mira Costa.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach, which operates one campus with about 700 students, would have  the option of joining the K-12 systems in either Manhattan Beach or Redondo  Beach.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach is already taking steps to form its own K-12 system.

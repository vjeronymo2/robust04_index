Boggiani] </F>   [Text] Fray Bentos -- President Luis Alberto Lacalle said  yesterday that he has maintained the predominance of civil  society over any other power, and that in making unpleasant  decisions he had sought "the common good."    During a break in his tour of the riverside region, the  president agreed to answer some questions from reporters during  an informal news conference at a century-old school.    Asked about his opinion on the fact that he is the president  who ordered the largest number of arrests after the military  regime, Lacalle replied that "it is not a matter of counting  episodes which, if considered in an isolated manner, have no  significance in themselves."    "We proudly assumed the post of commander of the armed  forces, and because of family tradition and because of my own  ideas, I feel deep respect for the military profession," he said.    "I visited all the military units of the country, I entered  them through the front door, I have had a frank relationship  with the commanders, and I have always observed hierarchy," he  noted.    He added that his decisions in the military area were  motivated by a high republican objective. "When I had to make  decisions -- which at times were unpleasant -- I made them  taking into account the common good, which is what I have to  safeguard, and the predominance of civil power, which was  elected and made legitimate by the votes," he said.    He also addressed the Common Market of the South, Mercosur,  in which he admitted the existence of difficulties, although he  did not rule out the possibility of finding solutions.    "There are difficulties, yes. Just think, if Germany and  France still have difficulties in achieving unity after almost  40 years of integration negotiations, imagine how difficult it  will be for us to pin the tail on the donkey," he said.    He admitted that there are difficulties between "the  Argentine and the Brazilian economies, or because of the  difference in size and magnitude between Uruguay and Brazil, or  Argentina."    "Yet in June we will have something certain. This is, in my  opinion, the most valuable result of the Mercosur summit in  Colonia," he said.    The president ruled out the possibility of problems with  Brazilian President Itamar Franco, who last Monday left before a  lunch that Lacalle hosted for his Mercosur colleagues.    "First, President Franco is a man of a certain age. He was  with us in Anchorena, and needs regular resting periods. He  does this at all meetings, so do not try to make anything else  out of it, do not try to see nonexistent things, because there  aren't any," he added.    Asked about the electoral campaign, the president said he  would prefer a short campaign.    "We want no contradictions between the electoral year and  the  work year. I believe both things can and should be done," he  said.    He added that it is necessary to have "more time to do  things, and time is necessary to advertise the proposals, the  names, and to explain why people are being asked for their  votes."    Asked about the contents of his message to the General  Assembly on 15 March, the president said he is satisfied "with  being able to show very good achievements which -- obviously --  we hope will be surpassed in the future."    He said the government has received much criticism, but  noted  that he is not in a sports game -- "to see whether we win three  to two, or five to one" -- and that he has always tried to  choose the positive side.    "I believe the current government, despite its limitations  because of its lack of a majority, as everyone knows, will  present a very good account of its term," he noted.    Asked about the constitutional reform project, he said it  will surely be approved, and despite the fact that it is not the  ideal project it is major news.    "The news I have that the Broad Front will in principle  support the initiative leads us to the conclusion that there  will be a comfortable two-thirds majority at the General  Assembly, which also leads us to conclude that the plebiscite  will also 'obviously,' as people usually put it, approve it," he  emphasized.    He said that the proposed reform "is not the reform we would  have liked. Some issues were sidelined, but the single  candidacy of parties is one of the most important issues."    "This will strongly promote party unity," the president  said.    Lacalle also emphasized the significance of the bills that  the Executive Branch submitted to Congress at the conclusion of  the interpellation of the ministers of industry and finance this  week.    The atmosphere leading to the interpellation showed that  several sectors were demanding the adoption of new measures.  Well, now the initiative is in the hands of Congress, not the  Executive Branch. We are sure there will be a rapid answer," he  predicted.</p>

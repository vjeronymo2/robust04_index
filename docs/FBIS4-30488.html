			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Tokyo University Professor Hiroshi Miyajima </F> by unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Tax System  That Revitalizes Local Areas"]    [Text] [Boxed item: "Concept for Local Consumption  Tax." The current consumption tax is collected by the  central government as a national tax and is allocated to local  governments at the rate of 20 percent of taxes collected as a  consumption transfer tax and at the rate of 19.2 percent of  taxes collected as a local government grant. In contrast, in  connection with the contemplated increase in the consumption tax  rate, the local consumption tax concept calls for direct  collection of a portion of the consumption tax by prefectural  governments for use as a fiscal source belonging to the local  government. Such a change is being proposed by local governments  and the Ministry of Home Affairs in view of the expected future  increase in the welfare burden of local governments. The  government's Tax Council has established a working committee to  study the proposal as a major issue in connection with pending  tax system reforms.]    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the new cabinet's foremost  issue is tax system reform. What sort of reform do you see as  being necessary?    [Miyajima] As suggested in the 21st century welfare vision  program, a senior citizen society will mean an inevitable rise  in the public burden whether it be taxes or social security  premiums. However, the current tax system is designed to impose  the burden on members of the active work force. A major issue  consists of changing this policy. About 15 percent of those  individuals whose incomes exceed 20 million yen are senior  citizens above age 60. On the other hand, individuals who rely  solely on government annuities for their livelihood lead  difficult lifestyles.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What should we do to cope with such  discrepancies?    [Miyajima] We should implement a comprehensive tax system  that taxes both interest income and annuity income. After  adopting a comprehensive tax system, the highest income tax  bracket, which is currently 50 percent, should be lowered to  about 30 percent. Interest can be taxed at the source at the  highest income tax rate and subsequently refunded to those in  lower income tax or tax-exempt brackets. The comprehensive tax  system should be designed so as to impose a tax burden on those  who are fortunate, whether they are in the senior citizen  bracket or in the working class, and to exempt the less  fortunate from the tax burden.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the consumption tax  where debate centers on a hike?    [Miyajima] If one looks at European nations, income taxes  and  consumption taxes will be the two main sources of revenues in  21st century Japan, and I believe the future will call for  increases in the consumption tax. The question is, what policy  areas should be covered by the increased revenues? Under the  government's welfare tax concept, even if the tax rate is set at  7 percent, revenue therefrom will have to be used to offset  other tax reductions, and only 800 billion yen will be available  for use on welfare programs. Such figures will not be acceptable  to the public. Before hiking taxes, we must clearly establish  programs so that the public will reap the benefits of taxation  in the form of improved welfare programs and improvements in  social capital. Further, unless we completely correct the  problem of "benefits of employee income tax withholdings" on the  part of employers, we will not be able to maintain any semblance  of social fairness.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The emasculation of industry is about to  become an issue, but what should we do about corporate taxes?    [Miyajima] It is said that Japan is heavily dependent on  direct taxation, but a major basis for that viewpoint is the  high ratio of corporate taxes. Of special note is that  dependence on the corporate operating tax, which is the local  government-imposed version of corporate taxes, is unusually high  on an internationally comparative basis. The world as a whole is  moving towards lower corporate taxes. If Japan alone retains  high tax rates, manufacturers will have no choice but to  transfer factories overseas, considering the additional  disadvantage of a strong yen. Maintaining economic vitality  calls for lowering of corporate taxes.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] If the corporate operating tax is reduced,  local governments will face increasing shortfalls in their tax  revenues.    [Miyajima] We can raise the consumption tax and allocate the  additional revenue to the local governments. They can be used to  cover local government expenses such as welfare and improvement  of the living environment. Certainly, local government requires  stable revenue sources. We have no alternative but to  decentralize government authority and to use taxes to improve  living standards as a means to justify the need for raising the  consumption tax.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What you are addressing is the introduction  of the local consumption tax as debated by the government's Tax  Council, is it not?    [Miyajima] The tax system recommended by Sharp that served  as  the basis for postwar tax system reform treated the corporate  operations tax as a kind of value-added tax such as the  consumption tax. A local consumption tax will translate into the  restoration of some of those original tax ideas. The local  consumption tax could result in cases where the locale of  consumption and the locale of tax payment will vary, but the  Ministry of Finance needs to deal with the issue of how to  allocate taxes as part of government decentralization programs.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] A single-year income tax reduction was  implemented as an economic stimulus measure, while social  security premiums were increased, bringing criticism from the  United States that "we lost the benefits of a tax reduction."    [Miyajima] Although for the public both areas represent  publicly sustained expense items, taxes are handled by the  Ministry of Finance, and social security insurance premiums are  handled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare with an absence of  policy coordination. Taxes and social security premiums should  be debated jointly. In the United States and Britain, social  security taxes are collected by the tax authorities, and the  same should be done in Japan. Duplicate collecting systems are  also a waste of government resources.</p>

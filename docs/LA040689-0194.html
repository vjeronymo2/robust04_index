			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> U.S. REVOKES EX-DICTATOR'S VISA  </P> <P> The United States has revoked the visa of Paraguay's ousted dictator Alfredo  Stroessner, U.S. officials said today.  </P> <P> Asked to comment on reports that Stroessner was seeking to come to the United  States for medical treatment, a State Department official said he knew of no  visa request.  </P> <P> "Stroessner's visa has been revoked. He'd have to reapply," the official said,  adding that a visa request from Stroessner, like all others, would be given due  consideration. Another State Department official, a Latin American specialist,  said it was highly unlikely that the request would be approved, given  Stroessner's background as a harsh foe of democratic liberties.  </P> <P> The United States maintains Stroessner can get adequate medical care in Brazil,  where he has lived in exile since being toppled by a former ally in a bloody  coup last February.  </P></p>

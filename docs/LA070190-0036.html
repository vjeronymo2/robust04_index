			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO EXPERIENCE A FAIR TO REMEMBER . . .  </P> <P> Waterford is celebrated for its fair, but it can be a day-trip from Washington  or an idyllic weekend getaway at other times. Surrounding Loudoun County is  known for its scenery, hunts, horse races, antiques and such historic sites as  Harpers Ferry and Oatlands.  </P> <P> The fair will be held Oct. 5-7, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. Admission is  $10 a day (children 12 and younger are admitted free). Advance tickets are  available by mail for $8 from the Waterford Foundation.  </P> <P> How to get there: Waterford is about 15 miles from Dulles International Airport  and 40 miles northwest of Washington. From Washington, take Route 7 west past  Leesburg, then Route 9 north toward Charles Town for 1/4 mile and turn right on  Route 662. Go four miles to Waterford.  </P> <P> Accommodations: The Waterford Inn (P.O. Box 227, Second and Church streets,  Waterford, Va. 22190-0227, (703) 882-3465) is a charming, Victorian bed and  breakfast in the heart of the village. Innkeeper Marcia Stover serves eggs  Benedict daily. Rooms are $65 and $75 double occupancy per night.  </P> <P> The Cornerstone (Route 1, Box 82-C, Routes 9 &amp; 662, Paeonian Springs, Va.  22129, (703) 882-3722) is a bed and breakfast on a farm four miles outside  Waterford. What it lacks in charm, it makes up for with a swimming pool and  evening deer watch. Double rooms are $65, which includes a bountiful country  breakfast.  </P> <P> Where to eat: Tuscarora (203 Harrison St., Leesburg, Va., (703) 771-9300) is  set in an attractively restored 1899 mill. It serves American cuisine with  fresh local and imported ingredients, including crab cakes, duck, salmon, veal  and lamb. Dinner for two without liquor runs $50-$60.  </P> <P> Wayside Gardens (420 W. Colonial Highway, Hamilton, Va., (703) 338-4315) offers  good food at reasonable prices in an informal, funky setting. Hickory-smoked  chicken, ribs, trout and barbecued pork are served in a tiny roadside trailer  or out back on a patio under a stand of oak trees. Try the French fries. Dinner  for two without liquor runs $25-$30.  </P> <P> For more information: Contact the Waterford Foundation, P.O. Box 142,  Waterford, Va. 22190, (703) 882-3018.

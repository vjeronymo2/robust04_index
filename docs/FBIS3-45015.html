			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai witnessed  sharp growth in its commercial sector last year, according to a  recent survey by the commercial department here.    It shows that great changes took place in the following ten  aspects of the city's commercial sector.    Despite the fluctuating market, the city achieved a  sustained  high growth in retail sales, with total turnover for 1993  amounting to 65.35 billion yuan.    This was an increase of 33.5 percent on 1992, and 11.5  percentage points higher than the national average growth rate.    In an effort to establish a socialist market economic  structure, it also expanded the market for consumer goods,  removed various kinds of fees and brought the market economy  into play.    A new system for retail price control, professional  negotiation for prices, overall control and major commodity  reserves, also took initial shape.    In addition, Shanghai established a number of exchanges and  wholesale markets of national level for petroleum, farming  resources, food, oil and meat.    Taking the food and oil exchange as an example, the trading  volume of food-stuff and oil in the first six months since its  founding reached 31.3 million tons, totalling 54.2 billion yuan.  It made contact with many of the world major food exchanges,  and with REUTER's international high-speed information network.    The city has also set up 204 regional markets, constituting  an initial commodity market system.    So far, about 700 large and medium-sized commercial firms in  Shanghai have adopted the independent management system, with  4,177 small ones practising leasing and risk liability  contracting systems.    Some 168 such companies were sold by auction, and 28  comprehensive chambers of commerce and commercial groups were  reorganized.    The city also approved 19 joint stock companies, six of  which  were listed on the market.    In 1993, the city earmarked at least 7.8 billion yuan for  commercial development, about 1.5 times the amount in the  previous year.    There were 50 major commercial projects with an investment  of  over 30 million yuan each, with 12 completed and nine in their  final stage.    To gain more strength in developing the city's commercial  sector, it made use of a total overseas investment of 660  million U.S. dollars, a rise of 2.24 times the figure in 1992.    With its 179 foreign-financed projects approved last year,  1.77 times the number of the previous year, Shanghai has now 354  foreign- funded projects, totalling about 1.9 billion U.S.  dollars, including foreign funds of 958 million U.S. dollars.    As a result, the city's total export value surpassed 100  million U.S. dollars last year, and nine overseas commercial  firms were set up.    Also, the city has quickened its paces in developing the new  commercial streets in Pudong new zone.    The two-kilometer-long Wenden commercial street was  completed  in less than one year. Its turnover in half a year topped one  billion yuan.    The building of 17 large projects in the area of the Yangpu  business center has already started. They are expected to be  completed in two years.    To meet the demands of the fast development in the sector,  the city government is also accelerating the training process  for financial and trading personnel. About 59,100 people  received various kinds of business training last year.</p>

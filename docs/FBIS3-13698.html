			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of letter by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz to </F> Jean-Bernard Merimee, French permanent representative to United  Nations and current president of the UN Security Council, UNSC;  on 16 March]    [Text] Your excellency Jean-Bernard Merimee, president of  the UN Security Council [UNSC], New York;    Sir;    On the occasion of my visit to New York as head of the Iraqi  political and technical delegation, on the occasion of my talks  with you and with members of the UNSC, in view of the fact that  the date set for the periodic review of the unfair embargo  clamped on the Iraqi people since August 1990 is approaching,  and having analyzed the situation since Iraq delivered the  official letter containing an acceptance of its commitments as  enshrined in Resolution 715 on 26 November 1993, I would like to  explain the following points:    First, Iraq has honored all its commitments as enshrined in  Section C of Resolution 687, namely, Paragraphs 8,9,10,11,12,  and 13. It also officially accepted Resolution 715 on 26  November 1993. Likewise, it has demonstrated its willingness to  cooperate with the Special Commission and the International  Atomic Energy Agency to enforce the monitoring mechanism and  achieve the objectives set forth in Resolution 687 in this  regard. It has extended all necessary facilities in this  regard. Of particular importance in this regard is the fact  that Iraq pledged in October 1993 that the Special Commission  and the IAEA would be able to conduct the required inspections,  even after Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 is implemented per  Document No. S/26,571, Paragraph 13.    The very text of Resolution 687 provides that the UNSC shall  fully implement Paragraph 22 of the said resolution immediately  after Iraq officially accepted Resolution 715, something which  has failed to materialize.    In accordance with the promises made by Ambassador Rolf  Ekeus, chairman of the Special Commission, contained in Annex 3  of the joint report submitted to the UNSC in the aftermath of  high-level technical talks held in New York in September 1993,  per Document No. S/26,451, Paragraph 14 of Annex 2, and  Paragraph 7 of the report, the Special Commission was supposed  to have quickly embarked on the official implementation of the  monitoring measures enshrined in Resolution 715 as of 1 December  1993, particularly since Iraq officially accepted the said  resolution on 26 November 1993. Similarly, the chairman of the  Special Commission should have submitted his report to the UNSC  on Iraq's compliance within a period not exceeding six months  from the aforementioned date so that Paragraph 22 may be  implemented.    Also worth mentioning in this regard is the fact that the  six-month period Ambassador Ekeus spoke about last fall was not  originally mentioned in the text of Resolutions 687 and 715.  The chairman of the Special Commission imposed it by himself or  upon the request of certain states. However, what happened is  that after about four months after Iraq's official approval of  Resolution 715 on 26 November 1993, the chairman of the Special  Commission still did not announce the date of the official start  of the implementation of the monitoring system although  monitoring procedures actually began before Iraq's official  approval of Resolution 715. This is proven by the installation  and operation of cameras in October 1993 in the al-Rafah and  al-Yawm al-'Azim locations to monitor missile testing.  Moreover, three inspection teams observed temporary monitoring  measures for three months starting from the beginning of 1993 at  the Ibn-al-Haytham Center for Missile Research and some other  important installations. This is in addition to the continuous  presence of UN teams for over one and a half years in the  al-Muthanna establishment in connection with chemical weapons.  Helicopters have been continuously and intensively conducting  sorties for surveillance purposes since 1991.    It is also worth mentioning that the IAEA emphasized in  October 1993 that it started monitoring procedures 15 months  earlier and that it was convinced that the surveillance plan was  being implemented satisfactorily and that all the IAEA needed to  inform the Security Council of Iraq's compliance with its  commitments in accordance with Paragraph 22 was Iraq's official  acceptance of Resolution 715, Document F-26571, Paragraphs 16  and 19.    This position by the Special Commission means the Commission  will be late in presenting its report on Iraq's compliance with  Section C of Resolution 687 to the Security Council so that the  latter will consider the implementation of Paragraph 22. This  means the postponement of the implementation of Paragraph 22 to  an unspecified date. The technical pretexts and excuses being  used to justify this behavior are baseless because there is no  technical reason whatsoever to make the Special Commission  abstain from officially declaring the start of the monitoring  plan.    It has become clear to us that the Special Commission's  stand is a premeditated political stand instigated by specific  parties in the Council, which do not wish to lift the unjust  embargo on Iraq and want to impose on Iraq conditions that have  nothing to do with the Council's resolutions. They announce  policies that are not related to the Council's resolutions, as  contained in the article "Confronting the Renegade Countries"  published by Anthony Lake, the U.S. President's adviser for  national security affairs, in the March 1994 issue of FOREIGN  AFFAIRS magazine and the other statements along the same line by  U.S. officials.    These quarters exploit their influence in the Council and in  the Special Commission to impose the continuation of the embargo  on Iraq.    Second: It is impermissible to make the question of  maintaining the embargo on Iraq a diplomatic or political game.  The embargo has led to the death of Iraqi citizens and to  depriving an entire people of normal living conditions. The  reports by the UN agencies confirm the tragic results of this  unjust embargo, which has been imposed for four years. Warning  237 issued in July 1993 by the joint mission of the Food and  Agriculture Organization [FAO] and the World Food Program and  the report by the FAO mission issued in November 1993 evaluating  the food situation in Iraq clearly describes this situation.  Statistics also show that the mortality rate among children  below five years of age has risen sevenfold from 1989 to 1993,  and fourfold for those above this age. The comprehensive  embargo that has been going on for four years has greatly  damaged the level of public services, education, health,  transportation, agriculture, civilian industries, environment  and all other fields.    From this premise, the approach the Iraqi people and their  leadership have toward the embargo issue cannot be one of  indulgence toward the timetable certain members or countries  view as a political game. For Iraq, this is a question of life  and death.    Third, following these experiences, Iraq is not reassured  that the Council, in view of the pressure by specific countries,  will ever fulfill its obligations since Iraq has already  fulfilled its obligations under Section C of Resolution 687.  This lack of reassurance reflects itself on Iraq's assessment  of the Council's stand on this issue and the other topics  mentioned in the other pertinent Council resolutions.    Iraq demands that the Council apply Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687 immediately and without any additional  restrictions or conditions, that it respect the provisions of  its resolutions, that it interpret them in a sound legal manner,  and that it reject the tendentious political interpretations of  its resolutions that some states are seeking to impose on the  Council. Allowing for such political interpretations of  resolutions as noted in some parties' statements not only  clashes with the provisions of the resolutions themselves, but  actually means that every party inside and outside the Council  can have its own interpretation. This means that the Council  resolutions will have no specific meaning or target.    Fourth, regarding the other topics mentioned in the relevant  Security Council resolutions, including the issue of Kuwait,  which was raised by some member states in their contacts with  the Iraqi side, we would like to point out the following:    A. This issue is absolutely unconnected with the issue of  applying Paragraph 22, in accordance with the provisions of  Resolution 687.    B. Iraq has taken measures regarding this issue in  accordance with Paragraph 2A of Resolution 686 of 1991 and  informed the Council of this. Iraq has also accepted Resolution  687, which dealt with the subject.    C. It is obvious that when the Council fulfills its  commitments toward Iraq as cited in Paragraph 22 and proves its  credibility and good intentions toward a UN member state that  contributed to the founding of the International organization,  and when Iraq feels that its rights and legitimate interests  have been respected by the Council and that its sovereignty has  been respected by the Council member states, which are violating  its sovereignty through the imposition of a ban on military and  civilian flights in the north and south and interference in its  domestic affairs in all possible means, a new atmosphere will  certainly emerge and the issue can then be discussed in  accordance with the rules regulating relations among states as  cited in the UN Charter and the Arab League Charter, which Iraq  has always respected. This atmosphere will also help the Arab  states in the region to solve their problems in a peaceful  manner on the basis of mutual respect for rights and interests  and in accordance with the rules of the Arab League Charter,  which regulates relations among the Arab states.    The Security Council can, in such a climate, also contribute  to encouraging the Arab states to achieve this objective and in  a manner that guarantees the peace and security and rights of  states in a fair manner.    Fifth, Iraq hopes these points will be studied very  carefully  by the Council. When the Security Council asks a certain state  to abide by a resolution, the resolution must also be binding on  the Council and the Council must apply the commitments  stipulated by the Charter or by the resolution itself toward  that state. Regarding the resolutions passed on Iraq, their  provisions are clear. There are commitments and steps that Iraq  is required to implement and Iraq has implemented the  substantial parts of them, including all those pertaining to the  implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. Therefore,  the Council is requested to respect and implement Iraq's rights  as stipulated by the Council resolutions. The issue cannot be  dealt with by asking one party to honor its commitments without  the other party's implementation of its commitments. The  continuation of this state, from which the Iraqi people are  bitterly and harshly suffering, places the people and leadership  of Iraq in a position that will certainly lead to a reassessment  of the situation and to an action [tasarruf] that will protect  the Iraqi people from the harm to which they are being exposed.  We are awaiting tangible steps that we hope will emerge in the  near future, foremost of which is the implementation of  Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 without additional restrictions  or conditions.    Please accept our great respect and appreciation.    [Signed] Tariq 'Aziz, deputy prime minister, New York, 16  March 1994</p>

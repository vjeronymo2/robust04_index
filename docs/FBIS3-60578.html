			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, December 1 (BTA) -- The Sofia Inspectorate  of Hygiene and Epidemiology will distribute over 2,000 condoms  today, December 1, marked as World AIDS Day. The condoms will  be handed out together with leaflets on AIDS hazards.    A round-table discussion on the problems of HIV carriers and  their families is due to start next Tuesday. The experts will  also discuss the risks to which medics are exposed.    There are 121 registered HIV carriers in Bulgaria. The  danger of the transmission of the infection through blood  transfusion has been eliminated, according to experts of the  central AIDS laboratory in Sofia. Only ten people have  contracted the disease through homosexual contacts since AIDS  tests were introduced. Heterosexual contacts remain the  principal way of contracting AIDS and this is an alarming fact,  physicians say. Eleven children were born to infected mothers,  and one of them is definitively diagnosed as infected.    The import of AZT, the only existing medicine for AIDS, is  expensive and often unobtainable.

This Time, on  Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text] The All-Russia Center for the Study of Public  Opinion conducted a representative poll between 10 January and 2  February 1994 among 3,977 residents of Russia.    The answers to one of the questions in this survey -- Do  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's activities help the emergence out of  today's crisis? -- is in percentages:    They do -- 11    They do not -- 43    They make no appreciable impact -- 11    Hard to say -- 35    Those who believe that Zhirinovskiy's activities facilitate  a  way out of the crisis are relatively more often workers and  generally men (twice as many as women), persons below 30 years  of age with an education less than secondary, with the lowest  monthly incomes per one family member and living in a rural area  and in Russia's south.    Those who, on the contrary, believe that the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia leader's activities are not helping  resolve the crisis are more often than not entrepreneurs running  their own businesses, managers of various ranks, women  generally, and people below 30 (responding to this question,  they have the greatest number of both positive and negative  answers and the smallest number of neutral answers), with a  higher, unfinished higher education, with high and medium per  capita incomes, who live in capitals, big cities, and in the  Urals.    Thus, the forecasts that Zhirinovskiy would augment the  support received in the elections are not coming true.</p>

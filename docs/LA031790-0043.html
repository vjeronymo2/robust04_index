			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BILL'S HOME RUN HELPS OCEAN VIEW TOP BARONS  </P> <P> Ocean View High School's Kevin Bill will be the first to admit his  second-inning home run against Fountain Valley Friday wasn't an awesome sight.  </P> <P> He got under an inside pitch somewhat but a strong wind helped carry the ball  over the left-field fence. Impressive or not, the hit gave Ocean View a two-run  lead and Jim Gwaltney pitched a four-hitter as Ocean View won, 8-0, in a Sunset  League opener.  </P> <P> "It was just a good, level swing," Bill said of his homer. "I was sitting back  in the box waiting for a fastball and I got it. It wasn't the best of home  runs, it was kind of high."  </P> <P> Even so, Bill, who has struggled in his first season at the varsity level,  wasn't complaining. Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett said Bill, a junior catcher  batting ninth in the order, was hitting about .150 entering the game.  </P> <P> "Is it that high?" Bill said of his batting average. "I haven't been hitting  the best. I've been trying to pull everything."  </P> <P> Bill, who was two for two, added a two-run, bases-loaded single in the third  inning to increase Ocean View's lead to 7-0.  </P> <P> "This is his first year on varsity and the pitching is a little better,"  Barrett said. "We expected him to struggle at first, but he hit the ball today.  It's great for him -- a junior in his first Sunset League game -- to go deep on  his first at-bat. He sparked us."  </P> <P> Many of Bill's teammates shared his success at the plate. Daniel Hernandez and  Keith Herrell also had two hits. Hernandez doubled off the left-field wall in  the second inning to give Ocean View (6-2) a 4-0 lead. The Seahawks finished  with 11 hits.  </P> <P> The lead was safe with Gwaltney (3-0), who struck out five.  </P> <P> "I just used my split-fingered fastball, kept them off-balance," Gwaltney said.  "That's been working all season and I'll stick with it until something  happens."  </P> <P> Gwaltney, a 6-foot-5 left-handed senior, pitched around trouble much of the  game. Fountain Valley (3-5) had runners in scoring position in four of the  first five innings.  </P> <P> "They dominated us in every area of the game," Fountain Valley Coach Ron  LaRuffa said. "We had the opportunities. We just didn't clutch up with runners  on base."  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 6, Edison 0 -- Kenny Mays pitched his second consecutive  shutout and James Marietti had two RBIs to lead visiting Huntington Beach (6-4,  1-0). Mays (2-1), a senior left-hander, allowed six hits and struck out seven.  The senior also shut out Loara in the Loara tournament on March 5. Edison  dropped to 5-2, 0-1.  </P> <P> Marina 5, Westminster 2 -- Marc Newfield had a solo home run and a sacrifice  fly for visiting Marina (3-4-1, 1-0). Robin Lindsey, David Schultz and Travis  Boyd each had two hits and scored a run for Marina. Westminster is 2-6, 0-1.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Firms will need to install and operate compliance systems to comply with an effluent limitations guideline for the PFPR industry. The manufacture, installation, and operation of these systems will require use of labor resources. To the extent that these labor needs translate into employment increases in affected firms, a PFPR rule has the potential to generate employment benefits. If realized, these employment benefits may partially offset the employment losses that are expected to occur in facilities impacted by the rule. The employment effects that would occur in the manufacture, installation, and operation of treatment systems are termed the ``direct'' employment benefits of the rule. Because these employment effects are directly attributable to the PFPR rule, they are conceptually parallel to the employment losses that were estimated for the facilities that are expected to incur significant impacts as a result of the PFPR rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to direct employment benefits, the PFPR rule may generate other employment benefits through two mechanisms. First, employment effects may occur in the industries that are linked to the industries that manufacture and install compliance equipment; these effects are termed ``indirect'' employment benefits. For example, a firm that manufactures the pumps, piping and other hardware that comprise a treatment system will purchase intermediate goods and services from other firms and sectors of the economy. Thus, increased economic activity in the firm that manufacturers the treatment system components has the potential to increase activity and employment in these linked firms and sectors. Second, the increased payments to labor in the directly and indirectly affected industries will lead to increased purchases from consumer-oriented service and retail businesses, which in turn lead to additional labor demand and employment benefits in those businesses. These effects are termed ``induced'' employment benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of these possible employment benefits, EPA estimated the labor requirements associated with compliance with the PFPR effluent guidelines Option 3/S. Labor requirements_and thus the possible employment benefits_were estimated in two steps. EPA first estimated the direct employment effects associated with the manufacture, installation, and operation of the PFPR compliance equipment. Second, EPA considered the additional employment effects that might occur through the indirect and induced effect mechanisms outlined above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Direct Labor Requirements of Complying With the PFPR Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA separately analyzed each component of the direct labor requirements: Manufacturing, installing, and operating compliance equipment. The analysis is based on the compliance cost estimates developed for the economic impact analysis of the PFPR regulation. Compliance requirements and associated costs were estimated for each facility in the Survey that was assessed as incurring costs. For the labor requirements analysis, compliance costs and their associated labor requirements were considered only for those facilities that were not assessed as a baseline closure, or as a closure or line conversion due to compliance. That is, the analysis considered the labor requirement effects associated only with those facilities that, upon compliance with the rule, would be likely to continue PFPR production activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimated the direct labor requirements for manufacturing and installing compliance equipment based on the cost of the equipment and its installation, and labor's expected share of cost in manufacturing and installing the equipment. The labor input was estimated in dollars based on information contained in the National Input-Output Tables assembled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce. In particular, the direct requirements matrix identifies the value of each input, including labor, that is required to produce a one dollar value of output for a subject industry. The industries in the input-output tables that were used as the basis for this analysis are: the Heating, Plumbing, and Fabricated Structural Metal Products Industry (Bureau of Economic Analysis industry classification 40) for compliance equipment manufacturing; and the Repair and Maintenance Construction Industry (Bureau of Economic Analysis industry classification 12) for compliance equipment installation. The dollar value of labor's contribution was converted to a full-time employment equivalent based on a yearly labor cost of $35,800 (1988 dollars, including benefits and payroll taxes). Because compliance equipment purchase and installation are considered one-time outlays, the labor requirements for these activities were annualized over a 10-year period at the seven percent social discount rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the analysis of the labor required to operate compliance equipment, EPA used the estimates of annual labor hours that had been developed as the basis for assessing the annual operating and maintenance costs of the PFPR regulatory options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From these analyses, EPA estimated an annual direct labor requirement of 131 full-time equivalent positions for complying with the Option 3/S PFPR regulation. Of this total, the annualized labor requirements for manufacturing and installing compliance equipment are 71 and 27 full-time equivalent positions, respectively. Compliance equipment operation is estimated to require 32 full-time equivalent positions annually. The corresponding annual estimated payments to labor is $4,676,685 (1988 dollars) (see Table 13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

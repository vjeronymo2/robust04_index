			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Berisford in profit after three years of losses BERISFORD International, the property and agribusiness group which on Friday saw its Pounds 184m offer for C&amp;J Clark turned down by the shoe company's shareholders, will today announce a return to profits after three years of losses. It is likely to reiterate plans to buy other businesses. Interim results are not likely to include the costs of the abortive offer for Clarks. These are thought to be well under Pounds 1m, with many advisers' fees geared to success. Clarks' costs may be much higher. Its merchant bank, Schroders, held a full-scale international auction for the company approaching more than 40 possible bidders after shareholders agreed last October to seek a buyer. Schroders, whose position has been questioned after Friday's shareholder vote to keep the group independent, said yesterday it foresaw a continuing relationship with Clarks. Questions hang over the future of Clarks' chairman, Mr Walter Dickson, and six other directors. Attempts to oust Mr Dickson last October could be repeated, although on Friday shareholders promised to end the disharmony which has bedevilled the company. Berisford is expected to show a small pre-tax profit for the six months to end-March. This is thought to have come from asset sales rather than trading. Operations are likely to have shown a small loss. In the comparable period, Berisford lost Pounds 57.4m before tax on an FRS 3 basis, after Pounds 49.2m of provisions.</p>

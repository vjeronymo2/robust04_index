			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Fashions in green - Eco-clothing is a long-term trend, not a fad Ecology-consciousness has arrived in the apparel industry. While eco-fashions have not yet been paraded down the haute couture catwalks of Paris, Milan or New York, their niche in the multi-billion dollar apparel industry is growing. Since 1991, green-minded consumers have increasingly been able to find stylish clothing made from raw materials and with processes that match their concerns about the environment. Though many smaller companies were the first to make eco-minded clothes, large, mainstream US manufacturers, such as Esprit, Levi Strauss and VF Corp, are jumping on board. 'This is a trend, not a fad,' says Andy Baker, marketing chief for VF's new O Wear division. The 'O' is for organic, because the clothes are made from organically grown cotton. VF, a Fortune 500 apparel maker whose brands include Lee and Wrangler jeans and Vanity Fair and Barbizon lingerie, made Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) worth of O Wear sales last year and expects that to more than triple this year. Esprit, the women's sportswear maker, is in the second year of its Ecollection, a special line of 'green' clothes. At retail level, sales ran to about Dollars 4m last year, three quarters of which came from Europe. Levi Strauss, the jeans-manufacturer, is preparing a launch of a 'naturals' line of jeans. 'Naturals', market tested last year, are made with naturally coloured cotton, eliminating the dying process which is a leading polluter. Even footwear companies are entering the field. Nike, the athletic shoe and apparel company, has introduced a shoe whose outersole is 10 per cent re-cycled (reground) production scrap. Nike says the process cuts down the need for source material and helps reduce waste headed for landfills. The company plans to expand the process to all shoes in its outdoor cross-training and trail lines. The exact size of the eco-clothing market is unclear. The American Apparel Manufacturers Association, which represents two-thirds of all apparel production in the US, would not venture a guess. Carl Priestland, the association's chief economist, says: 'No one knows. It depends on how you define 'green'.' But those in the ecology movement have a definition. Carl Frankel, editor of the Green Market Alert newsletter in Bethlehem, Connecticut, says that eco-clothes are garments made with the following: 'Green' or 'natural' cotton, which is conventionally grown but processed in an environmentally improved manner, for example by reducing the use of resins and toxic chemicals; Organic cotton, which is grown without the use of chemical fertilisers or pesticides and involves crop rotation and other special farming methods; Naturally coloured cotton, which grows (both organically and conventionally) in colours and does not require dying; Recycled, post-consumer clothing, which is shredded and respun or woven. By this definition, Frankel estimates conservatively that eco-clothes sales were Dollars 20m last year and will rise to Dollars 80m by 1996. But some feel the figure is higher and the growth of the market more explosive. The increase in farming of organic cotton would seem to be an indication of where the market is going. Melanie Gordon, senior analyst with the National Cotton Council in Memphis, Tennessee, calculates that some 8,000 acres of organic cotton were planted last year, with a 6m lb harvest. She expects that to double this year. Eco-clothing manufacturers, big and small, are uniformly optimistic about prospects. For example, Ecosport, a small, New Jersey-based company which was one of the pioneers in the market, believes it will sell more than Dollars 5m worth of its organic cotton clothing this year, up from Dollars 1m in 1991 and Dollars 3.5m last year. VF's Baker claims that 'demand is blowing out the doors', from speciality shops. And Esprit expects its Ecollection to make a significant jump in sales next year when distribution is moved beyond its own 56 stores. Yet this is a business with more than profits in mind. 'It's sort of a mission,' says Lynda Grose, the lead designer for Esprit's Ecollection, from Manchester, England. The Ecollection began in 1990 as an in-house research and development project. 'It was never really intended to be a business,' says Grose. But it is now well regarded in the company and some of its accessories and processes are being expanded into Esprit main lines. The sense of mission is strong in this niche industry. Barbara Lesser, a founder and designer for the Santa Monica, California firm 'Wearable Integrity', says that while her clothes sell in up-market department stores and speciality shops, she shaves margins to price them competitively. 'We're committed to making this happen,' she says. A barrier to wider consumption of eco-clothing is its price premium. Organic cotton, for example, is scarce and costs twice as much as conventional cotton. Naturally coloured cotton, which was pioneered as a commercial product by Sally Fox, an entomologist in Bakersfield, California, is even more expensive. In addition, the 'greener' processes, such as the use of natural dyes or synthetic dyes with a low environmental impact, are applied on a small scale and are more costly. But Fox, who is Levi's prime supplier and widely considered a star of the eco-clothing world, is confident that demand will grow and that as it does production will be spurred and prices will come down. At present, eco-clothing makers say that as long as their products are in the same price range as designer-name sportswear, consumers will buy them. But they note that while consumers - whom they are trying to educate about eco-clothing - are drawn to the ecology concept, they are not buying just because it is a green product. The challenge is 'to come up with things that break through the granola image,' says Grose. 'The items that sell the best are the ones that look the best.' Fox, with a pioneer's conviction, is sure it will catch on. 'The public loves it,' she says.</p>

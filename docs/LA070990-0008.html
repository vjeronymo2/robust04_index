			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVES ON HOUSTON SUMMIT;  </P> <P> OUR STRINGS CAN PULL SOVIET UNION FORWARD;  </P> <P> EUROPEANS HAVE OPENED THE DOOR ON AID TO MOSCOW. IF AMERICANS DON'T WALK IN  SOON, WE COULD BE LOCKED OUT.  </P> <P> Although there have been no parades or peace treaties, it is clear that the  Cold War is over -- and that we have won.  </P> <P> Now, will the reward be an expanding economy, new foreign markets and global  stability? Or will the end of 40 years of confrontation bring layoffs,  recessions and uncertainty? The answer depends largely on what happens in  Houston this week, when the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial  democracies meet to set the rules of engagement for the new economic order.  </P> <P> At the economic summit, the victors will address how to help the vanquished  join the community of free nations. In the absence of American leadership, West  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterand will step  forward to propose an emergency aid package to speed the Soviet Union's  transition from a Marxist command economy to a free market, and from  authoritarian rule to democratic pluralism. Kohl has also announced $3 billion  in bilateral loans. Canada provided $500 million in credits during President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit in late May. Even British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher's government, which is openly skeptical over changes in the Soviet  Union, now concedes that it is not a question of whether we assist the Soviets,  but when and how.  </P> <P> While President Bush talks about change, our economic competitors are investing  their money. Unless we move soon, we could be left in the rear guard or on the  sidelines.  </P> <P> What should be the American response? We should start by recognizing our  interest in seeing economic reform succeed in the Soviet Union. Only when that  nation has moved toward a market economy and democratic values will it step  forward as a full partner in the new global economy. Nothing is more exciting  than the prospect of a prosperous Soviet market of 289 million consumers eager  to buy Western goods. By contrast, nothing is more dangerous than a shaky,  bankrupt superpower hiding behind thousands of nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> A package of economic and technical assistance to support economic freedom and  democracy in the Soviet Union is the surest path toward the long-term peace we  have sought through four decades of Cold War.  </P> <P> Such a package would not include blank checks. Without fundamental reform in  the Soviet Union, foreign aid only reinforces existing inefficiencies. Instead  -- and working with the other industrial powers -- we should provide assistance  that encourages, reinforces and validates real Soviet change. All Western aid  must have strings attached, strings that draw the Soviets forward to  responsible international behavior, free markets, reduced military spending and  respect for human rights.  </P> <P> While Gorbachev may back away from a head-first plunge into a market economy,  viewing a radical reform program as too dangerous or destabilizing to adopt  overnight, it is nonetheless essential that the Soviets take at least some  measured steps in the free-market direction. Moscow should proceed with  monetary reform to rebuild faith in the currency, set up commercial banking  institutions to channel savings into new private enterprises, break up large  government monopolies and back away from central planning. It should also allow  free-market forces to set virtually all prices, controlling only  ultra-sensitive products like fuel, rent and food.  </P> <P> Such reforms would create the momentum toward economic freedom. The West should  match these actions, step for step, with:  </P> <P>  -- Loans, food assistance and export credits to relieve short-term  dislocations in the Soviet economy.  </P> <P>  -- Full membership in Western economic and financial organizations.  </P> <P>  -- Technical assistance, financial support and political-risk insurance for  U.S. investors in joint ventures -- especially in regions where liberal  reformers are in power -- to foster a Soviet private sector.  </P> <P>  -- Preferential tariff rates and relaxed restrictions on non-military  high-tech exports as soon as the Soviets enact liberal emigration policies and  abandon coercive pressure on the Baltic states.  </P> <P> The unavoidable truth of our time is that communism is dead. The unanswered  question is whether it will be replaced by democracy and free enterprise --  opening up new markets for our goods and creating new jobs for our workers --  or something alien and chaotic, perhaps even a misshapen replay of communism's  past failures.  </P> <P> The Europeans have opened the door. If we do not enter, we could be locked out  of new opportunities generated by exports to a reviving Soviet economy. Our  leadership in this, the first grand cooperative enterprise of the post-Cold War  era, will set the tone for continued U.S. leadership in the decades ahead.  </P> <P> The stakes could not be higher. The threat could not be more real. Fifty years  from now, the 1990s will be remembered as the time when America reinvented  itself once again, and in so doing led the world into a new era of peace and  prosperity. That is, if we have the vision to see the change in the course of  history and the courage to adjust our course to meet it.  </P></p>

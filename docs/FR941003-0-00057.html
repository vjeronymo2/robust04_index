			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA declines to amend the provision as suggested by the comment. The provision is consistent with section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act by beginning the 180-day period on the date the first ANDA applicant has notified the agency that it has begun commercial marketing of the drug product or the date of a court decision holding the patent to be invalid or not infringed, ``whichever is earlier'' (see section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act).) Allowing an applicant to begin marketing before the commencement of the 180-day exclusivity period would, in effect, extend the exclusivity period in a manner that is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the act. FDA also notes that the court decision must be a final decision from which no appeal can be or has been taken (see 54 FR 28872 at 28895).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 79. FDA received four comments regarding ``substantially complete'' applications under proposed &sect;314.107(c)(2). Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(2) would consider an ANDA to have been ``previously submitted'' with respect to another application for the same listed drug ``if the date on which the first application was both substantially complete and contained a certification that the patent was invalid or not infringed is earlier than the date on which the second application was both substantially complete and contained the same certification.'' The proposal also stated that a ``substantially complete'' application ``must contain the results of any required bioequivalence studies, or, if applicable, a request for a waiver of such studies.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asked FDA to provide information as to which ANDA was the first ``substantially complete'' ANDA. The comment suggested that disclosing such information did not present any confidentiality problems because the ANDA applicant would have revealed the existence of the ANDA when it provided notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of the patent to the patent owner and NDA holder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees, in part, with the comment. Disclosing whether an ANDA had been received for a specific listed drug would enable manufacturers to decide whether to develop a generic version of that drug and perhaps conserve the manufacturer's resources. Such knowledge could, in turn, effectively reduce the number of applications for the same product and thus also conserve agency resources. The agency, therefore, will disclose whether an ANDA has been received for a particular drug, but, in order to preserve the confidentiality of the applicant, will not disclose when the application had been received or the applicant's identity. Potential applicants who wish to inquire whether an ANDA for a specific drug has been received can contact the Regulatory Support Branch (HFD&hyph;615), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0315.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80. Two comments disagreed with the language regarding ``substantially complete'' applications. One comment said FDA should only determine whether an ANDA contains a bioequivalence test or waiver request and not focus on the results of any required bioequivalence studies. The second comment suggested that a ``substantially complete'' ANDA be one that contained a paragraph IV patent certification and a bioequivalence study that is ultimately approved. The comment said this change would deter ANDA applicants from submitting ``superficial'' bioequivalence tests. The comment also suggested that the agency establish criteria as to whether changes to an ANDA were so substantial that the ANDA could no longer be considered as the first to be filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the proposed rule, FDA has clarified its policies regarding the submission of incomplete ANDA's. Under the earlier policy, ANDA applicants could submit ANDA's with bioequivalence study protocols and could provide bioequivalence study data at a later date. This policy resulted in a significant and unwarranted expenditure of resources in reviewing applications that had little potential for approval. Thus, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of April 28, 1992, FDA announced that it would no longer accept an ANDA that does not contain complete bioequivalence study data if such data are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for approval (see 57 FR 17950 at 17959). A ``substantially complete'' application, therefore, should have a complete bioequivalence study, or other information to show bioequivalence that could support approval of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. FDA will examine the bioequivalence information upon submission and, if the agency determines that the bioequivalence information is facially insufficient to support a finding of bioequivalence, the agency will not review the application under &sect;314.101(d). A decision by the agency after receipt of an application that the bioequivalence information is inadequate for approval does not necessarily mean that the application was not substantially complete at the time of submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also declines to establish criteria to establish whether changes to an ANDA were so substantial that it could not be considered to have been filed. While certain changes in an ANDA (e.g., a change in the listed drug) would amount to a new filing for purposes of &sect;314.107(c)(2), other changes (e.g., minor labeling changes) would not. The agency believes a case-by-case approach is preferable because many products and manufacturers may be unique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 81. The agency, on its own initiative, has revised the provisions in &sect;314.107 (c)(2) and (c)(3) to clarify their intent. These provisions address the issues of the ``applicant submitting the first application'' for exclusivity purposes, what constitutes a ``substantially complete'' application, and the effective dates of approval for subsequently submitted applications if the first applicant is not ``actively pursuing'' approval. FDA has made similar editorial changes at &sect;314.107(c)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 82. Four comments addressed proposed &sect;314.107(c)(3). The proposed provision would make an ANDA that had been received after FDA had already received an ANDA for the same drug immediately effective if the agency concluded that the first ANDA applicant ``is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application.'' Three comments asked FDA to define the phrase ``actively pursuing approval.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this rule, the phrase ``actively pursuing approval'' is intended to encompass a drug sponsor's good faith effort to pursue marketing approval in a timely manner. In determining whether a sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval, FDA will consider all relevant factors, such as the sponsor's compliance with regulations and the timeliness of its responses to FDA's questions or application deficiencies during the review period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 83. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c)(3) to make a subsequently received ANDA immediately effective upon a finding that the first applicant is not actively pursuing approval ``if [the subsequent application is] otherwise eligible for an immediately effective approval.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency agrees and has amended the provision accordingly. This change will remind applicants that FDA will make approval of a subsequent abbreviated application immediately effective if it satisfies all applicable requirements and FDA has concluded that the first applicant is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Bombay court orders liquidation of bank THE BOMBAY high court yesterday ordered the liquidation of Bank of Karad, a small private bank which owes more than Rs4bn (Pounds 76m) to Standard Chartered Bank of the UK. At the request of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, the court appointed Mr SN Lele, an official of Bank of Baroda, as provisional liquidator for Bank of Karad. The reserve bank had already appointed another Bank of Baroda official as chairman and asked other top executives to resign after it emerged that Bank of Karad, which had capital of Rs4.5m and deposits of Rs731.8m at March 1991, had issued Rs9bn of bankers' receipts, a form of IOUs. Bankers' receipts are at the heart of the scandal afflicting India's financial markets. The receipts, through which a bank pledged later delivery of securities already paid for, were used as collateral to fund share purchases in Bombay's then-booming stock market. However, many of the securities supposedly backing the receipts did not exist or had not been purchased. Officials of Standard Chartered were surprised at the speed with which the Reserve Bank moved to liquidation proceedings. The UK bank is expected to file its claims before the Bombay high court today. Indian legal experts say that the chances of Standard Chartered recovering even a part of the Rs4bn in the immediate future are bleak. The bank has made a Pounds 50m provision for possible losses. Standard Chartered in Bombay refused to comment on the bank's exposure to unreconciled bankers' receipts for the interbank transactions with another bank, Metropolitan Cooperative Bank, which issued receipts for an estimated Rs5bn. The Economic Times, an Indian newspaper, reported that the receipts were issued to Standard Chartered. Mr S Venkitaramanan, Reserve Bank governor, said action was being taken against Metropolitan Cooperative Bank.</p>

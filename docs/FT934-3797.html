			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Dealers in the London derivatives market began to concentrate on the exceptionally high level of open interest in Footsie futures as activity drifted back to pre-Budget levels yesterday, writes Peter John. By the close of business, the series in the FT-SE 100 Index which expires at the end of next week still had open interest above 50,000 lots. That figure represents the number of contracts bought as well as the number of contracts sold. Some traders are concerned that those with long positions, mostly investment funds and asset allocaters, might find it diff-icult to close out their positions over the next eight trading days. Many of the contracts will be rolled out to the next contract, which expires in March. For the rest, the longs - ie buyers - will need to find a willing seller. There is a feeling that because of exceptional profits made this year and over the life of the December contract some of the shorts, who are mainly marketmakers arbitraging between the level of the futures contract and the level of the market, might prefer to let positions expire thus taking the cash but creating an imbalance in the market. The December contract opened at 3,252 and saw some if its unusually high premium to cash narrow slightly before hitting 3,251, by the official close. At that level however it still showed a premium of 13 in contrast to a fair value estimate of zero. Options turnover returned to a desultory level of 23,102 with stock options activity headed by Lasmo as one investor sold 500 February calls and bought 500 May calls to roll forward the investment.</p>

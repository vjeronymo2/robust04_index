			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Official Chronicle" column: </F> "Augmenting the National Army--A Matter of Primary Importance"]    [Text] On 13 May in the Republic of Armenia there was a  conference devoted to questions of organizing the spring  recruitment. Participating in it were state ministers,  ministers, Defense Ministry and Internal Affairs Ministry  workers, managers from the procuracy, military commissars,  chairmen of ispolkoms [executive committees] of the Yerevan city  and rayon councils, and also through conference  calls--representatives of ispolkoms of city and oblast councils  of the republic.    Opening the conference, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan  emphasized the importance of the recruitment in the matter of  reinforcement of the national army and defense of the country  under the conditions of the continuing conflict in the region.  The prime minister noted the need for both extensive explanatory  work and the creation of a certain military-patriotic atmosphere  by the mass media, on the one hand, and, on the other, a refusal  to put up with draft dodgers and deserters and the application  of punitive measures against them within the framework of  existing legislation. In this connection Grant Bagratyan  reported that by a government decree the republic procuracy was  asked to file criminal cases in keeping with the established  procedure against citizens who evade the draft and to take  measures to return to Armenia draftees who are outside the  republic. The corresponding instructions were also given to the  ministries and departments.    Mr. Bagratyan also emphasized the need to ensure fairness  and  openness in the matter of conducting the draft and expressed the  hope that, as a result of the hard work, the draft would go  successfully.    State Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan talked about the problem of  conducting the draft, introduced the members of the regional  coordination commission, and addressed the tasks facing each  rayon. The state minister condemned the bad system that exists  whereby through fair means or foul every soldier is transferred  to the military unit of their native region. The draft will be  conducted according to a nonregional principle, he said, and  nobody will serve in his own rayon. The state minister denied  rumors that 18-year-old draftees would be sent to the border  regions of combat activities and called them absurd. Describing  the draft as a task of not simply republic but of national  significance, Vazgen Sarkisyan emphasized the importance of  universal support for this work, noting that it would be  desirable for deputies of the Supreme Council and parties and  public organizations to participate in it. The state minister  said that work was being done in this area and there had been  appreciable results.    A number of other issues related to the draft were also  discussed at the conference.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA NIGUEL LAND GIVEAWAY: FINDING CULPRITS IN LOST SPACE  </P> <P> We are writing to express our support of the strong action taken by the Laguna  Niguel City Council July 17, with regard to the giving away of 96 acres of  public parkland to developer Taylor Woodrow.  </P> <P> Mayor Patricia Bates has set the right standard in declaring the City Council's  determination to protect the public's property and rights. Councilman James F.  Krembas and all other city and county officials are public servants who must  honor the trust that has been placed in them.  </P> <P> Too often in the last 15 years, citizens have felt that county government is  largely in the service of developers who seek to exploit communities and  destroy the landscape for corporate and personal profit.  </P> <P> Communities such as Laguna Beach, which have actively sought to protect their  environmental heritage and remain good places to live, are accused of being  exclusive and shutting the door to others.  </P> <P> Developers seek to present themselves as serving the interests of the people by  building as many houses as possible. They act as though it is outrageous and  unfair for a community to try to protect itself from their profiteering and  destruction of precious natural resources. And never mind that they take their  profits and live elsewhere.  </P> <P> How did 96 acres of public parkland come to be lost? Since Laguna Niguel is a  new city without its own planning staff, it has been under contract with county  government to provide the proper protection for local land-use. The present  situation again brings to light the grave concern that for many years county  officials have not been adequately protecting our communities. They have  instead pursued a high-growth policy without regard for the extreme density and  traffic problems that would result.  </P> <P> A good example of county insensitivity to land-use can be seen in the large  portion of the Binion hillside and ridgeline above South Laguna which was left  under county control (now part of Laguna Niguel) when South Laguna was annexed  to the city of Laguna Beach, deliberately creating problems that can only be  solved by large expenditures on the part of Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel became a city to prevent violations of the public trust regarding  land-use. Many communities are seeking to incorporate for similar reasons.  </P> <P> The illegal disposal of public parkland causes us to wonder what other  improprieties may have occurred under county control. In the past we have  condemned the high-growth policies so rigorously pursued by the county.  </P> <P> Now we must question the very integrity of documents signed by county  officials. If Councilman Krembas did not draw up or approve the document which  bears his signature, who did?  </P> <P> MARY DOUGLAS  </P> <P> DAVID SMITH  </P> <P> Sunset Community Action Committee  </P> <P> South Laguna  </P></p>

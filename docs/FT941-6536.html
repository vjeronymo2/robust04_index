			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen at Midland &amp; Scottish Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, which is in the process of running down production at the Emerald oilfield east of Shetland, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.4m for the six months to end-June last year. The group blamed the loss on an exceptional charge of Pounds 17m, representing the write-off of capital expenditure incurred in drilling additional wells in the field, which proved unsuccessful. Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 35.4m. In first-half 1992 the group lost Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds 1.9m. For the 1992-93 year the group was Pounds 113.6m in the red after writing off the entire value of the Emerald development. In January Midland said its two subsidiaries that ran the oilfield had sent a proposal to their creditors for a voluntary arrangement under the Insolvency Act 1986. Trafalgar House, owner of the Emerald Producer rig, and MSR, which owns the floating storage unit, have halved their charter rates until creditors have been paid 50p in the pound. The field's life now hangs on when the operating equipment can be redeployed. Midland's future depends on Spirit of Columbus, a floating production platform being built in Italy. The group said delivery was planned for the coming summer, and described prospects for its deployment as 'good'. Administration expenses, including charges associated with the Italian project, were up from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 4.8m. Net interest payable was Pounds 3.5m, compared with a previous Pounds 300,000. Losses per share were 9.12p, against with 0.93p last time.</p>

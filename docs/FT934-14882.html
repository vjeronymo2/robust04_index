			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Commercial vehicles boost Chas Sidney STRONG GROWTH in commercial vehicle sales helped Charles Sidney, the Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle and passenger car dealer show a near 40 per cent increase in operating profits for the year to August 31. Charles Sidney, part of Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is coming to the market via a placing with institutional investors and public offer early next month. The pathfinder prospectus for the proposed flotation was issued yesterday and revealed full year operating profits of Pounds 2.44m, up from Pounds 1.76m the previous year, on turnover 35 per cent higher at Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 41.3m). The group, which ranks as the largest Mercedes-Benz commercial dealer in the UK and the sixth largest car dealer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 1.7m). Commercial vehicles, which have underpinned the group's performance in recent years, contributed Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 1.25m) of last year's operating profits and Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 21.7m) of total turnover with sales of new vehicles jumping from 648 to 993. The strong performance of the commercial vehicles segment offset the weakness of new car sales which reflected the delayed recovery of the luxury car sector and customers waiting for Mercedes' new models which were launched at the start of October. Mr Raymond Edwards, Albert Fisher's director responsible for the European food processing division including Charles Sidney, who will leave the group to become Charles Sidney's executive chairman, said sales of luxury cars have begun to pick up since the end of August. The final prospectus, together with details of the offer, is due to be published on October 27 and dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on November 10.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Calls to backdate change in insolvency law resisted The government last night resisted demands for the emergency legislation on insolvency to be made retrospective to 1986 to safeguard the position of insolvency practitioners appointed as administrators and receivers to companies in trouble. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, described as 'speculative' estimates that practitioners could face claims of up to Pounds 1bn if the Insolvency (No 2) Bill, which yesterday passed through all its Commons stages, takes effect only from March 15 1994. From that date the bill protects administrators and receivers from the consequences of a Court of Appeal ruling on Paramount Airways which in effect made them responsible for the contractual employment obligations of a company after 14 days. The Confederation of British Industry and the British Bankers' Association have called in the past few days for the legislation to be made retrospective as far back as the introduction of the 1986 Insolvency Act. The latest estimates from the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency suggest about Pounds 500m could be at stake in additional employment obligations following the ruling. Mr Hamilton told MPs it was possible that an appeal against the judgment could still be considered by the Lords in its judicial capacity. The bill comes before the Lords today. He said the government had not been persuaded that the arguments about the possible liabilities facing accountancy firms justified making the legislation retrospective to December 31 1986. Mr Hamilton assured MPs that if developments resulted in the accountants facing a 'serious problem' the government would be prepared to consider the matter further. Mr Stuart Bell, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said parliament should use its power to pass retrospective legislation if the original 1986 Insolvency Act, which had given rise to the problem, was shown to be defective. Meanwhile, the administrators to Paramount Airways at accountancy firm Touche Ross are expected to start their appeal to the Lords today. If the appeal fails practitioners may search for alternative test cases, delaying further payments to creditors while the position is clarified.</p>

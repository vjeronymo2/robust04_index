			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Travel: Christmas Krakow keeps the faith - Christian Tyler absorbs history in a city where Christmas eve tradition includes church and a family feast, yet Auschwitz is just a short taxi ride away At 11.30pm an invisible hand unlocked the doors of St Mary's basilica on the corner of Rynek Glowny, the market place which is the largest medieval square in Poland. By the time the Archbishop of Krakow and a dozen assistant priests had mounted the high altar to celebrate midnight Mass there was standing room only. Even after the chimes of midnight had rung, people continued to press through the doors and into the throng. The altar was scarcely less crowded than the nave. In the centre, surrounded by acolytes, stood the archbishop, a white-haired, dignified figure who looked too old to be successor to the last incumbent of the Krakow episcopate - Karol Wojtyla, otherwise known as Pope John Paul II. Lanterns radiated weak light, while the chains from which they hung disappeared into the basilica's gloomy vault. In the dimness, all eyes were drawn forward to the tableau vivant being enacted on the high altar where a gilded reredos, 13 metres high, reflected the light of a thousand candles. Polish Catholicism may be primitive, and the power of the Church may be extraordinary in a post-communist country, but it has certainly guaranteed the survival of the Christmas traditions which many westerners feel have vanished from their own festival. That afternoon there had been a double queue of last-minute customers in the liquor store as the shops closed up and families retreated indoors for wigilia, the Christmas eve celebration. Poles, it is well known, like to drink; but they do not celebrate Christmas by getting legless and spewing in the street. No doubt they spend more money than usual, but they do not behave as if Christmas were the joyful summit of the retailing year. It was dusk, about 4.30pm, when the waiter brought the bill for our Christmas lunch. He had been smilingly solicitous all afternoon. Now he was showing signs of distress, for he wanted to go home to his family. The bill he laid amid the ruins of the feast had so many digits in it there was hardly room on the paper. The majestic sum of 1,487,000.00 zlotys was in reality a modest outlay for a west European. A six-course meal for three people at the Wierzynek, the best-known restaurant in the city, including vodka with the herring a la cracovienne, Ukrainian champagne to accompany stuffed cabbage, soup, mushroom pierozki and breadcrumbed carp, cost less than Pounds 50. On Christmas Day, the streets of Krakow were deserted. In the country suburbs, however, on the high banks of the river Vistula, families were out walking. Many carried yew branches, or whole Christmas trees, which they were taking to the cemeteries to lay on the graves of their dead. In the church of one convent, a small boy stood in front of the crib, mesmerised by a beautiful angel with blonde hair who waved a torch back and forth with her clockwork arm. Southern Poland was grey and drizzling. The snow which had whipped across the German-Polish border and had been piled high in upper Silesia had now petered out altogether. Even on the high Tatras, which stand like a rampart 100km south of Krakow, there was only the thinnest coating of white. If this part of traditional Christmas was missing, it did not matter. The old city centre of Krakow, formerly the royal capital, is one of the most atmospheric in Europe. Although the walls surrounding the 13th-century town were knocked down in the early 19th century and the moat filled in to make gardens, the medieval bones are clearly visible underneath their neo-classical facelift. From the surviving barbican on the north-east side to Wawel Castle by the Vistula on the south is a 10-minute walk with enough inside its 78 hectares to occupy 10 days. In the centre of the great square where traders sell flowers, cheap woollen jumpers and fake caviar stands the colonnaded Cloth Hall. Its long arcade of shops is a good place for Christmas presents: amber jewellery, embroidered linen, carved wooden figures and boxes, fur caps and waistcoats. (All Poland, of course, is selling Red Army surplus such as badges, caps, binoculars, knives, bayonets and - under the counter - guns.) Beside the Cloth Hall is the tower of the former town hall. Its main surviving office is to house a good beer cellar with permissive opening hours. On the western side is the Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest in Europe, where Copernicus studied astronomy and the present Pope - who apologised for the Roman Catholic church's anti-Copernican mistakes - studied drama and literature. Leonardo da Vinci's 'Lady with an Ermine', rated by some his finest portrait, is to be found in the Czartoryski museum. At any time of year, Krakow is the obvious place from which to make the pilgrimage to the former death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau. If you have the stomach for it, there is a lot to be said for hiring a taxi and going alone in the cold, grey midwinter when the excursion coaches have departed. Auschwitz I, a solidly-built pre-war army barracks, is where the exhibits are laid out and the history explained. But to see the vast Birkenau camp under a blood-red sunset and to stand by the twisted ruins of the gas chamber-crematoria where more than a million Jews were exterminated is to understand what is meant by 'the banality of evil' - industrialised mass murder. Steven Spielberg's film masterpiece, Schindler's List, has no doubt helped put Krakow on the map. It was to Krakow that Oskar Schindler came to start in the war supply business, here that the sack of the long-established Jewish ghetto of Kazimierz (so horrifyingly depicted by Spielberg) occurred, and close by that the Plaszow labour camp was set up. From its bland modernised interior it is not obvious, however, that the large Cracovia hotel, a few hundred yards from the city centre, was where Schindler is said to have ingratiated himself with his Nazi protectors. Yet Krakow is a rare example of a continental European city that shows no wartime scars. Nor would the visitor guess that a few kilometres from the centre is the vast steelworks of Nowa Huta, responsible for half the country's output and most of the city's pollution. The works was put there deliberately by the former communist government to give bourgeois Krakow some appropriate proletarian balance. It has done no damage to the spirit of the place - and especially not to the Christmas spirit.</p>

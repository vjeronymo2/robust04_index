			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by Laure </F> Mandeville; place and date not given: "Zlenko: `Russia and  Ukraine Are No Enemies'"]    [Text] [Mandeville] To what extent did the Moscow  negotiations make it possible to settle the Crimea question?    [Zlenko] The problem of Crimea should not be linked to these  negotiations. What we discussed with the Russians was the  question of the Black Sea Fleet. On this point, we made  progress, but not significant progress.    We are in agreement on the partition of the fleet, but there  has still been no compromise on the question of bases, despite  Ukraine's concessions. We have accepted that the headquarters  of the Russian fleet should be in Sevastopol, and that  Sevastopol should be a Russian base, but Russia is demanding  other bases, which is not acceptable. We are prepared to make  arrangements for the location of other port facilities but we do  not want to have conditions dictated to us.    This is our territory, but we say that this problem  absolutely must be solved and that the status of the fleet must  be decided once and for all. Second, Russia must force its  military to accept the law of the foreign country in which it is  based. The fleet must not interfere in Ukraine's internal  affairs.    [Mandeville] Is it doing so now?    [Zlenko] Yes, we think that there was interference in the  conflict between Kiev and Simferopol. The statements by the  Black Sea Fleet press center are misinformation and increase the  risks of provocation in Crimea. We have warned Moscow  journalists of this danger. Some are spreading rumors about the  arrival of Ukrainian troops, which I refute. The Ukrainian  troops which were there are still there, but there are no new  ones.    [Mandeville] With regard to Crimea, [Russian Foreign  Minister] Andrey Kozyrev spoke of the danger of  "Yugoslavization."    [Zlenko] Parallels of this kind are not appropriate. It is  true that there is a risk of provocation, but we will solve this  question. It is an internal Ukrainian problem. We will not  tolerate any attack on our country's territorial unity, which  the 1992 Crimean Constitution calls into question. Calling our  territory into question would not only be a danger for the  Ukrainians, but for the whole of Europe.  <H5>  Ultranationalist Machinations </H5>   [Mandeville] There is a debate in Ukraine on the best way of  facing the secessionist threats. Some think that the unitarian  state should be strengthened, whereas others think that a  federal state would make it possible to avoid losing  everything...    [Zlenko] I do not deny that there are supporters of a  federal state in our country. But I think that there is no  reason to move in that direction. All the opinion polls prove  that this does not interest the population. In my view, this  idea is being promoted by some determined circles which are  inspired by Russian ultranationalist circles. Their aim is to  undermine the Ukrainian state.    [Mandeville] It is being said that at the forthcoming  presidential election, it will be the man in favor of  rapprochement with Russia who will win in Ukraine?    [Zlenko] We must not make enemies of Russia and Ukraine.  Some people in Moscow, but also in our country, are trying to  set us against each other, but Ukraine has never turned away  from Russia, it is our neighbor, our history, it is a special  partner, the dominant factor in our foreign policy. We must be  close while being independent and equal states. The problem is  that there is an imperialist syndrome in some Russian political  circles, the idea that we will all return to Russia, as before.  No! There is a new situation, there is no longer any big  brother or little brother.    [Mandeville] Do you fear the results of the forthcoming  Russian presidential election, the arrival in power of  extremists like Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy?    [Zlenko] This danger has been allayed. But the social  problem which was their breeding ground remains. It must be  remembered that the success of the economic reforms will be  decisive.    [Mandeville] What conclusion do you draw from the Conference  on Stability in Europe?    [Zlenko] I welcome this initiative by France. This  conference was welcome, because it answered the questions which  are worrying our continent. It put a finger on the problem of  minorities and borders. It gave a clear warning to those who  still cherish the idea of maintaining a divided Europe or  putting up new walls between nations. The conference showed  that we must think about a strategy for the whole of Europe in  order to prevent the return of history's demons.</p>

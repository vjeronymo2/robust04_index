			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / NHS staff crisis feared as forecasts attacked The National Health Service could face a shortage of nurses and occupational therapists in the next few years because of flaws in the system for predicting staffing needs. A report by the Institute for Manpower Studies for the NHS executive says regional health authorities in England have been forced to make 'heroic assumptions' about future staffing needs for nursing and occupational therapists in England. The report, which has not been published, says workforce planners face 'lack of reliable data' in deciding on the allocation of training places. Since the 1991 NHS reforms the 14 English regional health authorities have been responsible for identifying demand for newly qualified staff. The NHS executive conducts an annual poll of each authority and develops a five-year plan to make sure a national supply of trained staff is maintained. But the report says the short-term nature of the service contracting process with staff makes long-term forecasts difficult. In addition, it says, little historical data about turnover of staff is available to the regional health authorities. The length of training programmes and the over-reliance on current productivity levels also skews forecasts, it says. The report points out that private-sector healthcare employers are often unwilling or unable to contribute to the exercise and therefore training needs can be underestimated. The report says that workforce planning is not given a high priority. 'All too often,' it says, planning appears to be 'delegated to junior staff in personnel, who lack the authority to challenge staffing assumptions'. The Department of Health said the executive was considering the recommendations in the report, which also recommends options for improving data collection and forecasting methods. The Royal College of Nursing, the College of Occupational Therapists, and Unison, the main health service union, say that regional determination of training needs is flawed because it leaves gaps in forecasts. They believe central determination of needs is required. Mr Tom Bolger, RCN director of education, said the number of training places for nurses had dropped 33 per cent since 1987. He said he had heard reports that health authorities in London and the Thames region could not fill nursing vacancies and that advertised jobs in nursing journals had doubled in the past 12 months. He said: 'Unless something drastic is done to increase the number of students then we are likely to have a crisis of shortages in the future.' Ms Georgina Smith, director of education at the College of Occupational Therapists, said: 'I think there is going to be a training crisis as the health service continues to be devolved.'</p>

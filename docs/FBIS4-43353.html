			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. P/94/38: "Commission Adopts a European </F> Action Plan To Combat Drugs (1995-99)"]    [Excerpt] On a proposal by Mr. Flynn, Commissioner  responsible for justice and home affairs, the Commission today  adopted a communication on a European action plan to combat  drugs.    Introducing the communication Mr. Flynn said that "drug  addiction and drug trafficking constitute a major threat to the  citizens of Europe. This threat demands a coordinated response  by the Community and the member states. This document provides  not only a framework for the Union's future action to combat  drugs but also an integrated action plan."    The Treaty on European Union provides a new framework for  combatting drugs which considerably strengthens the Community's  powers and enhances cooperation between member states. The  Treaty offers new possibilities to consolidate existing  Community achievements and promote the further development of  union-wide strategies. The prevention of drug dependence and  the fight against drugs are specifically mentioned in the  provisions introduced by the Treaty on public health and  cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs. The  Commission wants to ensure that this new legal basis for action  is exploited to the full in order to promote the highest  possible level of cooperation and coordination. This will mean  that the drugs scourge is tackled in the most comprehensive and  effective way.    Commissioner Flynn pointed out that in line with the wishes  expressed by the Brussels European Council of 10 and 11 December  1993, the action plan provides a new framework for a drug  control strategy covering three key elements:     -  prevention of  drug dependency    -  reduction of drug trafficking, and    -  action at the  international level.     Each of these key elements is examined in the communication.  Measures proposed within the framework of the new union action  plan are designed to consolidate existing Community achievements  in these fields and take advantage of new possibilities opened  up by the Treaty on European Union in the fields of public  health (Article 129), common foreign and security policy (Title  V), and cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs  (Title VI).    The communication also highlights the importance of  coordinating anti-drug measures at national level and within the  Union as a whole in order to enhance the overall coherence of  the Union's actions.    Furthermore, in line with the emphasis given to the fight  against drugs within the Union, drugs had been singled out as a  priority of the common foreign and security policy.    Considering the heavy impact of the drugs problem on the  political and socio-economic development of developing  countries, drug control will be given a stronger emphasis in  political discussions with developing countries including ACP  states.    The action plan will also be supplemented shortly by a  further and more detailed communication to the Council and  Parliament concerning Community action in the field of drug  dependence under Article 129 with a proposal for a decision on a  programme of Community action in that field.    Commissioner Flynn expressed the view that the action plan  "will provide an effective framework for the Union to fight  against drugs and drug dependence in the foreseeable future."

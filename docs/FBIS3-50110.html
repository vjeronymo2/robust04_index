			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 23 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Army  General Milan Gvero on Sunday categorically denied that Bosnian  Serbs had had anything to do with the massacre of six children  in Sarajevo's locality of Alipasino Polje on Saturday and blamed  the outrage on the Moslem leadership.    "After checking out with all of our units, I positively  state  that no shell whatsoever has been fired for days from our  positions on the broader area of Alipasino Polje," Gvero told  TANJUG.    "Judging by reports in the Moslem media and the media which  indiscriminately pick up such reports, the Moslem propaganda  machinery has again staged another anti-Serb performance," he  said.    Moslem reports say that the shell fired on Alipasino Polje  on  Saturday killed six children and one Moslem soldier but "give no  names of the victims, which may be significant," said Gvero.    "If the incident actually took place, and I very much fear  that it did, then it was nothing but a repetition of the  breadline massacre in Sarajevo's Vaso Miskin Street in 1992 when  Moslem criminals and warmongers murdered 16 innocent civilians,"  he said.    The speed with which Moslem Premier Haris Silajdzic urged  Butrus-Ghali to approve air strikes against Bosnian Serb  positions is indicative of this scenario, said Gvero.    "The Moslem propaganda machine has deliberately disregarded  the opinion of U.N. officials that the perpetrators of the  incident could not be established, and has been quick to tell  the world that the deadly shell had come from Serb-held  nedzarici."    "We are sure that the world has woken up to the transparent  set-ups of the Moslem war propaganda," said Gvero.    "This time we have every right to expect the world to  condemn  the Moslem leadership for its evidently stage-managed attack on  its own citizens, who were children in this case which makes  matters worse, and who were sacrificed to the higher interests  of war."    "We expect protests and condemnation to come also from the  Moslem people who are being made the collective victim of the  blind irrationality of their religious leaders," said Gvero.</p>

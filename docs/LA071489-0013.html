			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISED HIGH COURT HEARINGS BACKED;  </P> <P> PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE ENHANCED, STEVENS BELIEVES  </P> <P> U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said Thursday that public  understanding of the high court would be enhanced if proceedings in some of its  major cases were televised.  </P> <P> "In my view, it's worth a try," Stevens said on the final day of the annual 9th  Circuit Judicial Conference at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> Stevens said that several cases have prompted such great public interest that  court-watchers have stood in line for hours hoping to gain admission to oral  arguments inside the high court building in Washington. "I thought it was sad,"  Stevens said, that the court had not allowed the proceedings to be televised.  </P> <P> Jesse Choper, dean of the law school at UC Berkeley, said that Chief Justice  William Rehnquist has been considering the possibility of televising court  proceedings.  </P> <P> Timothy Dyk, a Washington lawyer who represents a dozen news organizations,  including ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC, said the networks conducted a demonstration at  the Supreme Court last November. The goal was "to show the advances that have  been made in technology and how it is possible to cover the court without  disruption," Dyk said.  </P> <P> Rehnquist and Associate Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy attended  the demonstration, Dyk said, but did not express an opinion. Dyk said news  reports have suggested that some justices are favorably disposed to the idea.  And in a reply to a letter from journalists in April, 1986, Justices Stevens,  Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan went on record in approval of  televised hearings.  </P> <P> Rehnquist's predecessor, Warren Burger, was unalterably opposed to allowing  Supreme Court proceedings to be televised. Burger said the presence of cameras  would have a negative effect in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Under questioning by two federal judges and a Los Angeles lawyer, Stevens  avoided such controversial topics as the court's recent decision upholding a  Missouri law that bans abortion in public hospitals and forbids public  employees from assisting in abortions. Stevens was one of four dissenters in  that case.  </P> <P> He did respond, however, to a question from U.S. Judge Mary M. Schroeder of  Arizona about fractious relations among the Supreme Court justices. Several  justices have strongly criticized their colleagues in written opinions this  term.  </P> <P> "I think it is unfortunate that we sometimes get carried away in our views of  our colleagues," Stevens responded.  </P> <P> "It's poor advocacy in opinions. . . . It sets a bad example, and it does not  reflect the true personal relations in the court," Stevens added.  </P> <P> He noted that Brennan, one of the court's most liberal members, and Justice  Antonin Scalia, on the conservative side, "have disagreed strongly" in  opinions. But "they're the best of friends, they get along beautifully,"  Stevens said.  </P> <P> Asked about what role the public should play in the judicial process, Stevens  said he thought it had an "important function" in jury trials. However, Stevens  expressed reservations about the need for federal judges to stand for  reelection, as those on most state courts must do after their initial  appointments. Federal judges have lifetime appointments from the President.  </P> <P> "I have strong feelings, that for the sake of the process itself . . .  appointment and tenure have a value that far exceeds the value of election,"  Stevens said.  </P> <P> During a panel discussion, Stevens said he thought that a judge who did not  have to stand for reelection might have responded differently to Cincinnati  Reds Manager Pete Rose's suit challenging the impartiality of Baseball  Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti.  </P> <P> A Cincinnati trial court judge, who faces reelection next year, has issued a  temporary injunction barring Giamatti from holding a hearing on whether Rose  violated major league baseball rules by gambling on games. Further hearings are  scheduled later this month in an Ohio federal court.  </P> <P> In a matter of considerable interest to the 300 judges and lawyers gathered  here, Stevens said that, for the present, he saw no need to split the 9th  Circuit, the largest of all the federal circuits.  </P> <P> There has been a move afoot, spearheaded by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), to  split the circuit, which stretches from Guam to Montana and includes nine  states. Senators from the Northwest have said the circuit is too large and  excessively dominated by California judges.  </P> <P> At the conference, a resolution urging that the circuit not be split was  overwhelmingly approved by judges.  </P> <P> "As of now, if it isn't broke, you don't need to fix anything," Stevens said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ted Rohrlich contributed to this story.  </P></p>

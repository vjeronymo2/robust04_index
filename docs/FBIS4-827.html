			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The proposed march through Johannesburg by the  Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] Youth Brigade tomorrow has been  postponed. It's expected to go ahead on Tuesday, instead, along  with the stayaway. March organizers today blamed what they  called technical problems for the postponement. The say they'll  make a final decision on the march late tomorrow. Police say  they'll continue with their contingency plan in the city  tomorrow, treating it as a crime prevention exercise. Arlene  Wainstein reports:    [Begin recording] [Wainstein] The IFP Youth Brigade is  adamant that the march will go ahead in Johannesburg. They say  it will be a peaceful one, but they are determined to defy the  ban imposed by the regional commissioner of police.    [Youth Brigade spokesman Charles Loliwe] We actually appeal  to him as a party that he should give us a permission so that we  should march in the Johannesburg city to mourn for our people  who were brutally murdered, because if he is going to disagree  to grant us a permission to march in Jo'burg [Johannesburg],  what I'm going to say is, we are going to march by force in  Jo'burg.    [Wainstein] The pivotal part of any IFP march through the  streets of Johannesburg will be a memorial service here at ANC  headquarters in Plein Street. In line with ancient black custom  the spirits of those who were killed here just two weeks ago can  only be laid to rest once a wreath-laying ceremony has been held  at the spot. The IFP Youth Brigade says ban or no ban, this is  one duty they simply have to perform. It's a sentiment that was  echoed today by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    [Buthelezi] So I think that 53 people that were killed in  cold blood has made the blood of many people to boil, and I  think the least that they would like to do is to pay tribute to  them. I don't think there are any other motives as far as I can  see myself. [passage omitted]    [Wainstein] The Youth Brigade says the rolling mass action  will continue until after the election. Among their plans, the  march is on the Independent Electoral Commission and the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange. They say they want to coerce big  business into intervening to postpone the elections until the  IFP is part of the process. Also on the cards is a  demonstration at SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  headquarters. This is to protest, what they call, the ANC  allegiance of board chairman, Dr. Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, and the  assistant to the chief executive, Mr. Zwelakhe Sisulu. [end  recording]</p>

There was a 7.1 percent increase last  year. At the first industrial policy conference of Mecklenburg  Western Pomerania in Klink, near Waren, Rexrodt said on  Wednesday [23 March] that this land was one of the regions that  was going through particularly profound structural changes.  However, the upward trends were consolidating in the key  industries of food, agriculture, and shipbuilding.    The Federal Government has so far supported this conversion  with some 17 billion German marks [DM] in subsidies, which has  helped to create or save a total of 445,000 jobs. According to  Rexrodt, the Baltic Sea Highway A 20 will make the coastal  region of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania more attractive to  investors.</p>

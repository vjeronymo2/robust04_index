			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Observer: Overdone Is Germany being wholly up-front about its threatened ban on British beef because of 'mad cow disease'? Some of its ministers seem to be rather partial to the stuff, even in an election year. At a ministerial dinner in Dortmund City Hall on Saturday night, hosted by employment and social affairs minister Norbert Blum for his EU colleagues, beef was definitely the flavour of the evening. First course: Fillet of beef Carpaccio. Third course: Fillet of Angus beef. The Dortmund Rathaus catering staff were under strict instructions not to comment on the source of the fare. The German-British Chamber of Commerce, meanwhile, had no such inhibitions about identifying the nationality of the fillet steak served at its annual dinner at the Dorchester last week. It was British. Well, it would be mad to miss that opportunity, wouldn't it?</p>

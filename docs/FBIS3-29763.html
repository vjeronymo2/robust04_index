In this  way, he stressed that Japan held fast to its stand at the recent  Japan-U.S. summit talk.    As an example, he cited the following dialogue: President  Clinton insisted on saying that "although both countries signed  more than 30 accords after the 1970's, none of them was  observed." In response, the prime minister said: "I do not  think what you have said is right. Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone [NTT] Company purchased $17-million-worth of goods in  1980. But, the NTT is buying $780-million-worth of goods now.  This is an increase by 46 times. Can you still say that no  progress has been made?"    Moreover, Hosokawa also touched on the issue of auto and  auto  parts, which was a focal point at the new economic talks, and  said: "Cars with a steering wheel on the right-hand side are  driven in 18 percent of the countries in the world. There are  many European cars, such as Mercedes and BMW's, in the Japanese  market. Since U.S. companies are not trying hard to sell their  cars in Japan, it is not right for you to say we are not buying  U.S. cars." Reportedly, Hosokawa pointed out lack of efforts by  the United States.</p>

There is effectively  no legitimite rule in the town, says a cable from the deputy  head of administration of the town, received by ITAR-TASS.    The Vladivostok mayor's office is blockaded by OMON [Special  Purpose Militia Detachment] men who have been brought in by  Lebedinets, vice governor of Maritime Kray. They are not  allowing lawyer Ulitskiy to see the mayor, although Mayor Viktor  Cherepkov has been detained, a report from the mayor's office of  the town points out. The fact that yesterday the mayor had a  serious heart attack is being ignored, and doctors who arrived  in an ambulance have told him to stay in bed and have forbidden  him being questioned.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / BBC faces sponsorship accusation: Concern over tobacco promotion THE BBC was accused yesterday of providing free advertising for tobacco companies through its coverage of of sporting events supported by tobacco-related sponsorship. The government-funded Health Education Authority suggested that BBC viewers of sporting events last year could have watched 'tobacco company or brand images for up to 25 minutes of every hour of transmission' - equivalent to as many as 50 30-second tobacco advertisements an hour. The report suggests that tobacco companies have discovered an attractive commercial deal: whereas paid-for television advertising could cost some Pounds 1 1/2 m an hour, tobacco-sponsored televised sport amounts to some 300 hours annually on the BBC, with just Pounds 5m spent by the companies on sponsoring events. Cigarette advertising on television was banned in the UK in 1965. That ban was extended to include all tobacco advertising last October when the government acted on the 1989 EC broadcasting directive. The EC council of health ministers is due to meet soon to consider a draft directive to ban all forms of tobacco advertising. The authority's report highlights the means by which tobacco sponsors spread their message on BBC broadcasts. Placing tobacco company and brand names of boards in key positions. Putting company logos on sport participants. Visual and verbal references to sponsors in commentaries and studio event-title shots. Echoing the company colours and brand names in other features of the event, such as umbrellas or refreshment stands. The BBC said that its policy on sponsorship was subject to 'very strict guidelines', particularly in the case of events sponsored by tobacco companies. The guidelines went beyond the voluntary code agreed by the government and the Tobacco Advisory Council, which lays down the number of shots of posters, logos and other promotional items. The BBC said the authority's recommendation that it should cease covering tobacco-sponsored events would 'conflict with our obligations to our licence-payers'.

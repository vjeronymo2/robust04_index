			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gay Bekhor, HA'ARETZ Arab Affairs Correspondent </F>   [Text] "If the future Palestinian self-rule will err by  inefficiency, corruption, and tyranny, it will meet in a short  time the fate of the secular regime in Algeria, which received  broad credit at the beginning, and now holds onto power with all  its strength versus a violent and popular radical Islamic  opposition. That is one of the most serious problems that await  the Palestinians--and, therefore, us as well. As it appears from  the outside, the leadership in Tunis, or at least part of it, is  not ripe for the transition from leading an underground to  leading a state or a self-rule"--warns MK [member of Knesset]  Efrayim Sne, with regard to the day after the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. Sne, who holds the title of doctor of  internal medicine, was the chief of civil administration in  Judaea and Samaria and the commander of the security region in  Lebanon.    [HA'ARETZ]A key question in the conduct of the  negotiations for the Cairo agreement was the strengthening of  'Arafat and the members of his circle. Too good an agreement  from our viewpoint was liable to weaken 'Arafat, and in that  situation it would not be honored by the Palestinian  population.    [Sne] We are interested that the side that reached the  agreement with us will be able to return to the Palestinian  public, which it represents, and to show it achievements--as  long as these do not impair sovereignty. We were flexible on  those symbols that do not have security implications.    [HA'ARETZ]Can 'Arafat flourish any achievements at all  following the Cairo agreement?    [Sne] The achievement is that they are partners in the  management of the crossing points, without receiving  responsibility on the subject of security. If they would hurry  up and prepare administrative institutions, they would have  first received the money from the international community, and  would display achievements in economics and infrastructure. To  my sorrow, they are not doing that. We cannot compensate them  generously on the security issue for what they cannot ensure for  themselves in the financial and material spheres.    [HA'ARETZ]Can the Cairo agreement as it stands, without  the freeing of prisoners, without the returning of expellees,  and without the transfer of civil authority, be accepted by the  Palestinian public in the territories?    [Sne] When the agreement is translated in the field, the  Palestinian public will be able to see with its own eyes what is  most important to it: a certain withdrawal, that will herald  larger withdrawals in the future by the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces]. But according to the surveys that are appearing, even  today the support for the Palestinian opposition is not high.  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] won about 15-percent  support, and the left fronts are winning a few percent, so that  the picture is not so bleak.    [HA'ARETZ]What is your opinion of the two approaches  that prevail among us--one, that the PLO will serve us as a  shield against fundamentalist Islam, and the other, which is  based on fears of cooperation against us between Hamas and the  PLO?    [Sne] There are among us persons who, out of lack of  knowledge of the Palestinian reality, err with illusions. There  are those who get caught up in fear and those who get caught up  in false optimism. There are those who fear that the PLO will  try to outfox us by secret cooperation with Hamas, and that  while it is the contractor of peace, Hamas will be the  contractor of terror. Those who believe this do not understand  that the antagonism between the secular PLO and the religious  Hamas is sharp and cannot be resolved, because it stems from a  diametrically opposed conception of the nature of the future  Palestinian society. There is no compromise here, and the  Palestinians must make decisions tomorrow morning. For example,  how much religious studies will be in the schools and how much  secular studies, what will be the religious content in the  Palestinian schools, what will be the dress of the female  employees of the Palestinian administration, will a female clerk  in the driving license office in Bethlehem come to work in  jeans. The battle will be fought over such things.    On the other hand, there are those who see in their mind's  eye how the Palestinian police keep apart for them the Ez a-Din  al-Kassem gangs and the settlements of the Katif Bloc. That is  without any foundation. In the entire Palestinian family, there  are three sons, the Fatah, the Popular Front, and another one  that is the Hamas or the Islamic Jihad. They will be ready to  fight each other over the control of the Palestinian street, but  not in order to protect Avi Farhan or Tzvika Hendel.    [HA'ARETZ]Will a war of all against all break out in  the territories after the withdrawal of the IDF?    [Sne] The fear of 1936-39 is still in them, the fear of  civil  war is rooted among them, and, of course, this depends on the  question whether a vacuum will be created between the rule of  the IDF and Palestinian rule. But, in my opinion, the key  question is rooted in the quality of the self-rule that the  Palestinians will establish. If it will have the correct balance  of authority and efficiency without despotism and corruption--it  will be able to impose its authority. If the balance is  disturbed, it will be difficult for that rule to exist, and the  proof of that is given in Algeria.    A corrupt Palestinian rule will encourage, more than  anything  else, the rise of Hamas, and even today part of the support for  Hamas stems from lack of trust in the manner in which the PLO  establishment is running things. Here the question is: how will  the senior Palestinian administration be appointed. They have  both in the territories and in the diaspora enough excellent  individuals to staff these positions. The question is whether  they will choose the good persons, or perhaps other  considerations will guide them. Today they have a big advantage  compared with Third World states: they can build their  administrative government system from the bottom up and on a  healthy basis. But if the beginning is bad, this system will  crumble very quickly. The countries that are donating $2.2  billion to the Palestinians will require only the slightest  excuse in order to cancel their donations. If they do not see  that an efficient apparatus is receiving the money, spending it  efficiently, and supervising it, they will renege."    Sne says that he bases his statements on conversations that  he had recently with those responsible for this in the European  Community, and, according to him, they are aware of the problem.    [HA'ARETZ]The question is not only for the  Palestinians, it is also ours, because we will be tied together  after the signing of the agreement.    [Sne] We cannot impose either efficiency or democracy. At  the  same time, they have lived alongside us for 27 years and learned  from us the good and the bad. They, for example, watch our  television in the evening, and see that because of a discount in  a hotel some want to change the inspector-general of the police.    [HA'ARETZ]The leadership that will come from Tunis to  lead the residents of the territories does not watch our  television, and in the social mixture that will be created in  the territories between the "inside" and the "outside," tension  will arise precisely due to the different way of relating to  what can be termed corruption.    [Sne] That is one of the most serious problems, if not the  most serious one of all. As it appears from the outside, the  leadership in Tunis, or at least part of it, is not ready for  the transition from the leadership of an underground to the  leadership of a state or an independent entity. They have  different criteria and different norms. If they think that they  can run the West Bank of Gaza as they ran western Beirut and  southern Lebanon, there will be ungodly disturbances here. It  will inspire a harsh response both regarding brutality and  corruption. As the commander of the region of southern Lebanon  in the early 1980's, I still remember the extent of the cruelty  with which the PLO ran things there. But it may be that they  will pull themselves together and make the correct decisions.    There is no doubt that the failure of self-rule will also be  the failure of the agreement. In any event, we will take care  that in any situation, the security key will remain in our hands.    [HA'ARETZ]In your opinion, is 'Arafat interested in  holding elections and in a democratic system?    [Sne] They say not.    [HA'ARETZ]And is Israel?    [Sne] We are interested in a democratic Palestinian system,  but we do not have the possibility of establishing fully the  internal processes there. But to wish that there be totalitarian  rule there that would ensure short-term stability and cause the  population to revolt in the long run, that is a mistaken desire.  It is the nature of despotic rule to become stagnant, and then  the internal opposition that would be there would come out  against them and against us.    [HA'ARETZ]However, is there not something real in the  assertion that general elections will establish officially the  demands of Hamas, if they win, for example, 30 percent? In that  way, it will have a significant right of veto, and we ourselves  will place the veto in their hands.    [Sne] If they will be 30 percent, it is preferable that they  be 30-percent represented, rather than 30 percent fighting from  the outside for their place. Look at the smart calculation of  King Husayn in this matter. The real obstacle to Islamic  fundamentalism is economic progress. An educated and satisfied  society successfully curbs Islamic radicalism. Therefore, here  our interest and that of the PLO leadership come together. An  agreement that works would bring with it investments, foreign  money, and economic development, and then radical Islam would  retreat. If there will not be a successful agreement, it will  not be accompanied by all those things, and fundamentalism will  get stronger. That is bad for them and bad for us. Due to this  intersection of interests, there is room for optimism."</p>

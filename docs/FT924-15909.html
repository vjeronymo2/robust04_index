			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: First tri-party repurchase agreement in Europe THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Swiss Bank Corporation and Cedel yesterday announced the first tri-party repurchase agreement (repo) programme to be launched in Europe. Under the agreement, the EBRD lends cash to SBC, which in exchange deposits collateral with Cedel, which provides the back-office function. Tri-party programmes, which reduce the risk of failed trades, are designed to encourage participation by companies often deterred by the com-plex back-office processing involved in repurchase agreements. In the US, where such tri-party deals are common, outstandings in the repo market have reached around Dollars 1,000bn. The European repo market - involving direct trades between two counterparties - is estimated at just Dollars 100bn. The advent of tri-party agreements could mean its expansion. Mr Mark Mazzonelli, a director of SBC, said: 'The objective of the tri-party programme is to broaden and deepen the multi-currency repo market. . . by providing easy entry for those institutions, specifically corporations, which were unable or reluctant to enter the repo market in the past.' Prior to the agreement, the EBRD had already been active in the repo market on a direct basis. The bank has around 20 per cent of its Ecu2bn of liquidity invested in the repo market, according to Mr Rene Karsenti, the bank's treasurer. The EBRD finds the repo market 'superior to bank deposits, because it provides us with collateral and offers better returns', Mr Karsenti said. SBC will not on-lend the cash, but will use the funds to finance its trading inventory, according to Mr Mazzonelli.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LYNWOOD;  </P> <P> $6.8 MILLION FROM STATE TO BUY NEW SCHOOL SITE  </P> <P> The Lynwood School District moved a step closer to building a high school for  the overcrowded system recently when the state approved $6.8 million for the  purchase of 12 acres of property.  </P> <P> The money will be used to complete the purchase of the property on Imperial  Highway owned by the Sterik Co. of West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The total state-funded price of the land was $24.9 million.  </P> <P> The district had been in court with the company since 1986 in an attempt to  settle on a price. In April, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided the  value of the land.  </P> <P> The district has not yet reached a settlement on about 25 acres of land  adjacent to the Sterik property. The land is owned by the Seventh-day Adventist  Church, which has a school on the property.  </P> <P> The district is scheduled to go to trial in August on the remaining land.  </P> <P> The district, which has nearly 15,000 students, has been attempting to build a  modern facility to replace its aging and overcrowded high school since 1983.  </P></p>

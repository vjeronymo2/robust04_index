			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / A hole in the middle Ask yourself the big question. How many Kellaways short of a party is Mr Paddy Ashdown? Mr Alec Kellaway, you will have noticed, was until Wednesday the Liberal Democratic candidate in the Newham North-east by-election. At the last minute he had a fit of conscience and defected to Labour. Correction. Not at precisely the last minute. The Kellaway conscience, it appears from various accounts, spoke with finality last Sunday and the bearer of it four days later. Further correction: Mr Kellaway, an economist for 10 years at the Henley Centre for forecasting, did not, in his view, defect. He 'returned home' to Labour. That is the party from which he had previously defected to join the Social Democratic party, may it rest in peace. There is no need to hold up your hands in horror to protest that this is all very confusing. Do not mock. The inference to draw from Mr Kellaway's little drama is quite clear. The Labour party was rendered unelectable by the schism of the early 1980s. In those days Labour was loony and left. Now it is just about social democratic. It may be ready to welcome the return of many of the voters it lost a decade ago. That would transform British politics. We can be startlingly precise about how much room exists for such a development. An entire trio of psephologists - Messrs Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell and John Curtice - has reported in its latest study* that 42 per cent of those who switched in 1983 from Labour to the Liberal-SDP alliance returned to Labour in April 1992. Some 12 per cent of respondents to the same questionnaire had moved to the Conservatives, while 36 per cent were still voting Liberal Democrat. That is a great many Kellaways to play for. Mr Ashdown, the third party's leader, would be the first to recognise this disturbing truth. It is possible, indeed likely, that Mr Kellaway himself is an isolated case. We do not expect Liberal Democratic candidates to leap off the hustings in the final hours of all future contests. Against that, a shadow has fallen over what should have been the happy counting of votes cast for those Liberal Democrats who did stay the course yesterday. The victors in the five by-elections will be known this morning. The results of the elections to the European Parliament will be announced after the weekend. A few days ago Mr Ashdown might reasonably have expected people to be talking his party's prospects up on Monday. Now there will be doubt. How many Kellaway consciences will strike before the next general election? There is plenty of time for that 36 per cent to trickle over. The government could hang on until 1997, if it had to. Much depends on the outcome of the Labour leadership contest that begins this morning. If either Mr John Prescott or Mrs Margaret Beckett wins control of the people's party, the Liberal Democrats can breathe again. It would not surprise me if in those circumstances Mr Kellaway re-Kellawayed. If, however, Mr Tony Blair wins, and does so in the proper manner, Mr Ashdown may have reason to tremble. The manner of a Blair victory is as important in this reckoning as would be the triumph itself. Labour must convince the watching public that it is ready to welcome alliance defectors back. Mr Blair entered Parliament in 1983, after the great schism. He has no reason to harbour old hatreds as, it seems, does his lieutenant, Mr Jack Straw. He starts off free to deal with the Lib Dems, or absorb them. He will achieve none of this if he wins by pandering to the left of his party, or if he kowtows to trade union barons who cannot accustom themselves to their diminished status in British society. Those who question the need to win converts from other parties should turn again to Messrs Heath, Jowell and Curtice. They demonstrate that even in the most propitious circumstances Labour will need a larger accretion of support than it has ever achieved at a single general election since 1945 if it is to win an overall majority. Destroying the Tory majority, and thus creating a hung parliament, would be easier. Any Labour leader would, however, regard that as second best. It would make it necessary to do a post-election deal with Mr Ashdown. Mr Blair must therefore ask himself whether an unprecedentedly large swing to Labour is achievable. In a paper prepared for Kleinwort Benson**, Mr Curtice and a colleague, Mr Peter Spencer, intimate that it might be. They run most conventional economic variables through their model and emerge with what they should have called political disaster theory. The Conservatives are deeply unpopular because of the chaos in their party and their government that followed sterling's sudden ejection from the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Labour suffered similarly after the devaluation of the pound in 1967 and the payments crisis of 1976. Plainly, political performance does matter. In April 1992 many of us found it difficult to believe that the Conservatives would win, since Britain was at the bottom of a deep recession. In the event, persistent mistrust of Labour did the trick for the Tories. For the past two years the Conservatives have been carrying on like a party on its way out, but the government could yet improve its performance. There is time in which the memories of Black Wednesday and its aftermath might be erased. A period of consolidation would help. Some people think the Tories will win anyway, on the ground that the public in Britain, as in other western countries, is just as fed up with the opposition as it is with the government. Only a new face, like that of Mr Berlusconi in Italy or Mr Ross Perot in the US, could make a difference. The leadership contest gives Labour the chance to present the next best thing to a new face. A thoroughly modernised party, with clear policies and a coherent economic strategy is also required. If such a package is on offer, Mr Ashdown could find that this weekend marks the apogee of his party's performance. Total modernisation is a great deal to ask of Labour, but the alternative could be a fifth victory for the Conservatives. Many of us, Tories included, shudder at that prospect. *Labour's Last Chance?

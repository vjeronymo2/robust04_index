			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Daniyel] </F>   [Excerpts] The Palestinians will have free passage from  Gaza to Jericho, passing through Israeli settlements, and they  will even travel on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Agreement  on that was reached a short time ago in the Cairo talks. Our  correspondent Roni Daniyel reports on the agreement reached:    Inspections at the Erez junction will be reorganized.  Inspection of vehicles and passengers will be computerized to  provide real time data on those leaving the Gaza Strip, their  destinations, and the time they arrive, so that by the end of  the day we will know who is still in Israel. Four axes were  defined as free passage for traffic from Gaza to Jericho. From  the Yad Mordekhay junction those with permission will be able to  travel to the Shoqet junction, and from there to Hebron,  Bethlehem, and Jericho, or through 'Arad to the Dead Sea and  Jericho. [passage omitted]    Besides those two southern axes, Israel has agreed to permit  free passage along two other axes: From Ashqelon through Qiryat  Gat to Hebron, a distance of 60 km, while the fourth axis links  the Gaza Strip with Latrun and Jerusalem through Qiryat  Mal'akhi. [passage omitted]    Those are the four axes that will link Gaza and Jericho, it  was agreed upon in Cairo. They are called the free passages.  We traveled along one of them today and where does it come to?  Highway No. 1, which links Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and from  there they will travel through Jerusalem to Jericho, with all  the security problems such traffic can set off, but that was  what was agreed upon and the moment there is autonomy traffic  from Gaza will cross here.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / EFA - that queasy feeling: The wrangles over the Pounds 20bn Eurofighter are symptomatic of a rough phase in defence collaboration The scene opens in a hardened aircraft shelter, somewhere in Europe, sometime after the year 2000. Computer-generated images of an aerial combat mission, by an anonymous air force fighting an unidentified enemy, zoom across a semi-circular screen. The stomach lurches. The flight simulation is a promotion for the European Fighter Aircraft, a Pounds 20bn project now caught in a limbo between reality and fiction. Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain have been working in earnest on the project for seven years. Two prototypes are nearly ready. More than Pounds 5bn has been spent. But it is now more uncertain than ever what form the aircraft will take, whose air force, if anybody's, will fly it - and when. Germany no longer wants the aircraft it helped design. The other partners want costs cut. The Italians are already thinking they may be forced to buy something else. Spanish support hangs by a thread. EFA should have made its maiden flight six months ago. It would have been the belle of the ball at the Farnborough air displays which closed on Sunday. In the event, it was the wallflower. Outside the projection room where hundreds queued to see the flight simulation stood a forlorn mock-up of the aircraft. Instead, visitors watched live displays by the latest MiGs and Sukhois - the fighters that EFA was designed to take on. They also saw smaller European rivals of EFA's generation, Sweden's Gripen and France's Rafale, both resembling EFA with their delta shapes and small forward 'canard' wings. The manufacturers say technical hitches linked to some of EFA's computer-driven systems have been mostly overcome. But the politics of reunified Germany have given the whole project such a buffeting in the last few months that plans to have aircraft in service in 1998 already appear unrealistic. A first flight is still scheduled this year. But the first prototype is German, and it is uncertain whether Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, will want the flight to take place. Germany has said it will stay in the Pounds 8bn development programme but not proceed with production of the current EFA design. British officials have ceased to entertain hopes that Bonn might accept a modified version of EFA as it exists, with a lower price tag and the option of a special-edition German model. Mr Ruhe, a prospective future candidate for chancellor, has overruled his air force, EFA supporters within the government and the German defence industry. His rejection of EFA, as too expensive and geared too closely to the needs of the cold war, was a clear political calculation. In most of Germany, the fighter - known there as the Jager 90 - had become irredeemably unpopular. Any chance of making Germans identify with the project was undermined by a perception that the British bullied their way into industrial leadership of all the main elements of the programme, including the radar and electronic warfare systems. Some were already calling it 'the British aircraft'. The unwelcome surprise that Mr Ruhe sprang in June was his proposal, not just that Germany withdraw, but that Europe should go back to the drawing board and make something different - cheaper, lighter and later. While discussions continue between the partners, they seem to be talking at cross-purposes. Two sets of studies are due to be completed by late October. The first is by defence chiefs, who have been told to re-evaluate their operational requirements. The second is by the two main industrial consortia involved the project - Eurofighter and the engine grouping, Eurojet - and is intended to identify cost savings. Britain, in its confidential long-term defence plans, is understood to have budgeted for a price of about Pounds 30m an aircraft at 1991 prices, excluding development and support costs. Eurofighter hopes to cut costs through a redistribution of work and more use of off-the-shelf components. The consortium plans a 'buffet approach' - offering a range of options from which partners can choose. The fate of EFA may be decided at a defence ministers' meeting in November. But there is already talk of trying to delay final decisions until the German elections of 1994. For all of Britain's partners, the project poses budget problems. Germany is able to put off buying any new aircraft, relying for the interim on an ageing, but updated, fleet of F-4 Phantom fighters. Italy, on the other hand, urgently needs to replace its single-engined F-104 Starfighters. 'They take their life into their hands every time they fly,' says one UK expert. Rome has been considered Britain's staunchest EFA ally. But it recently asked McDonnell Douglas of the US for data on the F/A-18, a possible short-term substitute. Spain already uses this aircraft and has the least pressing military need for a new fighter. Its reasons for joining EFA were political and industrial. The more trouble the project encounters, however, the less compelling those reasons become. German officials say Italy and Spain are now interested in a cheaper collaborative venture. Where does that leave Britain? 'Technically,' says Mr John Weston, British Aerospace's defence chief, 'there is nothing in the programme that we could not do in the UK if we had to.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, came close last week to saying Britain might be prepared to go it alone. But it is doubtful he would get his way in the cabinet if there were no other partners. The RAF's requirement - originally set at 250 - is unlikely to be enough to make a competitively priced aircraft. Back in the late 1980s, the nominal viability threshold for the project was 800 aircraft, although purchase plans by the four partner nations never quite reached that level. Lord Prior, chairman of GEC, the defence group which reckons it has as much at stake on the project as BAe, sees it becoming 'a titanic struggle in Whitehall'. Bonn's proposals for a Jager Leicht - or EFA Lite - have muddied the waters. EFA itself was meant to be as light and cheap as possible for the performance, with an airframe 70 per cent made of reinforced carbon fibre. How much lighter should it be? Mr Erich Riedl, parliamentary undersecretary at the German economics ministry, whose job it is to oversee the country's aerospace industry, dismisses the concept of a still lighter EFA as 'laughable'. But the idea - jocularly dubbed the Volksjager - is tempting to a country such as Spain, which might be willing to divert remaining development funds into a smaller, less capable aircraft. The Swedish government has expressed interest in participating, saying the aircraft would have a lot in common with its single-engined Gripen. Eurofighter's own review includes a study of whether EFA could have one engine instead of two and still meet its required performance. Mr John Vincent, the consortium's managing director, said at Farnborough that it was making the study so 'we cannot be accused of ignoring' the suggestion. Managers at Rolls-Royce, the UK engine partner, splutter at the very idea of a one-engine model. Mr Weston at BAe believes the review will point to an aircraft 'very similar' to the current EFA. The aircraft will be required to last 30 years, and Britain is reluctant to jettison any of EFA's capabilities. All the alternative aircraft, apart from one, fall 'significantly short' of the performance needed to beat new Russian-made fighters, says Mr Weston. The exception is the F-22 air-superiority fighter being developed in the US by Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics. But it is expected to be less versatile than the EFA and to come on the market at twice its price. The Gulf war brought home the overriding importance of air superiority in any conflict, Mr Weston argues. 'A poor second best in this area could mean that all investment in other military arms and systems may have been of little value.' But the worry haunting EFA's proponents is that the US will come in with a 'loss-leader' - a multi-role fighter such as the F/A-18 or F-15, with an attractive price tag and industrial offsets thrown into the bargain. Mr Weston argues that offsets would never compensate for the work lost on EFA. BAe expects the project to engage 16,000 aerospace workers in the UK at the height of the programme. Some estimates put the figure as high as 40,000. Britain's engineering base would suffer if the project is scrapped, Mr Weston says, and export opportunities would be lost. The bitterness and recriminations over EFA are symptomatic of recent European defence collaborations. Germany may well follow its EFA move by withdrawing from the Tiger attack helicopter project, which it is developing jointly with France. That in turn could scuttle the anti-tank weapon the helicopter is designed to carry, a project in which Britain is involved. However, in many fields of defence, there is no alternative to collaboration if European manufacturers are to remain in the business. National budgets are shrinking; equipment is needed in smaller numbers; and development costs continue to rise. Secretive US projects in sectors such as combat aircraft are seen as leaving little room for outside partners except as sub-contractors or, eventually, as licensees. The Harrier - a British aircraft reworked by Americans - is an exception to the rule. The strangest thing about the wrangle is that the French - direct rivals - are not pleased with the prospect of EFA's demise. Officials and industrialists believe France's own long-term survival in the military aircraft business depends on having strong partners in Europe. After its experience with the Rafale project - which has also faced a reappraisal - France has no intention of going it alone again. Mr Serge Dassault, its chairman, says he would be 'most unhappy' if the EFA project fell apart. This is the same company that once fought with BAe over design leadership in a five-nation EFA project. When that quarrel came to a head in 1985, the French attempted to lure other EFA partners away from the project to join the breakaway Rafale programme, without success. If even the French are now worried by the consequences of EFA collapsing, then matters must be serious.

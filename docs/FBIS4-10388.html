			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Larry Astorga] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan youth and Sandinist youth: I believe it  is my responsibility to tell the truth and get to the heart of  the matter concerning the internal crisis now afflicting the  JS19J [19 July Sandinist Youth] organization. I hereby state my  political position.    I think we need to try to dot the i's and act without  subterfuge or ambiguity. It is essential to speak out clearly,  particularly as the people for whom I have the greatest respect  are the members of the National Assembly of JS19J and its  rank-and-file members in general.    Brothers and sisters in Sandinist Youth:    The decision made by the National Council of Sandinist Youth  on 19 February was the result of manipulation controlled from  outside our organization, encouraged by some of the National  Committee (some were naive, while others were well aware of what  they were doing, realizing that the rank and file had not been  consulted, and that only the National Assembly of JS19J can  elect the organization's national officers.    The Sandinist youth leadership, like other sectors of  Nicaraguan society, has been confronted with some major changes  in behavior, and has been rejecting everything that it considers  harmful to the youth sector. We now have leaders whom we support  for the joint leadership in Sandinist Youth.    1. We are not the founding leaders of JS19J, and so we do  not  have the same age and experience that others may have had.    2. Our organization's financial resources available for  working with youth are totally inadequate.    3. The apathy and scepticism felt by the majority of young  people concerning political participation is not the  responsibility of our work, and it greatly affects what we can  do.    4. We have led Sandinist Youth under the banner of the unity  of Sandinism, and so we have rejected any attachment to specific  ideological factions or persons. This was part of a decision  made in the National Committee of JS19J, a decision which I have  respected with fairness and which I have always defended.  <H5>  JS Should Not Be a Springboard </H5>   The decision made on 19 February affects the unity of JS19J  because I was unwilling to allow Sandinist Youth to be used to  strengthen specific individuals in the FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front]. I want to make it clear that I had been  pressured on various occasions by the departmental secretary of  Managua, Bladimir Soto, to take a position in relation to one of  the factions (which I refused to do out of respect for the  decision of my youth organization). This meant both supporting  his candidacy for political secretary of District Two in Managua  and of Henry Petrie for political secretary of Managua. By  making this clear, I believe that the rest may be readily  deduced.    This situation is seriously detrimental to Sandinist Youth,  both nationally and internationally. The comrades who set up the  political ambush in the National Council should consider this  carefully. I call upon them to reflect and return the situation  to normal immediately. If not, they could be parties to the  destruction of JS19J.    I will not fail to mention here my amazement about the  ingenuousness displayed by comrade Roger Grijalva, who is being  used to defend a divisive concept, behavior, and attitude in  JS19J. My brother, a man must adopt a single standard of  judgment. As a thinking being, no one takes away your right to  speak out and to act with honesty. Even in the National  Committee we decided that everyone of us has the full right to  choose one faction or another, but not to use Sandinist Youth as  a springboard to strengthen individuals. On the contrary, our  mission is to work to strengthen the party as a whole.    Sandinist young people: it is up to you to decide; you have  the truth and the power in your hands. Let us strive for  Sandinist unity.</p>

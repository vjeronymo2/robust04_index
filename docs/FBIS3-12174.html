			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has expressed regret  over the PLO's decision to put off the resumption of the  negotiations with Israel. Peres told our correspondent Menahem  Friedman that the government had approved tough steps against  all manifestations of murder and violence or attempts to  undermine the peace process. Foreign Minister Peres said there  was a small group of people who posed a real danger to national  security. The people who attended the murderer's funeral and  shouted that he was a martyr pose a danger to Israel's future.  The foreign minister nevertheless stressed that the  Palestinians had no better alternative than resuming the peace  process.</p>

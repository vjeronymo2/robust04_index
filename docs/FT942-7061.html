			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: China liberalises in drive to join world trade body - Gatt chief welcomes MFN renewal China launched a determined drive yesterday for admission to the World Trade Organisation, the successor body to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, by removing import licences and quotas on 195 items. It pledged further liberalisation. The move came before President Bill Clinton announced renewal of China's trading status as a Most Favoured Nation, an announcement welcomed in advance by Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, in Hong Kong yesterday. China has stated its desire to be a founder member of the WTO, expected to be established on January 1 to replace the Gatt. In spite of yesterday's liberalisation package, quotas and licensing restrictions still apply to more than 700 products, but China says it would phase out half of those restrictions under an existing accord with the US. Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief Gatt negotiator, is due to visit Europe and the US for Gatt discussions next week. He will go first to Brussels, then to Washington, where Gatt talks are scheduled on June 3, the deadline for US renewal of China's MFN status. 'Gatt has no responsibility in the area of political issues which underly the issue of MFN status, but the MFN decision has an indirect effect on the negotiations because MFN policy is relevant to Gatt members,' Mr Sutherland said. To secure Gatt membership, he said, China had to improve the transparency of its existing trade regime, demonstrate uniformity in applying those laws, clarify how its trading companies operate, and elucidate tariff and non-tariff barriers. But Mr Sutherland emphasised that significant steps had already been taken in both trade and foreign exchange regimes. While questioning China's ability to become a member by January 1, he was confident that the WTO itself would be in place on schedule. 'I believe it's very important that the US as a leading trading country with an absolute interest in the development of the multilateral system should provide leadership in this area, and it seems it is determined to do so,' he said, adding: 'I would consider it inconceivable that the US would retard the progress of something not just desirable for the world as a whole, but for the US itself.'</p>

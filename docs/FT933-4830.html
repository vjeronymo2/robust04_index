			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Observer: Accidental tourist Good news for holiday-makers - both royal and non-royal - going to Bali: there is more room to play. Population density has shrunk from 815 to 503 people per square kilometre because the number of square kilometres has increased by 62 per cent to 539,458. While the economy of Indonesia grew by 6 per cent in 1992, the number of islands in the world's largest archipelago rose by 28 per cent to 17,508. But although it is a highly volcanic region and islands can literally come and go, this latest surge is probably the result of satellite photography, which allowed a more accurate count. But an official of the government's National Development Information Office explains: 'Another suspicion is that it depends on the level of the tide. Don't plan to travel to most of them,' he adds.</p>

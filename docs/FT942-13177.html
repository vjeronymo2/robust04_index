			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: New products help Kao to Y49bn Kao, Japan's leading household products maker, reported increases in annual sales and profits for the 14th consecutive year due to strong sales of new products and a decline in material and operational costs. Kao, one of the few Jap-anese companies bucking the current recession, saw a 9.6 per cent increase in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to last March to a record Y49bn (Dollars 473m), while sales rose 2.8 per cent to Y639.5bn. After-tax profits rose 4.4 per cent to Y24.5bn, while operating profits increased 13.3 per cent to Y52.8bn. The company's operating profit margin was 8.3 per cent, offsetting the deterioration in the non-operating balance. Due to the firm rise in profits, the company will raise its dividend for the second half by Y0.5 per share to Y5.5, or Y10.5 per share for the full year. Sales of Kao's household product division rose 2.9 per cent to Y559.5bn, thanks to new hair products and lipsticks, while the chemical division posted a 1.6 per cent sales increase to Y80bn. For the current year to next March, the company remains cautious over prospects of a consumption-led economic recovery advocated by many private economists. Mr Tomiaki Nagase, senior managing director, said strong sales growth was unlikely, and forecast a 4.1 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y51bn on a 2 per cent increase in sales to Y652bn.</p>

At Friday's meeting of working-level officials on price  stabilization, the participants decided to resort to old methods  based on "administrative guidance" to control the prices of some  commodities and services which have recently shown signs of  increasing.    Among major steps decided in the meeting were to increase  the  number of commodities and services to be subject for special  price control from the previous 20 to 30, including rice, sugar  and underwear, the prices of which will be curbed within 5  percent. The government's antitrust watchdog and tax  authorities will conduct investigations into businesses which  raise prices.    Some businesses, apparently threatened with the government's  adamant anti-inflationary stance, backed away from their planned  price hikes.    Domestic auto makers, which had announced plans to raise the  prices of some models by up to 400,000 won ($500), have changed  their minds. Makers of coffee and soft drinks who have recently  increased their prices will likely soon follow the example of  auto companies, industry sources said yesterday.    The price spiral has been triggered by the recent remarks of  Chong Chae-sok, new deputy prime minister and minister of  economic planning. The government's top economic official, as  soon as he was inaugurated, made it clear that the government  will allow some public service charges which had long been  forced down to go up, reflecting cost-push factors. Chong's  remarks were followed by actual raise in transportation fares  and cigarette prices, giving a much-anticipated excuse for  private industries to follow the government's example.    Chong, faced with mounting concerns in various sectors of  society about the resurging specter of inflation, later  retreated from his initial position, which he said was aimed at  respecting market forces and giving a freer hand to the private  sector to strengthen competitiveness.    Thanks to the swift return to old inflation-combating  methods, the brief but turbulent social turmoil rooted in deep  fears about price pressure will likely subside, at least for the  moment.    Damaged amid this uproar will once again be the  administrative credibility, analysts said. Also, price  stabilization will likely re-emerge as the most contentious  issue in Korean society this year, when and if the government  appears to let up its tight inflationary control, they said.    The price controversy which hit the domestic economy from  the  start of 1994, however, should in no way affect the new economic  team's much-heralded policy switch to give priority to market  force and the private sector, the analysts said.</p>

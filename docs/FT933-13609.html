			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Israel warns of Lebanon retaliation ISRAEL yesterday issued a clear and public warning it would strike against Arab guerrillas in southern Lebanon in retaliation for recent attacks which killed five Israeli soldiers. 'The Israel Defence Forces is ready with reinforced troops to defend the towns and residents of the north. It will act against those who hit its forces in the security zone,' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, said. After a long cabinet discussion Mr Rabin also admitted that Israel had heavily reinforced the large area it controls inside Lebanon in the past week. Reports have suggested Israel has sent up to 1,000 troops  - including a mechanised company  - and 22 pieces of large artillery to bolster its existing force of 1,000 men and a 3,000-strong Israeli financed Lebanese militia in the zone. Israeli airforce planes flew across the Lebanese capital Beirut yesterday and staged mock raids over the south. The fresh Israeli military activity followed an attack on an Israeli patrol in the zone on Saturday, which left two soldiers wounded and a Lebanese guerrilla dead. Syria, blamed by Israel for the upsurge of attacks, said over the weekend any attack against Lebanon was an attack against Syria.</p>

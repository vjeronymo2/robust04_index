			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Property: Who cares for the countryside? - Gerald Cadogan considers schemes to keep the UK a green and pleasant land SO MANY SCHEMES nowadays encourage care of the countryside that farmers and landowners hardly know which quango or government department to deal with. The Countryside Commission (CC) perhaps, or English Nature (EN), or the Rural Development P Commission, or the Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF), and their Scottish and Welsh counterparts (DAFS and WOAD)? The schemes appear overlapping and, as with social security, those entitled to do so do not always take up what is on offer. To help readers who have land or are about to buy an estate, our table explains the grants. The present intent of all schemes is two-fold. They aim to reduce production by making farming less intensive - reversing previous policy - and to conserve, or improve, the countryside and its wildlife. EN's new attitude shows how times have changed. In making agreements for Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) it now emphasises active management. Typically, that could mean clearing scrub from a meadow rich in rare flowers and allowing grazing only for a certain number of days a year. On the way out is the Nature Conservancy Council's passive concentration on stopping 'Potentially Damaging Operations' (PDOs), of which a long list encompassed almost anything you can do on a farm. Next summer this approach will have a major boost when the Government submits its agri-environmental plans, in accordance with new EC agricultural policies. They will probably incorporate many of the schemes listed here. The Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) suggests adopting a unitary and country-wide system of environmental management payments. Farmers would be paid to manage the countryside and enhance it. The CPRE proposes, on the production side, cutting farm support so that a true market economy can dictate prices. What does need supporting is what we cannot, as private citizens, buy; care of the countryside. Farmers, it argues, should get far more public money in a balanced package to keep up their hedges and walls, be moderate in spreading fertiliser and treat their grassland and woodland so that species that have flourished from time immemorial will still do so, and not perish from overgrazing or hasty development. Such proposals would complete the revolution in farming already under way and could be a positive encouragement to farmers and owners to carry on doing what they have always been best at - managing the land and employing farmworkers. It is a far cry from the making land and labour idle policy implicit in the Set-Aside scheme. But it needs time and patience to convince farmers that these are wise and profitable courses. Inducements must be attractive and paid on time (often they have not been), and agreements tailored to the particular needs of a piece of land, and not blanket prescriptions. You must have the right people to spread the word, says Lindon Cornwallis, of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, who has an SSSI and an NSA on his farm. He thinks senior people who know farming and conservation are needed. The Barn Elms reservoir in west London shows how specific negotiation succeeds. Next to Harrods furniture repository it is no longer needed. Thames Water wanted outline planning permission for housing, but it has been an SSSI as a bird habitat. To meet the objection, Thames Water called in a firm of environmental consultants from Chester, R. PS Clouston (0244-313486), who in turn consulted the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust at Slimbridge, Glos. and came up with a scheme for a bird reserve and visitors' centre, which at the same time allowed plenty of space for future housing. Dr David Hockin, of Cloustons, thought that the adversarial system inherent in planning inquiries and appeals did not automatically produce the best results. The issues were more a matter of nitty-gritty scientific observation and interpretation. He spoke to me from a badger sett near Reading, where he and his team have spent nights observing badgers and their habits. He will then suggest a plan to protect setts and identify unbadgered land to build on. And when estate agents advertise SSSIs on land they are selling, we know attitudes have changed. Savills in Norwich (0603-612211) is offering the Didlington Hall estate, which includes an SSSI of three glorious lakes dug in the early 19th century. Unusual swamp plants are the breeding ground for gadwall, teal, shoveler and great crested grebe. Bewick and whooper swans winter there. The big house was demolished in 1950. With 460 acres at a guide price of Pounds 850,000, it is an ideal spot for the romantic, well-heeled birdwatcher to build a new house and a state-of-the-art birdhide.</p>

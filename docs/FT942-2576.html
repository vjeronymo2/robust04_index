			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ferfin sues auditors for L650bn Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the listed holding company of the collapsed Ferruzzi group, yesterday announced it was bringing a L650bn (Dollars 401m) damages suit against auditors Price Waterhouse. The claim relates to the alleged negligent role played by the auditors in presenting accounts from 1987 to 1992 that failed to give a true picture of Ferfin's accounts. It follows an earlier claim against Price Waterhouse lodged in April for damages of L1,000bn for the negligent preparation of the Montedison group accounts. Montedison is the principal subsidiary of Ferfin. Last November, Ferfin shareholders voted to take legal action for damages against Price Waterhouse. However, the size of these two claims is bigger than expected and in the case of Montedison it covers accounts prepared by Price Waterhouse from 1983 to 1992. Price Waterhouse has filed a counter-claim against Montedison taking the view that the previous management should be held responsible for 'deliberate and systematic fraud' rather than the accountants. The company was not available for comment last night but is expected to pursue the same robust line over the latest claim.</p>

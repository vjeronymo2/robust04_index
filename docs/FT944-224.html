			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Not on the rocks but it may still break up: Richard Tomkins charts the transformation of ITT as the conglomerate nears its 75th anniversary The year about to begin will mark the 75th anniversary of ITT, the US conglomerate once known as International Telephone and Telegraph. Will it also be the year in which the company ceases to exist? Wall Street is rife with speculation that ITT is about to be broken up. The company itself does not deny it could happen; indeed, in March this year it made what many analysts construed as a preparatory move by announcing plans to turn its three main operating divisions into separate subsidiary companies. With or without a break-up, the company is being transformed. This week it said it had found buyers for ITT Financial, its group of financial services businesses, in deals that should bring in a net Dollars 3.3bn to Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn). Only a week earlier it announced that it was buying Caesars World, the US casino group, for Dollars 1.7bn. The company that will emerge from this transformation will be very different from the one that Mr Rand Araskog, chairman and chief executive, inherited in 1979. During an extraordinary 20-year buying spree, his predecessor, Mr Harold Geneen, had expanded ITT beyond its roots in telecommunications and built it into one of the world's biggest multi-national conglomerates. Under Mr Geneen, ITT snapped up any company it regarded as undervalued, regardless of the business it was in. Its 250 acquisitions included companies as diverse as Avis, the car rental group; Continental Baking, maker of Wonder bread and Twinkies; W. Atlee Burpee, a seed company, and Eason Oil, an oil and gas producer. Something else ITT acquired during the Geneen years was a reputation for pursuing profit without much regard for ethics. One of the more notorious scandals it was involved in was in 1970 when, fearing the nationalisation of its assets in Chile, it offered the Central Intelligence Agency Dollars 1m to fund a campaign to block the election of the left-wing Allende government. When Mr Araskog took over at ITT, one of his first moves was to soften ITT's image by emphasising social responsibility. But he was tough in other ways: he ruthlessly hacked back the sprawling ITT empire, not only selling off most of the businesses acquired by Mr Geneen, but even pulling out of the telecommunications business on which the group had been built. Rationalisation, however, did not succeed in transforming ITT's lacklustre financial performance. During the 1980s, as profits bobbed up and down, ITT's stock badly underperformed the market: from 1979 to 1991, it lagged the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-share index by 36 per cent. Investors fumed as Mr Araskog and his executives rewarded themselves with lavish pay and perks. Matters came to a head three years ago when activist shareholders pressed the board to link executive pay to ITT's share price performance. Since then, profits have continued unsteadily: last year's net earnings of Dollars 913m were an improvement on the previous year's losses of Dollars 260m, but were lower than the Dollars 922m earned in 1990. Yet the share price has rebounded on the prospects of what the future may hold. Today, ITT is still diversified, but Mr Araskog has whittled it down to three main areas of activity. Financial services, the largest division, comprises ITT Hartford, a big insurance company; ITT Financial, now being sold; and ITT Communications and Information Services, a publisher of telephone and business directories. The manufacturing division comprises an array of automotive, fluid technology, and defence and electronics businesses. And the leisure division, the smallest of the three, consists of ITT Sheraton, the international hotel group. Mr Araskog's recent strategy has been to strike a better balance between the three divisions by selling the financial services operations, excluding ITT Hartford, and using the proceeds to expand in the lodging, gaming and entertainment industry. In the past few months ITT has spent Dollars 400m to acquire a 70 per cent controlling stake in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel group; signed up with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television company, to buy New York's Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex for Dollars 1.1bn; and agreed the acquisition of Caesars World, one of the best-known names in the gaming industry. Not all the moves have been welcomed by Wall Street. ITT's share price fell by 8 per cent in the week the company announced the Madison Square Garden acquisition because ITT had no experience in the sports business and Madison Square Garden lacked any obvious synergy with ITT's existing activities. 'That seemed to scare investors,' says Mr Jay Cohen, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. For the same reason, the market is uneasy about hints that ITT would like to buy into television broadcasting. Yet excitement has been provoked by the prospects of a break-up. Mr Phua Young, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, points out that investors have difficulty in valuing the ITT conglomerate because insurance companies are typically valued on a multiple of book value, industrial companies are valued on a multiple of earnings, and hotel and casino companies are valued on a multiple of cashflow. Break the three up, Mr Young says, and ITT would be worth at least Dollars 115 a share, compared with yesterday's Dollars 87 7/8 . ITT has been careful not to confirm or deny the likelihood of a break up, but it says this is not the main motivation for incorporating the three divisions. This is not the first time speculation about a break-up has arisen: Mr Araskog spoke of splitting up ITT in an interview with the Financial Times nearly three years ago. But this time, investors see greater grounds for certainty because Mr Araskog, 63, reaches the mandatory company retirement age in 18 months. ITT insiders say Mr Araskog, has no inclination to retire. He also finds the entertainment business particularly appealing because it gives him a high public profile and allows him to travel the world, both of which he enjoys. If ITT ceased to exist, so would the mandatory retirement age - and what then would prevent Mr Araskog from staying on as chairman of the leisure and entertainment company for as long as he liked?</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Sitting suspended as Scots protest A DOZEN fiery Scottish Labour backbenchers disrupted the Commons yesterday by defying Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, and forcing her to suspend the sitting for just under three hours. In vain attempts to secure a government statement on proposals to confer trust status on more Scottish hospitals, they capped two rounds of bogus points of order by staging a disorderly demonstration. Led by Mr Ernie Ross, MP for Dundee West, and Mr George Galloway, MP for Glasgow Hillhead, the small group of protesters, mostly from the Scotland United faction, stood in the centre of the Chamber in front of the mace, symbol of the Crown's authority. Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, ordered an initial five-minute suspension when his appeals for seasonal goodwill as MPs prepared to disperse for the three-week Christmas recess were ignored. When the sitting resumed Miss Boothroyd took the chairbut her attempts to persuade the protesters to comply with the rules of the House were no more successful than those made by Mr Morris. In ordering the more prolonged suspension Miss Boothroyd made clear her determination to ensure that nothing interfered with the final item on the agenda - her announcement of the measures given royal assent by the Queen. When the House reassembled at three o'clock Miss Boothroyd announced that three measures - the Consolidated Fund (Number 3) Act, the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act, and the Civil Service (Management Functions) Act - had received royal assent. She immediately adjourned the House and the deputy serjeant-at-arms removed the mace before protesters could take any further action.</p>

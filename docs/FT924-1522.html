			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: French notes weakened by pressure on franc FRENCH government bonds closed lower yesterday as the French currency came under pressure and speculation increased that the Bank of France may be forced to raise its key interest rates shortly. Money market rates continued to edge higher, with three-month money quoted at around 11.5 per cent yesterday. The rise in money market rates forced several French banks to raise their base lending rates from 9.45 per cent to 10.00 per cent yesterday afternoon, and led to more speculation over whether the Bank of France would be forced to raise its 5-to-10 day interest rate shortly to help support the franc. Dealers said there was further speculation over whether the French currency would be devalued or allowed to float outside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Short-dated bonds dropped during the day with the yield on the 8 per cent bond due 1994 moving from 8.40 per cent to 8.60 per cent. Longer-dated issues were less seriously hit, with the yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 moving from 8.27 per cent to 8.29 per cent. News that the prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, was holding a press conference this morning led to speculation that an important announcement would be made concerning the franc. However, dealers said the prime minister's office was later understood to have denied that there would be a statement on a devaluation, claiming that the press conference would simply provide an opportunity for the press to put questions to the prime minister. 'The worst possible scenario for the bond market is if we have no devaluation but higher interest rates', said Mr Julian Jessop, economist with Midland Montagu, referring to the possibility that the Bank of France may raise its 5-to-10 day rate. Mr Dominique Barbet, economist at Paribas, said the decision by the commercial banks to raise their lending rates yesterday would 'increase the political pressure in France to either devalue the franc or float the currency'. Today's planned auction of FFr14bn to FFr16bn of two and five-year notes may further depress prices at the short end of the yield curve, dealers said. ITALIAN government bonds tumbled again at the opening following Tuesday's announcement that Mr Bettino Craxi, leader of Italy's Socialist Party, was under investigation for involvement in a political corruption scandal. However, after an initial fall of about a point, the bond market recovered some of its losses. The March futures contract, which opened at 92.93 and fell to a low of 92.00, ended the day at 93.20. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds traded in a narrow range with the Liffe bund future contract edging up from 91.57 at the opening to a high of 91.60. UK government bonds closed higher in thin trade helped by weaker-than-expected retail sales figures for November. Retail sales fell 0.1 per cent between October and November, after a 0.2 per cent increase the previous month. In the cash market, the 10 1/2 per cent gilt due 1997 edged up from 110 17/32 to 110 19/32 , while the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 improved from 108 9/16 to 108 23/32 . A drop in the Tokyo stock market rekindled hopes of an easing in interest rates and helped to lift Japanese government bond prices yesterday, dealers said. The Nikkei average index fell 212.03 to 17,268.71 and dealers said further falls in the stock market would revive hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate soon. The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.62 per cent, the low of the day, and ended at 4.615 per cent. US Treasury prices firmed yesterday on the back of economic news suggesting that the US economy is growing gradually. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  7/32 higher at 102 5/16 , yielding 7.425 per cent, while the two-year note was up  3/16 to yield 4.624 per cent. The market moved slightly on the release of housing starts for November, which rose 1.5 per cent. In addition, industrial production rose 0.4 per cent in November. In the afternoon, the Treasury said it would auction Dollars 11.25bn in five-year notes and Dollars 15.5bn in two-year notes.</p>

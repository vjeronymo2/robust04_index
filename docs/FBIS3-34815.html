			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Rousselin: "Alain Juppe in the Middle </F> East -- Israel: France's Contribution to Extensive Peace"]    [Text] Traditionally a friend of the [French] Socialists,  Israel's Labor government seems more comfortable with a Gaullist  at the helm of France's diplomacy. On Alain Juppe's arrival  yesterday for his first official visit there, Jerusalem  celebrated the markedly improved relations the two countries  have enjoyed since the new French Government came into power.    Diplomacy is not immune from paradox -- and the bitter  memories left by [former socialist foreign ministers] Claude  Cheysson and Roland Dumas only serve to accentuate today's  favorable climate. "This time we do not have to wonder what the  minister is going to lecture us on," an Israeli diplomat told  French correspondents yesterday.    Newspapers indicate that Alain Juppe was the first French  foreign minister to come to the Israeli Embassy for the  Independence celebrations -- in May 1993 -- since the Six Day  War. A symbolical gesture, but a welcome one.    In any event, since the Oslo agreement and the beginning of  the dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat, a diplomatic "slip" has become  unlikely. This is something the Israelis now do very well by  themselves. For instance, new Labor Party Leader Nissim Zvili  [name as published] has said that a Palestinian State is an  unavoidable perspective, just like that of the Golan Heights  being returned to Syria.    Before leaving Jordan, Alain Juppe simply stated on Israeli  television that "meeting the deadlines" is a necessity if the  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is to be achieved: "It is  important to prevent the peace process from getting bogged down:  time is not on the side of those who want peace."    In Amman, as his contribution to a peace he wishes will be  "extensive," the French foreign minister promised to push for a  rescheduling of Jordan's debt at the meeting of Club de Paris  creditors next month.  <H5>  Perspectives </H5>   With his Israeli and Palestinian partners, Mr. Juppe will  strive to lay the groundwork for France's contribution to the  peace process. Already very active within multilateral  negotiations, Paris has agreed to head working groups on the  economy, refugees, and water-related issues. As regards  infrastructure projects, French firms try to position themselves  in the perspective of an actual peace.    Mr. Juppe's visit takes place after the Cairo "breakthrough"  on security, at a time when negotiations on the withdrawal from  Gaza and Jericho have resumed in Taba, Egypt. On the agenda:  the Palestinian police force and issues relating to water and  electricity supply, as well as telecommunications and the  Palestinian radio and television, a project in which France is a  partner.    The Israelis hope that improved relations between the two  countries will afford Mr. Juppe an opportunity to announce the  lifting of the visa requirement imposed on Israeli citizens  wishing to go to France since the 1986 terrorist bombings in  Paris. This has not been facilitated by [Interior Minister]  Charles Pasqua's decision to require exit visas from  Palestinians leaving France, thus putting them in the same class  as Iranians, Iraqis, Afghans, or Libyans.    The visit's highlight will take place tomorrow with Alain  Juppe going to the Gaza strip, where he intends to visit the  Chati [name as published] seaboard refugee camp. The first  French foreign minister to go to Gaza, Mr. Juppe made it clear  to [Police Affairs Minister] Shahal that he did not want to be  escorted by jeeps. Consequently, he had to sign a letter  releasing Israeli authorities from any responsibility as to his  personal safety. "With the perspectives opened by the Gaza and  Jericho agreement, we must show that the Gaza strip can be  viable without an Israeli presence," French sources argue.</p>

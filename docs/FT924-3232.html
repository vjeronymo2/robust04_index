			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM attacked over EC role OPPOSITION leaders rounded on Mr John Major's presidency of the European Community yesterday with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, claiming he had 'incompetently and humiliatingly bungled' an opportunity to shape the EC's future. The attack was joined by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who charged the prime minister with reducing British influence in the EC by lacking authority and by failing to give a clear lead. With Whitehall officials apparently systematically trying to lower hopes of substantial breakthroughs at the Edinburgh summit at the weekend, both opposition party leaders were yesterday preparing to pin all the blame on Mr Major. At Commons' questions, the prime minister seemed to be taking the same approach as officials, leading to speculation that his strategy is to lower hopes deliberately in order to make any agreements eventually reached appear important victories. Questioned from his own benches, Mr Major warned that 'a large number of very complex' issues remained outstanding, ranging from the EC budget, enlargement of the Community and the so-called Danish problem. The prime minister said Britain had the lowest corporation tax among the G7 countries and the lowest interest rates in the EC. He also insisted, to cheers from Conservatives, that there was no question of Britain allowing its budget rebate to be cut if the question was raised by other member states at the summit. Mrs Jacqui Lait (C Hastings and Rye) offered Mr Major the 'total support' of Tory backbenchers in resisting pressure to give ground on the rebate. Pressed by Mr Smith to explain why jobs were not at the top of the agenda, Mr Major said Treasury officials had been touring the Continent to seek agreement on a Community-wide growth strategy. 'I very much hope that co-ordinated measures will emerge from those discussion, but we will have to wait and see what our European partners also feel at Edinburgh,' he said. In reply, Mr Smith underlined that proposals to stimulate the EC economy with research and development funding through infrastructure programmes and job-creation measures had all come from other member states. Downing Street officials made clear later, however, that the shape of the package set to be tabled at the summit centres squarely on proposals made public some time ago. These comprise policies endorsed in the Autumn Statement on public spending, stressing capital spending programmes and restraints on public sector wage costs. A Tory Euro MP said yesterday that Britain was proposing a deal at the summit to waste more than Pounds 500m of taxpayers' money over the next five years by perpetuating the EC government's 'travelling circus'. Mr Peter Price, MEP for London South East, said the heads of government would be invited by the British presidency to endorse a plan to retain the existing arrangement - a debating chamber in Strasbourg, staff offices for 3,000 in Luxembourg and committee rooms and offices for MEPs in Brussels.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE APPROVAL OF CHENEY PREDICTED  </P> <P> Two senators predicted Saturday that the Senate would easily approve President  Bush's new choice for defense secretary, Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.), but they  did not expect a vote on the nomination this week.  </P> <P> Speaking on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday," Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and  Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) agreed that Cheney had adequate experience for the job.  </P> <P> "I think it may be helpful to have somebody go in that doesn't think he has all  of the answers, but Dick Cheney has had a lot of experience in matters relating  directly to national defense," Cranston said. "Dick has a great deal more  experience with defense matters than has been the general cast of reports about  him," Wallop said.  </P></p>

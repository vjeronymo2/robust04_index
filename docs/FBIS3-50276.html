			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Granic sent a letter to the German Vice  Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, following  Germany's decision to repatriate Croat refugees in Germany  starting from the 30 April of this year.    The Croatian foreign minister thanked Germany for its  efforts  in caring for thousands of Croat refugees but pointed out that  one-third of Croatia's territory was still under occupation so  that most of the refugees cannot return to their homes.    In his letter Mr. Granic called on Germany to help in the  return of refugees to their homes but urged it to keep in mind  that this process should be carried out in phases in accordance  with the normalization of relations and the reintegration of the  UN-protected areas into Croatia's legal system.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Relief as Heseltine offers haven from Tories' political storms ANOTHER NARROW shaft of sunlight has broken through the dark grey clouds that have overshadowed the government for a full six months. Yesterday the mood of relief on the Conservative benches was palpable. Mr Michael Heseltine's highly political compromise on coal may signal the beginning of a much-needed period of calm for Mr John Major's embattled administration. Obstacles undoubtedly lie ahead, not least the Newbury by-election. But the whiff of optimism in the economic indicators, the successful attempt on Wednesday to accelerate the Maastricht ratification process and what looks set to be an escape from the mire of the coalfields has raised Conservative spirits. In the parliamentary lobbies last night government business managers were openly confident about Monday's coal debate. There may well be continued muffled Tory backbench criticism that the government ever found itself in such trouble, but the reassertion of divisions along party lines in the Commons chamber suggested that traditional political antagonisms over coal have been re-established. The trade and industry secretary started his statement hesitantly. But it was soon apparent that the widely leaked formula for the pits should prove to be enough to secure Monday's vote. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman warned: 'This is not a rescue plan, merely a stay of execution,' adding that it might 'buy off' the Tory benches but would not do the same for the country. But the attack appeared only to restore Mr Heseltine's confidence as he shouted over heckling that the state of Britain's coal industry was largely the fault of the last Labour government. When Dr Michael Clark, Tory MP for Rochford and a rebel in October, rose to speak, it was clear he had been won round. Less positively, another Tory rebel, Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, MP for Batley and Spen, seemed to be shifting back towards the government, while raising some doubt as to whether enough had been done to find new coal markets. But of the original six Tory rebels and five abstainers only Mr Richard Alexander, the Newark MP, appeared ready to continue defying the whips when he warned of the 'devastation' which closures would bring to Nottinghamshire pits. It was also apparent that party politics was back in harness within the trade and industry committee. While Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour chairman, and Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat, both made their continuing dissatisfaction known, several Tories, such as Dr Keith Hampson, a long-time Heseltine loyalist, insisted that the broad thrust of the committee's demands had been met. At the weekly meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 committee last night there was a distinct sense that, for the first time since last year's 'autumn of banana skins', a hint of spring has broken through.</p>

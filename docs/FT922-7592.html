			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / The European Market: High-tech future for food retailers THE structure of the food retailing industry varies enormously across Europe; how pizzas, paellas and pasties are sold remains a largely parochial affair. Europe's food retailing markets are still dominated by domestic companies - with the possible exception of French hypermarkets in Spain. Those in northern Europe are characterised by a few, powerful grocery chains while the southern sunbelt boasts highly-fragmented regional industries. Although they have similar numbers of consumers, Italy has three times as many food retailing outlets as the UK, for example. But in spite of the differences, food retailers across Europe are facing many common challenges: flat sales; a static and ageing customer base; the increasing internationalisation of their supplier base; and perhaps most important, inflated demands for variety, quality and choice. In order to respond to such changes, J. Sainsbury, the leading grocery chain in the UK, launches more than 1,000 own-label products every year and stocks more than 15,000 lines in its bigger stores - almost twice the number of a decade ago. The future velocity of change will be even more daunting, if the experience of the US is any guide. Last year alone, according to one observer, food makers launched 123 new cereal products, 64 new flavours of spaghetti sauce, and 69 new variations of disposable nappies. There are more than 30,000 lines in the average US supermarket. Against this increasingly complex background, food retailers have to generate growth by squeezing more profit out of the same sales volumes through productivity improvements and greater distribution efficiency. Some observers believe recent technological developments have brought scope for vast structural change across the European grocery trade. Mr John Hollis, a senior partner at Andersen Consulting who has conducted a study of the European market in the 1990s for the Coca-Cola Retailing Research Group, says: 'Over the next five years we will see a major change in the way the grocery industry organises itself.' He believes differences in distribution efficiency will mark national industries, with the implication that companies which can develop a successful formula will be able to translate their success into foreign markets. The ultimate dream for retailers is to develop a 'stockless distribution chain' with suppliers which will give them enormous cost advantages by reducing the need for expensive storage space. The report suggests the two main routes to this are electronic point of sale (Epos) equipment, which scans the bar-codes on all products sold, recording supermarket sales patterns throughout the day, and electronic data interchange (EDI), which creates an information network between retailers and manufacturers allowing both to align their operations more closely to sales patterns. Some of the most skilled practitioners of these developments have been the big UK retailers, which have introduced Epos equipment, stopped direct manufacturer supplies to their stores and centralised their distribution functions. This process has reached the stage where Tesco has been able to open a supermarket in Leatherhead, in Surrey, with no warehouse space at the back. Instead, it receives its goods through a series of meticulously-calculated daily deliveries. But the Andersen report suggests that such companies have as yet fully tackled only half of the distribution chain. The challenge in the 1990s will be to attack the manufacturing end through speedier exchange of sales information using EDI networks, as Tesco is beginning to do. To be effective, such partnerships will require a high degree of transparency and trust. Retailers have to trust manufacturers with sensitive sales information and be confident they can deliver to tight lead times, while manufacturers have to open up their operating procedures to the retailers' scrutiny. But if the two sides fail to establish such partnerships an alternative scenario may emerge. If food makers can adopt highly flexible manufacturing methods and create joint distribution networks with one another, they could perhaps create entirely new retail channels, bypassing traditional supermarkets altogether. Stores may simply become compact 'idea centres' where customers pick what they want to buy from a display of products and later collect ready-packaged bundles of goods from a nearby distribution centre. Or the dream of every couch potato may be realised, with electronic home shopping and direct delivery becoming economically feasible.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Alcatel and Telefonica loosen ties Alcatel, the French tele-communications company, yesterday announced it had bought a 13.2 per cent stake in Alcatel Standard Electrica, its Spanish subsidiary, from Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, writes John Ridding. The purchase of the shares, for Pta22.23bn (Dollars 178.3m), satisfies a recommendation by the European Commission that the Spanish operator eliminate shareholding ties with its transmission equipment suppliers. The recommendation, made in 1990, followed the acquisition by Alcatel of Telettra of Italy. The acquisition gave Alcatel, through its Spanish subsidiary and the Spanish operations of Telettra, about 80 per cent of the country's transmission market. Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, had expressed concern about Alcatel's dominance of the Spanish transmission market.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / IMF may seek to expand reserves MR MICHEL Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to press finance ministers at this week's IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington to support moves to expand the foreign exchange reserves of former communist and developing countries. The IMF believes world trade is being artificially restricted because at least 40 countries have severe shortages of reserves. It is pressing for a new allocation of special drawing rights, an international reserve asset equivalent to a basket of the leading currencies. A senior IMF official said a new issue of SDR36bn (Pounds 32.5bn), 10 per cent of the expected demand for reserves resulting from increased global economic activity in 1992-1996, was required. He said rich countries, which faced no shortage of reserves, should hand over a portion of any new SDR allocation to former communist and developing countries as loans or grants. The IMF would oversee this process and impose conditions so that the reserves were used responsibly. The official said opposition by many finance ministers to a new SDR issue - in effect an increase in global liquidity - made no sense because inflationary pressures were at their lowest for 30 years. Ministers had agreed an increase in the 1980s when inflation was higher. The share of SDRs in total world reserves had fallen from about 5 per cent in the early 1980s to below 2 per cent.</p>

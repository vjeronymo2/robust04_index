			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sheri Prasso] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 7 (AFP) -- Cambodia's ailing King  Norodom Sihanouk returns here Friday with what observers expect  will be a new plan for talks with the Khmer Rouge, but the  guerrilla's recent defeats on the battlefield give the  government little incentive to negotiate.    The Khmer Rouge lost their ruby- and timber-rich  headquarters  of Pailin in a government offensive just over two weeks ago, and  the government's call for a total ceasefire before roundtable  talks can be held remains in force.    "If we want to have talks now, talks must be in a different  mood," co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said this week. "Now  the Khmer Rouge have nothing."    The Khmer Rouge's public face, Khieu Samphan, has requested  an audience with the king and is expected to arrive in the  Cambodian capital within the next few days, Royal Palace  officials confirmed.    His presence, however, is not likely to lead to talks unless  he is willing to offer a surrender, that is if Prince Ranariddh  and his co-Premier Hun Sen can maintain their strong positions  militarily and politically.    But the 71-year-old king has cancer, and wants to be  remembered as the uniting force of a divided Cambodia after he  dies, according to diplomats and observers.    The cancer has spread to his bone marrow and King Sihanouk  has been undergoing chemotherapy in a Beijing hospital. But he  is returning to spend about a month in Cambodia in order to  celebrate Khmer New Year with his compatriots on April 13-15.    Diplomats as well as Cambodian Government officials had  believed that King Sihanouk was likely to die by mid-1994 and  would return to Cambodia for his final days.    But recent reports from the Royal Palace say the king's  cancer has gone into remission. However, they warn of a  possible stroke from arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the  arteries.    His arrival at Pochentong Airport on Friday will be shrouded  in secrecy. Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen and acting head of state  Chea Sim will be the only people allowed to greet him upon his  arrival, Royal Palace officials said.    The diplomatic corps, brass band, lines of bowing Cambodian  officials and throngs of journalists who normally greet King  Sihanouk at the airport have been told they are not invited.    Even the crowds of flag-waving schoolchildren who are  normally trotted out to the roadside to cheer his speeding  motorcade have been told not to come.    King Sihanouk has gone bald due to months of chemotherapy,  and palace officials do not want him photographed. Whether he  will walk of his own accord off his plane or be carried off,  will be left to speculators or spies to say.    A special room has been set up at Calmette Hospital in case  he needs emergency medical attention, and French doctors were  asked to disinfect his room to cut down on the possibility of  infection, [word indistinct] sources said.    The king will only be able to receive visitors for one hour  each morning and one hour each afternoon during his stay.    The diplomatic corps hopes for at least one window of  opportunity, as do chosen "representatives of the people" who  traditionally ask the king to solve their problems during the  Khmer New Year.</p>

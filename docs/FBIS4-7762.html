			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "AWO": "We Want To Join NATO"] </F>   [Text] The Partnership for Peace program does not  guarantee us or other Central European countries membership in  NATO. Even so, does it enhance our security? This question was  put to a representative group of Polish citizens age 15 and over  by the Public Opinion Survey Center. The answer is that most of  us believe that Partnership for Peace is good for our security,  as the table illustrates.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Does Partnership for Peace enhance Poland's security?                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No                                    |24 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                                   |66 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hard to say                           |10 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A decisive majority of Poles believe that Poland should  strive most energetically for NATO membership. Advocates of  this option constitute 79 percent of respondents, while  opponents of our association with the NATO pact represent only 7  percent of those questioned. The belief that NATO membership is  a correct course for Poland increases along with respondents'  attained level of education. Its most fervent champions are  optimistic, affluent, and inclined to approve the changes that  took place under Solidarity rule. Those who are discontented  and pessimistic rarely advocate our membership in NATO.    The survey also provided an opportunity to investigate our  views on our country's sovereign status. A little over 50  percent of those questioned believe that Poland is now fully  sovereign and independent of other states. One in three  respondents sees our situation as exactly opposite. This  distribution of views has not changed for the past year.  Residents of large cities are convinced of our sovereignty.  Those who live in the rural sector and in smaller cities  maintain a much higher degree of skepticism in this question.  Discrepancies between views held by urban and rural dwellers  are becoming progressively greater and embrace a number of other  questions beside the subject under discussion. It has not yet  been ascertained whether this phenomenon is caused by  differences in urban and rural mentalities or by divergent  interests.</p>

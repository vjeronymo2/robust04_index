Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1886(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishes a ceiling on the allowable rate of the increase for Medicare hospital inpatient operating costs. Prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), section 1886(a)(4) of the Act defined the ``operating costs of inpatient hospital services'' to include ``all routine operating costs, ancillary service operating costs, and special care unit operating costs with respect to inpatient hospital services as such costs are determined on an average per admission or per discharge basis *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3610.3 (formerly section 3608) of the Medicare Intermediary Manual, Part 3 (HCFA Pub. 13&hyph;3) and section 415.6 of the Medicare Hospital Manual (HCFA Pub. 10) provides that, if a beneficiary with Part A coverage is furnished outpatient hospital services and is thereafter admitted as an inpatient of the same hospital before midnight of the next day, the outpatient hospital services furnished to the beneficiary are treated as inpatient services and are included in the hospital's Part A payment. This administrative policy has been in effect since June 1966. It was adopted in response to a recommendation by the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council (HIBAC), which believed it would shorten inpatient stays by encouraging hospitals to perform some services connected with the stay prior to the actual inpatient admission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 1, 1983, the prospective payment system (PPS) was implemented. PPS is a system of payment for acute inpatient hospital stays under Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) based on prospectively-set rates. Under this system, Medicare payment is made at a predetermined, specific rate for each hospital discharge. All discharges are classified according to a list of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). When PPS was introduced, the costs related to the longstanding policy concerning the payment for preadmission outpatient services as inpatient services were included in the base year costs used to calculate the PPS standardized payment amount and the DRG weighting factors (see 49 FR 250, January 3, 1984). Those hospitals excluded from payment under PPS continue to be paid for inpatient hospital services they furnish, as well as for the preadmission services described above, on the basis of reasonable cost up to the ceiling specified in section 1886(a) of the Act. Therefore, for both PPS and non-PPS hospitals, these preadmission services may not be billed separately from the covered inpatient admission that follows, since payment for them is included in the payment made under Part A for the inpatient stay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BITES : A STICKY MILESTONE  </P> <P> This year is the 100th anniversary of the invention of peanut butter, which was  originally a health food, later became a grammar school treat and recently has  made a comeback among adults for some unclear mixture of health food and  nostalgia reasons. Between one thing and another, the Peanut Advisory Board  reports that sales have doubled over the last 25 years. Americans eat more  peanut butter than any other people in the world -- nearly four and a half  12-ounce jars per person per year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Dud-Free Milestone  </P> <P> It's also the 25th anniversary of Orville Redenbacher's hybrid popping corn.  Best wishes, Orville, and this might be a very good occasion to spring for a  new necktie.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Porky Pumps Up  </P> <P> Pork has had this image problem, so over the last 10 years breeders have  created a New Pig for a leaner New Age, aiming for lower-fat porkers and  providing them with carefully controlled diets. Even more credit, says  University of Missouri Extension swine specialist Ron Bates, goes to butchers,  who are trimming these leaner pigs more severely. A South Dakota State  University researcher recently traveled around the country buying pork in  big-city supermarkets and found that it averaged 44% less fat than the USDA  reported in 1983.  </P> <P> At the same time that pigs are being raised leaner, meat processors want them  to be larger because they want to give consumers the same-size cuts they did 10  years ago, so today's pig is 20 pounds heavier. But that's solid muscle, pally.  Go ahead, punch a pig in the stomach. Come on, give it your best shot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Bold Step Backward  </P> <P> The Garlic Smash, available in many gourmet stores, is a return to either the  Stone Age or the '60s, a Totally Natural kitchen utensil consisting of a  smooth, flattened stone and a circular wooden block. It makes a lot of sense,  actually. Garlic presses give you garlic that is not exactly pureed but more or  less riced. In a mortar you can pound garlic to a paste, but you spend a lot of  time chasing the slippery cloves around with the pestle. Out on this block they  can't get away, and you can rock the, well, rock around and squash them to  garlic paste with surprising efficiency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eco-Eats  </P> <P> In Seattle, a company called EnvirOmints is selling chocolate wafers stamped  with the images of six endangered wildlife species. The symbolism of eating an  endangered animal is peculiar, but EnvirOmints promises to donate half its  profits to environmental causes once its initial debt is erased.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Marin, Fantastic Tempura reports that it has reformulated its  tempura batter mix with organically grown whole wheat, brown rice and corn  flours and that its package is now printed on recycled board with non-polluting  inks. When we dip our high-calorie, high-cholesterol shrimp in this tempura  batter and deep-fry them in mass quantities of oil, we shall do so with  consciences as clear as a summer sky.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lonely Palates  </P> <P> "How can single gourmets meet other single connoisseurs?" asks the leaflet.  "One answer is Gourmets &amp; Friends. This new service is designed to  discreetly introduce single gourmets and other friends of good food  everywhere."  </P> <P> Gourmets &amp; Friends, P.O. Box 11652, Houston, Tex. 77293, is intended, as  the leaflet says, "to provide single gourmets with information needed to reach  out to others for possible friendships, romance and business contacts." A fine  endeavor, surely, though what, exactly, are singles business contacts?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sweet Teeth  </P> <P> Natural snack sales rose 22% in 1989, reports "Progressive Grocer." Pretty  good, since candy sales have taken five years to rise 19% per capita and soft  drink sales nearly 10 to rise 40%. The average American now consumes 46.6  gallons of soft drinks and 19.7 pounds of candy a year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tan and Fit to Eat  </P> <P> Imported pistachios have always been dyed red, originally to distinguish them  from other nuts when they were sold in vending machines. California pistachios  are sold undyed to distinguish them from the foreign ones. CHARLES PERRY  </P></p>

This fact is bound to place grave responsibilities  upon it, given the serious position it is occupying. Hence, it  is peculiar for it to act just like small states, which are  content with engaging themselves in tit for tat to avenge old  enemies. What is currently taking place shows that the United  States wants to enjoy its current position as the world's sole  superpower without shouldering the responsibilities this  entails. This has been manifested in what is taking place in  Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Middle East. For the  Clinton administration believes that the current PLO-Israeli  negotiations are none of its business. What does this mean?  Does such a position reflect a serious attitude? This  indisputably reflects the abandonment of responsibilities toward  the peace process, which supposedly continues to be sponsored by  the United States. Moreover, it is the United States which  continues to persistently enlist support for the Declaration of  Principles signed between the PLO and Israel. The United States  deemed this agreement the first diplomatic success of the  current administration. What about the White House ceremony?  What about the invitations extended for the first donor  conference designed to secure pledges of aid for developing the  territories sabotaged by the Israeli occupation?    It is impossible for Washington to see its role as that of a  witness at a signing ceremony as if it were a protocol official.  Likewise, no one would expect Washington to say that it has  nothing to do with the implementation of the agreement, just  because it was drafted in Oslo. It is to be recalled that it  did nothing to deter those who called the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement the Washington agreement. Many of those who believed  their eyes during the signing ceremony still call the agreement  the Washington agreement. Does all this mean that the full  partner's role is to be undertaken by Norway? This allegedly  objective U.S. impartiality reflects a favorable response to  Israeli wishes. It is not objective at all. It is true that  Washington is still concerned with the other tracks of the  negotiations. However, the experience of the past two years of  negotiations has shown that Washington, at times, impeded,  rather than aided the peace process. If the Arab negotiators  are to speak frankly about this issue, they would say that the  five rabbis, the U.S. Middle East peace talks coordinators, at  times, wanted for Israel more than it wanted for itself.  Indeed, the effort required to achieve this objective was not  that difficult. This effort sought to preclude any coordination  among the Arab negotiators.    The conclusion the Americans might have reached in the  aftermath of the Oslo agreement is that the complex of the  Israelis unilaterally handling the Palestinians has been, at  last, resolved without their intervention, and without their  having to provide any guarantees. This thinking cannot be  classified as that of a superpower. It has to be recalled that  all Arabs, be they supporters or opponents of the Oslo  agreement, believe that Washington's role was brought under the  limelight when the agreement was signed, and that this role  cannot end at that. Although this agreement is flawed, nothing  precludes efforts to rectify it. It is a mistake to attempt to  address a major conflict involving peoples' rights and the  sufferings of successive Arab generations with a mind-set that  believes that the strong must emerge as the winner, because it  had the skills required to seize the others' territory and  rights. Such views should not be espoused by a superpower, for  we are in the year 1994. What is more serious than Washington  shirking its responsibilities toward the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement is that international parties will  follow in its footsteps. Consequently, the agreement will fail  to enjoy international recognition. We have seen signs of this  eventuality. Washington might have failed to see the negative  impact of its position. No harm would be done if we remind it  that the Arabs were expected to bear heavy burdens for peace.  What then would be the consequences of sabotaging an agreement  that was concluded out of despair in the first place? Has  Washington thought of this, or is it not interested in this,  either? It is hoped that the United States will pursue historic  solutions on the remaining tracks, instead of seeking to force  settlements and take advantage of adverse circumstances. For if  it does, it, as a superpower, can then give its ally, Israel, a  model to be emulated. That is, it can produce true peace. For,  this is better than encouraging Israel to employ tricks that  only befit war criminals.</p>

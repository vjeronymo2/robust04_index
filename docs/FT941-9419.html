			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No doubt about nature of manifesto Sir, Philip Stephens' report, 'Major deepens Tory divisions on Europe' (February 11), suggests that the prime minister has tilted Tory Euro-Election preparations in a sceptical direction by announcing, at question time last Thursday, that we will fight in June on a 'distinctively British Conservative manifesto' rather than on a European People's Party (EPP) platform. There has, in fact, never been any doubt that the British Conservative European parliamentary candidates would be fighting on anything other than a British Conservative manifesto. This position has been set out with crystal clarity on several occasions by both the prime minister and by the foreign secretary. I am, in fact, confident that the Conservative party manifesto will be both balanced and positive, setting out a clear agenda for the next five-year European Parliamentary term. There is no question of it marking a fundamental shift towards Euro-scepticism. Fears in this direction are, I believe, groundless. In his article, Mr Stephens inadvertently re-cycles some well-travelled misinformation about the Conservative MEPs' relationship with the EPP. Neither the Conservative party nor the Conservative MEPs are members of the EPP party organisation, which is a transnational centre-right political party. The Conservative MEPs are 'allied members' of its European parliamentary off-shoot, the EPP parliamentary group. Our office in Conservative Central Office is the office of the British section of the EPP parliamentary group. This difference is important. British Conservative, Ulster Unionist, Danish Conservative and some French UDF MEPs all sit in the EPP group as allied members, whose full members comprise Christian Democrat and other Conservative MEPs from all over the Community. After June's elections, we hope the Gaullist MEPs will also join as allied members. Together we are all in an alliance to oppose both socialist and extreme right political forces in Europe. The EPP party organisation intends to issue a manifesto for the forthcoming elections. Although we shall part company in several specific respects, its likely commitment to an open, decentralised Europe based upon the principles of subsidiarity and market forces is one we wholeheartedly share. But whatever it says, neither the Conservative party nor the British Conservative MEPs will have played any part whatsoever in drafting it and nor will we be bound by it. That situation is the opposite of the one faced by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Their national parties are full corporate members of the transnational European Socialist and Liberal parties. Their European manifestoes are binding. Some Tory Euro-sceptics should ask themselves whose interest they are serving by propagating a deeply misleading interpretation of the role played by British Conservative MEPs in the European parliament. They should, rather, direct their anti-centralist fire not at members of their own party but at our Labour and Liberal Democrat opponents. Unless they desist from this destructive campaign, they will bear a heavy responsibility for any electoral losses which follow.

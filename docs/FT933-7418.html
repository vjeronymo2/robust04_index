			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Improved margins help lift NZ publisher 34% INDEPENDENT Newspapers, New Zealand's biggest publishing group, yesterday reported a 34.3 per cent rise in after-tax profits, to NZDollars 41.16m (USDollars 22.9m) for the year ended June 30. Mr Alan Burnet, chairman, said the group, which publishes papers in New Zealand, Australia and the US and is 51 per cent-owned by News Corporation, was planning for continuing strong growth. Turnover rose 4.4 per cent, to NZDollars 965.6m, and operating profit before abnormal items and tax was up 26.4 per cent to NZDollars 73m. Mr Burnet said profit margins widened to 7.6 per cent from 6.1 per cent last year. This followed an upturn at the Gordon and Gotch advertising business, and the the introduction of new technology in newspaper publishing. He said the company was buying the 127-year-old paper, The Nelson Evening Mail. The deal would consolidate its position as New Zealand's biggest publishing company. Natural Gas Corp, the big gas utility, reports an after-tax profit of NZDollars 17.8m for the year ended June. The result is 19 per cent ahead of the prospectus forecast given when the company was floated last September. The company is controlled by Fletcher Challenge and the Australian Gas Light Company. Mr Bill Falconer, chairman, attributed the result to higher growth rates in residential sales, lower interest rates, reduced operating costs, and improved contributions from equity profits.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF ALL THOSE AWARDS  </P> <P> With spectacular lack of anticipation, if not with pain, we brace ourselves  this time of year for that annual American function called the Heisman Trophy  voting.  </P> <P> Ballots have been circulated for the purpose of determining what is labeled the  outstanding college football player in the United States.  </P> <P> The theory here has been and always will remain that it will be a better  society when awards are abolished. They are handed out capriciously. They cause  bitterness among the deserving who are overlooked. They create false values.  </P> <P> The Heisman is singled out for its overplay, but we reject other awards with  equal passion.  </P> <P> Heisman people needn't be offended. Our revulsion of awards is  all-encompassing.  </P> <P> Well, running a historical tracer on the Heisman Trophy, occupying such stature  in national affairs, we find it is named for the late John Heisman, who gets a  law degree at Penn but chooses the existence of itinerant football coach,  touching base at Oberlin, Akron, Auburn and Clemson.  </P> <P> His next stop is Georgia Tech where, on Oct. 7, 1916, he displays the sporting  spirit winning the heart ineradicably of the Downtown Athletic Club of New  York, which he later would serve as athletic director.  </P> <P> Heisman's team at Georgia Tech beats Cumberland, 222-0.  </P> <P> No such score was known before; no such score has been known since.  </P> <P> So, a student of disasters, including the Hindenburg and the Johnstown Flood,  we get in touch with historians at Georgia Tech who, from the archives, dredge  out information showing that Heisman leads Cumberland, 63-0, in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> In the second quarter, he scores 63 more, meaning he is edging out Cumberland  at halftime, 126-0.  </P> <P> But it is clear that Heisman isn't of a mind to pour it on. In the third  quarter, he scores only 54 points, raising the count to 180-0.  </P> <P> And the final quarter is a veritable laydown. Heisman rings up but 42 points,  his team ending the game with 32 touchdowns and 30 conversions.  </P> <P> We are informed by Georgia Tech that Heisman's team gives Cumberland such a  working over that Cumberland the following week against Wofford is able to put  but 10 men on the field.  </P> <P> In order for the game to go on, Wofford must lend Cumberland a player.  </P> <P> "And what happened?" we inquire.  </P> <P> "Cumberland wins, 3-0," we are told.  </P> <P> Which, of course, makes Cumberland the comeback team of the century and casts a  shadow on the Downtown AC, which would pay homage to the architect of the worst  massacre in football history.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech is going to a bowl game this season. Decency would dictate its  players wear armbands, commemorating the diamond anniversary of the Cumberland  butchery.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech should also pay reparations.  </P> <P> But no matter how heavy the hoopla, how golden the honor is painted, the  Heisman award will never impress us, because no method of selection for such  decorations is exact enough to be just.  </P> <P> In the end, one guy is happy and maybe 24 others angry and feeling cheated.  </P> <P> If awards were expunged from this earth, everyone would be happy. There would  be fewer speeches and less contempt for the system.  </P> <P> Do you realize that Michael Milken, Charles Keating and Ivan Boesky have  received awards? The former owner of the San Diego Padres, C. Arnholt Smith,  was elected "Mr. San Diego," just before he was charged with 64 counts of bank  fraud.  </P> <P> Awards have cascaded upon George Steinbrenner. And Donald J. Trump? Tons of  them.  </P> <P> This awards habit, this curse upon American life, must stop, beginning with the  Heisman Trophy. On the hands of the winners is seen the blood of Cumberland  College.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (9): A force to be reckoned with / Profile of Hyundai Motors HYUNDAI MOTORS is one of the success stories of Korean industry. Its name is one of the very few Korean brands known to western consumers. It makes more than half the cars on Korean roads. It is perhaps the only Korean car maker capable of holding its own in world markets. But Hyundai's success is, like so much else in the Korean economy, the product of government planning. Japanese cars are banned entirely from the Korean market and other foreign cars carry prohibitive tariffs. In 1981, the government decreed that passenger cars should be made by only two companies, Hyundai and Daewoo. Given those two factors and a tenfold increase in Korean car ownership in the past decade, it would have been hard for Hyundai to fail. The going is getting tougher. According to Mr Don Lee, motors analyst at BZW in Seoul, growth in the Korean car market this year could be a mere 11 per cent, after an average 40 per cent in the previous five years. And the government has relaxed restrictions on other Korean companies entering the market. The total is now seven, a number which in the long run is plainly insupportable. Most worrying for Hyundai is the fact that Samsung, perhaps the most formidable of all the big Korean conglomerates, may also soon be allowed to make cars. But Hyundai is a force to be reckoned with. Like all the other Korean car makers, it has historically depended on Japanese technology. But this is changing. Uniquely among Korean manufacturers, Hyundai has reached the stage of making its own engines. According to Mr Lee Chung-Goo, vice-president and chief engineer of Hyundai Motor, Hyundai is technologically self-sufficient, except for engines and transmissions made under licence from Mitsubishi. But its new family of engines, the Alpha range, has already been introduced into one model, the Scoupe. The target is to put Alpha engines into the rest of the range by 1995. Nevertheless, Hyundai is some way off matching Japanese standards. In the US market, its cars are a byword for poor quality, chiefly because of disruptive union disputes at its Korean plant in the late 1980s. 'I'm not satisfied with our efficiency', Mr Lee says. 'Our union problems started from 1986 and our workmanship is still not as good as it was before then. Previously, the workforce had a hungry spirit. Now they think they can get by, so they're not so accurate as they were in assembly work. Rejects are still much worse than in 1986.' Meanwhile, he says, the Japanese have not been standing still. 'On hardware and the lines themselves, we have invested in higher productivity, and our latest plant is very close to Japanese levels. But though our average quality standards are not so far from the Japanese, the tolerance is too big. So customers complain. We need a campaign in the plant to improve that.' Another crucial advantage enjoyed by Japanese carmakers is their domestic supply of components. This is not merely a matter of quality and innovation. Component supply is central to the Japanese system of lean manufacture whereby inventories are squeezed out of the system and costs held down. 'We have many disadvantages when it comes to sub-contractors', Mr Lee says. 'According to Japanese studies, even if a manufacturer like Hyundai could catch up with the Japanese, their sub-contractors are 10 or 20 years behind. The big developments of the future will be in electronic components. Japan has suppliers like Nippondentsu and Hitachi - big companies which can support the R&amp;D. In Korea there are almost none. In things like navigation systems, the Japanese sub-contractors are ahead of the manufacturers. No Korean company is even thinking in those terms.' At present, Mr Lee claims, only 2 per cent of the value of Hyundai cars is imported. 'But I'm worried about the future. Most Korean suppliers are close to Japanese standards in hardware terms, but not in terms of human resources. Their organisation and systems may appear close to Japanese standards, but they are behind in management terms, especially when it comes to quality levels.' Despite the problems, Hyundai has ruled out the idea of manufacturing abroad. Its plant at Ulsan, on Korea's south-east coast, is the biggest single vehicle manufacturing complex in the world. The area - some 4.8m square metres - is now fully occupied. In three years, Mr Lee says, more capacity will be needed. Within the next month or so, the decision will be made on where to put it. It will certainly be in Korea. There are several reasons for this. The Korean market is of paramount importance, as are - for better or worse  - the existing links with suppliers. And a new plant will be for a new model, which as a matter of principle will be tried first on the Korean market. And, says Mr Lee, there is a cultural reason. 'The Koreans are hot and emotional people, as opposed to the Japanese who are cold and analytical. That can lead to management problems in working overseas.' Hyundai's one experience of overseas manufacture has been traumatic. In 1983 it set up an assembly plant at Bromont in Canada. As a way into the US market, it proved wildly premature. According to outside estimates, the plant is now working at only 30 per cent of capacity. 'The Bromont story hasn't been happy', Mr Lee says. 'We're presently investing in China, Thailand and Egypt. But these will probably be joint ventures where we supply parts only. In Europe and America, it will take a long time. China has cheap labour and market growth. In Europe, labour costs are higher,and the management needs to be different in philosophical terms from the Oriental model.' All the while, there is the recurring threat of excess competition in the Korean market. 'In my personal opinion', says Mr Lee, 'while Japan has reconstructed its industry through quasi-mergers, Korea is going the opposite way. That's very dangerous. I don't think mergers will be possible. All the manufacturers are from strong groups, and the owners all have strong characters. And while in the past the government could force mergers, with democracy that's harder than before.' There is another, more radical threat. Cars are one of about 30 items covered by the Korean government's so-called Import Diversification Policy, which is a polite term for banning Japanese goods from the Korean market. This is officially justified by reference to Korea's chronic trade imbalance with Japan. In reality, it has more to do with the deep-seated fear that in free market conditions Japan, the old colonial power, would re-establish its dominance by economic means. The government's economic advisers argue that this is incompatible with Korea's membership of the international free trade system, and that the barriers will have to be dismantled within the next few years. How politically realistic this is remains to be seen. But, as Mr Don Lee of BZW says: 'in terms of technology and global competitiveness this is a very important time. The Korean car companies have to develop their own technology and improve their overseas marketing in the next couple of years if they're to compete globally. Hyundai is going that way. As for the other companies, I'm very concerned.'</p>

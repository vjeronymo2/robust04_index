			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Buying New Submarines for the Navy"] </F>   [Text] The Pakistan Navy's annual naval exercises,  "Shamshir (?Bahr-e-Awwal)," have begun in the Arabian Sea.  Spread over two phases, the exercises involve Pakistan Navy  destroyers, submarines, missile carriers, oil and supply  vessels, military aircraft, helicopters, and ground units.  Following the first phase, exercises will be held in the open  sea.    These types of exercises are essential in assessing the  performance of the armed forces during peacetime, especially in  a situation where the future intentions of our neighbor India --  which has embarked on aggression against Pakistan twice in the  past -- do not seem that good. India is persistently pursuing a  naval buildup. Not only is the Indian Navy several times bigger  than the Pakistan Navy, it also possess a nuclear submarine  force. India dreams of becoming a regional superpower.  Therefore, the Pakistan Navy needs to be equipped with more  powerful and modern weapons so we will not have to hope for the  arrival of any fleet in the Indian Ocean, as we did during the  1971 war.    Chinese, Swedish, and French offers for the sale of three  new  submarines are now under consideration by the Pakistani  Government, but the Defense Ministry has yet to make any  decision on them. A delegation of Swedish military authorities  is currently visiting Pakistan along with a naval ship. The  delegation will brief Pakistan Navy authorities on the new  Swedish T-96 submarines. The Swedish offer includes full  funding and complete transfer of technology. France also wants  to transfer technology. Its submarines also possess destructive  power. China is a friendly country, but it does not have modern  technology. It is hoped that the Defense Ministry will keep  national interests in view and make a decision, so that the goal  of equipping the Navy with the most modern weapons and equipment  can be achieved in the shortest possible time.    The military buildup currently being pursued by India is  definitely a matter of concern for Pakistan and other small  countries in the region. Poverty in India is more intense than  in Pakistan. Its population, already 10 times bigger than that  of Pakistan, is growing rapidly. What is strange is that  instead of taking steps to alleviate the suffering and poverty  of its masses, the Indian leadership is spending more money on  military preparations. In fact, the Indian leaders consider  themselves the successors to British rule. Not only do they  want to establish their hegemony in this region, they want to  maintain it by increasing their weaponry and military might.    Pakistan is undoubtedly a developing country. Its people are  backward; therefore more funds need to be spent on their  economic development. It is a fact, however, that Pakistan  spends comparatively less on defense than India. Pakistan  cannot disregard its defense. India's aggressive seizure of  Kashmir and its atrocities against unarmed Kashmiris pose a  great danger to peace in South Asia.    The big powers should realize the threat posed by India's  increasing military might and the danger the countries of the  region are facing, including Pakistan. The Indian threat to  peace in South Asia is always increasing.    Given India's already formidable military power and its  ever-increasing additions to it, Pakistan cannot curtail its  defense budget. India's military strength is a permanent threat  to Pakistan's security and defense.    The Pakistan Government has justifiably decided to increase  its defense budget, matching the increase in India's defense  budget and buildup. In this context, the government has also  decided to curtail governmental expenditures. Authorities say  that taxes and revenues amounting to 180 billion rupees will be  collected before the budget so as to reduce the budget deficit.  The government has also directed that few taxes be imposed in  the budget. It is hoped that the government's steps will yield  gratifying results.</p>

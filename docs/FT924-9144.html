			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westpac shares at nine-year low SHARES in Westpac, the Australian financial services group, touched a nine-year low of ADollars 2.44 on Australian stock exchanges yesterday as the crisis surrounding the bank's financial position deepened. On Thursday the bank announced that it would be unable to meet its forecast of a 12 cents a share final dividend - made in a ADollars 1.1bn rights issue prospectus - as a result of an unexpected ADollars 115m (USDollars 80m) US tax liability. Westpac has been officially queried by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), and the Australian Securities Commission has indicated it would re-open surveillance of the bank's rights issue prospectus. Westpac shares recovered late in the day to close 24 cents down at ADollars 2.51 after the bank assured the ASX it had not withheld information on the US tax position. The ASX query resulted from comments attributed to Westpac's chief financial officer, Mr Derrick Heywood, that the US tax problems had first been detected in June. This raises the question of whether Westpac should have disclosed the US tax situation in its rights issue prospectus. Mr RI Barrett, group secretary, said yesterday that investors had been fully informed. 'A problem was detected in June 1992, and a further problem was detected in September, both of which concerned transactions in non-US currencies and accounted in total for a sum of the order of ADollars 25m which was not seen to be material in the context of underlying performance as assessed by management at that time,' Mr Barrett said. 'The matters which gave rise to Thursday's announcement concerned transactions in US dollars. The issue which emerged on or about October 15 related to those US dollar transactions and was of a different character from that considered in June and September,' he added. Westpac, which made a pre-tax loss of ADollars 2.32bn for the six months ended March, now plans to pay a final dividend of six cents a share for 1991-92. Its ADollars 1.2bn rights issue was heavily undersubscribed, culminating in the resignation of five main board directors.</p>

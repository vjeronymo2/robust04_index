			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Must try harder to do the tax return - Computing Bright new versions of all the principal home budget computer programs have blossomed with spring: Intuit's Quicken, Microsoft Money, and Sage Moneywise. All are Windows programs, and all represent significant improvements on earlier versions. Two years ago I would have fainted for joy at the features offered by any. Now I am exasperated that no-one has got it quite right. I must begin by declaring an interest: I worked with Intuit through the winter helping to anglicise parts of the Quicken manual. I expressed my exasperation to them directly. I have several years of computer account-keeping behind me now. I like knowing exactly how much we have in our various accounts. Tax returns are easier. Reconciling a bank statement is almost fun by computer, and does reveal mistakes - usually mine, sometimes the bank's. I do not bother much these days with reports and graphs. I do not even do much budgeting any more, now that I can turn back so easily to last year's figures. All three programs meet these needs admirably. All three, but especially Quicken and Moneywise, have new features, both useful and fun. And all can calculate and report on VAT, making them suitable for small businesses. Sage Moneywise is much easier to use than it used to be, but it remains unashamedly a computerised cashbook. The two American programs, Quicken and Money, include provision for accrual accounting. I think Quicken is the better of the two. Included in the box with Moneywise is a separate program to calculate the interest you should be paying or receiving on bank accounts. Amid all this excellence, what do I find to complain about? Just this: these programs do not provide the help I want with my tax return. Both Quicken and Money claim to offer help with tax. In Quicken, income and expense categories can be assigned to particular questions on the standard tax forms and drawn together in a tax report. Wonderful? No. Because neither program has included provision for the tax deducted from bank and building society accounts, or for tax credits received with dividends. You can devise categories for these items and include them in your accounts - but it will not do you much good, because you cannot get the information out again in a useful form. Quicken was the first domestic accounts program in this country to incorporate a stockmarket module. Now all three have them. Although even the best (Quicken) is not a substitute for dedicated portfolio management software - I like and use this feature. An investment performance report, offered by Microsoft Money as well, assesses performance from any date to any other date, taking everything into account - dividends, profits and losses, dealing costs, and changes in capital value. The result is expressed as a percentage of the value of the portfolio at the beginning of the chosen time span. This is one report I use regularly. Quicken gives the return on our portfolio in 1993 as 16.5 per cent, not counting tax credits - that sounds all right. Microsoft Money has been imperfectly anglicised, with the result, among other oddities, that shares cannot be arranged according to stock market sector. Sage's portfolio is not fully integrated with the rest of the program. My husband and I own most of our share portfolio jointly, but for historical reasons, we each have some shares in our sole names. Most of the time we think of the whole lot as 'the shares', without distinction. I need a program which allows me to divide the shares into different accounts according to ownership, but view and update them together. In Quicken and Microsoft Money, but not Sage Moneywise, this is easily done. It is a valuable feature. It means, for example, that each of your personal equity plans could be placed in an account of its own, but merged with each other and the rest of your portfolio when required. So far so good. At income tax time, proper distinctions must be made. My summers are darkened by the need to draw up lists for our tax returns of his dividends, her dividends, their dividends; his shares-in-lieu, her shares-in-lieu, their shares-in-lieu; and then the gilts and the unit trusts and finally, in a little list all of their own, my husband's four dividends from Bowater, including income from savings and investments abroad. Quicken offers many report formats, all capable of a variety of modifications, but will not produce a simple list of dividends and tax credits. Microsoft Money has not even heard of tax credits. Sage Moneywise, being British, will produce the list. But Sage makes no provision for shares-in-lieu, and will not let me merge the portfolios. Does no one besides myself mind? I feel that these otherwise excellent programs have invited my discontent by promising 'tax reports'. If I use either Quicken or Money for a year, all the information the tax man wants will be there, carefully typed in and verified as bank accounts are reconciled. I want to click my mouse and see the lists roll out of my printer. Maybe next spring? These programs require an IBM-compatible computer running MS-DOS version 3.1 or higher and Microsoft Windows. Money Version 3 costs about Pounds 50, including VAT. Telephone: 0734-270001. Moneywise Version 2 costs Pounds 49 plus VAT. It requires Windows 3.1 and at least 2 MB of memory (RAM); 4 MB is recommended. Telephone: 091-2013000. Quicken 3 for Windows costs Pounds 59.95 including VAT. It requires Windows 3.1 and at least 2 MB of RAM. Telephone: 0800-585058.</p>

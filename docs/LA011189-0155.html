			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOUSEHOLD FINANCE PARENT FIRM TO TRIM NON-SERVICE UNITS  </P> <P> Household International Inc., the diversified financial services company that  owns Household Finance, today announced a restructuring that will eliminate its  manufacturing holdings through spinoffs and asset sales.  </P> <P> Household's shares surged $4.675 to $61.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in  reaction to the plan.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, Household's stockholders will receive shares in three new  companies to be created from operations that make up most of its Household  Manufacturing subsidiary. Six units will be sold.  </P> <P> The effect of the transactions will be to reduce debt and sharpen the company's  focus on financial services.  </P> <P> The manufacturing unit's 1988 sales amounted to more than $1 billion and  represented more than 20% of the total sales and profits for the company, based  in Prospect Heights, Ill. Its businesses ranged from Thermos Inc., maker of  insulated consumer products, to Scotsman ice makers and GC-Thorsen tools.  </P> <P> "These actions are intended to create more focused entities and should increase  the value of Household shareholders' investment," Chairman Donald Clark said in  a statement.  </P> <P> Household shareholders will receive shares of Eljer Industries Inc., a building  products company; Schwitzer Inc., which makes turbochargers, engine cooling  systems and vibration dampers, and Scotsman Industries Inc., which makes  commercial ice makers and drink dispensing equipment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> April Distribution  </P> <P> The distribution, at a ratio of one new share of each of the three spun off  units for every five shares of Household International, is planned for April  15. It is subject to various approvals, the company said.  </P> <P> The company's investment banking adviser, J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., said the  shares of the manufacturing division will trade "at higher market valuations  than these businesses are now accorded as part of Household International."  </P> <P> Among the six units of Household that will be sold are Albion Industries, which  makes heavy duty casters for material handling; King-Seeley, a supplier of  cooking appliance controls and timers; Omni Products International, a supplier  of leisure furniture, and WaterTest Corp., which provides water testing  services.  </P></p>

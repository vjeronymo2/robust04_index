			<p>BFN     [Text] Radio Rwanda has announced that the self-imposed  President Sindikubwabo will attend Mandela's swearing-in today.  Sindikubwabo has nothing to celebrate in Mandela's victory.  Mandela has been fighting for democracy and the creation of a  just society for all, while Sindikubwabo is responsible for the  massacres of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.  Sindikubwabo has been committing genocide against the people of  Tutsi origin in Rwanda. Oppression of one group of people  against another group is what Mr. Mandela has been fighting  throughout his life. Mr. Mandela is seen as a symbol of freedom  the world over. Sindikubwabo is a wanted criminal for  committing crimes against humanity. Sindikubwabo has not even  been invited to attend today's occasion in South Africa because  his government is illegitimate and has been denounced by the  whole world. The victory of South Africans against apartheid  should sound a warning for Sindikubwabo and his fascist  colleagues that their days are numbered.</p>

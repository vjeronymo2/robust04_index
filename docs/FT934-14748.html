			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Rio group urges rapid trade deal LATIN AMERICAN presidents will again press for a swift conclusion to international trade negotiations and for a commitment to open access to markets when they meet today in Santiago, the Chilean capital. The Uruguay Round is one of the main topics for debate at the annual Rio Group summit, which will host presidents from 11 Latin American states, plus a representative each from Central America and the Caribbean, this year El Salvador and Jamaica. Latin American countries, many of which have undergone radical economic liberalisation since the mid-1980s, feel they have received scant reward. 'We have been liberalising our markets without better access to markets in the developed world,' said one official. Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's finance minister, put it more tersely. 'We are very confused and disappointed by the total failure of the Gatt negotiations and by the sad spectacle of industrialised nations doing their best not to agree on some obvious matters such as the agricultural issue,' he said. 'It is a task that has been postponed and swept under the rug for years.' Other topics likely to be discussed at the summit include the role of regional trading blocks, the strengthening of the region's often fragile democracies, and combating chronic poverty, which worsened sharply during the 1980s.</p>

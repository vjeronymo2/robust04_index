			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CALCAVECCHIA HAS 69 FOR A SHARE OF LEAD  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia, warming up along with the temperature, shot a two-under-par  69 Friday to move into a three-way tie for the lead in the $800,000 Nestle  Invitational golf tournament at Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia, a two-time winner this season, finished two rounds over the Bay  Hill Club course with a three-under-par 139. He was tied with first  round-leader Loren Roberts, who shot a 73, and Davis Love III, who had the  day's best round, a 67.  </P> <P> It was 20 degrees warmer than on Thursday, but a howling wind still made the  conditions difficult.  </P> <P> Dan Pohl, Tom Kite and Larry Rinker were tied at 140, one stroke back. Rinker  shot a 68 and Kite had a 72.  </P> <P> Larry Mize, with a 71, and Fred Couples were tied at 141. Couples shot a 69  that included a 30 on the back nine.  </P> <P> Masters champion Sandy Lyle was disqualified. Lyle, 11-over par for the  tournament, shot into the water on the 18th and walked off the course without  completing the hole.  </P> <P> Bobby Nichols, trying for his first victory on the PGA Seniors Tour, shot a  10-under-par 62 to take the first-round lead in the $300,000 Arizona tournament  at Phoenix.  </P> <P> "It's the best competitive-round score I've ever had," the 52-year-old Nichols  said. "I shot a 61 once but it was not in competition."  </P> <P> Al Geiberger, the defending champion, was second with a 65 on the new  6,617-yard Pointe Golf Course. Harold Henning, Miller Barber, Tommy Aaron and  Dick Rhyan shot 66s.  </P> <P> Briton Tony Charnley, who has yet to win in 14 years on the PGA European Tour,  shot a three-under-par 69 for a 136 total and a three-shot lead after two  rounds of the $100,000 Baleares Open at Palma de Majorca in the Balearic  Islands.  </P> <P> Defending champion Severiano Ballesteros of Spain birdied two of the final four  holes and barely made the cut at 145.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 AREA TEAMS MAKE SEMIFINAL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Four Southeast/Long Beach area high school teams are still alive in the CIF  Southern Section football playoffs, including Whittier Christian and Valley  Christian, which face each other in a Division IX semifinal game at 7:30 p.m.  Friday at Whittier College.  </P> <P> Undefeated Whittier Christian (11-0) won its first two playoff games, 52-6  against San Jacinto and 61-28 over Desert, after averaging 37 points a game  during the regular season.  </P> <P> But it is doubtful if the Heralds, coached by Phil Bravo, will be overconfident  -- they had to come from a 28-7 halftime deficit to beat Valley Christian,  33-28, in October.  </P> <P> Mike Wunderley's Valley Christian Crusaders of Cerritos are 6-5 and coming off  a 24-6 victory over Bishop last week.  </P> <P> In Division I, Paramount (12-0) will play El Toro (11-1) at 7:30 p.m. Saturday  at Mission Viejo High School. The game will be a rematch of last year's  Division III title game, which was won by Paramount, 26-20.  </P> <P> Besides the running of Leon Neal, the Paramount Pirates have a potent passing  attack, led by quarterback Steve Lopez, who has thrown for 1,492 yards and 22  touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Pirates, who beat Muir, 35-13, last week, have won 20 consecutive games.  </P> <P> In Division III, St. Paul (7-3-2) plays 10-2 Hawthorne at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at  Cerritos College.  </P> <P> St. Paul of Santa Fe Springs, coached by Miguel Olmedo, has won six games in a  row, including a 42-7 victory over Beverly Hills in the second round last week.  </P> <P> The Swordsmen are led by defensive lineman Tim Norton, the lineman of the year  in the Mission League, and tight end Ryan Granillo, who is averaging 13 yards a  pass reception and is also a good blocker.  </P></p>

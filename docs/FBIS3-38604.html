			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Leaving the Hotel de Ville in Rennes, Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur announced that he will meet with  representatives of the fishing industry. The minister for  [agriculture and] fisheries said only that the meeting will  probably take place in the late morning. Balladur went on to  the Regional Council. [passage omitted]    At the beginning of his remarks, the prime minister of  course  started by mentioning the fishing dispute:    [Begin Balladur recording] Faced with this crisis, we are  ready to use all means possible to come to the help of those who  are threatened or let down by the evolution of the world and the  evolution of society. We have already applied this principle in  the farming sector. We are applying this same principle to  industrial sectors which are in difficulty. I am resolved to  apply the same principle also to the fishing sector, which, in  its turn is also experiencing difficulties caused by many  different factors. But, whatever the cause, the government  intends to resolve problems which occur, and we will do for the  fishing industry what we did for the farming industry. In other  words, we will make sure that those involved in Brittany or  elsewhere will have a better future to look forward to. [end  recording]</p>

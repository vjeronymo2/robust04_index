			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pepsi's Hot Spot: Just about anyone watching commercial television tonight --  almost anywhere in the world -- has a good chance of viewing the much  ballyhooed Pepsi-Cola commercial featuring rock star Madonna. The two-minute  ad, which ad industry sources estimate cost Pepsi more than $1 million to  create and upwards of $5 million to air, will be shown in 40 countries. The ad,  which features Madonna debuting her new song "Like a Prayer," will be aired in  the United States during the first commercial break of "The Cosby Show" on NBC.  Later in the evening, 30-second versions of the ad will air during the TV shows  "Cheers" and "LA Law."  </P></p>

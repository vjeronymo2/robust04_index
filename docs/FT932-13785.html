			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC to curb Czech and Slovak steel THE European Commission yesterday agreed to limit imports of steel from the Czech and Slovak republics over the next two years. The decision is part of an effort to protect the EC's struggling steel industry from recession, overcapacity and cheap imports. The Commission announced that the agreement would allow a 'progressive increase' in imports until 1995, 'balancing the twin imperatives of restructuring for the (Community) steel industry and gradual opening of trade with (east and central Europe)'. Officials were not immediately able to give more precise information about the restrictions or the products affected, but further details were expected to emerge later. Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, had been arguing for a relatively generous increase in imports of 35 per cent up to 1995, compared with 1991 figures. But his colleague, Mr Martin Bangemann, responsible for industry, wanted to a 20 per cent limit, following complaints from EC producers that imports of cheap east European steel were destabilising the Community market. Mr Bangemann and Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, met EC steelmakers last night in Germany to discuss the industry's closure and restructuring plan. Producers have until the end of September to come up with realistic capacity cuts, to be backed by a package of commercial and financial measures agreed by Community members. EC industry ministers said in February they would support tariff-quotas on imports of individual steel products from the east alleged to be undermining the EC market. The Community had already agreed in principle to restrict Czech and Slovak steel imports, under the terms of trade agreements with the two republics. Yesterday's decision should bring those restrictions in line with the terms of the general support plan.</p>

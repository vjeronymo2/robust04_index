			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FAILURES: Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine (A3, D5), now target of a state  criminal investigation, has hardly been the only Orange County thrift to go  under. . . . In the last four years, 13 other S&amp;Ls based here have failed  -- more than in any other California county. Ten county banks failed this  decade, also a high in the state. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

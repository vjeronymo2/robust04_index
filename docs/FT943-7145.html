			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Cuban exiles await the green light from US: James Harding hears Bay of Pigs veterans vent their views on the continuing exodus from the island The 2506 Brigade is in a belligerent mood. At its Miami headquarters, the members of the Bay of Pigs invasion force that made an abortive bid to overthrow President Fidel Castro in April 1961 think it is time to take another shot at the Cuban leader. 'We sense this is the beginning of the end,' says Mr Jorge Marquet, former infantryman in the brigade's 5th battalion. 'A revolution is able to succeed at any moment. 2506 Brigade wants to be with our brothers in Cuba. We are again willing to sacrifice our lives.' Washington is unlikely to share some of the brigade veterans' enthusiasm for another US-sponsored expeditionary force. The Bay of Pigs invasion, in which some 1,500 anti-Castro Cuban exiles were landed on the island's southwest shore in a US-financed and directed operation only to be defeated and captured within four days, is widely seen as an exemplary military bungle. However, 2506 Brigade veterans include some of the most prominent members of the Cuban American community, and represent an influential cross-section of opinion. Most conspicuous and politically astute of the 2506 alumni is Mr Jorge Mas Canosa. Mr Mas, a member of 2506 Brigade's naval force and now one of Miami's leading businessmen, is the founder and chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, the community's most powerful lobby. On Friday Mr Mas flew up to Washington with Florida's Governor Lawton Chiles for a private meeting with President Bill Clinton after the US broke with 28 years of policy and announced that Cuban refugees would no longer be welcomed in the US. Instead, they would be taken to a detention camp at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Following the meeting the US announced it would tighten its embargo on the island, a move the foundation endorsed. 'We support the whole package,' one official said. However, not all Bay of Pigs veterans support the bar on refugees entering the US. Mr Arturo Cobo, 3rd battalion veteran and director of the Key West Transit Centre for Cuban Refugees, advocates an international embargo and rejects the new detention policy. His priority is 'assisting my sisters and brothers escaping Cuba for freedom in the US.' Despite the change in policy that has ended the tide of Cubans coming through his centre, Mr Cobo keeps the doors open in the hope that 'things will get back to normal immigration policy.' Adopting an even tougher line is Mr Jose Miro, 2nd battalion infantryman and current president of the Brigade. Mr Miro is drawing up plans for a new Cuban-American invasion force. On Monday night Mr Miro, a Cuban-trained lawyer and now retired life insurance salesman, met his board of directors at the brigade's headquarters and memorial hall. On the back wall of the meeting room hang the pictures of the 114 Bay of Pigs martyrs; left of the speaker's podium a perspex box contains a model of Havana's future Cuban Memorial Museum which will chart the fight for independence from the battle against the Spanish to the overthrow of Fidel Castro. At the top of Mr Miro's agenda was the need to start recruiting a new force to overthrow the Cuban president. Mr Miro did not foresee any problems in gathering the 25,000 people he estimates he needs to defeat Mr Castro. 'All we need from the US government is the equipment and a green light,' he says. He subscribes to the pressure cooker theory - if the Cuban people are forced to stay under deteriorating conditions caused by a full blockade, they will ultimately rise up and overthrow their oppressor. However, Mr Castro's imminent downfall has been predicted for many years. In front of Mr Miro's office hangs the 2506 Brigade standard. It was handed to President John F. Kennedy after the US paid a Dollars 53m ransom for the release of Bay of Pigs captives held in Cuba for 20 months. At the presentation in Miami's Orange Bowl, President Kennedy said: 'I can assure you that this flag will be returned to this brigade in a free Havana.' That was December 1962 and the standard is still in Miami.</p>

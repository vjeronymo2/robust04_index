			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> "The Cubans won!" salsa singer Celia Cruz shouted in Spanish as Cuban-Americans  and southern Republicans celebrated Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's election to Congress  in Miami. Ros-Lehtinen defeated Gerald Richman after an ethnically divisive  campaign for the late Claude Pepper's seat. "Now it's time for healing, now we  have to reach out to all those (ethnically divided) sections," Ros-Lehtinen  declared. Ros-Lehtinen is the first Cuban-American elected to Congress.  Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater expressed delight at the GOP's latest  Southern success; the party picked up a seat held by a liberal Democrat for 27  years and won its first congressional victory in Dade County.  </P></p>

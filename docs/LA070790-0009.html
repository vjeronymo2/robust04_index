			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> COUNTY BOARD TO CONSIDER AIRPORT PLAN  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors will consider later this month whether to approve an  agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration to build a permanent air  traffic control tower at Camarillo Airport.  </P> <P> The permanent tower would replace a 37-foot-high temporary tower erected at the  airport last year.  </P> <P> The agreement, which would give the county a 40-year lease on the new control  tower when it is completed, is necessary because the FAA is providing the $1.5  million needed to build the six-story structure. The supervisors will consider  the agreement July 24.  </P> <P> "It's long overdue," said James G. O'Neill, the airport administrator.  </P> <P> The county has been seeking federal money for an air traffic control tower  since 1982, when the annual number of landings and takeoffs at the county-owned  airport first exceeded 200,000, O'Neill said. The FAA requires control towers  at airports where operations exceed that number, he said.  </P> <P> Last year, about 210,000 flights began or ended at the airport, airport  spokesman Jeff McCaullay said.  </P> <P> If the lease agreement is approved, construction on the permanent tower would  begin in November, with work ending in May, 1992, McCaullay said.  </P> <P> "It's not soon enough," he said. "Getting that brand new tower is like a  windfall to us."  </P> <P> The airport's three air traffic controllers now work in a cramped room  supported by two large shipping crates. Controllers sitting in the  glass-enclosed structure have a full view from three sides and a partial view  from the fourth side, O'Neill said.  </P> <P> "It's a no-frills tower and was never meant to be permanent," he said.  </P> <P> The new tower will include office space, an elevator, restrooms and drinking  fountains, O'Neill said. Controllers must now walk about 75 yards to the  nearest restroom facility, he said. CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

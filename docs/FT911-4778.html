			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK group breaks new ground in Moscow BRITAIN'S Carroll Group yesterday became the first western company to obtain a long-term lease on Soviet land when it finalised an agreement to build a Pounds 150m trade centre in Moscow. It has created a joint venture with Moscow city council's Association of Hotels for the project. The British-Soviet Trade Centre is due to open on a 5-acre site in 1994. The 99-year lease is the closest thing to foreign land ownership allowed under new legislation in the Russian Federation, the country's largest republic, which has tried to press ahead with radical economic reform. But the legislation has stopped short of allowing outright ownership by foreigners, partly because of fears that it would allow them to swallow up land at bargain prices. The centre will include 20,000 square metres of office accommodation as well as 500 hotel rooms. To facilitate approval of the deal, Carroll has also agreed to build a kindergarten for the local district, as well as homes for 150 families.</p>

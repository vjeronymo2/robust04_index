			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a statement by Alija Izetbegovic, president of </F> the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, in Sarajevo on 4 May --  recorded]    [Text] In the past 10 days, President of the Presidency  Alija Izetbegovic has twice toured the Bosnia-Herzegovina free  territories. Upon his return to Sarajevo, President Izetbegovic  gave a statement to Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Izetbegovic] I have made two visits: Last week I visited  for four days. This was primarily a visit to the army, and I  did not make any civilian tours. I thought that after Gorazde,  I ought to tour the fronts, so I went to (?Niksici), the front  near (?Niksici), for the first time. After that I toured the  front in Olovo, and then went on to Tesanj and Maglaj. On the  second occasion -- after I returned -- [words indistinct] three  days, I visited the Kladanj front, which is a very important and  hot front. Then I visited the Brcko front, which has recently  been frequently mentioned as the probable scene of a future  offensive, a massive Serb offensive, and finally, yesterday I  visited Mt. Vlasic, the Mt. Vlasic front. [Words indistinct] on  the hills themselves, on the 1,700-meter and [word indistinct]  high peaks. So, if I were to talk about my impressions, I could  say that on the one hand, the morale of the troops is extremely  high, considering the circumstances under which the people are  fighting. My aim was actually to [words indistinct] under which  our units up there are living, because I had been informed that  there were great problems with food, accommodation, clothing,  ammunition, and so forth. Such problems do exist, but my  conclusion -- after analyzing the situation in the General  Staff, as we did late last night -- is that the problems can be  solved and we shall begin solving them immediately. Some of the  issues we have already solved. Actually, the problem of caring  for the families of our troops needs to be solved in a definite  and systematic way [words indistinct]. We need to solve the  problem of nutrition [words indistinct] of our troops. This  problem has so far been more or less solved in a satisfactory  way. It is only lately that certain problems have arisen.  After the subject was broached and it was discussed whether  this was the obligation of the commune or the Defense Ministry.  [sentence as heard] Then we have the issue of attire --  clothing and footwear. I believe that we shall soon solve these  issues in a satisfactory way, that is, in the conditions under  which are troops are fighting. I met many of them, I personally  listened to them, I saw what they were being fed, and I visited  their sleeping quarters -- I believe, for example, that those on  Mt. Vlasic are cold in the night, and so forth. Therefore,  these problems do exist but we will solve them.</p>

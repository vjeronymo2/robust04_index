			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GILBERT &amp; SULLIVAN COMPANY DECIDES IT WILL BRANCH OUT  </P> <P> When the San Diego Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Company ends its 11th season with  "The Gondoliers," March 30 through April 8 at the Casa Del Prado Theatre in  Balboa Park, it will also be doffing its name and ending an era.  </P> <P> The company will be reborn as the San Diego Comic Opera Company.  </P> <P> And just what's in that name? Plenty.  </P> <P> Leon Natker, chosen as the company's artistic director last year, said the new  name will reflect a new repertoire for the organization. The company will  branch out with a variety of old and new musical theater and small opera  offerings in its three- to four-play seasons.  </P> <P> The first show of the 1990-1991 season will be "The Beggar's Opera" by John  Gay, opening Sept. 14 at the Casa Del Prado. The other shows, with specific  dates to be announced, will be a concert celebrating the 75th anniversary of  Balboa Park with music of 1915, including selections from John Philip Sousa,  George M. Cohan and Gilbert and Sullivan in October; "Rose Marie," composed by  Rudolf Friml with book and lyrics by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II, in  March or April, and "H.M.S. Pinafore," by Gilbert and Sullivan, in June.  </P> <P> Part of the reason for changing the focus of the organization is that the  restrictions of a limited repertoire are catching up with the company.  </P> <P> "How long can you support a theater that keeps recycling a dozen pieces?"  Natker asked. "After we ran through the entire G&amp;S repertoire in the first  five years, subscriptions took a dramatic 40% dive. We've never really built  back. When Holly (Hollace Koman, founder and first artistic director of the  company) started, she had wonderful casts. That changed when she could no  longer afford to pay her artists as much and they were tired of doing the same  thing over and over again."  </P> <P> The San Diego Comic Opera Company will still produce at least one Gilbert and  Sullivan operetta a year, Natker promised. But don't be surprised if even that  opera is not what it used to be.  </P> <P> "The Gondoliers," directed by Natker, will be set in modern Venice. Natker's  aim is to play up the political satire in Gilbert's tirade about the extremists  of democracy fighting the extremists of monarchy, without a single sensible  voice among them.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is find parallels in our own era," Natker said. "The  political points are salient. It's all about little islands like Grenada and  the Falklands, about dictatorships and colonialism. I want people to go away  from this not only being entertained, but thinking about something as well.  That was Gilbert's objective."  </P> <P> Also among Natker's objectives is to offer surprise where the San Diego Gilbert  &amp; Sullivan Company once promised predictability.  </P> <P> By presenting rarely seen, small-scale productions of works by Offenbach, early  Jerome Kern and Cohan, as well as small chamber musicals and small commissioned  pieces, Natker hopes to attract the growing San Diego audiences that have come  to expect new and experimental works from leading local theaters, especially in  the past six or seven years.  </P> <P> The theater has a balanced budget now, after battling a deficit for the past  four to five years, Natker said. But that can change quickly.  </P> <P> "I have to compete with all these theaters," Natker said. "I have to say, 'Come  spend your theater dollars with me and not with them.' I've got to offer a new  audience something new to see. I know I've already offended some of the people  on the church-singing circuit who have nice voices but are not actors. But if  we don't change, we're going away. We're in a make-or-break situation. Either  the company goes into the 1990s or it closes its doors."  </P></p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Amerada Hess to shed 10% of staff AMERADA HESS, the US oil company whose North Sea operations have expanded rapidly in recent years, is to cut about 10 per cent of its 1,000-strong UK workforce today. The staff cuts are thought to be confined to onshore workers and are not expected to affect employees on North Sea production rigs. The company has blamed the cuts on changes to the Petroleum Revenue Tax introduced by the government in the last Budget. Other factors cited by the company include the present low oil prices and the fact that the prospect of further large-scale oil discoveries in the North Sea is becoming more remote. The cut marks an end to Amerada's aggressive expansion of its British operations in recent years. It spent more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 519m) to develop the Scott field, which was brought onstream last month recently and is likely to be one of the largest developments on the UK continental shelf in the 1990s. Amerada has made no secret of its opposition to the tax changes proposed by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, in his Budget speech last March. The company's biggest concern, shared by a number of smaller oil companies operating in the North Sea, was that exploration costs could no longer be offset against the tax. The company has repeatedly warned in recent months that it would have to re-assess its exploration programme in the UK. It said that the tax reforms reduced the incentive for companies to seek out the smaller reserves of oil which are likely to characterise UK offshore exploration in coming years. Mr Sam Laidlow, managing director of Amerada's UK operations, predicted earlier this year that job cuts would follow the introduction of the new tax system. The government's reforms included a lowering of the tax rate on existing fields and its elimination on new fields. The effect of the changes was to make production from developed fields more profitable but to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies that had been able to take advantage of the tax offset. Almost 160 jobs are to be created by Avon Rubber, the tyre and motor parts company, in a Pounds 3m investment to produce components for vehicle air conditioning systems near Williamstown, Rhondda, south Wales.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Kleinwort Benson in Dollars 23m write-off KLEINWORT Benson, the London merchant banking group, has had to write off loans totalling Dollars 23m (Pounds 13.6m) to a US development capital company founded by a former director. The loss was disclosed in the group's latest annual report released yesterday. The loans were made to companies linked to Mr Kenneth McCormick, an American banker who was hired by Kleinwort Benson in the mid-1980s to set up and run a swaps business in Los Angeles called Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing (KBCF). Mr McCormick became a director both of KBCF and Kleinwort Benson Ltd, the merchant banking arm of the group. According to the annual report, the Kleinwort group made a series of loans beginning in 1987 to Ojai Capital, a partnership founded by Mr McCormick, to finance start-ups and property investments in California. Loans were also made to Kenneth McCormick &amp; Co, a company set up by Mr McCormick to provide management services to KBCF. The loans amounted to Dollars 15m by the end of 1989. Last year further loans, plus unpaid interest and unreimbursed expenses amounted to an additional Dollars 5.81m. In May KBCF advanced Mr McCormick's company a further Dollars 1.92m. But later last year Kleinwort decided that Ojai Capital was not financially viable, and it decided to sever its connections with Mr McCormick's companies. It made a full provision against the Dollars 22.73m owed by them. It also terminated its operating agreement with Kenneth McCormick &amp; Co, incurring in the process a Dollars 2.4m payment. As part of a settlement agreement, Kleinwort has waived all claims against McCormick and Ojai, and was itself also released from any claims from Mr McCormick and his business interests. Mr McCormick resigned his Kleinwort directorships in February. He was not immediately available for comment last night. The loss comes at a difficult time for Kleinwort. The group recently reported an overall loss of Pounds 68m before tax for 1990, largely because of a Pounds 34m loss on a misjudged block trade in Premier Oil shares. Lex, Page 20</p>

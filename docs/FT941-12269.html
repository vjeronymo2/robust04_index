			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The Bundesbank policy-making council meets on Thursday for the third time this year and could well seize the opportunity to cut the discount rate for the first time since October. One positive factor is that inflation is coming back under control - the 3.4 per cent rise in prices in January reported last week was better than expected and points to inflation down to below the 3 per cent for 1993 as a whole. Another is the Bundesbank's insistence that however dreadful the delayed money supply figures for December turn out to be, this should be put down to special factors. The Bundesbank is encouraging markets to look ahead, saying that in January M3 growth subsided. Ms Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets Research in London says the easing may come via a move to a 28-day variable-rate repo tender on Tuesday. This would the first move from fixed-rate repos since early November and could usher in a cut in 'official rates' on Thursday. She argues that the recent weakness of the D-Mark will not discourage a rate cut - 'the D-mark is weak precisely because interest rate easing is already discounted'. In the bund market further easing is not so well discounted and yields on 10-year bunds are likely to fall from Friday's 5.72 per cent level if the Bundesbank acts.</p>

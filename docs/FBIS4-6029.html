			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The head of the North  Korean delegation to the eighth round of inter-Korean  working-level talks will likely be relieved of his post due to  trouble caused by his remarks at talks threatening to turn Seoul  into a "sea of fire," South Korean Government officials said  Sunday.    Pak Yong-su, also deputy director (vice-minister level) of  the Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of  the Fatherland, has been in an awkward position since the threat  triggered international criticism.    Pak's position was seemingly worsened by Seoul's withdrawal  of its demand for an envoy exchange, the officials said.    "We saw Pak trying to make his ability acknowledged by the  North Korean leadership during the eighth round of inter-Korean  talks," they said. "The only way for Pak to survive seems to be  proving his value once another round of working-level talks  resumes."    The officials added, however, "It is not likely that he will  survive because we are not pursuing the exchange of envoys."    North Korean officials have recently tried to appease the  international community, with Workers' Party Secretary Kim  Yong-sun explaining that Pak's remarks were made out of  excitement. Moreover, one of the other delegates to the meeting  said on a Pyongyang talk show that Pak's remarks had been  distorted by the South.</p>

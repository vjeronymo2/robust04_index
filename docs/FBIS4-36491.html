			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jordanian Information Minister </F> Stresses Amman's Neutrality in Yemeni Crisis"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Jordanian Information  Minister Jawad al-'Anani has said that Jordan's neutral position  on the Yemeni crisis has not changed since the crisis began,  contrary to what some media services say.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT he added that "Jordan  was  aware early on of the dangers of an armed conflict in Yemen. It  made great efforts with the two parties to the Yemeni crisis  until we held a conference to sign the Pledge and Accord  Document, which was tantamount to a defusing of the fighting and  a step toward dialogue and a peaceful understanding. It was in  response to a written request from President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid."</p>

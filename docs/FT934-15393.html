			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Storehouse loses finance director MR GRAHAM RIDER has resigned as finance director of Storehouse, the retail group, with immediate effect. His is the latest in a series of board changes at the company, including four finance directors since 1989 and three chief executives since 1988. The shares slipped 4p to 207p yesterday, although the company stressed Mr Rider's departure did not reflect any worsening of trading performance, nor a clash of personalities or disagreement with Mr Keith Edelman, the latest chief executive, who joined in August. The timing of his departure is sudden, with Storehouse due to publish interim results on November 18. Storehouse said yesterday nothing had changed since it said in mid-September that sales at its BhS and Mothercare chains were up. Mr Rider is expected to receive some compensation, although not fully reflecting his two-year contract and annual salary of around Pounds 150,000. Compensation payments have become a feature of Storehouse's annual report. The latest said six directors had left during the year, including Mr David Dworkin, the chief executive who departed in March. He had taken on the role last July when Mr Michael Julien, chief executive since 1988, left due to ill-health. Five directors shared compensation of Pounds 1.16m, while Mr Dworkin took a Pounds 2.71m profit-related bonus which, with his salary, gave him Pounds 3.29m in the year. Storehouse's run of finance directors began in November 1989 when Mr James Power took early retirement. He was succeeded by Mr Bob Mackenzie, who left suddenly in October 1990, leaving a gap until Mr David Simons joined in February 1991. Mr Rider, who is 40, joined the group in February 1992 as finance director of BhS. He was propelled into the group finance director's role in December 1992 when Mr Simons left to join Isosceles, the Gateway food retailer. An outside observer said yesterday that rapid promotion had come too soon for him. Storehouse said the successor would probably come from outside the company. The observer added: 'Keith Edelman probably has someone lined up already, perhaps from Carlton Communications or Ladbroke.' Mr Edelman previously worked at those two companies.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BOY'S AUTOPSY: NO HEART TROUBLE  </P> <P> A Little Leaguer who died from heart failure after a wild pitch struck him in  the chest had no history of heart problems, a doctor said. The autopsy showed  that the impact of the ball stopped 10-year-old William Ryan Wojick's heart,  the Hillsborough County medical examiner's office said.  </P> <P> National Little League officials said it was only the second time in at least  40 years that a child has died playing league baseball.  </P> <P> Wojick was at bat during the fourth inning of a game at the Citrus Park Little  League field Sunday. He was struck in the upper left side of his chest and  collapsed at home plate. The child was flown by helicopter to St. Joseph's  Hospital when paramedics from a fire station next to the field could not revive  him, a Sheriff's Office report says.  </P></p>

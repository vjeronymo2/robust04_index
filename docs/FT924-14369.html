			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: MAI sells Avenir stake to French parent MAI, the financial services and media combine, is accepting an offer from Havas, the French media group, for its 15.2 per cent stake in Avenir Havas Media, the outdoor advertising group. MAI will receive convertible bonds with a nominal value of Pounds 40m which are redeemable in 1997 for Pounds 51m, giving a yield to redemption of 7.7 per cent. The deal would add Pounds 24m to MAI's net worth, taking it to Pounds 198m. Havas has made the same offer to other minority holders in Avenir, in which it has a near 56 per cent stake. The bonds will bear a 3 per cent coupon and be publicly listed. Lord Hollick, managing director of MAI, said the sale would boost MAI's post-tax income, as the coupon on the bonds would exceed the dividend the group had been receiving from its Avenir shares. In pre-tax terms the sale would lock in a level of profit - on the 7.7 per cent yield - higher than the Pounds 2.2m contribution made in the year to June when profits at Avenir were depressed. The sale would take MAI's net cash to about Pounds 150m. Lord Hollick said the group was in the middle of a Pounds 75m investment programme, which includes spending on Meridian, the TV company which starts broadcasting in January. The stake in Avenir dates back to 1989 when MAI and Havas each injected their media interests into it. At the time MAI held a 36 per cent interest, which was reduced through sales in 1990 and 1991. This disposal will take the total proceeds from advertising to Pounds 200m. MAI's accounts, published yesterday, show that Lord Hollick's remuneration during the year was Pounds 426,000, up from Pounds 348,000 the previous year, and nearly returning to the Pounds 439,000 he received in 1990. Havas yesterday denied that it had been building up a stake in Hachette, the heavily-indebted French media group, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Hachette claimed on Thursday that Havas had been buying its shares. The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market's regulatory body, said it was investigating dealings inHachette shares, which rose sharply mid-week but fell back on Friday on Havas' denial.</p>

So  today we continue the topic of a nuclear-free Ukraine.    Talking with our correspondent Vitaliy Lytvynov, Colonel  General Ivan Oliynyk, deputy defense minister for arms issues,  speaks on the military, scientific, and technological aspects of  the implementation of the trilateral statement and an appendix  to it on the elimination of nuclear weapons on the territory of  Ukraine:    Oliynyk, in Russian with superimposed Ukrainian  translation: "The atmosphere at the meeting between the  three presidents on 14 January 1994 was exceptionally friendly  and benevolent. It was one of respect. The timing of the  meeting was no accident. It had been predetermined by a number  of factors which need airing and explaining today. Factor 1 is  the technical condition of the nuclear warheads in Ukraine  today. Factor 2 is our difficult economic situation. And,  finally, Factor 3 is that both the president and government had  to implement the decisions taken by the Ukrainian Supreme  Council."    Lytvynov: The world has reacted to this in a very  positive manner. The interpretation of this issue here in  Ukraine, however, is not uniform, in particular because the  people are concerned about us actually becoming defenseless  should we rid ourselves of our nuclear forces. This is how our  collocutor answered this question:    Oliynyk: "The condition of the arms and the  purpose of their use in Ukraine (?did not have any bearing) on  the issues of our security. We do not control these weapons, we  cannot maintain them in the technically perfect condition and we  cannot but implement the decision taken by our state to become  non-nuclear in future."    "With regard to our security, it can be viewed from two  standpoints. That is, relying on our own forces and creating  non- nuclear weapons that can enable us to ensure the protection  of our state; after all, we are a great rocket and space power.  It should also be said that we hope the pledges that were given  by the United States, the Russian Federation, and Great Britain  will be carried into effect both in respect of our state and the  international community."    Correspondent: Answering the question on how long,  what is the duration of the process of nuclear disarmament the  Ukrainian deputy defense minister said:    Oliynyk: "This is a lengthy process which is to  be determined by the technical condition and the possibility to  safely move these weapons over a long distance by transporting  them. Everybody today wants to hear when the first and the last  weapon will be removed. The state must have its own state  secrets, for these are very dangerous and unusual weapons. That  is why to advertise today when a train will cross Ukraine by  railway over a distance of over 700 km to our western borders is  unnecessary and risky. We must keep this transport a secret, to  ensure safe transportation."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The director general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], Mr. Hans Blix, at a meeting with the First  Vice-President, Mr. Hasan Habibi, yesterday, referring to the  reports of the IAEA teams dispatched to inspect the nuclear  centers of the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI] said: The study  and investigation of the Agency's experts indicate peaceful use  of atomic energy by Iran; and keeping the region free from  nuclear weapons will be in the interest of establishing peace  and tranquillity in the region.    Mr. Habibi, agreeing with the remarks made by Mr. Blix,  described global arrogance as the agent responsible for tension  all over the world and in the region; and added: Tragedies  observed in Africa, in the Middle East, the occupied territories  of Palestine and Bosnia are clear examples of this created  tension. Mr. Habibi stressed the need for even-handed  implementation of international regulations in the entire region  and said: The fact that some governments are, without  justification, subjected to pressure of biased propaganda from  every direction, while some others, including the occupiers of  territories, are exempt from any inspection just because they  enjoy the support of major and arrogant states, is contrary to  logic and law and against moves towards peace and tranquillity.    The first vice-president went on: The IRI Government is  strongly opposed to procurement and application of any  destructive weapons by whatever state; and it believes that the  propaganda against Iran is waged to deprive it from peaceful  utilization of atomic energy and to prevent Iran's socioeconomic  development. [passage omitted]    In an interview with our correspondent today, Mr. Blix  termed  the outcome of his talks with the Iranian officials as fruitful.  Referring to the IRI's constructive cooperation with the IAEA,  he said: So far the IAEA rapporteurs have inspected Iran's  atomic installations on several occasions; and close cooperation  of the Iranian officials with this Agency's representatives have  been positive.    Referring to the attitude of the IAEA towards Israel, which  is one of the largest producers of nuclear weapons in the  region, the head of the IAEA said: So far, Israel has not agreed  to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. However, we are  studying ways to gain information about Israel's nuclear  installations and facilities. [passage omitted]</p>

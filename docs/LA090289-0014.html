			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKS, HOMES, BIKES, TRAINS? DEBATING RR RIGHTS OF WAY  </P> <P> Regarding Lake's concern about the purchase of railroad rights-of-way, what may  be viewed as a "hunch" by some can be fairly academic to others. For example,  an experienced urban planner knows with the confidence of an eagle spotting its  prey that a straight and continuous railroad right-of-way traversing an  increasingly congested city landscape is an invaluable asset as a  transportation corridor. He also knows that it would be a fundamental mistake  not to acquire the right of way at the earliest opportunity.  </P> <P> The Westside-to-downtown Los Angeles corridor would serve some of the fastest  high-rise development currently under way in downtown Los Angeles. There is no  question about its commuter potential. The alternative bus lanes suggested by  Lake are definitely an idea worth considering. But where? Double-decking the  Santa Monica Freeway would significantly increase noise pollution in sensitive  areas such as Rancho Park and other neighborhoods. Make Olympic Blvd. a  transit-only affair? I seriously doubt that the nearby streets could absorb the  displaced traffic.  </P> <P> Why not use the Exposition right-of-way? Make it a busway, light rail,  monorail, you name it. But let's preserve the one remaining open corridor from  the Westside to downtown.  </P> <P> PETER P. ZIMMERMANN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

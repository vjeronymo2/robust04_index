			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Suppression of Patriotic Students"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  puppets sent several thousand police to the Hongik University in  Seoul on June 18 and brutally suppressed students affiliated  with the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General  Student Councils (Namchongnyon) who were there.    In a swipe at the suppression, papers here [word indistinct]  this is a special product of the military dictatorship which is  unimaginable in a democratic society.    A NODONG SINMUN analyst says:    Such a suppression is a rash act committed by those who took  off even the "civilian" veil and openly unsheathed the sword of  the military dictatorship.    As for the participation of students of Namchongnyon in the  Seoul rally against the "parliamentary ratification of the  Uruguay Round accord," there was nothing wrong in it. Checking  the "endorsement of the accord" is vital to the existence of the  people.    It is natural that South Korean students and people rose up  in a struggle against the treacheries and despicable moves of  the puppets.    The Kim Yong-sam group is facing a serious ruling crisis for  its policy of North-South confrontation and rice market opening  it has persistently pursued since it came to power.    It is clear to every one that the puppets resorted to such  brutal crackdown, consider that if they allowed students from  local areas to participate in the Seoul rally against the  "parliamentary endorsement of the accord," it would develop into  a massive anti-"government" struggle. The fascist suppression,  however, cannot save them from their hopeless position.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst demands that the Kim Yong-sam fascist  clique promptly stop the suppression of patriotic students and  release the innocent students under arrest, mindful that the  intensified suppression will result only in precipitating their  own destruction.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana  radio and television in Spanish between 8 and 12 April.    Radio Rebelde reports at 1700 GMT on 8 April that Cubana de  Aviacion has initiated flights to Caracas with a stopover in  Bogota in an effort to enhance tourism. Tour operators Sol y Sun  [as heard] Agency from Cubana de Aviacion, Nirvana from  Venezuela, and G.M. Tropical from Colombia are taking part in  this operation.    Rebelde also reports that during the recent Berlin  International Tourism Conference, industry executives asserted  that this year Cuba is one of the prime tourist destinations in  Latin America and the Caribbean. To handle the projected  increased in visitors, Cuba's Gaviota tourism enterprise is  planning to open two new four-star hotels, a 260-room hotel in  Varadero and a 242-room hotel in Holguin, and plans to build  more facilities.    Cuba Vision Network at 2220 GMT on 8 April reports that the  Sancti Spiritus paper factory has resumed activities upon the  arrival in the country of the necessary raw materials. The  factory will this month begin production of 2,000 tons of paper  designated for that production facing paper deficits, such as  cigarette boxes and school notebooks. Some 400 tons will be  earmarked for a match factory. This year 19,000 tons will be  earmarked for exports. Only one-third of the factory's capacity  will be exploited, in joint operations with Latin American and  European nations. Sugarcane bagasse is also used as raw material.    In the same newscast, Cuba Vision reports that the operator  of a sugarcane harvesting machine has cut 1 million arrobas of  cane during this harvest. The operator is the first woman in the  country to cut 1 million arrobas; she averaged 10,000 arrobas  daily despite continuous mechanical problems.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 9 April  report that the steam-driven trains of the Orlando Gonzalez  industrial complex in Ciego de Avila are the first of their type  in the country to run on emulsified fuel and magnetized water.  This experimental mixture has been used in the boilers of an  asphalt plant in this province. Use of the emulsion has saved 43  tons of fuel. After 100 days of harvest, all locomotive engine  parts are perfectly clean, which will result in great savings  both in fuel and in labor. The report adds that the Sugar  Industry Ministry has 200 of these locomotives.    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 9 April reports that the  workers  of the Hotel Caracol in Santa Lucia have decided to give health  institutions all the hard currency they receive in tips during  the month of April.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 April reports that the German  airline LTU will increase activity in Cuba. LTU expects to  double the number of tourists -- currently 26,000 a year -- and  plans to establish flights to Ciego de Avila in the near future.    Radio Rebelde adds that farmers in Matanzas have planted 109  caballerias of miscellaneous crops during March. The spring  planting program comprises 900 caballerias of corn, pumpkin,  cucumber, yucca, yams, and plantains. Specialists stress that  fulfilling the planting program is vital to meeting the needs of  the people.    Radio Rebelde also reports that in San Cristobal  Municipality  in Pinar del Rio, the 93-94 sugar harvest is experiencing  difficulties. A provincial expert adds that measures had to be  taken to overcome delays, such as activating the Jose Marti Mill  to help the 30 November Mill meet the sugar production goal, and  mobilizing over 1,000 workers.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 11 April reports that more than  120,000 poles of tobacco have been collected in Holguin, while  peasants have already planted 23 caballerias of tobacco. This  plantation is below its established goal because of bad weather.  In San Juan y Martinez, Pinar del Rio Province, the municipal  board has termed positive the results obtained in tobacco  production by more than 100 producers who, for the first time,  have received land to enlarge their plantations.    Radio Reloj at 1942 GMT on 11 April reports that Mexican  Ambassador Carlos Tello Macias has presented a humanitarian  donation to Raul Taladrid, vice president of the State Committee  for Economic Cooperation. The 10-ton donation includes food  stuffs such as rice, beans, and cooking oil, and cleaning items  such as bleach and detergents, powder, and diapers to be  distributed to the Carlos J. Finlay and Luis Diaz Soto Hospitals  in Havana.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 12 April reports that last year  and during the first quarter of 1994, the Indalecio Monteco  Metalworking Company in Ciego de Avila assembled 7,800 bicycles  produced by the Caibarien Factory in Villa Clara. The bicycles  are to be distributed among peasants and workers in Ciego de  Avila. Through this effort, almost all peasant members of the  Ciego de Avila cooperatives have bicycles.    Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 12 April reports that in Ciego  de Avila the Agricultural Shops Enterprise has repaired 183  large and small irrigation pumps over the past 60 days. Last  year the Agriculture Ministry received only 24 of these pumps  essential to agriculture. This company is becoming more  productive and efficient by following guidelines proposed by the  workers parliaments.    In the same newscast, Radio Progreso adds that 17,000  Agriculture Ministry tractors and equipment are being serviced  at ministry repair shops under a maintenance and repair program  running through October. According to the director of the  Agriculture Ministry mechanization department, 15 to 20 percent  of machines presently out of commission will be recovered.</p>

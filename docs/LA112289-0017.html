			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURRAY LEADS UCLA OVER AUSSIES, 80-68  </P> <P> Freshman Tracy Murray scored 16 points and pulled down six rebounds to lead  UCLA to an 80-68 exhibition victory over the Australian National Team Tuesday  night in front of 5,341 at Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> The Aussies found themselves down under in a hurry, giving up 27 consecutive  points and missing 14 shots in a row after taking a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> But they closed to within 55-49 midway through the second half as guard Philip  Smyth made four three-point shots.  </P> <P> UCLA's three freshmen -- Murray, Zan Mason and Mitchell Butler -- then scored  all but one of the Bruins' next 17 points as they pulled away in their final  tuneup before Saturday night's regular-season opener against Santa Clara.

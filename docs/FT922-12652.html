			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Air France cuts loss to FFr685m AIR France, the French state-owned airline which recently concluded a partnership deal with Sabena of Belgium, cut its loss in 1991 to FFr685m (Dollars 122.3m), compared with a deficit of FFr717m in the previous 12 months. The French airline, together with its international competitors, was badly affected by the impact of the Gulf War on air travel during the first half of last year when it posted a net loss of FFr1.16bn. However, it mustered a recovery in the second half and managed to break even at an operational level. For the year as a whole, operating profits stood at FFr213m, against an operating loss of FFr1.14bn in the previous year. Air France, which owns Air Inter, the domestic French airline and UTA cargo service as well as its eponymous international airline, reduced operating costs by 1.1 per cent during the year through its ongoing cost-cutting programme. The group experienced an overall increase in turnover of 1.4 per cent to FFr57.6bn during 1991. This was due to a modest rise in prices, which countered the effect of a real decline in traffic in both the passenger and cargo sectors. Air France had to swallow an increase in financing costs during the year, mainly because of the impact of the 37 new aircraft of which it took delivery in 1991. It was also hit by provisions of FFr700m to finance its restructuring in 1992 and 1993. This will include shedding staff and internal reorganisation. The contribution from exceptional gains fell from FFr1.93bn in 1990 to FFr1.58bn in 1991, in spite of the proceeds of the sale of its Paris headquarters at Square Max Hymans. The Sabena deal, which was completed last week, involves Air France and its Belgian financial partners injecting BFr6bn (Dollars 29.4m) into the Belgian airline in return for a 37.5 per cent stake. In addition the Belgian government will invest BFr9bn in Sabena. The deal also involves forging commercial and managerial links between the two airlines. Air France's investment in Sabena forms the latest part of its long-term strategy of broadening the base of its business across the international airline industry. Earlier this year Air France led a consortium of investors to take a 40 per cent stake in Ceskeslovenske Aerolinie (CSA), the Czechoslovakian state airline, in a Dollars 60m deal.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Nomination hearing delayed by Republicans US REPUBLICANS yesterday succeeded in delaying the Senate confirmation hearing of Dr Joycelyn Elders, President Bill Clinton's nominee for surgeon-general, who is under fire for her strong advocacy of birth control help for teenagers. Dr Elders had just finished her opening statement detailing her rise from poverty to director of the Arkansas Health Department when Senator Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, demanded the hearing be postponed. Under Senate rules, any member can delay a hearing being held more than two hours after the regular Senate session begins. The nominee, a formidable black woman, has been targeted for attack on several grounds: her strong support of sex education, her outspoken support for abortion, and financial and ethical dealings in both her professional and private life. The White House is standing firmly behind the nomination after being criticised for having caved in too quickly to attack on other nominations - particularly that of Ms Lani Guinier, another black woman, named to the Justice Department. Senators were expected to question her about a negligence suit against her and other board members of the National Bank of Arkansas, which was ultimately settled. There may be trouble about her husband's failure to pay social security taxes for a nurse taking care of his elderly mother, and she will be questioned about drawing a full-time Arkansas state salary while working part-time for the federal government, during her transition to the surgeon-general's job. Meanwhile, another Clinton nominee, Mrs Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seemed on her way to winning confirmation to the Supreme Court after enduring and mostly parrying intense questioning for three days.</p>

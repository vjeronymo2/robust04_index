			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / JAL to start Vietnam flights Japan Airlines (JAL) will start regular flights to Vietnam later this month with the launch of services to the country's business capital, Ho Chi Minh City. The Japanese Transport Ministry said yesterday it intended to grant approval this week to the company's plan to operate twice-weekly round-trip flights from Kansai International Airport near Osaka from November 16. In the last year, leading European and Asian airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France and Cathay Pacific, have begun regular services to Vietnam as the country's economy has expanded rapidly in the wake of an accelerating economic reform programme and the lifting of US sanctions. Japanese corporations have been among the most active in pursuing opportunities in the growing Vietnamese market and JAL expects to carry more than 19,000 passengers a year. The airline will use DC-10 aircraft with 218 seats on the new route.</p>

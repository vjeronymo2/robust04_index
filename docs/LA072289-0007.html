			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOCK;  </P> <P> MAN'S ANGER OVER BRUTAL SEXUAL ATTACK IN INGLEWOOD TURNS INTO HELP FOR  SURVIVORS  </P> <P> Marvin Feldman says that when he heard the radio news report, he felt "like  someone had hit me in the stomach."  </P> <P> A man had broken into a home near Hollywood Park race track in Inglewood, raped  two women and a girl, then shot each several times as they lay bound on the  floor. A 19-year-old victim died, but her 32-year-old house mate and the older  woman's daughter, 14, survived.  </P> <P> Feldman, a Van Nuys public relations consultant, did not know any of the  victims, but he had a chance meeting with a friend of the murdered woman a few  days after the June 3 attack and decided: "Let's do something."  </P> <P> The result was formation of a group called Help Each Life Please, which so far  has collected $4,500 in donations for the mother and daughter and for the dead  woman's two orphaned children.  </P> <P> HELP has also recruited a doctor, Santa Monica ophthalmologist Marshall J.  Keyes, who will donate his services to help the teen-ager, who lost an eye in  the attack.  </P> <P> A suspect, J. C. Metoyer, 19, was arrested in the Crenshaw District a week  after the attack. The reputed gang member is scheduled to face a preliminary  hearing next Friday in Los Angeles Municipal Court on 11 felony charges,  including murder.  </P> <P> "Every now and then I just sit and think, 'Why?' " the surviving mother said in  a telephone interview. "I think, "Why me and why my daughter?' " She is living  with her four children at a friend's house in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo Bank at 400 S. Market St. in Inglewood is collecting the donations.  </P></p>

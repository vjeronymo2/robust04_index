			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau/Kathleen Battle - Song recitals in London While Julia Varady is winning superlatives at Covent Garden, there is a bonus to be had from the soprano's presence here in London. Where the wife goes, there is always a chance that the husband will follow and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau duly appeared for a single recital at the Barbican Hall on Sunday afternoon. If memory serves right, this was the first time that the baritone has sung in recital at the hall. It is not an ideal venue and singers who tried recitals in its early years invariably found their voices drained of colour, or even lost altogether. However, Fischer-Dieskau is a law unto himself and his voice sounded as full of nuance as ever it was. Sometimes he sang so softly that the sound should never have carried in this hall, but every time it did. The programme was devoted solely to Schubert's Die schone Mullerin. This is commonly regarded as the young man's Schubert cycle and that may explain why we seldom hear it sung with half the meaning with which it was invested here. Through a life of singing Lieder, Fischer-Dieskau has discovered an immense amount to say about this music and some of the simpler songs almost burst out of their seams with the intensity, the range of emphasis and dynamics, that he packs into their slight frames. One would be happily admiring the quiet and intimate atmosphere that he had built up in a song like 'Morgengruss' only to have it suddenly snatched away in the last stanza. The listener looks anxiously down at the text. Yes, the words do support the interpretation ('Now shake off the veil of dreams') and yet it is somehow a feature of the singing these days that it should lurch so often from one extreme to the other. Nevertheless, even if a song does not always work as a whole, there is line after line that comes across with more meaning than it ever had before: the devotion of the simple words 'if she sent you', the chill as clouds come over the last lines of 'Tranenregen'. Nor is the pure singing of a section like the Miller's words in the penultimate song really that simple at all. A lifetime's knowledge of how to colour the voice was there artlessly on show. Together with his accompanist, Christoph Eschenbach, Fischer-Dieskau paced the cycle flawlessly, moving on rapidly from song to song just after the mid-point, when jealously and resentment start to fire the music. Otherwise Eschenbach was the respectful partner, underplaying much of the time, rarely taking the lead. But then to have a pianist as well who was equally as intense would probably have been too much to bear. ***** In its specialised way, Miss Battle's light coloratura soprano is practically a perfect instrument. Not only is it true, flexible and pretty - ineffably pretty - but it embodies just the sort of character that opera-composers write for that voice: charming, often little-girlish, bright with carefully cultivated innocence. In such roles Miss Battle is regularly enchanting. In recital, as at the Royal Opera on Sunday, there is a risk of surfeit, of too much of a winsome muchness. She drew an impressively large house on a very warm night. Her programme proved to be brief (just seven songs in the second half), but she compensated for that by starting a quarter-hour late. She chose to sing just what one might have expected: a little Handel to warm up, the usual light Mozart, some pretty Liszt and Rakhmaninov, and four high-flying songs from Richard Strauss's opus. 68. Song by song, they were mostly delicious - but in the end, it was extraordinary how similar all those composers sounded. Not only did the vocal personality dominate everything, but the accompaniments were firmly reduced to discreet background support. American divas still command the services of an accompanying breed which is almost extinct on this side of the Atlantic: abjectly self-effacing employees, from whom any bid for musical attention may amount to a breach of contract. In Handel and Mozart Margo Garrett was routinely grey, but with the three later composers - who wrote piano-parts of salient independence - it was deeply moving to hear a competent musician striving to suppress any expressive force in her music. It is a considerable technical feat to keep the note-filled climaxes in Rakhmaninov and Strauss down to a bloodless pianissimo, but Miss Garrett managed it, without (as far as I could tell) scamping the literal notes. That left the Battle voice to float free, to do its own appealing thing; it also left the song-shapes and the harmonic sense obscure, again and again, and dramatically null - or anyhow, much of a winsome muchness. It was disheartening to learn from the programme-book that in America Miss Garrett is a 'leading teacher' of 'collaborative pianists' (the politically correct new label for accompanists). Throttled submission is not collaboration. Must America have another generation of keyboard-doormats? Whether or not Miss Battle knows or cares, the lines of her Strauss Lieder - 'Ich wollt' ein Strausslein binden' and 'Sausle, liebe Myrte' ravishingly turned, an ethereally brilliant 'Amor' - could have been enhanced beyond measure by an unfettered partner at the piano.</p>

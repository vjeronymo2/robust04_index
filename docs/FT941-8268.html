			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / People: Following in Sekimoto's footsteps NEC, the Japanese electronics and telecommunications company, will be headed by a younger president than has been the case for some time when Hisashi Kaneko takes over from Tadahiro Sekimoto who has been at the top for an unusually long 14 years, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. Kaneko, 61, has long been considered a natural successor to Sekimoto, 68, who, as executive chairman, will concentrate his energies on activities in the wider business community. The new president, who is currently executive vice president, followed a similar career path to that of his mentor, and worked for a long time on the telecomunications side of NEC's businesses. His rather uninspiring personal style has won him the nickname of 'mini-Sekimoto', according to one Japanese newspaper. Kaneko graduated from the prestigious University of Tokyo's engineering department and joined NEC in 1956. After managing the company's Central Research Lab, Kaneko moved to the US to become president and chief operating officer of NEC in the US in 1989. Kaneko takes over at a less than opportune time for NEC, which is suffering from the economic downturn as well as increased competition, but the company seems to have weathered the worst of the bad times. The new president's leadership and vision will be tested in the years ahead; NEC will be particularly pressed to develop new market areas as its dominance in the domestic PC market is threatened from overseas.</p>

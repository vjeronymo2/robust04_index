			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Reaping science's reward Will he or won't he? All week I have been in a state of trepidation, wondering whether Kenneth Clarke Ha Ha Ha, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, will dare to introduce value added tax on books and newspapers - the so-called tax on knowledge - in Tuesday's Budget. I do not have a surplus of knowledge, anyway, and the prospect that its acquisition may be taxed has filled me with dismay. In a flurry of desperation I have been reading book after book - one of which, called Making of the Modern World, about milestones in science, has had a strange effect, calming and pacifying me in a way I would not have thought possible for someone whose normal state of mind as he surveys this weary planet is one of melancholy. Making of the Modern World was produced by experts at the Science Museum in London, and lists 100 key developments in science, technology and medicine. The photography is superb. According to John Murray, the publisher, the inventions are presented chronologically to give an idea of the historical progress made in science, starting with the Byzantine sundial calendar in 1217 AD through to genetically engineered mice in the 1980s. Other inventions covered include Arkwright's spinning machine, Trevithick's high-pressure engine, Elias Howe's sewing machine, Puffing Billy, the first plastic, Bell's telephone, early cine cameras, the first tube railway, polythene, the V2 rocket, and Marconi's first radio transmitter. Before plunging in, I jotted down a short list of scientific breakthroughs I would like to see. I did not ponder deeply. The idea was to improvise, at speed, a list of obvious improvements on the life we live now and see how it compared with the 100 key inventions listed in the book. My list: a cure for cancer, and for all forms of illness; an anti-stupid pill; super-cheap power; a gun that never hits its target; improved human life expectancy; a way to save the elephant and all God's creatures. It is not a brilliant list. It is amazingly airy-fairy. Even I can see that now. But what I hadn't expected was the overwhelming practicality of the 100 key inventions listed by the museum. Most of these gadgets and processes were the result of centuries' worth of effort aimed at answering extremely specific needs. None is airy-fairy, or was day-dreamed into existence. All are tangible and real. As the Science Museum says, reflecting on these inventions helps us appreciate why the world of today has become what it has. An example is Bell's mechanical reaper, designed in 1827 by Patrick Bell of Carmyllie, Scotland. For centuries, reaping (the cutting of corn at harvest) had been done using hand-held sickles and scythes, even though a mechanical reaper had been described in the writings of scholars of ancient Rome. Bell's reaper proved to be the first workable design. He was ignorant of previous research, except that of James Smith, and dismissed a succession of ideas until starting work on a design incorporating the cutting action of garden shears. A small working model was made in 1827, followed by a full-scale prototype. It is not in the least difficult to see how Bell's invention has played its role in shaping the modern world - or to realise that without it the European Union, among other ingenious things, would hardly have come into existence. No Bell's reaper: no Jacques Delors. No Jacques Delors: pestilence, war and famine across the face of Europe. Similar trains of thought are produced by contemplating Lister's 1826 microscope, Bessemer's converter, Holmes' lighthouse generator, Crookes' radiometer, Wimshurst's electrostatic machine, the Rover safety bicycle, etc. I am grateful to the Science Museum for helping me see why the world of today has become what it has. There is a reason for everything. Whimsicality is useless. An anti-stupid pill (given freely with The Sun) is probably nothing but wishful thinking. Thanks to this book, I have grown tolerant and fond of all sorts of modern phenomena. Motorway service stations. British Rail. Eurotunnel and Euro Disney. John Major. Prince Charles. Britain's nuclear submarines. Alleged manifestations of the Virgin Mary. Vong Phaophanit's Neon Rice Field. How long will this mood last? At least until Tuesday's Budget.

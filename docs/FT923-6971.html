			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Walter THE most ardent supporter of C P Taylor would not claim Walter is one of his best plays. One reason why it is included in the tribute to him in this year's festival may be that the work pays homage to his native Glasgow. Glasgow did not encourage Taylor as a playwright. It was the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh that discovered him. Afterwards he moved south to Northumberland, where he wrote his best work. Still, Glasgow was a formative influence. Taylor was born there in 1927, the son of a Jewish family which had fled from tsarist Russia. The Walter of the play is based on a music hall comedian called Walter Jackson (originally Jacobson). Jackson, like Taylor, had Jewish parents. He began performing in Glasgow in 1932. After the war, Jackson became relatively well known beyond music hall. He appeared in television soaps and did straight acting at the Glasgow Citizens'. But just as his new career was taking off he died aged 60 in 1977. The version that appears in a collection of the seven Taylor plays being performed at this year's festival takes less than an hour to read, but stretches to two and a half hours on-stage. For all the love and care that have gone into Hamish Glen's production at the St Bride's Centre, it remains heavy going. Walter, the music hall comedian, is left far behind. The play is about the sex life of a man who wonders how far he remains Jewish. He has left a Jewish wife for a Jewish mistress, then abandoned her and is now living on the banks of Loch Lomond with a young Gentile girl who speaks with a Geordie accent. She wants him to move to Northumberland because the Scots do not like the English crossing their border and Scotland is full of 'bloody Jews, communists and film directors'. The sex life does not seem very satisfactory; nor is the play. There is a nice joke about Catholics being lovely when they are sober and terrible when drunk, and Protestants the other way round. Tom Watson plays Walter with tremendous determination and one admires Tracey Wilkinson as the Geordie girl. But none of the cast is on fertile ground.</p>

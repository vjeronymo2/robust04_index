			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA requests comments about the potential safety problems discussed in this notice. To what extent does adding a second convex mirror to a System A mirror increase the blind spot? How significant a safety problem is caused by the increase in the blind spot? How significant a safety problem is caused by the driver's inability to use the entire mirror system, particularly with mirrors with a radius of curvature less than 35 inches, while operating a moving bus? If a manufacturer added a second convex mirror to a System A mirror system, couldn't the driver use the preexisting high radius of curvature driving mirror?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As to Blue Bird's request for the agency to ``immediately issue'' its requested change to the Standard, NHTSA has determined that it cannot legally accommodate Blue Bird's request. The Administrative Procedure Act generally requires an agency to issue a notice for public comment before issuing a final rule such as a rescission of a requirement. (5 U.S.C 553) There is one narrow exception to this requirement which provides that an agency may forego notice-and-comment procedures upon a finding that such procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' ( 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) However, the courts have construed this exception very narrowly, emphasizing that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> circumstances justifying reliance on this exception are ``indeed rare'' and will be accepted only after the court has ``examine[d]'' closely proffered rationales justifying the elimination of public procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Council of Southern Mountains, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Donovan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  653 F.2d 573 (DC Cir. 1981) citing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> American Federation of Government Employees <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Block, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  655 F.2d 1153 (DC Cir 1981).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This case law and previous agency experience indicate that foregoing notice-and-comment is a disfavored approach to be used only in emergency situations involving great urgency. The agency has determined that the circumstances surrounding Blue Bird's petition do not rise to this level of urgency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice was not reviewed under E.Q. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency believes that a full regulatory evaluation is not required because the rule would have only minimal economic impacts. The proposal, if adopted, would not result in any cost savings or cost increases since to comply, the small radius of curvature mirrors would be replaced by larger radius of curvature mirrors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. School bus manufacturers are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Small governmental units and small organizations are generally affected by amendments to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards as purchasers of new school buses. However, any impact on small entities from this action would be minimal since it would make a minimal change that would not impose additional costs. Accordingly, the agency has determined that preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), NHTSA notes that there are no requirements for information collection associated with this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has also analyzed this proposed rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it would not have a significant impact on the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this proposed rule would not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Civil Justice Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Submission of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR part 512.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

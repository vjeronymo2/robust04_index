The Department's recovery of funds followed a settlement reached between the parties under which Idaho refunded a total of $115,000 in principal to the Department in full resolution of the Department's final audit determination. This notice describes Idaho's plan for the use of the repaid funds and the terms and conditions under which the Secretary intends to make those funds available.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under a settlement agreement between the Department and Idaho, the Department recovered $115,000 from Idaho in full resolution of all claims arising from an audit of Idaho's State Division of Vocational Education, covering fiscal years (FYs) 1983 through 1985.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's original claim of $376,538 was contained in a final letter of determination issued by the Assistant Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education on August 8, 1988. The claim arose from findings related to Idaho's administration of its vocational education program under provisions of the Vocational Education Act of 1963, 20 U.S.C. 2301,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1982) (VEA). In the August 8, 1991 letter, the Assistant Secretary determined that Idaho had violated the prohibition against supplanting State and local funds with Federal funds awarded under the VEA. The supplanting prohibition was contained in section 106(a)(6) of the VEA (20 U.S.C. 2306 (a)(6))(1982), in effect at the time. The Assistant Secretary had also determined that Idaho had improperly awarded vocational education funds to local educational agencies (LEAs) that failed to meet the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement in section 111(b)(1) of the VEA (20 U.S.C. 2311(b)(1))(1982), in effect at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In responding to these findings, Idaho asserted that the MOE violations resulted when it misinterpreted the VEA's MOE requirements, using the wrong years when calculating MOE for compliance purposes. Idaho further asserted that the supplanting violations resulted from Idaho's attempts to mitigate potential maintenance of effort problems at the local level. The VEA requirements relating to local maintenance of effort, which were among the primary subjects of the August 8, 1988 final letter of determination issued to Idaho, are no longer in effect. Under the current program authority, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins II), local educational agencies (LEAs) are not required to maintain local effort (20 U.S.C. 2463(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The settlement negotiations that followed Idaho's appeal of the Assistant Secretary's August 8, 1988 determination in this matter culminated in a settlement agreement in which Idaho agreed to repay $115,000 to the Department. The settlement agreement was executed on September 29, 1991. On December 11, 1991, the Department received full payment from Idaho in the amount of $115,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

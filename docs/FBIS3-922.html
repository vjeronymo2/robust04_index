Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said 7,600 static  centres manned by 7,900 civil servants, and an undisclosed  number of mobile booths for remoter regions, would register  voters.    He hoped the process would be completed in two weeks,  although authorities had an extra 45 days to cope with  unexpected problems.    The date for the elections, the fourth since independence in  1980, would be announced by President Robert Mugabe, he said.  "We are gambling he will go for between March and May next  year," he said.    One-hundred-and-twenty seats will be contested in the  election in the 150-seat parliament. Mr Mugabe has the right to  appoint another 30. Elections for the post of president are  every six years, and are due in 1996.    The announcement will heighten growing political activity  among the ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF  [Patriotic Front]) party and about 10 opposition parties already  preparing their campaigns. It also suggests it is unlikely Mr  Mugabe will call an early election to beat deepening  disenchantment with the government, as has been forecast by some  political commentators.    All the previous elections have been won overwhelmingly by  ZANU (PF) and pundits predict another outright victory for the  party.    Mr Dabengwa made a point of promising that the election  campaign and the voting would be free, fair and peaceful. "I  assure you there will be no violence during the elections," he  said. "Police will be deployed at full strength throughout the  country."    The election will be the first since 1964 to be held under  ordinary legislation. Until late 1990 they were held under  state of emergency legislation which gave authorities  wide-ranging powers to curb opposition activities.    Special provision is being made to register an estimated  300,000 Zimbabweans living in South Africa, and extra staff will  be deployed at the Zimbabwe Trade M$ssion in Johannesburg.  Zimbabweans resident in other countries would not be able to  register because of the government's "limited resources".    In apparent recognition of criticism of hasty and often  chaotic voter registration for the previous election in 1990,  authorities this time have started six months earlier.    Registrar-General Mr Tobaiwa Mudede said the electorate  consisted of about 5.5 million people.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Mexico move to charge deputy The Mexican Congress has moved to strip immunity from the member implicated by the attorney-general's office in the assassination last week of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, who was the number two official in the governing party, the PRI. The Congress stated that the necessary steps will be taken to lift the immunity of Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a PRI congressman from the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. The attorney-general's office is ready to charge Mr Munoz with having masterminded the assassination. The deputy was reported missing yesterday, although newspapers suggested that he may be willing to surrender himself. Investigators said they were told by an accomplice to the assassination that Mr Munoz Rocha and Mr Rubio Canales, a former colleague of Mr Ruiz Massieu now in prison, plotted the murder to slow political reform in the country, to settle an old score with an enemy, and to weaken the government's battle against drug traffickers. The dead man's brother, Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, is the deputy attorney-general responsible for drug enforcement. Financial markets in Mexico were rattled by the accounts of an alliance between drug traffickers and political reactionaries willing to kill reform-minded politicians. At mid-morning yesterday, the Mexico City stock market was down 0.9 per cent. There has been much speculation in Mexico on whether other government politicians were involved in the assassination, and whether there was a link between this crime and the killing last March of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate. The government's special prosecutor has concluded that Mr Colosio was killed by a lone, deranged gunman. The attorney-general's office said Mr Ruiz Massieu was shot in the neck last Wednesday by Mr Daniel Aguilar Trevino, who was captured at the scene of the crime. Mr Aguilar said that Mr Fernando Rodrguez Gonzalez, an aide to Mr Munoz, had offered him about Dollars 15,000 (Pounds 9,500) to kill Mr Ruiz Massieu. Mr Jorge Rodrguez Gonzalez, the brother of Fernando, admitted his involvement in the crime on Friday, and has directly implicated Mr Munoz in the attack, according to testimony released by the attorney-general's office.</p>

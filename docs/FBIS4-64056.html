			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service issued  a report in which it draws attention to the instances connected  with a provocation attempt against the command post of the radio  engineering brigade of the anti-aircraft defense forces of our  state located in Sevastopol. Two instances have occurred over  the past few days that testify to such intentions. What the  press service has in mind is the fact that places, prepared by  unknown persons for planting an explosive, and a wire laid down  to blow it up, were discovered near the above command post.  Quite probably, says the report, this could have been done by  an unknown person detained here, who turned out to be a reserve  Black Sea Fleet officer. A large amount of the explosive has  been confiscated from him.    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service reports that  competent bodies launched an investigation into the above  instances. The name of the detained person has not been  disclosed so far in the interests of the investigation.</p>

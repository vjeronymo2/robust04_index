			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Opinion" page: "New Members To Benefit </F> PWC"]    [Text] The appointment of 13 more people to the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), raising its numbers to 70  must be welcomed, if only because there is so much to do to  prepare for the handover of sovereignty in 1997. But more  especially because some of these newcomers will be bringing to  the PWC the expertise and experience hitherto lacking in its  ranks.    The presence of Guo Fengmin, chief negotiator in the Joint  Liaison Group (JLG), will be a boon, given that the PWC has to  look into areas which must be resolved within the JLG. Mr Guo  might understand better the feelings of Hong Kong members about  the need to speed up and complete JLG work on matters such as  the localisation of laws and ratification of international  treaties for the post-1997 period.    Hong Kong members, on the other hand, might get to know and  understand at first hand, the progress or otherwise of various  JLG items. Perhaps, even help to give the Chinese side a push  towards settlement of some of the outstanding issues. The  addition of Hong Kong academics, a former member of the bench  and a civil servant will enlarge PWC horizons. All these  individuals are ideally placed to give the mainland members  insights into areas of vital importance if confidence in the  future Special Administrative Region Administration is to be  built up.    Arthur Garcia, former civil servant, ex-High Court judge and  newly-retired ombudsman, is most certainly in a position to give  the mainland members a historical perspective of many of the  existing laws vital to understanding the need to maintain or  modify them for the post-colonial period.    Since its formation the PWC has been grossly misrepresented  and misreported. It has not been helped by thoughtless remarks  by some of its members. The result has been a general  misunderstanding of its work and its role in the current,  embittered situation arising from the failure of China and  Britain to come to terms on political reforms for Hong Kong. It  has also been handicapped by lack of resources and shortage of  expertise in some areas.    The appointment of new members will not greatly help its  image problem but it may at least lighten the burden of the few  local members who are working unstintingly for Hong Kong's  future.    But when all is said and done, the PWC must still win the  confidence of Hong Kong people. This it has signally failed to  do. Mainly because its approach to dealing with both the media  and Hong Kong people is unbelievably antediluvian. This has to  change. The PWC must strike out in new directions to instil  confidence in the public at large. If the addition of new  members helps it would be a plus.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Selling Atlanta to the world Atlanta, the leading business city of the southern US, has become the first city to promote itself through a worldwide television marketing campaign. The city is attempting to lure foreign investment through a series of TV advertisements to be shown on the cable TV service CNN International. The campaign has been prepared by BBDO, the US-based advertising agency, for the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Atlanta has long had a reputation for self-hype. In the 1920s it was the first city to advertise itself in print. In its latest campaign Atlanta has targeted European and Asian business audiences with 30-second TV adverts. CNN, widely available in international hotels, started showing the adverts last month. They are screened in the early morning, as business travellers prepare for their day, and in the early evening, as they return to their hotels. Atlanta's three-year campaign, costing at least Dollars 1m, (Pounds 676,000) aims to build on the publicity that will come when Atlanta hosts the 1996 summer Olympics. 'The Olympics give us a unique window of visibility,' says Bill Crane, the chamber's marketing director. The initial advert simply tries to establish an identity for the city, according to Tod Martin of BBDO. It tackles international unfamiliarity with Atlanta by showing it as home to companies such as Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines. As the Olympics approach, the adverts will increase in number and length, says Crane. Atlanta is unlikely to be the last company to promote itself around the world on TV. The possibilities of this kind of marketing are just being discovered with the advent of worldwide television broadcasting networks such as CNN and BBC's World Service Television.</p>

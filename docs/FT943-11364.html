			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Austrian bank hit by trading income drop Creditanstalt-Bankverein (CA), the Austrian bank in the midst of privatisation negotiations, has reported a 17 per cent decline in pre-tax profit in the first half to Sch1.9bn (Dollars 165m) due to a steep fall in trading income. Meanwhile, the Austrian finance ministry has decided to commission an investment bank to evaluate bids by CS Holding of Switzerland and a consortium of Austrian, Italian and German investors for a large portion of the government's 70 per cent voting stake in CA. A decision is expected after the Austrian general elections on October 9. CA, Austria's second largest bank, said it expected an improvement in second-half trading and net interest income, but forecast pre-tax profit for the full year would be lower than last year's record Sch5.4bn. However, it was confident that net income would be higher as a result of lower provisions for bad loans. CA saw income from own account trading slide 45 per cent to Sch455m in the first six months of 1994. The bank's so-called partial operating profit, which excludes trading, was up 11.7 per cent to Sch1.35bn. Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief executive, said provisions in the first half were less than Sch1.5bn compared with Sch3.8bn in the whole of last year. Total assets at the end of June at Sch573.4bn were only 2 per cent higher than at the end of 1993. Precise consolidated results were not available, but CA said its group pre-tax profit was down 13 per cent to just over Sch2.6bn.</p>

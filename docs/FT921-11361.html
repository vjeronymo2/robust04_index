			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: A barbed peace offering to Rowland HOUSE of Fraser Holdings delivered a barbed peace offering to Lonrho yesterday in a corporate feud that has dragged on for nearly seven years. This was the latest exchange in a battle that started after Mr Mohamed Al-Fayed and his brother Ali, acquired control of House of Fraser when Mr Rowland sold them Lonrho's own shareholdings in the company in 1984. The approach, which House of Fraser insisted was a genuine effort to settle the differences between the two companies, came in the form of a letter to Mr Tiny Rowland, the Lonrho chairman, from Mr Royston Webb, legal director of House of Fraser Holdings. The letter began: 'Dear Tiny, you must find the events of the last few days very depressing. Lonrho shares have halved in value in eight weeks and your deputy chairman has broadcast that everything, including his desk, is for sale.' Pleasantries over, it suggested that Mr Rowland might permit a representative of House of Fraser to address shareholders at Lonrho's forthcoming general meeting. The ink was still sizzling on the page when Mr Rowland delivered a blunderbuss response by return of dispatch rider. He said: 'The company you represent is now so sunk in debt that Harrods, the once proud flagship, can barely be said to be trading at all. It is only the excess of debt over the value of the assets that prevents its bankers selling up at this unpropitious time.' He was confident, he said, that his various court actions against the Al-Fayeds would result in the award of massive damages to Lonrho. Mr Webb, he said, could not expect the 'wild suggestion' of addressing the Lonrho AGM to be taken seriously. 'It has not been. The matter will be resolved in the proper forum - the High Court of Justice.' Last November, a meeting was set up between Mr Rowland and Mr Webb. The first proposed encounter at Claridges Hotel ended disappointingly when Mr Webb did not attend. A second meeting was arranged in which negotiations began on a settlement. The Al-Fayeds even offered to remove the name Tiny from their stuffed shark hanging in the Harrods food hall, but the talks ended in acrimony.</p>

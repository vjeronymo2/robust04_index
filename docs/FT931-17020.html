			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / State of the Art: Raiders of the cultural past - Theatre and Dance: deconstructionism without tears / To apply academic talk to trash gets nobody anywhere ENGLISH theatre is still a terrain remarkably innocent of intellectual parlance. The word 'deconstructionist' is applied far less often than in opera; the words 'post-modern' and 'post-modernist' less often than in dance. In fact, the dominant buzzword of the day is 'accessible' - a word anti-intellectual in its implications. This reflects the amount of popular entertainment - and unsubsidised theatre  -around. (Our public is less worried by whether a show is new-wave, academically hip or politically correct than by whether it is just a good show, and in that sense our public it has its heart in the right place.) But it also reflects the traditionalism, even insularity, of the English. More Pinero than Brecht is still being played. The many excellent features of British theatre are almost all traditional virtues. But can there be post-modernism on terrain where modernism has hardly taken root? To some extent. People have tried slapping the label 'post-modern' on West End shows such as Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon - 'post-modern' in their Trump Tower mixture of lavish production values and populist entertainment - but it does not really stick, mainly because to apply academic talk to such trash gets nobody anywhere. 'Post-modernism' is exemplified not by trash (however appealing) but by works that ecletically incorporate some features of trash - boutique art, glitz design, democratic accessibility - into a conscious (often historically conscious) work of art. An obvious example is Tony Harrison's The Trackers of Oxyrrynchus (National Theatre, 1989). This was a highly knowing work, using the old satyr plays of the Greeks as a platform on which to discuss the importance of popular entertainment within high art. The satyrs were Priapic (with huge phalluses beaming up from their loins) and pop (they tap-danced heavily) and they made a point about the way that modern theatre has been divorcing low culture from high culture. As with so many post-modern works, there was something of an art-history lecture about it. I would say that to the extent one was made conscious of this, Trackers failed as art; but thereby hangs a debate too big for this space. 'Post-structuralism' occurs where the unquestioned premises (usually sociological) of one tale are questioned or revealed in another, or where an existing work of art, or art form, is framed and examined within another. A simple instance is Tom Stoppard's Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. A remarkable work of theatre in itself, its basis is that the story of Hamlet is occurring, mainly to other characters, just around the corner; and so it leads you to re-examine issues that, in making Hamlet, Shakespeare took for granted. An increasing number of plays today are about missing characters in famous works of art (Helen Cooper's Mrs Vershinin), real artists and their critics (Alan Bennett's Kafka's Dick, the other people involved in the creation of art (the TS Eliot play Tom and Viv), or the whole culture surrounding the creation of art (Timberlake Wertenbaker's Three Birds Alighting on a Field). All of these qualify as post-modern; all of them involve some measure of both structuralism and deconstructionism; and most of them are rooted in feminism - the most widely influential 'new' factor in the creation of art today. ***** Is there deconstructionism without tears? Yes - and in dance. Just watch The Hard Nut - the choreographer's Mark Morris's version of (of all things) The Nutcracker (1991 - soon on TV). Everyone thinks of The Nutcracker as a ballet, and everyone thinks of ballet as a basically Eurocentric and hierarchical form of entertainment - a wedding-cake rising in tiers to the ultra-white prima ballerina: who is in The Nutcracker the Sugar Plum Fairy. But Morris (now aged 36) is an artist with an essentially 1960s sensibility. He sets The Hard Nut in the American '60s, and what he deconstructs is ballet itself. In The Hard Nut men may dance on point too; but here pointwork gives superiority to no one. The dancers are of all colours; and the traditional virtuoso steps of ballet are given not to the stars but to the ensemble. There is no Sugar Plum; and the heroine, Marie, is barefoot. The Hard Nut is also a post-modern work in the way it commutes between high art and popular culture, and in its way of commenting on, or framing, another work of art. It retells Hoffmann's original Nutcracker story in a 1960s setting. It moves from kids watching the Hard Nut story on black-and-white TV, through a party where adults do all kinds of groovy '60s dances, take drugs, quarrel and upset their kids, and finally (like The Wizard of Oz) enters a world of colour and magic. And its message (all you need is love) illustrates Sixties utopianism. There are other labels that can be slapped on The Hard Nut and on Morris's choreography in general. Most of his work, in the core of its dance style, is multiculturalist - with elements of flamenco, Indian, ballet, modern and much more co-existing. His 1987 trilogy Mythologies - a dance illustration of the sociological deconstructionism of Roland Barthes's Mythologies - was about popular culture: its three parts were Soap Powders and Detergents, Striptease and Championship Wrestling. If The Hard Nut were only a piece of deconstructionism or post-modernism, it would not be a work of art - merely an intellectual construct. There are some other artists who similarly illustrate the complexities of our culture. But I attend at some length to Morris because no one else is doing so on such a scale of consequence.</p>

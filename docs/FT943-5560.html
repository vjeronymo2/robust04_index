			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Mackie flotation will test confidence in Ulster: Province's business optimism 'may be bouncing back' Mackie International, the precision engineering company that straddles the peace line between Protestants and Catholics in Belfast, will provide an early test of business confidence in Ulster's future after this week's ceasefire. Mackie is to be floated as a public company, and plans to come to the Unlisted Securities Market via a placing this month. It will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 20m and hopes by the end of the year to have moved to a full listing on the London Stock Exchange. Ulster's business leaders believe Mackie's flotation is very significant, coming just after the IRA began its ceasefire on Thursday. 'It is the first indication that business confidence could be bouncing back,' one said. Mackie is one of Northern Ireland's best known companies. Its headquarters are sandwiched between the Roman Catholic Falls Road and the Protestant Shankill Road. While 70 per cent of its 380 workers are Protestants it is run and owned by a Catholic, Mr Pat Dougan, the company's chief executive. 'This is the first opportunity the City of London has had post the cessation of violence to show its confidence in Ulster,' Mr Dougan said yesterday. 'This company could become the flagship of west Belfast. If we can demonstrate to American and overseas investors that there is a work ethic here, this will allow us to develop the skills of the community.' Flotation will enable the company to eliminate debts totalling Pounds 14.3m, incurred while the company was under US ownership. Mr Dougan said it would also 'assist in the financing of a capital expenditure programme and the provision of working capital to finance the company's substantially increased levels of turnover'. Three years ago Mr Dougan was brought in by the Northern Ireland office to help rescue Mackie. Sales had fallen to Pounds 6.1m in 1991 but are predicted to top Pounds 19m with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m this year. The company specialises in designing, manufacturing and installing textile machinery for a worldwide market. Its new environmental division recently won a Pounds 25m contract with the Argentine water sanitation authority. Mr Dougan's 66 per cent ownership of the company will fall to just under 21 per cent after flotation. The workforce will collectively own about 8 per cent of the share capital.</p>

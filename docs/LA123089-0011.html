			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVOLUTION, CREATIONISM AND PUBLIC EDUCATION  </P> <P> In your editorial "Creationists Should Give It a Rest," " 'creation science,'  or the biblical interpretation of human origin . . . " (emphasis mine). As a  professor of composition and of The Bible as Literature, may I suggest you  change the article the to a or, even more precisely, use the possessive their?  As you are certainly aware, other believers in the Bible do not agree with  so-called "creation science." By casually using the definitive article the, you  imply that there is only one biblical interpretation and thereby strengthen  such an absurd position.  </P> <P> RICHARD J.

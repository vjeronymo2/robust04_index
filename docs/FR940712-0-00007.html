The effect of this amendment is to broaden VA's interpretation of that term based upon new epidemiological evidence. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> August 24, 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Donald England, Chief, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, (202) 233&hyph;3005. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In 1970, Congress passed Public Law 91&hyph;376, &sect;3, 84 Stat. 787, 788 (1970), which established a presumption of service connection for seven categories of diseases and conditions, including ``beriberi (including beriberi heart disease),'' developing to a ten-percent degree of disability at any time after active service in the case of a veteran held as a prisoner of war in World War II, the Korean Conflict, or the Vietnam War who suffered from dietary deficiencies, forced labor, or inhumane treatment in violation of the Geneva Conventions. The intent of Congress was to recognize diseases suffered by former prisoners of war during captivity for which there is no medical documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concern remained, however, as to the problems encountered by these veterans in their efforts to prove service connection for disabilities attributable to the conditions of their capture and imprisonment. Some claimed that their ability to prove service connection for disabilities was hampered because there are inadequate medical records and that certain disabilities which were considered to be minor at the time of release from service were becoming more serious. Congress therefore enacted the Former Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 1981, Public Law 97&hyph;37, 95 Stat. 935, which eliminated the requirement that former prisoners of war must have suffered from dietary deficiencies, forced labor, or inhumane treatment during confinement in order to qualify for the presumption of service connection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Early thiamine deficiency is characterized by anorexia, irritability, and weight loss. Later, patients experience weakness, peripheral neuropathy, headache, and tachycardia. Advanced thiamine deficiency presents with involvement of two major organ systems predominantly: the cardiovascular system (the syndrome known as ``wet beriberi,'' i.e., beriberi heart disease) and the nervous system, both central and peripheral (known as ``dry beriberi'').  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cecil Textbook of Medicine  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1171 (James B. Wyngaarden, M.D., Lloyd H. Smith, Jr., M.D., J. Claude Bennett, M.D., ed., 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, the Medical Follow-up Agency of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, issued a study entitled ``The Health of Former Prisoners of War'' which reported the results of a medical examination survey of former World War II and Korean Conflict POWs and comparable control groups. That study found what it termed a noteworthy association between ischemic heart disease and earlier reporting of localized edema of feet, ankles and legs_presumably due to beriberi heart disease (wet beriberi)_while in captivity. While there is no known satisfactory explanatory biological mechanism linking beriberi or malnutrition and subsequent chronic heart disease, the examination data from the current study provides epidemiological evidence to suggest there is a connection between conditions during captivity and the later development of ischemic heart disease. According to the study, the reporting of edema in prison camp indicates a specific nutritional deficiency, beriberi, and the location of edema in the feet, ankles and legs is presumably related to beriberi heart disease in prison camp which is caused by thiamine deficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

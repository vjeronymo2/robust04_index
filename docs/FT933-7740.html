			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs up on US demand DRUG STOCKS led the market higher for a second day as American investor enthusiasm showed no sign of abating. Yesterday, Wellcome was the star performer, the shares surging 55 to 733p in hefty turnover of 8m, its highest daily volume in six months. Zeneca, the former bioscience arm of ICI, was also in sparkling form, appreciating 32 to 695p. Turnover there was a heavy 9.5m. Glaxo, which had led the surge on Tuesday with a 36 1/2 p rise, climbed a further 33 to 591p yesterday with even higher volume of 12m shares. SmithKline Beecham also showed a sharp gain, finishing 18 1/2 stronger at 466 1/2 p. US investors were still responding positively to the speech made on Monday by President Clinton in which he failed to mention drug price cuts - an issue casting a cloud over the sector in recent months - as part of his healthcare reforms. The president's omission was taken as a signal by some on Wall Street that pharmaceuticals will escape any punitive financial regulation when the White House plans are announced later this year. Analysts were also continuing to point out yesterday the relative underperformance of the leading drugs shares, and that even after yesterday's gains they still looked good value. Mr John Aldersley at Smith New Court said: 'No-one likes to see stocks move this fast, but even after today's rise, they are still down on six months ago.' He remains a buyer of Wellcome and SmithKline, although less positive on Glaxo.</p>

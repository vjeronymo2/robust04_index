			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem spoke out  yesterday against the legalization of abortion during a speech  in the Colon Theatre and announced plans for a campaign to  combat the levels of infant mortality in the country.    Echoing the view of the Roman Catholic Church towards  abortion, Menem said: "Life begins at the moment of conception  and anything done to destroy that life is bordering on crime."    The line brought rapturous applause from an audience  including politicians and nongovernmental pressure groups.    Under current law abortion is forbidden except for cases  such  as rape or where the life of a mother is considered to be in  extreme danger due to the birth. Some bishops have been  pressurizing the government to include a law against abortion in  the new national Constitution when it is reformed in August.    Also in his speech the head of state said he hoped to reduce  the rate of infant mortality to below 20 for every 1,000  children born. The current figures of mortality are 21.54 per  thousand.    Menem added that the strategy would be part of a new Federal  Plan for Mothers and Children, which would seek to improve  health care and nutrition.    To assure that the law embraces the whole country -- Menem  cited figures of three million children and 650,000 mothers who  would be targeted -- he said he would introduce a Federal Pact  to be signed by all provinces.    The plan will be monitored by groups such as UNICEF, Caritas  and the Argentine branch of the Red Cross. [passage omitted]</p>

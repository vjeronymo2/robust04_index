			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Amato wins first vote Italy's new government led by Mr Giuliano Amato passed its first parliamentary test yesterday by surviving a vote of confidence in the senate, writes Haig Simonian from Milan. The decision came against renewed speculation against the lira in the foreign exchange markets, causing the Bank of Italy to intervene to support the currency against the D-Mark, and the seventh consecutive day of stock exchange losses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 22 SAPA -- The budget would stimulate  economic growth while making substantial provision for social  services, the National Party [NP] said in a statement on  Wednesday [22 June]. Commenting on Finance Minister Derek Keys's  budget speech, NP spokesman Danie du Plessis said the budget was  the product of negotiation within the government of national  unity and contained sufficient elements to promote growth.    However, he expressed reservations about the one-off levy to  cover the costs of the transition.    "The functioning of the Independent Electoral Commission and  its lack of financial discipline which the taxpayer now has to  account for is an example of how state expenditure should not  occur."    If the government kept strictly to the budget, South Africa  would reap the fruits. But if insufficient discipline was  exercised over state expenditure, taxpayers would face an  increasing burden.    "Extravagant promises by some ANC ministers have already  made  the danger lights flicker. All ministers must now realise that  they can only make promises within the framework of the budget."</p>

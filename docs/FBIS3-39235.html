"I stick to my flowering landscapes. But it will  take somewhat longer than we originally expected," Kohl said at  the annual reception of the Southwest Saxony Chamber of Commerce  in Chemnitz on Friday [11 February].    While investment is declining in western Germany, it is  increasing sharply in the new laender. East German public and  private per capita investment is already higher than the western  German one. With these investments, together with  future-oriented technology and know-how, eastern Germany creates  opportunities for the whole of Germany, Kohl said.    Kohl called upon banks to get more involved in the  construction of the east Germany economy. He deplored that they  were only hesitatingly fulfilling their promise to participate  in Trust Agency companies with 1 billion German marks [DM]. The  insurance companies, on the other hand, have kept their promise  to contribute DM1 billion. Kohl said that the banks should  become more of a partner to small and medium-sized companies in  eastern Germany and should take more account of the fact that  the economy is still being developed when rating companies'  creditworthiness. The people in the east have not had the  opportunity to collect capital for 40 years in order to offer  the securities that banks ask for today.    After the reception, Kohl discussed Chemnitz as an  industrial  location, unemployment, and vocational training with trade union  representatives, representatives of the chamber, and Mayor Peter  Seifert. A meeting was agreed on 2 March, where representatives  of the Chancellor's Office and Chemnitz authorities will discuss  a regional project to fight long-term unemployment.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / S Africa killing raises fears The murder at the weekend of South African religious leader Professor Johan Heyns has raised fears that radical elements in South Africa's white right wing may still be active and are now targeting people they regard as traitors to the Afrikaner people. Prof Heyns, a former moderator of the Dutch Reformed Church to which the great majority of the country's 3m Afrikaners belong, was shot dead in his Pretoria home on Saturday night while playing cards with his family. He was regarded as the driving force behind the church's decision in 1989 to reverse its long-standing support for apartheid and brand it a sin. Political and religious leaders yesterday paid tribute to Prof Heyns's contribution to effecting South Africa's political transformation. 'He had a major part in preparing the church and the Afrikaner community for change,' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</p>

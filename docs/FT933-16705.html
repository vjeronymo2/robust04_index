			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM slams 'shared responsibility' on Ulster MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday triggered a rare political row on Northern Ireland at Westminster by angrily denouncing an idea floated by Labour that responsibility for the province should be shared between London and Dublin. He cheered Unionist MPs by saying Conservatives stood 'four square' behind the union with Britain. But the prime minster's comments infuriated nationalist MPs and could set back still further the chances of round-table talks on Northern Ireland resuming this year. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said Mr Major was 'playing politics' while lives were being lost. Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, wrote to Mr John Smith, Labour leader, asking for clarification of Labour's Ulster policy. Earlier Sir Patrick said uncertainty about Northern Ireland's constitutional status 'must make the task of the security forces harder.' The government has in the past tried to act as a neutral 'facilitator' in negotiations and has enjoyed backing from Labour for its efforts. It has said Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of the population want that. But Mr Major firmly rejected 'shared responsibility' which, he said, would have to be imposed against the wishes the province's population. Separately, Sir Patrick provided further encouragement for Unionist MPs, telling the Commons that round-table talks could replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement with a pact that included a 'unambiguous statement' on the future of Northern Ireland. Mr Major's comments put the Labour leadership on the defensive. A spokesman said the document prepared for Mr Kevin McNamara, Northern Ireland spokesman, was 'invalid' as a policy paper - although he did not deny proposals for 'responsibility sharing' were under consideration. Mr McNamara later made clear that Labour was sticking to its 1992 manifesto of unification by consent. But he believes that, in the absence of agreement between local Unionist and nationalist politicians, London and Dublin would have a duty to set up new political institutions to replace 'direct rule' from Westminster. A discussion paper is expected in October.</p>

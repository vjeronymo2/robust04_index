			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Nadir aide may see SFO today A close associate of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former head of Polly Peck International, is expected in London today to meet officials of the Serious Fraud Office and police. Mrs Elizabeth Forsyth worked in London at South Audley Management, a company with links to the Nadir family, before going to northern Cyprus three years ago. Her return has been timed to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the police raid on the company's offices, which precipitated the Polly Peck collapse. A spokeswoman for the SFO said yesterday: 'We would like to talk to her.' There is, however, no warrant for the arrest of Mrs Forsyth and it appears unlikely that any attempt would be made to detain her when she lands. The Jasmine Court Hotel in Kyrenia in northern Cyprus, where Mrs Forsyth had been staying and which is owned by Mr Nadir, said yesterday that she had left to take a flight to Britain and that she would not be returning for three weeks. The SFO denied that the way it dealt with Mrs Forsyth would have implications for its treatment of Mr Nadir, should he return from his self-imposed exile. Sources close to Mrs Forsyth had suggested that a failure to charge her would in effect mean that the SFO had no case against Mr Nadir. The SFO said: 'Asil Nadir has skipped bail and is a fugitive from justice. There is a case ready to proceed against him and we are ready to try him when he returns.' Mr Nadir fled to Cyprus in May 1993 while facing 13 charges of theft and false accounting involving Pounds 34m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray by Yegor Yakovlev; place and </F> date not given: "Who Has the Right To Determine Who's To Blame?"]    [Text] [Yakovlev] During the referendum and subsequently,  when the Constitutional Assembly was meeting, we touched  repeatedly on the subject of choice. I said that the very  problem of choice, the lesser of two evils, was essentially  immoral. You, on the other hand, maintained that there are times  of forced choice, when this is essential in the name of higher  goals, for the sake, for example, of avoiding civil war. And you  continued: A new constitution will be adopted, elections will be  held, and we will have an opportunity to act on the basis of  moral convictions. All this has happened. Now you and your  faction in the Duma have voted for a political amnesty for the  prisoners of Lefortovo. This was a free choice, so its time had  come?    [Shakhray] The choice about which you speak was made by me  consciously and voluntarily, and I consider it, as before,  correct. As far, however, as actual preferences are concerned,  we will still be balancing on the razor's edge for quite some  time. Take the present situation concerning the constitution.  The majority of those in the Duma recognize, I believe, neither  the constitution nor the Duma, but are, nonetheless, using both  to resolve their problems. This does not afford them any  delight, of course, and they are looking for sympathy. I made my  choice on the basis of the fact that as of 3-4 October we have  been in a state of civil war, although there are no hostilities  currently. The possibility of their resumption is for me not  ruled out. And I chose between the just but abstract demand for  the proceedings to be brought to the point of the rendering of a  judgment or, on the other hand, the adoption of a decision on  amnesty as an important step en route to civil reconciliation.    Let us look the truth in the eye. On the first day of  business of the Duma it became obvious that it would adopt a  decision on a political amnesty. This was borne out by the test  voting, when on each occasion there was a shortage of two to  five votes. But if a fact is obvious, it is necessary to think  through one's actions on the basis of this fact. Otherwise it  remains merely to throw up one's hands, which is what we are  today doing: Where were the advisers, analysts, aides?    We decided to support the amnesty not for amnesty's sake but  as a step on the way toward civil reconciliation. And we  insisted that this be done in a particular sequence, what is  more. First, a Memorandum of Accord adopted by the Duma, then  the negotiations of all political sides and branches of power,  at which the terms of political, socioeconomic, and interethnic  stabilization for the coming two years would be recorded.  Finally, the president and parliament would adopt a document on  legal guarantees of a political truce, the amnesty included. And  only after this would the people go free. The sequence was  broken, unfortunately. The communists and the agrarians wanted  an amnesty without any obligations. And Russia's Choice believed  that it would prevent this, manifestly overestimating its  possibilities.    [Yakovlev] But if the planned sequence in civil  reconciliation was unsuccessful, you should not have voted for  the amnesty, perhaps?    [Shakhray] People breathe a sigh of relief when if only some  opportunity for reconciliation appears. There is currently a  mass of calls, and I am receiving a heap of telegrams from the  provinces: Go for the next steps. I confess, this is for me the  sole outlet in the information blockade in which I have found  myself in Moscow.... Following the amnesty, there have come to  be more opportunities for reconciliation, incidentally. We need  to be able to avail ourselves of them. The time for this is two  months.    Besides, the present political amnesty has a number of  paradoxical features, which are easily predicted. The amnesty  corresponds to the interests of the president and the  government. It is more beneficial having Rutskoy and Khasbulatov  at liberty than in Lefortovo. In addition, the people who have  been released have undertaken, as it were, not to call for  bloodshed, assaults in the future....    [Yakovlev] Permit my disbelief: I heard what Anpilov was  shouting as he came through the gate, and I know the character  of Konstantinov.    [Shakhray] If Anpilov or Konstantinov once again call for  violence, the law enforcement authorities should act on the  basis of the new circumstances.... A second paradox of the  amnesty: It will be followed, in my view, by quite a lengthy  period of interaction of the president, the government, and  parliament. A considerable part of the Duma has discharged its  election commitments: the release of the above-mentioned  persons. Now they have no interest in the further elevation of  either Rutskoy or Khasbulatov, they need other leaders. They  will not, most likely, move to exacerbate the confrontation with  the president: The law of self-preservation will operate.    [Yakovlev] Today we know that the president did not comment  on the amnesty directly. But the pressure on the prosecutor  general led to his resignation. Aleksey Kazannik believed that  it was more important to be honest than to swear fealty to the  president. As far, however, as his entourage is concerned, how  many days is it now that it has been publicly confessing that it  was unable, did not know, could not think how to get around, as  it were, what should be done according to the law.    [Shakhray] You are to a large extent right, unfortunately.  In  addition, we have seen for ourselves that, apparently, we lack a  mechanism of the interaction of president and parliament. The  president, parliament, the public prosecutor's office, and the  judicial system. But if intelligent conclusions are drawn from  this lesson, what I have said: The need for forced  reconciliation, will have been confirmed.    [Yakovlev] I cannot say that I share your opinion, at the  same time, on the other hand, I accept what is undoubtedly  reasonable in your arguments. But how, pray, is it possible to  be reconciled with the disregard for public opinion that was  manifested so forcefully at that time? The gate of Lefortovo was  flung open without people even having been told who were to  blame--the one who signed the edict, violating the constitution  and breaking up parliament, or those who, lodged in the White  House, called for the storming of the Kremlin. Do you believe  that it is not you and I but merely posterity that should answer  this?    [Shakhray] There is the ancient piece of wisdom, which has  with time become a legal axiom: You cannot be the judge at your  own trial. Both parties to the conflict are to blame, and  neither of them has either the moral or the political right to  condemn the other. You ask: Why are we leaving this to  posterity? I shall answer the question with a question: Who  would determine who was guilty? The victorious presidential  party wanted to do so today. But if tomorrow there are  multiple-choice elections, will those who lost the October  events start to point to the guilty party? As far as public  opinion is concerned, it has already rendered its verdict, and I  can merely repeat it: A plague on both your houses.    [Yakovlev] When I speak of the need to explain to people  what  happened on 3-4 October, I am not thinking merely in categories  of the judicial investigation. It seems to me that the president  should get up and tell people: In signing the edict of 21  September dissolving parliament I was a poor statesman insofar  as I was unable to weigh the consequences this would have. Both  Rutskoy and Khasbulatov should make their confessions: Lodged in  the White House, we were thinking only of ourselves, of our  power, forgetting about the inevitability of the casualties,  which we had provoked....    [Shakhray] Were the said people capable of steps such as you  have mentioned, we would not, possibly, have the present crisis.</p>

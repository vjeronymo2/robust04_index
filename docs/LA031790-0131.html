			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PIPE BOMB ENDANGERS SCHOOL'S SWIM TEAM BUT FAILS TO EXPLODE  </P> <P> Clay Kaytis was swimming laps with the rest of the Orange High School swim team  early Friday morning when he noticed a small, dark object on the bottom of the  pool.  </P> <P> Curious, the 16-year-old swam down to examine the object.  </P> <P> What he brought to the surface was a container wrapped in black electrician's  tape with a red fuse.  </P> <P> "It looked like a bomb," Kaytis said.  </P> <P> It was a bomb.  </P> <P> Kaytis carried it to his coach, Charles Fisher, who told somebody to call the  police, then took the device to an isolated spot in the student parking lot.  </P> <P> For the next 90 minutes, surrounding streets were closed and nearby classes  canceled as the Sheriff's Department bomb squad worked to defuse what deputies  called a "very lethal explosive."  </P> <P> The fuse had been lit, authorities said, but for some reason it did not  explode, even though it was equipped to detonate in the water.  </P> <P> "Whenever you have a pipe bomb, and you don't know who made it, the quality of  it is suspect," Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo said.  </P> <P> He also said Kaytis and Fisher had placed themselves "in great danger" by  handling the device.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Sgt. Charles Stumph, supervisor of the bomb squad, said his unit has  gone out on more than 85 bomb calls so far this year, 22 of which involved  homemade bombs.  </P> <P> "We've been very active lately," he said, adding that most pipe bombs they  encounter are traced to teen-agers. "It seems that most of these kids are  experimenting."  </P> <P> On Jan. 31, a student at Loara High School in Anaheim found a pipe bomb as he  was walking across the school's football field.  </P> <P> Pipe bombs are lethal because fragments from the pipes shoot through the air  "faster than a bullet," Stumph said.  </P> <P> Kaytis, who was dubbed a hero by several classmates, admitted that he was a  little shaken up after he learned that the object was a real bomb.  </P> <P> "I could have lost an arm or something," he said.  </P> <P> School officials and police said they have no idea who put the bomb in the  pool. "It's hard to understand who would want to do a thing like this," said  Shirley Fox, Orange High's principal.  </P></p>

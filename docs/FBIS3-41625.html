Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation </F> minister for protection of the environment and natural  resources, by ZELENYY MIR correspondent N. Filimonova; place and  date not given: ``New Does Not Mean Better'']    [Text] At ZELENYY MIR's request, V.I.  Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister for protection of  the environment and natural resources, comments on the idea of  creating a state oversight system in a conversation with our  correspondent N. Filimonova.    Filimonova: Viktor Ivanovich, do you believe that  there is a need to create a new system?    Danilov-Danilyan: No, and I do not share the draft  authors' position, although I do understand what it is based on.    Dissatisfaction with the state of the environment in the  Russian Federation is causing many people contemplate how the  situation could be improved. Unfortunately, many opt for a  traditional Soviet way--asking themselves how to reorganize  environmental protection bodies.    I often read initiative memoranda on this topic, proposals  to  the government, specialists' letters in newspapers and  magazines. And all of them are structured following a standard  scheme: First they register the fact that the ecological  situation is very alarming, quote some statistics--all of them  usually borrowed from the national report ``On the State of the  Environment in the Russian Federation in 1991,'' which was  prepared under the auspices of the Ministry for Protection of  the Environment and Natural Resources, and then propose a new  structure for an environmental protection system which, they  say, will help to solve all the problems.    Filimonova: This standard approach does not mean  that the proposals are worthless. Some of them deserve attention  perhaps?    Danilov-Danilyan: The draft document we are  looking at would not withstand criticism on several points.    First, in principle. A completely wrong conclusion is drawn  from an unquestionably true premise: Since the environment is in  terrible shape, we need to reorganize environmental protection  bodies.    Second, they propose to reorganize not only our structure  but  the entire system of monitoring and oversight. That is, the  conclusion extends far beyond the premise.    In addition to the three oversight committees currently in  existence (the Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight,  the Russian Federation State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, and the Russian Federal  Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety), the draft proposes  to create seven new committees! In the current situation, when  there is not enough money for the most urgent undertakings, to  start such a reorganization is socially wrong! We need to think  how, to the extent possible, to cut the number of agencies, not  breed new ones.    Filimonova: In the opinion of some economists,  however, separating oversight and monitoring services will allow  us to bring order to our economy.    Danilov-Danilyan: The source of these proposals is  the perception that the Ministry for Protection of the  Environment and Natural Resources, they think, combines these  functions with economic activities. This is not the case,  however. We are not involved in any economic activities  whatsoever! There is not a single natural resource that is  utilized by the ministry's units or enterprises and  organizations subordinate to it. We only regulate resource  consumption by other sectors' enterprises using direct  limitations (quotas) or indirect means (payment amounting to  in-kind taxes). And what is monitoring and oversight if not a  form of regulation?    Separating monitoring and oversight services into  independent  organizations will only make conducting an integrated long-term  ecological policy more difficult, since it includes setting  norms and standards; forming a system of sanctions for  violations; introducing payment for discharges, environmental  pollution, and utilization of natural resources; improving the  taxation system and the mechanism of ecological expert  evaluation; management of the natural preserves system; and  development of ecological programs--scientific-technological and  investment.    Unfortunately, quite often the people whose job includes  development of ecological policy are unable to grasp this set of  problems in its entirety. They overestimate the importance of  some components of this policy while underestimating others.  Such an approach is ruinous right now for the system of  environmental protection, Environmental protection bodies should  not be playing the role of slave-driver--they need to work with  producers rather than just crack the whip...    It is said that the standards we set for producers are too  low... Well, let us raise them--and bankrupt most enterprises.  Is this what we need?    A pauper is not capable of anything. Only he who has  property, opportunities, and means can do something (including  in the area of environmental protection). Yes, it would be best  for the environment if we cease all production activity. But if  this is impossible, let us look at things realistically.    Filimonova: But you would agree that the  environmental protection inspectorate is in such a dismal shape  now that precisely the monitoring and oversight components of an  integrated ecological policy may fail.    Danilov-Danilyan: Our inspectorate had always been  financed as a different ``line item'' than the actual  environmental protection bodies, and therefore in worse shape. I  think we have resolved this problem--unless there is a return to  the past in the process of making changes in the 1993 budget,  the inspectorate's situation will improve considerably. Now we  are taking the next step--getting the needed material and  technical support for these services: instruments,  transportation, communications, information processing  capabilities, etc.    Have you ever seen financial and material and technical  support of an organization improve when it is split into  separate parts, or at least not deteriorate? If we start  dividing territorial environmental protection committees now, we  will have to divide financing, staff rosters, facilities (in  some oblasts this will be a catastrophic development), means of  transportation... For a year nobody will work--everybody will be  busy dividing property.    Filimonova: Well, what can we do--this is the way  it is always done in Russia...    Danilov-Danilyan: This is the last thing we need  right now. We will again have a situation which our prime  minister (on a different occasion) described this way: ``We  wanted to do better, but it came out is usual.''    Filimonova: And personnel? How do you divide  personnel?    Danilov-Danilyan: There are not too many good  cadres, highly skilled and capable of being good administrators,  on the local level. If we start breeding new agencies on a scale  proposed in the draft under consideration, it will inevitably  lead to a decline in the quality of administration in each of  them.    Under the powerful pressure of the geological, forestry, and  water management lobby (all these lobbies we have now!), the  corresponding committees have been separated from the ministry.  They have become autonomous entities under the government as  committees or federal services. I am convinced, however, that  this has not strengthened the environmental protection system;  on the contrary, it has weakened it, because it is more  difficult now to resolve coordination problems. For objective  reasons, however, this splintered system has to be managed as an  integral whole, while retaining within limits of expediency  independence of its units.    Unfortunately, the initiators of the creation of state  oversight of technology-related and ecological safety, while  painting a pretty organizational scheme, did not have a good  conception either as to how to implement this scheme or of the  consequences of its implementation: where they will get the  expected results, and where exactly the opposite. They obviously  lack knowledge of reality.</p>

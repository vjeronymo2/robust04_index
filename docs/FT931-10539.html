			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Minister criticises service from banks HIGH-STREET banks were criticised by a Department of Trade and Industry minister yesterday for their service to small businesses. Baroness Denton, minister responsible for small businesses, said banks needed to show a greater understanding - and to base lending more on past performance than stagnant or falling property values. 'In the service supplied to my constituents (small business), there is a long way to go,' she said. Her remarks to the Young Conservatives' conference in Southend contrasted with the Treasury's recent review of banks' treatment of small businesses which largely exonerated them of failing to pass on interest rate cuts. They also reflected the Trade and Industry Department's DTI's emphasis on wealth creation via industry. Baroness Denton said small businesses were not 'simple' but often used advanced technology and were exporters. Baroness Denton said 99 per cent of businesses employed fewer than 200 people. 'It is crucial for the health of the economy and job creation that these companies are allowed to prosper,' she said. Before addressing the conference she suggested banks should look to boosting regional enterprise funds set aside for lending to growing businesses, citing Midland Bank as an example. She also wanted to see a replacement for the Unlisted Securities Market, which is due to close, to encourage finance for entrepreneurs. Baroness Denton said banks should follow the German example and link their own prospects to those of their small busines clients. She said of the attitude of some high-street banks to falling borrowings by small businesses: 'If it is good news for them that small businesses are borrowing less, where is our growth going to come from?' She said small companies could also help themselves by recognising that the injection of equity by outside investors could help their expansion.</p>

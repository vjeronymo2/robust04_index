			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEN BODA; ADVISER TO MAO BEFORE HE WAS IMPRISONED  </P> <P> Chen Boda, the onetime No. 4 man in China who advised Mao Tse-tung for 30 years  before leading purges during the Cultural Revolution, has died in Beijing of  heart failure, the pro-Beijing press said here Friday.  </P> <P> Chen was 85 when he died at his Beijing home on Sept. 20, the Hong Kong China  News Service reported. The pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao said Mao's  disgraced colleague was cremated Thursday under his original name -- Chen  Jianxiang.  </P> <P> Chen was one of Mao's former secretaries and became the head of Mao's Central  Cultural Revolution Group in 1966.  </P> <P> In 1980, he was put on trial along with the so-called Gang of Four, the radical  leaders of the Cultural Revolution. The man whom the Communist Party newspaper,  the People's Daily, dubbed the "mad persecutor," was sentenced to 18 years in  jail for "counterrevolutionary activities" and purging innocent people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Released on Probation  </P> <P> Officials disclosed in early 1988 that Chen had been released on probation for  medical reasons. He was believed living with a son in the Chinese capital at  his death and quietly pursuing research at the city's Literature and History  Museum.  </P> <P> Chen was born in 1904 in coastal Fujian province and joined the Communist Party  in the mid-1920s. He studied in Moscow for four years, returning in 1930 to  teach at China College in Beijing.  </P> <P> When the Japanese occupied Beijing in 1937, Chen went west to Yenan, the remote  base of China's Communist Party leaders. He taught at the party school and  began his long friendship with Mao.  </P> <P> Over the next decade Chen, as Mao's personal and political secretary, counseled  Mao while writing some of the Chinese leader's most famous essays and speeches.  He played a major role in drafting the new constitution of Communist-ruled  China after 1949 and in 1958 became the first editor of the party's ideological  journal, the Red Flag.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Went With Mao to Moscow  </P> <P> He accompanied Mao on his only foreign trips, his 1949 and 1957 visits to  Moscow.  </P> <P> In 1966 Mao appointed Chen head of a four-member group assigned to lead the  1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution by mobilizing China's masses to  denounce alleged "capitalist roaders" in the party and purge the nation of  bourgeois influences.  </P> <P> Chen used the post to orchestrate campaigns against top officials, including  party General Secretary Deng Xiaoping. He was regarded as the fourth most  powerful person in China, behind Mao, Mao's designated successor Lin Biao and  Premier Chou En-lai.  </P></p>

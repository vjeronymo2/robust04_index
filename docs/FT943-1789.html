			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Cash flows out of BAe despite Rover disposal Underlying profits at British Aerospace trebled from Pounds 29m to Pounds 90m in the six months to June 30, but BAe shares fell 26p to 445p yesterday when the market learned that the company saw a first-half cash outflow despite the Pounds 800m sale of Rover to BMW. Operating profits in defence of Pounds 221m, against Pounds 230m, were offset by an increased loss of Pounds 79m (Pounds 75m) on commercial aircraft. The sale of Rover generated an exceptional profit of Pounds 299m. However, exceptional losses of Pounds 16m on adjustment to the sale of BAe's corporate jet division to Raytheon, Pounds 30m on the early repayment of expensive debt, and Pounds 14m to top up the value of lease provisions cut the total exceptional profit to Pounds 239m. Total pre-tax profits were Pounds 329m, and the interim dividend was lifted from 3.3p to 4p. BAe's borrowings rose as working capital requirements increased and it converted Pounds 220m of guarantees to associate company Hutchison Telecom into a direct loan. Operating cash outflow was Pounds 115m in the first half. Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director, said the underlying trend in cash flow was healthy. 'While the erratic timing of large cash payments can distort the figures,' he added, 'over time cash flow from defence businesses will more than offset any losses in commercial aircraft.' Losses at the turbo-prop aircraft division, based in Prest-wick, Scotland were particularly heavy. BAe chief executive, Mr Dick Evans, said conditions in the regional aircraft market remained extremely difficult. He said BAe had almost halved its cost base in these areas to remain competitive, and that losses at the RJ regional jet business were much lower, while work on Airbus moved further into profit in the first half. BAe is continuing to negotiate with potential joint venture partners over the future of the regional jet and turboprop businesses. Despite the losses, Mr Mike Turner, the director responsible for the division, said BAe was 'in no hurry to do a deal'. The order book in the central defence business is now Pounds 8.5bn, only slightly lower than the record figure of Pounds 8.8bn last year. With substantial additional work on the final production phase of the Eurofighter 2000 due to be agreed in a year's time, one analyst said: 'BAe has the strongest defence order book of any company in the world.' Production of the 48 Tornado aircraft for Saudi Arabia has already started and first deliveries are due at the end of 1995. Prospects for Hawk advanced trainer/light fighter sales are also good, with South Africa, India and Australia all having significant requirements.

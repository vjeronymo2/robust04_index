			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: A leading light under its new ownership - How Technology has survived and prospered after last July's traumatic events THE letter from International Business Machines arrived, hand delivered, in the reception area of Technology on July 10 last year. It gave notice that the world's largest computer manufacturer had decided, unilaterally, to terminate its contract with Technology, one of the UK's largest and most successful personal computer distributors. It was a sharp rebuff for Technology's audacity in allowing itself to be acquired the week before by ICL, the UK computer maker in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake. The same day, Digital Equipment, the US minicomputer manufacturer, said it would not renew its distribution contract. A year on, Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Technology, still resents the cavalier way in which Big Blue ended the relationship: 'We had been working with them for nine years and sold half a billion pounds worth of IBM equipment'. Mr John Gardner, chairman of ICL (UK), recalls the shock of Black Friday: 'It was traumatic; it stopped Derek's business dead in its tracks, but in hindsight it was the best thing that could have happened'. It was hardly unexpected, though. ICL bought Technology for Pounds 30m with the aim of becoming the largest supplier of personal computers in the UK, ahead of IBM, Compaq and Dell. It was a controversial move which always courted the risk that major personal computer makers would not want to deal with a distributor owned by a rival and selling ICL products in direct competition. 'The chances were we would lose one personal computer manufacturer,' Mr Lewis says. 'But IBM was not the most likely.' Today, Technology has not only survived but prospered, and its lean and hungry business methods are the model for the rest of ICL. Operating margins, for example, are typically less than 10 per cent. Mr Lewis pays by results; low salaries and high commissions mean that overheads are always in line with sales. By comparison, ICL as a whole is working hard to drive operating expenses below 23 per cent of sales. In the year to June 1992, before the ICL takeover, Technology made sales of Pounds 147m, of which some Pounds 70m was IBM and Digital Equipment business. Despite the pull out, in the six months from July to December last year revenues totalled Pounds 110m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.5m. For the full year the target is revenues of Pounds 250m. Of the Pounds 110m, Pounds 40m was ICL equipment; the rest came from sales of systems from other suppliers: Compaq, Sun, Hewlett Packard, Toshiba, and Groupe Bull. Digital Equipment never, in fact, cut off supplies of its systems. Now Technology is able to sell IBM mid range machines through an agreement with Bull of France, which sells the US manufacturer's machines under its own name. If a customer insists on IBM personal computers, Technology buys them from brokers: 'It only amounts to sales of Pounds 200,000 or so a month,' Mr Lewis says. ICL bought Technology because, in common with other large computer manufacturers, it had to find a cost effective channel to market low cost systems which could not command the profit margins necessary to support a direct sales force. The problem is complicated because many large customers like dealing directly with the manufacturer. By buying Technology, ICL brought together in one step the dealer-only channel and the manufacturer's direct channel. For significant sales accounts, ICL takes the lead but passes the implemen-tation over to staff at Technology once the contract is signed. The company recently concluded a deal worth Pounds 6m for the supply of 2,000 Toshiba notebook computers to NatWest Life Insurance. The ICL account team handled the sale; Technology staff are to implement it. The intention had been to run the company as a separate division, but the fracas with IBM and Digital forced a rethink and Technology was integrated into the overall company structure: 'It was more a merger than an acquisition,' Mr Gardner says. ICL is now the sixth largest personal computer supplier in Europe. ICL, with turnover of Pounds 2.48bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.6m last year, is now developing its business in three directions: computing services, business solutions (including the mainframe business) and volume products; the latter are the responsibility of Technology. Personal computer manu-facturers these days are segmenting their product lines into systems which command premium prices - IBM's PS/2 line for example, and commodity systems which sell at the lowest possible prices. Last week ICL took a further step in acknowledging the increasing tendency for computer hardware to become a commodity product by introducing a low cost version of its high powered mid range machines which run the Unix operating system. A typical Unix system sells for Pounds 250,000. ICL's value for money machines - the Technicl range - sell for between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 50,000, making Unix computing accessible to a broad range of small business customers. All ICL's personal computer and Unix systems are handled by Technology. The difference between a premium Unix computer and a Technicl product is simply packaging. The Technicl system comes in fixed configurations; it can be ordered, sold and delivered in 48 hours. The logical conclusion is that most of ICL's hardware will eventually be sold by Technology: 'The sooner the better,' Mr Lewis says.</p>

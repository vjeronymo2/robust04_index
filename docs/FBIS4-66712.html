			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "PM Conveys Message to U.S."] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 8. The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao, was noticeably cautious in his references to the  Indo-U.S. relations--while briefly dealing with foreign policy  matters in his reply to the Lok Sabha debate on the motion of  thanks to the President's address.    While Mr. Rao pointedly mentioned the progress on economic,  cultural and other fronts, he roundly talked of certain  statements from Washington which had generated misgivings. But  instead of elaborating on the second issue or dealing  specifically with the points of disagreement, he merely repeated  the implied references in the President's address -- "We look  forward to working with the United States towards mutual  understanding, including those issues on which such  understanding needs enhancement. This will reflect the vibrant  democratic and secular ideals of our two countries".    Paraphrasing the President's words, Mr. Rao said there were  areas where understanding was lacking and the address made the  country's stand clear. Mr. Rao confined himself to recalling  that the Home Minister (Mr. S.B. Chavan) had explained the  government's position in Parliament the other day. Now Mr.  Chavan had used strong words against Washington's stand, taking  exception to the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton's statement at  the credential presentation ceremony of the new Pakistan  Ambassador that "we share Pakistan's concerns about human rights  abuses in Kashmir". Mr. Rao, however, chose not to elaborate any  of the points, dealt with by the Home Minister.    In his reply to the debate in the Rajya Sabha later, the  Prime Minister maintained the same cautious line. India's  response, he said, had to be calibrated and "if a statement  comes and next day there is clarification, you have to take it  together. We are not in the habit of knee-jerk reaction."    The net result of the two pronouncements is that India on  the  one hand made its stand abundantly clear on the "statements from  Washington", while, on the other hand, it projected a posture of  caution at the highest level. None in Washington was left in any  doubt about the feelings of the Government (as also of the  political parties and various sections of public opinion). At  the same time, none in the U.S. Administration could link the  Prime Minister with tough words against the American attitude to  India. Even otherwise, Mr. Rao had avoided commenting on the  "statements from Washington", a euphemism for Mr. Clinton's  recent references to Kashmir -- contained, apart from the  credential ceremony speech, in the President's address at the  U.N. General Assembly and in his reply to a private American  citizen, connected with a blatantly anti-India outfit -- as also  his statements on Punjab. New Delhi left it to the foreign  office spokesman to reply to what were regarded highly  objectionable points.    By recalling Mr. Chavan's strongly-worded statements, Mr.  Rao  impliedly provided the endorsement. That the Home Minister's  off-the-cuff observations was evident from the way he repeated  his points, first made in the Lok Sabha, in the Upper House --  and that, too, after the U.S. Embassy here conveyed its  unhappiness, in a letter to Mr. Chavan, with a copy to the  External Affairs Ministry. On March 2, Mr. Chavan (in the Lok  Sabha) charged the U.S. with developing a vested interest in  Kashmir and wanted the country to be on guard, adding that  Washington was interested neither in helping India nor Pakistan,  "they would like to help themselves". He was equally sharp in  criticising the U.S. interference in Jammu and Kashmir.    On March 4 (in the Rajya Sabha), Mr. Chavan, while dealing  with the U.S. Embassy's unhappiness with his earlier statement,  stood his ground and reiterated his charge of interference  against the U.S.    The exploratory talks through diplomatic channels for a  meeting of the Prime Minister and Mr. Clinton are unlikely to be  affected (in view of Mr. Rao's caution). That New Delhi's stand  was made clear was an important factor.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Hungarian foreign minister will travel to  Yugoslavia today. Prior to his talks, he gave an interview to  MAGYAR SZO, the paper of Vojvodina Hungarians. Arpad Madarasz  reports from Novi Sad.    [Madarasz] It is a fundamental interest of the two  neighboring peoples to live in peace and good-neighborliness  with each other, the Hungarian foreign minister told the Novi  Sad paper MAGYAR SZO. Geza Jeszenszky stressed that Hungary  wishes to have friendly relations with every southern Slav  people, and from the beginning of the crisis it has been  striving to establish well balanced ties with each successor  state of the disintegrating Yugoslavia.    First of all, I would like to see and experience personally  how people live in Yugoslavia today and how it feels to be a  Hungarian in Vojvodina, said Jeszenszky. He added that he does  not expect spectacular results from the visit and talks.  However, he expects us to confirm that it is our mutual  determination to improve interstate ties gradually, step by  step, taking the possibilities into consideration, to restore  confidence.    The Hungarian Government supports the autonomy concept of  the  Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], but it  does not regard it as its task to discuss this with the Yugoslav  Government, Geza Jeszenszky pointed out. However, he said he is  pleased to learn that President Milosevic has invited [VMDK  leader] Andras Agoston to attend the talks.</p>

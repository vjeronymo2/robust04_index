			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Westpac to reduce costs by cutting 2,000 jobs WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, yesterday said it planned to make 2,000 staff redundant as part of a restructuring of retail operations intended to cut operating costs by ADollars 150m (USDollars 107m) a year. Mr Robert Joss, managing director, said most of the staff in question would leave over the next three months as the retail business was split into separate consumer and commercial divisions. 'This new structure will enable us to better serve the different needs of our business and household customers, and presents an important step forward in making Westpac the best retail bank in Australia,' he said. The announcement, which was expected, comes in the wake of a wide-ranging review of Westpac operations following a record loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year to the end of September. The bank announced last week that it planned to dispose of many of its Asian operations, and consolidate its US operations into one office, as part of a restructuring of international activities. Mr David Morgan, head of retail banking, said the redundancies would raise the bank's retail productivity to world class levels, but would not affect customer service. Westpac said last year that it would probably make up to 4,000 of its 20,000 staff redundant in an attempt to reduce its higher than average expenses to income ratio.</p>

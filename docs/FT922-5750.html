			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Italy's new president calls for reform MR Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Italy's ninth president, yesterday took the unprecedented step of calling for a constitutional overhaul in his inaugural address to parliament. The only president to take an initiative of this kind, the 73-year-old former Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies left no doubt that he intended to encourage institutional reform and inject new morality into public life. 'I believe the president's task consists above all else in taking note of the popular will and, within the constraints of his powers, ensuring this is translated into valid and effective results,' he said. That popular will, he noted, had been expressed in the April 5 general election which saw the traditional political parties humiliated by a large protest vote. 'In this light, the president of the republic from this moment invites parliament respectfully but firmly to nominate a commission of the two houses with a brief to revise the entire institutional framework.' He also emphasised public morality, in a clear reference to the country's corruption scandals, notably in Milan. 'The misuse of public funds is a very serious matter, defrauding honest taxpayers and abusing citizens' confidence: there is no worse evil, no greater danger to democracy than the dirty involvement of politics with business.' Mr Scalfaro was elected on Monday as a compromise candidate proposed by his Christian Democrat party. He was backed by the four-party Christian Democrat-led coalition, as well as the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), as a candidate whose reputation was untainted by corruption. In his speech, Mr Scalfaro also warned of the need for urgent action on the country's deteriorating finances. He emphasised the risk of failing to converge with the rest of Italy's EC partners, adding: 'We are well aware that Europe cannot wait.' After being sworn in for his seven-year term, Mr Scalfaro drove to the Quirinale Palace where Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the interim president for the last month, formally handed over the keys of office. Mr Scalfaro, a long time widower and devout Catholic, inherits a 16th century palace with 1,200 rooms used by 30 former Popes, four kings and eight presidents. The total presidential staff numbers 796 with a budget of L207bn (Pounds 93.7m) a year. This may well be among the first items to be subjected to reform and austerity.</p>

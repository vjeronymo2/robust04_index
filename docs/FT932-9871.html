			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Commercial property to raise more money THE COMMERCIAL property sector is set to raise significantly more money this year than last year, when funding fell sharply, Savills, chartered surveyors, said. In the first four months of this year the property sector raised Pounds 1.38bn through loans, bonds and rights issues, a similar rate to 1990 and 1991. Figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show the number of new homes started by housebuilders in the UK rose 7 per cent in January, February and March compared with the first three months of last year.</p>

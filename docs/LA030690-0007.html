			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Mayor-in-the-Air:  </P> <P> Tom Bradley took to the skies in a police helicopter Monday to remind commuters  via six radio stations to car pool.  </P> <P> "I am up here today to urge all of you -- and I can see you riding into work  all by yourself -- to take advantage of ride-sharing programs," he intoned.  </P> <P> Bradley, of course, already ride-shares.  </P> <P> With his chauffeur.  </P> <P> Figuring that about one out of three people in L.A. claim to be authors -- or  at least writing screenplays -- the Metropolitan Water District of Southern  California is soliciting snappy prose for a forthcoming book.  </P> <P> The theme: How to save water. OK, so it's not exactly on a par with the meaning  of life.  </P> <P> But, points out MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski: "We're in the fourth year of a  drought period and water availability is going to be real tight this summer, so  we want people thinking about water conservation."  </P> <P> Authors whose work is included in the tome, "The Book on Water Conservation,"  will receive credit but not pay (neither salary, nor a percentage of the gross  if it becomes a movie).  </P> <P> The water district has received some not-so-productive suggestions over the  years.  </P> <P> "We had a woman who said she washed her personal things with her hands then  used the same water to wash her floor," said Malinowski. "We've had people  suggest that swimming pool owners be required to put up signs that say, 'Do not  splash in pool.' One we hear quite a lot is, 'Shower with a friend.' "  </P> <P> The most unusual suggestion was a variation on the cozy shower.  </P> <P> "I heard from a guy who showered with his dog," Malinowski said.  </P> <P> Pass the flea shampoo, Rover.  </P> <P> "Would like to borrow $2,500 for our honeymoon," says the ad in this week's  Downtown News. "Restitution 24-month period at 7% interest."  </P> <P> Not only is the approach unique, but the parties involved turn out to live in  Michigan.  </P> <P> "My girlfriend lives out in California," said the bride-to-be over the  telephone. "She suggested I try there and maybe I'd find someone in Beverly  Hills who wanted to help someone out. We both come from broken homes and we're  really scraping to come up with money for the wedding. As it is now, we're only  having six people at the wedding."  </P> <P> She said that she and her fiance have both been hit hard by the recession in  Michigan. But she pointed out their hometown of Bay City, Mich., has one  distinction.  </P> <P> "Madonna was born here," she said.  </P> <P> What is it about A's-Giants baseball games?  </P> <P> First, there was the Oct. 17 San Francisco quake just before the start of the  third World Series game.  </P> <P> Now, it turns out the A's and Giants were warming up to play in Monrovia last  Wednesday when the Upland temblor struck.  </P> <P> Well, not those A's and Giants. These were teams from the local youth baseball  league.  </P> <P> One other difference too. "There was no way these kids would have the game  postponed," said league President David Bower. "The quake even pumped 'em up  more."  </P> <P> The A's won again, by the way.  </P></p>

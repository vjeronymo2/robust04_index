			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CENTERPIECE;  </P> <P> SEARCH FOR FOSTER HOMES STILL DIFFICULT  </P> <P> An increasing number of single people, seniors and dual-career couples are  opening their homes to the hundreds of abused or neglected Ventura County  children who are removed from their homes each year. But social workers say the  shortage of available foster care is still far from over.  </P> <P> "We're still in bad shape," said Diana Caskey, who works with the Department of  Children's Services as Ventura County's foster home recruiter. "Each time a  child comes to us, finding a foster home is a little like hunt and peck."  </P> <P> Each month, between 40 and 60 children require some kind of foster care, Caskey  said. But only 55 licensed homes in the county have available beds, she said.  </P> <P> "Even then, that statistic is deceiving," Caskey added. "It's rare to get a  foster parent who says, 'I'll take any age, any sex, any behavior problem.'  There usually are some restrictions.  </P> <P> "Last week, I had a 7-year-old boy, and there was no place to put him," she  said. "I finally had to call a woman who had requested only girls."  </P> <P> No statistics are available that compare the reasons for foster care placement  over the years. Between 1987 and 1988, however, the last year for which data is  available, Caskey said the majority of emergency foster care placements were  because of parental neglect.  </P> <P> Young children have been found alone in homes where the power and water have  been turned off, and where there has been no food for days, she said. Social  workers have also removed children who have refused to go to school and have  been left home alone for long periods of time.  </P> <P> "You'd be amazed how many parents have no idea how to set any limits," Caskey  said. "They want to be their children's buddies or something, and then when the  child gets older and he wants to do whatever he wants, the parent has no  control. There's usually a lot of dysfunction in these families."  </P> <P> Next are cases of physical abuse, sexual abuse, child abandonment and  drug-addicted infants.  </P> <P> "We have lots of cocaine and heroin babies, and those have definitely  increased," Caskey said. "Even though we don't keep figures on how it compares  to five years ago, I personally think drugs and alcohol play a big role in  foster care. They can be involved in every category."  </P> <P> Before a drug-addicted child is removed from its home, the mother is first  given the opportunity to enter a drug rehabilitation program, Caskey said. In  many cases, she said, the mother is unwilling to comply. AURORA MACKEY  </P></p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / German new car sales set for further 5% fall NEW CAR sales in Germany are likely to fall by a further 5 per cent in 1994 after a slump of more than 20 per cent this year, according to the influential Ifo economics institute. In real terms, this means the first-time registration of 2.8m-2.9m new cars compared with 3m this year and 3.9m in 1992, when recession struck and the unification boom ran out of steam. The continuing fall marks a further stage in the normalisation of the domestic market which was distorted by pent-up demand in the former GDR. Many east Germans bought new cars after unification in late 1990, while western Germans replaced their old models earlier than normal to take advantage of higher prices for second-hand vehicles. The 1992 figures were also boosted by a buying surge last November and December before an increase from 14 to 15 per cent in value added tax on January 1 this year. But next year's sales will also be hit by a sharp increase in fuel taxes, the institute said. Government levies on petrol and diesel fuel are to rise by 16 pfennigs and 7 pfennigs a litre next January. Rising unemployment and lower disposable incomes will also take their toll. The annual German wages round, due to start in the next few weeks, is widely expected to result in awards at or below next year's expected inflation rate of 3.5 per cent. The forecast supports the widespread view that German economic recovery, next year at least, will depend on improved exports rather than any rise in domestic demand. According to Ifo, replacement purchases in western Germany this year will fall by only 4 per cent to 1.04m cars. However, growth in overall car ownership dropped almost 50 per cent to fewer than 400,000 vehicles in the first half. Industry executives do not expect a return to 'normal' market conditions in Germany and abroad before mid-1995. West German industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent in August against July, Ariane Genillard adds from Bonn. The largest increase was in capital goods, which rose by 4.5 per cent. Manufacturing went up 2 per cent and the construction sector by 3 per cent, according to the Economics Ministry.</p>

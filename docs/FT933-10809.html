			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: Monteverdi at Salzburg - Opera The Salzburg Festival started out, in the early decades of the century, as a place of theatrical experiment. In the postwar era of Herbert von Karajan it developed into the epitome of the Luxus-Festival. Here the top names of the operatic and concert-giving world assembled for top fees in money-no-object performances at top ticket prices. Increasingly the 'straight' theatre found itself consigned to the margins; by the time of Karajan's death, in 1989, the whole formula had become horribly decadent. Now Salzburg is back on the road of experiment. This is the third year of Gerard Mortier's artistic directorship, and everywhere his horizon-widening approach is apparent. Trends and themes deemed unworthy of notice not long ago are energetically examined; significant composers and performers accorded non-person status by the previous administration are warmly embraced. This year's modern-music compilations (Nono, Ligeti, Kurtag) offer a prime example. Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the pioneering Austrian period-practice conductor, offers another - uninvited in Karajan's day, since 1991 a mainstay of programming. Monteverdi offers yet another - Orfeo and L'incoronazione di Poppea staged with period-instrument accompaniment. Under Peter Stein, Salzburg theatrical tradition is excitingly refreshed; Coriolanus under Deborah Warner (European debut) is already a big talking-point. (I shall return to the new Coriolanus in a subsequent report.) Not everyone is happy. The old guard continues to rumble against Mortier's combative management style. The record companies, for whom Salzburg was once a licensed showcase, are unhappy. At a first-week press conference the Vienna Philharmonic wondered aloud whether it was still loved and wanted here - Mortier's announcement that next year's Beethoven symphony cycle would go to Harnoncourt and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe can hardly have been irrelevant to such musings. New patterns of audience attraction are incompletely formed; in these recessionary times, ticket sales are down. And artistically not everything this year has come quite right - even someone wholly in sympathy with Mortier's vision has to admit as much. The two Monteverdi productions make the point: Orfeo in the courtyard of the Residenz, Poppea in the vast spaces of the Grosses Festspielhaus. Both succeed as splashy, attention-grabbing events; both find different ways of (to my mind) cruelly diluting the profound seriousness, the very modernity of the works in question. Orfeo is a Re-interpretation In Capital Letters by producer-designer Herbert Wernicke (a figure of note in continental opera houses so far unknown in Britain). In a daring visual conceit, a gigantic mock-up of the Residenz courtyard facade itself serves as set, slashed and kinked by a great scarlet gash. The opera's dramatic personae are - here we go again] - in modern-day evening dress, evidently engaged upon a wedding party for Orpheus and Eurydice at which things get out of hand. Events, some of them dispersed to vertigo-inducing heights, are re-thought in what one can only assume is Wernicke's dialectical confrontation of the original libretto. The trouble is that his 'new' Orfeo plot proves obscure (at one point Eurydice dies then recovers, at another Orpheus stabs himself), lacking in its own strict logic, drenched in modern cliche; since moments of illumination were scarce, one ended up feeling that the cord of artistic tension connecting Monteverdi's time and our own had here been frayed beyond repair. Rene Jacobs's slack, slow-tempo conducting of the Concerto Vocale was no help. Nor was the mediocre singing, though Laurence Dale (a baritonally rich, sensitive tenor Orpheus), Susan Graham (La Musica), the veteran Jules Bastin (Charon) and Monica Bacelli (an Italian Messenger, mirabile dictu, with blessedly idiomatic enunciation) provided exceptions to the latter rule. Poppea - surtitled in English and German (a Salzburg first), with Harnoncourt using a huge Concentus Musicus for his fancy Monteverdi edition  -was a bloated burlesque. In Jurgen Flimm's production much jokey time-travelling (eg guards with portable TVs) clogged the severely logical thought-lines of this terrifyingly austere, intimate music-drama. No doubt, given the absurd choice of venue, some such enlargement was inevitable. This one was unforgivably coarse in spirit and even coarser in general singing style, with verismo phrasing that only underlined the preponderance of poor Italian diction. Recitar cantando, indeed] Harnoncourt's reputation as a Monteverdi guru must surely have taken a knock. On the other hand, the reputations of the few really accomplished singers on hand - Sylvia McNair a deliciously cool, subtle Poppaea, Philip Langridge an authoritative tenor Nero, Kurt Moll amazingly refined and stylish as Seneca, Andrea Rost a youthfully pure Drusilla - will only be enhanced, and deservedly so.</p>

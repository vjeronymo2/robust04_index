			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Birmingham airport seeks private cash BIRMINGHAM International Airport, Britain's fifth largest, is seeking up to Pounds 400m of private-sector investment to fund expansion over the next 10 years, its local-authority owners said yesterday. Meanwhile the High Court has ruled as unlawful proposals by the government to increase the number of night flights at London airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The seven local authorities which own Birmingham airport said improvements to the terminal and runway could create up to 11,000 jobs in the region. Investors will be offered an equity stake in the airport. Local authority leaders, however, said the move did not signal a move to privatisation. Raising the necessary capital will depend on approval from Mr John McGregor, transport secretary, who is being asked to meet Midlands councillors to discuss their demands for a relaxation of public-sector spending rules. Mr Fred Hunt, leader of Dudley Borough Council, said the authorities envisaged a partnership between the public and private sectors enabling Birmingham to keep pace with its main regional rival at Manchester. Detailed proposals on raising the finance, setting out options for investors such as preference shares or long-term debt, will be published next year. If approved, construction work could begin in 1997. The court decision yesterday on night flights at London airports is a blow to the government and to BAA, the privatised airports operator, which wanted more flexibility for aircraft movements at Heathrow. The government was planning to introduce a new quota system for night flights based on the noise performance of aircraft to replace the current system based on a specific number of aircraft movements. The proposals faced fierce opposition from local authorities near the airports worried that the new rules would sharply increase the number of night flights. Mr Justice Laws yesterday granted the councils a declaration that the proposed new noise regulations were not authorised by the 1982 Civil Aviation Act. He also ordered the government to pay 25 per cent of the legal costs incurred by the councils. They include Richmond and Hillingdon in London, Tandridge in Surrey, and Windsor and Maidenhead as well as Slough councils in Berkshire. British Aerospace has applied for planning permission to develop its airfield at Filton, north Bristol, as a commercial airport. The proposal is highly controversial because several thousand houses have been built in recent years near the airfield. It also threatens the viability of Bristol's existing airport south of the city. BAe said it needs to make better use of the airfield to protect the future of its Filton plant, the largest local private-sector employer. BAe says in its planning application that it would restrict air traffic movements to 23,000 a year, and night-time movements to 20 a night. It says the terminal building would limit passengers to 350,000 a year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis pursuant to Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether a regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and to the requirements of the Executive Order, which include assessing the costs and benefits anticipated as a result of the proposed regulatory action. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB has determined this is a significant rule under Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, this section of the preamble summarizes the potential economic impacts of the proposed RCRA Expanded Public Participation and Revisions to Combustion Permitting Procedures rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the economic impact analysis for today's proposed rule, the Agency's best estimate is that the requirements regarding expanded public participation before and during permit application would result in an incremental national annual cost of $130,000 to $380,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the annualized incremental national cost of the permitting requirements in today's proposed rule is estimated to be between $0 to $520,000. EPA expects that much of the effect of the permitting provisions in today's proposed rule will be to clarify and codify current practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the economic impact analysis for today's proposed rule, the Agency's best estimate is that the requirements of today's proposed rule would result in an incremental national annual cost of $130,000 to $900,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A complete discussion of the economic impact analysis is available in the regulatory docket for today's proposed rule in a report entitled ``Economic Impact Analysis for the Proposed RCRA Expanded Public Participation and Revisions to Combustion Permitting Procedures Rule.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on the data and methodologies used to derive the estimates described below and in the background document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Cost Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section summarizes estimated costs and potential impacts of two aspects of today's proposed rule: (1) Expansion of opportunities for public involvement in the permitting process, and (2) modification of combustion unit permitting requirements. These two pieces of the proposed rule affect a different universe of facilities at different stages in the permitting process and, thus, are presented separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Expanded Public Involvement Opportunities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the requirements of the expanded public involvement portion of today's proposed rule apply only to new hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal permit applications. With the exception of the information repository requirement (see below), the expanded public involvement requirements do not apply to post-closure permits and permit modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimates that, over the next ten years, the bulk of new permit applications will be submitted by the 159 interim-status boilers and industrial furnaces (BIFs). In addition, based on information provided by the Regional permit writers, EPA estimates that an additional 53 to 127 new treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (for a total of 212 to 286 facilities) will submit permit applications over the next ten years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed rule includes several requirements that would result in direct costs to facilities submitting new permit applications. The analysis estimates the costs to all affected facilities of (1) Preparing a public notice announcing the intention to submit a permit application and to hold a public meeting; (2) disseminating the public notice in local newspapers and over the radio; and (3) holding a public meeting and preparing a transcript.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for communities with a non-English speaking population, the rule will require the facility to ``make all reasonable efforts to communicate with the community in ways that reach all segments.'' Based on conversations with RCRA and Superfund Regional community relations specialists and on data about existing RCRA facilities, this analysis assumes that between 5%&hyph;30% of the facilities (11 to 86 facilities over the next ten years) will fulfill this requirement by publishing multi-lingual notices and providing an interpreter at the public meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the rule will give the Director the discretion to require a facility to set up an information repository, based on the level of public interest or other factors. This requirement can apply anywhere in the permitting process, including post-closure permits, permit renewals, and permit modifications. Thus in addition to the interim status BIFs and the new facilities mentioned above, the repository requirement can apply, at the discretion of the Director, to the approximately 4,100 treatment, storage, and disposal facilities that EPA expects will undergo permit renewals, modifications, or closure over the next ten years. EPA estimates that 15&hyph;20% of the estimated 212 to 286 facilities submitting a new Part B application, and 1% of the 4,100 already-permitted facilities (73 to 98 facilities total) would be affected over the next ten years by the repository requirement in today's proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost per facility of the above requirements is approximately $5,000 to $14,000. Annualized over a ten-year period, using a 7% discount rate, the resulting national annual cost of the expanded public involvement requirements is estimated to be between $130,000 to $380,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Modification of the Permitting Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Direct costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposed rule includes two new permitting requirements that have direct cost implications for the regulated universe: (1) Changing the ``data in lieu of'' requirements, and (2) specifying the events that follow a trial burn failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, interim status combustion facilities have the option of submitting ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn for a unit that is ``sufficiently similar'' to an already-permitted unit. Today's proposed rule proposes changing the requirements for ``data in lieu of'' by requiring the units to be ``virtually identical'' and to be located at the same facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on information from trial burn contractors, preparing a trial burn plan and conducting a trial burn costs about $110,000 to $550,000 per facility. Submitting ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn is assumed to cost approximately the same as preparing a trial burn plan, or $10,000 to $50,000. The net incremental cost of denying the ``data in lieu of'' option would be $100,000 to $500,000 per affected facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

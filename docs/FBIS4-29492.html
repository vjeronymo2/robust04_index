			<p>BFN     [Text] The Senate meeting convened at Parliament this  morning at 0935. The meeting considered the house-approved  draft copyright bill. A number of senators debated in support  of the bill saying that it will contribute to developing the  national economy to be in line with the world economic  situation. They said this will lead to greater development of  the country's economy because it will also result in expansion  of trade and industry. The draft bill will encourage Thai  people to be enthusiastic in using new and modern inventions.    Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said that the  draft copyright bill will provide protection for data work and  actors' achievements. Regarding computer programs, over which  many parties have expressed concerns, they will be protected by  the existing law.    After a considerable period of debate, the meeting decided  to  accept in principle the draft bill before being passed for  further consideration by the commission. The meeting was  adjourned at 1210.    Earlier, it took the House of Representatives three weeks to  deliberate and approve this draft copyright bill.</p>

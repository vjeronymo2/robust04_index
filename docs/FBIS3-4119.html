The "Happiness Project" aims to help improve the living  conditions and the health of farmers, particularly those in  remote and poverty-stricken districts.    The welfare foundation, a non-governmental organization  headed by Chinese celebrities, plans to raise funds from around  the country and abroad.    Donations are to go toward providing equipment and training  to farmers.    The foundation also plans activities to challenge the  traditional concepts that favor large families and encourage  rural families to have fewer and healthier children.    State Councillor Peng Peiyun, who is also minister of the  State Family Planning Commission, said the government will  support the project and called on social institutes and  individuals to donate or volunteer their time to the effort.    Some rural families, especially those in economically  depressed districts, often have more children, particularly  boys, to help with field work and support the family.    It is a common scene that the poorer a family, the more  children it has.    Peng pointed out that family planning work must be  integrated  with improvement of living standards and expansion of social  welfare services.    She said greater publicity and educational activities should  be carried out to teach farmers about advanced production  techniques and the state family planning policy.</p>

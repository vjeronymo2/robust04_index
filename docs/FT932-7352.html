			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Devaluation of sterling gives sharp boost to UK exports BRITAIN'S visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Community narrowed again last month, amid fresh signs that the devaluation of sterling has given a sharp boost to UK exports. In April the value of imports from countries outside the EC exceeded the value of exports by Pounds 831m. However, the overall deficit was Pounds 98m less than in March, underlining the trend of the last three months which has seen the trade gap narrowing. The better news on the trade balance was underlined by a sharp growth in export volumes in the last three months. The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that total UK export volumes - excluding oil and erratic items, such as ships and precious stones - had grown by 6 1/2 per cent compared to the previous 3 months. By contrast, imports rose by only 2 per cent over the same period. Yesterday's figures were seen as a further indication that the devaluation of sterling is helping to promote economic recovery through the exports boost. On the foreign exchange markets, sterling received a boost from the trade figures following its 4 pfennig rise against the Germany currency last week. The pound closed in London at DM2.5125, up half a pfennig on the day. The CSO's figures indicated that, despite a sharp increase in March, the prices of exported goods returned to their levels at the beginning of the year. This implies that exporters have not used the devaluation of the currency to the very low levels seen in the spring as an opportunity to mark up prices. The CSO's figures also indicate that UK exporters are winning a greater share of markets outside Europe, as those in the EC continue to fall into recession. For the first time since May 1992, the UK registered a trade surplus with North America in April. The UK is also increasing the volume of its exports to developing economies, in a trend which has continued unbroken since November of last year. Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg, said the figures underlined that the UK's Gross Domestic Product would show an increase in the second quarter of this year. 'The UK is winning market share even though economies in the rest of Europe are slowing down,' he said. Since the beginning of the year, the CSO has not provided data for UK trade with European Community countries because a new system of measuring intra-EC trade is being introduced.</p>

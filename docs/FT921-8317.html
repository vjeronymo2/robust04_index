			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Names seek injunctions in test case the individuals whose assets provide the insurance market's capital - is preparing to seek injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing from Names' funds in order to meet insurance claims. Mr Michael Freeman, of the West End legal firm Michael Freeman, aims to issue motions for 'around 10' separate injunctions either today or tomorrow. The injunctions would function as test cases for the more than 600 Names who are financing the action. The Names are members of insurance syndicates specialising in catastrophe reinsurance and managed by Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire agencies. All suffered heavy losses from the string of catastrophes that occurred in 1989 and 1990. Names on the Gooda Walker syndicates recently received notice that they must pay cash calls of Pounds 101m before March 2 or Lloyd's would cash bank guarantees, held by the Names' agents, in order to meet claims. Lloyd's is pledged to fight the injunctions and will seek an immediate court hearing if they are granted. Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, said yesterday: 'We oppose the injunction extreme-ly strongly. We have no way of operating if people don't pay their losses.' Mr Freeman described the cash calls as 'improper'. Earlier this month he wrote to Names advising them that the terms of cash calls made by agents breached the agreements signed by Names with their agents. He also said that the certification required to begin the procedure to draw from deposits had not been provided.</p>

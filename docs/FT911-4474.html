			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Arts: Otello - New York It is 27 years since Solti last conducted at the Met. On Tuesday, in Carnegie Hall, he conducted a concert Otello, with the Chicago Symphony, that was electrifying. At Covent Garden, of course, he used also be electrifying in this opera - but in Carnegie he had a greater orchestra, and the extraordinary power and intensity with which he invested the score was even more exciting. Sure, some disapproving voices were heard in the intervals: 'hard', 'noisy', 'driven'. They are words, I confess, that I have on occasion used about Solti performances, but they were not apt to this one. There was hardness, there was drive, and sometimes the music was very loud indeed - but always where it was appropriate, never at the expense of the singers, and never in any show-off way. I've never heard Solti's famous excitability so completely harnessed to a disciplined, long-lined, marvellously vivid, engrossing account of the whole score. For example, that strange, discordant blast of trilling woodwinds that accompanies the first clause of Iago's Creed was terrifying: as if for the first time one realised what Verdi meant by it; yet the Iago, Leo Nucci, remained clearly audible. A list of string passages superbly, intently, powerfully played would be long. There was also much tenderness and beauty. The concert doubled as a Decca recording session. The soloists were raised on a bridge behind the orchestra, and behind them was the large and magnificent Chicago Symphony Chorus, prepared for this performance by Terry Edwards. Pavarotti was singing the title role for the first time. (He had not been well, and there was a great deal of carry-on with potations and pills and a yard of white silk; the Desdemona, Kiri Te Kanawa, must have been tempted to swat him as he and his outsize hanky scene-stole during her Willow Song.) But when he rose to sing, he sang well. 'Esultate' was clear, ringing, heroic. In the love duet, his reluctance to be intimate, confiding, anything but stentorian, was a drawback. In Act 2 it was the ringing phrases that made most effect. But in the third-act duet he began to engage with the soprano and more fully with the role, and then 'Dio mi potevi scagliar' was moving. In Act 4 he was tremendous. He sang softly, tenderly, as well as loudly. Most of my Otellos have been burly-voiced, thick-toned, sometimes raw and sometimes heavily covered in their forceful outbursts. Pavarotti represents a return to the lyrical tenor of exceptional, apparently limitless, power, with free, forward emission and words out on the lips. Onstage, he might be grotesque; in this concert, I admired him more than I have for years. Dame Kiri, too. I never thought to write that her utterance of words would be in itself a keen, piercing pleasure. But so it was in the Willow Song and the Ave Maria. Each consonant and vowel was beautiful. She made her New York debut as Desdemona 17 years ago. In Act 1, I thought that over the years her tone had hardened somewhat, and that her lovely middle voice had paled somewhat. But she got better and better. The dramatic fire that we admired in her student days, at the London Opera Centre, and the vocal radiance through the full range returned. The Willow Song and Ave Maria provided one of those adventures that listeners remember all their lives: a house rapt, silent and spellbound; the soprano, the conductor, the cor anglais, the flutes mutually inspired and inspiring; the whole a revelation of why music matters. Nucci may be vocally hit-or-miss now, but he is not a dull interpreter; he always brings the text to life, and his Iago, despite some dubious intonation, was lively and trenchant. Elzbieta Ardam seemed a nice steady Emilia until in Act 4 she began to shout. Anthony Rolfe-Johnson made his New York mark as a sharp-cut Cassio, but made it by singing sometimes louder than necessary. I nearly skipped this Otello: in another hall, another Hungarian artist, Adrienne Csengery, was making her New York debut, in Kurtag. I'm glad I went to the Otello. It's a performance I'll not forget. Solti conducts it again tonight in Carnegie - his last performance as musical director of the Chicago Symphony, and a glorious crown to his 22 years in the post.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Oil refinery in Aden bombed by northerners Northern Yemeni warplanes yesterday bombed Aden's oil refinery, setting a storage tank on fire. Rival forces exchanged rocket and tank fire at battlefronts around the city before the expected arrival in Yemen of a United Nations envoy, Reuter reports from Aden. 'As part of a dangerous escalation in the war, and in a flagrant violation of mediation by the international community, Aden's refinery was bombed by  . northern warplanes, setting fire in one of the storage tanks,' said a southern statement. It added that southern anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the raiding aircraft. The refinery, in the Little Aden suburb about 12 miles from the centre of Aden, has been a constant target of northern aircraft. Refinery officials put production at 70,000 barrels per day, down from about 110,000 bpd at the start of the war. Southern officials had warned that, if the refinery or the nearby power plant were hit, the south would retaliate by attack vital northern installations.</p>

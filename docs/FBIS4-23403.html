			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Cuito] </F>   [Text] The political and military situation has remained  unchanged in Cuito over the past few hours. Hand-to-hand combat  continues. National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola's [UNITA] rebels continue to pitilessly shell the  martyred city of Cuito. In response, government forces continue  to inflict heavy losses on Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, which has  already lost more than 100 men. The clashes have been  intensifying day by day and it is still not yet known when peace  will return to Cuito.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY SUGGESTS SELF-PROTECTION AGAINST AIDS  </P> <P> A USC study suggests the responsibility of "safe sex" rests with the individual  and that one cannot count on a sexual partner for protection against infection  with the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> The federally funded study, presented Friday at the annual meeting of the  American Psychological Assn., found that of 90 men and women known to be  infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, half had continued to have sex.  </P> <P> Of those, 17 men, or 19% of the total group, continued to have sex without  informing one or more of their partners that they were infected. By contrast,  all of the women who continued to have sex informed their partners, according  to their responses in confidential questionnaires.  </P> <P> "The findings support the idea that individuals must assume responsibility for  protecting themselves from HIV infection," said Gary Marks, an assistant  professor of preventive medicine at the USC School of Medicine and an author of  the study. "Others cannot be depended upon to behave in a socially protective  manner."  </P> <P> The researchers did not analyze the specific sexual practices of the 76 men and  14 women in the study. But generally, they said, sex occurred both with and  without condoms and included activities such as anal intercourse, considered  especially risky in terms of spreading the virus.  </P> <P> The other findings included the following:  </P> <P> * Those who withheld the fact of their infection were on average slightly  younger and less educated than their more forthcoming counterparts. They tended  to have fewer physical symptoms and to have been diagnosed for a longer period  of time, the study found.  </P> <P> * Men and women were more likely to reveal their diagnosis to others if those  people knew of the infected person's sexual preference. Less than 10% of the  gay and bisexual men in the study disclosed their diagnosis to friends, parents  or employers unaware of their orientation.  </P> <P> * Whether a person revealed their diagnosis depended on how serious they  considered the consequences of the revelation to be. However, the actual  consequences of disclosing the information were often less serious than the  infected person believed.  </P></p>

Speaking to theologians in a mosque here Wednesday night, he  said "despite all efforts launched by the U.S. to conspire  against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iran's policies formulated  by the late Imam Khomeyni are successfully going ahead."    Rowhani who is the chief of Majles Foreign Policy Committee  and the leader's representative at SNSC, said the United States  has suffered defeat in post-Soviet era in international and  regional arena and after the admission by Russia that they have  failed in their plans.    He said the hard efforts of the U.S. to persuade Europe and  Japan not to cooperate with Iran in economic and commercial  areas have failed. He deplored the U.S. for raising a ballyhoo  on Iran's foreign debts by giving unrealistic figures which he  said had failed to reach anywhere.    Answering a question on Iran's relations with the  neighbouring countries, Rowhani said ties with Turkey are  satisfactory. In light of national and security issues, Turkey  has no other way but to maintain growing relations with Iran and  "we welcome friendly relations with Ankara."    On relations with Iraq, he said if grounds are provided for  Iraq in the international arena, Baghdad would be willing to  consolidate ties with Tehran. However, he added, it was Iran's  natural right to respond severely to the armed attempts by  counterrevolutionary groups outside the borders.    On ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states, he said Iran  employed logical ways is to settle its problems with these  states in order to foil U.S. attempts to bring discord into the  Persian Gulf.    He described Iran's relations with Pakistan as excellent and  on Afghanistan, he said Iran was the only mediator in the  conflict. He said the prospect of relations with Afghanistan  was promising.    On the fall in oil prices, he said lower oil prices can  prompt a new mechanism to cut off dependence on oil and pave the  way for economic growth through non-oil exports.    Rowhani said Iran's non-oil exports reached dlrs. 5,000  million [figure as received] this year. The figure is expected  to reach dlrs. [dollars] 6,000 million next year, he said.    He put emphasis on Iran's relations with Saudi Arabia and  said issues including oil, presence of foreign forces in the  Persian Gulf, and Hajj pilgrimage entitled Tehran to strengthen  mutual relations with Riyadh.</p>

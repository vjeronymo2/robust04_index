			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Arts: Democracy in the Deep South If the result of the American civil war, or the war between the states, as people in the south still call it, had gone another way, the history of the world after 1865 or thereabouts would have been quite different. How different, in what ways and whether for good or ill, no-one can tell. But if you think about the question for a moment, you will realise that the proposition is true: the preservation of the American union was a decisive historical event. It was also one of the most brutal campaigns ever fought, mixing new technology in the north with older notions of valour and chivalry in the south. There were more recorded casualties than in any previous war. That is part of the background to the new piece at the Bush by the Canadian writer, John Murrell. Democracy is one of the most cerebral plays you are likely to see. It consists largely of a dialogue between Ralph Waldo Emerson, the thinker, and Walt Whitman, the poet: the rationalist opposed to the romantic. The exchanges take place near Washington as the battle rages in Gettysburg in 1863. Murrell writes beautifully. Emerson has a speech about war which goes on so long that it must qualify for the Guinness Book of Records in the theatre. Spoken by Hugh Ross, it remains riveting throughout. Describing the aftermath of the conflict, he relates: 'Some of the boys coming home from Gettysburg didn't even seem to recognise the name of the great battle that they had fought.' When he says: 'It was hell, Walt. It was hell itself', there is not even the faintest suggestion that such words could be a cliche. This is an immaculate performance by Ross. The other star in Democracy is Robert Jones, who designed the set. When you enter the theatre, the stage is concealed behind billowing red curtains. They disappear to reveal a set of woods and wet grasses so naturalistic that some of the audience started to show symptoms of hay fever. This is the romanticism behind the war. Whitman has given shelter by his pond to two young drop-outs from the conflict, one a southern deserter, the other a dying soldier from the north. They talk, sing and achieve a kind of harmony while the main business remains between Whitman and Emerson. Democracy is not a play that I would recommend to all-comers. There is too much shouting in the first act. It could be said to have more than a share of north American sentimentality: too much of the fondness for the pond. The nature of the dialogue is not the most obvious subject for the theatre. Yet under John Dove's direction I admired it enormously, and enjoyed it. Bush Theatre. (081) 743 3388</p>

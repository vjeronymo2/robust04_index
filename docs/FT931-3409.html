			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Astra makes sweeping changes ASTRA International, the Indonesian motor company, has made sweeping boardroom changes prior to announcing its 1992 results which, brokers say, will show a 59 per cent fall in net profits to Rp87bn (Dollars 42m). The changes follow the forced sale in January by the Soeryadjaya family, Astra's founders, of their majority stake in the company. Three of four family members have left the board, including Mr Edwin Soeryadjaya, formerly vice-president. Mr Oskar Surjaatmadja, a former director-general of the ministry of finance and currently chairman of the Jakarta stock exchange, has been appointed president commissioner, equivalent to company chairman. Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who led the consortium which bought into the Soeryadjaya stake, has become vice-president commissioner, while his close business colleague, Mr Henry Pribadi, has been made commissioner. The senior management responsible for the company's day-to-day affairs remains largely unchanged, quelling investors' fears that the sale by the Soeryadjayas could prompt an exodus of top personnel. The Soeryadjayas still own, directly or through nominee companies, more than 13 per cent of Astra but are expected further to reduce their stake to repay debts associated with their privately-owned Bank Summa, which collapsed in December owing Rp1,600bn. Liquidators, led by the central bank, have currently agreed to repay large clients half their deposits. They hope to raise further finance by selling off the Soeryadjayas' extensive property interests. Astra has yet officially to announce its 1992 figures, but brokers have been privately informed that net profits slumped to Rp87bn from Rp210bn in 1991. The company's vehicle sales fell 32 per cent to 97,239 units, although it increased market share year-on-year to 56.5 per cent from 54 per cent. The net profits are higher than brokers' forecasts, reflecting a recovery in the last quarter. Nevertheless, some new shareholders are reportedly keen to restructure Astra and possibly dispose of non-core businesses, which include timber, palm oil plantation and telecommunications subsidiaries.</p>

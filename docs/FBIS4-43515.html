			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- On the occasion of the 41st  anniversary of the popular uprising in the German Democratic  Republic [GDR], Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed to all  German democrats "resolutely to oppose the enemies of freedom."  Anyone playing down the Socialist Unity Party of Germany regime  today was jeopardizing the "fundamental antitotalitarian  consensus" in Germany, Kohl said in Bonn today. The same  applied to those who sought to suppress the crimes of the  national-socialist tyranny. Kohl added: "Left-wing and  right-wing radicalism is shameful for our country."    The chancellor emphasized that remembering the popular  uprising in the GDR of 17 June 1953 remained topical even after  German unification. It united all democrats in the belief that  there should never be another dictatorship. History has proved  those right who at the time had "worked courageously and  selflessly for freedom and German unity." Kohl recalled that  the peaceful uprising in Berlin, Jena, and many other industrial  centres of the former GDR was "brutally put down by the  communist power apparatus."</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Intervention fails the franc THE French franc again came under strong pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, forcing the Bank of France to support the currency through repeated intervention, writes James Blitz. In early morning trading in Europe, the franc fell through the FFr3.40 level, a little more than 3 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.4330. It later closed at FFr3.399 from a previous FFr3.395. Yesterday's intervention by the French central bank was covert, and dealers were uncertain as to its size. One London-based analyst suggested that the French authorities had spent around Dollars 10bn supporting the currency in recent days, which would constitute a sizeable chunk of reserves. But others dubbed this an exaggeration. Given the state of the recession in France, the authorities would find it hard to defend the currency by raising interest rates, and may have held back their reserves for another day. There were differences of opinion over what kind of selling of francs was taking place. A commonly held view was that much of the selling was coming from French companies rather than international players, such as the US hedge funds. Others suspected that the selling was short-term and speculative. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, said it was hard to take the flight out of francs and into D-Marks seriously, given the German currency's significant overvaluation in Europe. 'This buying of D-Marks somehow seems artificial,' he said. There was little doubt that the franc would come under more pressure next week unless the Bundesbank eased pressure on the franc by easing monetary policy. One London-based analyst said that a cut in the Lombard rate at next week's Bundesbank council meeting could pacify the markets. Others said that another salami-sized cut in interest rates from the Bundesbank would be ignored by the markets. The pressure on the franc was at the centre of another flight into the German currency and assets which pushed down the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta and the Swedish krona. A notable victim yesterday was the Danish krone, which fell from DKr3.8550 early in London trading to close at around DKr3.8650. The dollar rallied sharply against the D-Mark, helped by expectations that the Bundesbank would ease policy and next week and the 'safe haven' status it enjoys at times of crisis. The US currency closed more than 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM1.7210.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Accord Reached in Opera Strike: A tentative agreement was announced Wednesday  in the eight-week musicians strike that canceled the New York City Opera's fall  season. Terms of the agreement reached late Tuesday were withheld pending a  ratification vote, probably this weekend. The strike began Sept. 13, which was  to have been opening night of a 70-performance season. After making progress in  negotiations last week, the company announced that it was going ahead with  plans for its spring season of musicals. The opera's 69 orchestra members went  on strike over wages and the number of guaranteed weeks of work per year.ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

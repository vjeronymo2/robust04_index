			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A runaway commuter train barreled through the Bavarian countryside for 12 1/2  miles after the engineer left it unattended to go to the bathroom, but forgot  to set the brake, officials said. The train, which had no passengers at the  time, finally was intentionally derailed. No one was hurt as the train traveled  from Ebersberg to Wasserburg in upper Bavaria, roaring through 20 regular  passenger stops during its 20-minute run, averaging 37 m.p.h., police added.  The train was at the end of its usual commuter run.  </P></p>

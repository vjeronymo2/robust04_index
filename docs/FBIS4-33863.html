			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The national government has rejected the comments  made in Iran against Alirio Parra, our candidate for the post of  OPEC secretary general. According to reports from this Middle  East nation, the Iranians will not vote for Parra because he  allegedly is close to the Saudi (Ahmad Laki Jammani), who is an  adviser in his Economic Investigation Center. The Iranian  source added that this country will present its own candidate,  Kazem Pur Ardebili, at the next OPEC elections. The communique  issued by the national government regretted speculations about  the former energy and mines minister and added that Alirio Parra  has the support of 11 of the 12 OPEC member countries.</p>

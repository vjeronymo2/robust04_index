			<p>BFN     [Text] Subrata, director general of press development and  graphics, told newsmen in Jakarta this afternoon that the  government has decided to withdraw the publication permits of  two magazines -- TEMPO and EDITOR -- and a tabloid paper, DETIK.    He said the government arrived at this decision after  listening to advice from the Press Council. He also said that  the publications had been repeatedly reminded about their  contents, but the government's directives went unheeded.    According to Subrata, the publications' operational licenses  were withdrawn because of two categories of cases -- an  administrative reason and the content of news reports. EDITOR  magazine was banned due to an administrative reason under the  Information Minister's Decision Letter No. 124/1994 and DETIK  tabloid was banned under the Information Minister's Decision  Letter No. 125/1994. TEMPO magazine was banned for its news  reports under Information Minister's Decision Letter No.  123/1994.    The three Minister of Information's Decision letters banning  the publications are effective as of today, 21 June 1994.</p>

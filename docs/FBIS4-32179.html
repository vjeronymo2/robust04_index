			<p>BFN     [Text] Zemplinska Sirava, East Slovakia, June 18 (CTK) --  The coalition National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS) of  Ludovit Cernak will run in autumn elections on the slate of  Premier Jozef Moravcik's Democratic Union (DU), Cernak told CTK  today. The decision was made at today's meeting of the NDS  Central Council. Cernak had been chairman of the nationalist  Slovak National Party (SNS), from which he was expelled in  February "for consistent gross violation of the statutes."    Cernak said that the offers made to his party by the DU and  the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) of Jan Carnogursky were  equal. The NDS has opted for Moravcik's party because the DU's  major priority is the creation of a centre bloc, he added. The  KDH is clearly right-orientated.    Another reason were, Cernak said, the results of public  opinion polls which had shown that the membership and voters of  the two parties were "compatible." According to the latest  poll, the DU has a 6 per cent voter support, while the NDS would  not cross the 5-per cent parliamentary border.    Cernak said that the final decision on the participation of  his party on the DU slate would be made by the DU National  Council next week. The elections are scheduled to take place on  September 30-October 1.</p>

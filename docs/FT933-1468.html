			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel active A broker's recommendation and profits upgrade for British Steel made it the day's most actively traded stock as turnover soared to 20m and the shares improved 2 to 114 1/2 p. The stock was also heavily traded in the traded options sector, with the equivalent of a further 6.3m shares dealt. Maintaining its current year estimate at Pounds 70m, BZW lifted its prediction for the year to March 1995 by Pounds 50m to Pounds 250m. The securities house said the revised forecast is based on current steel prices excluding the September 1993 price initiative. It added that a further 5 per cent increase in steel prices would lead to a raising of its estimate to Pounds 450m. Urging investors to buy the shares, the engineering team at BZW said: 'Now that the European steel restructuring plan appears to be achieving its objective, the focus of attention will shift to the fundamentals surrounding British Steel's valuation.' The demand for British Steel also boosted sentiment in ASW Holdings, which moved forward 12 to 208p. Bathroom manufacturer Spring Ram was one of the best performers in the London market yesterday. In spite of announcing boardroom resignations - including the departure of Mr Bill Rooney, the founder and chief executive - and a loss of Pounds 36.4m for the first half, Spring Ram forged ahead 7 1/2 to 68p. The market felt that the risks to the company had been minimised following the shake-out by the new chairman. Pharmaceuticals group UniChem climbed 6 to 247p after announcing a rise in half-year profits to Pounds 17.99m from a previous Pounds 12.56m. Vodafone hardened 2 to 494p after the group introduced a new tariff to its MetroDigital service, enabling calls to be made more cheaply from a specified location. Cable and Wireless, which owns Vodafone's competitor Mercury Communications, shed 2 to 853p. Mercury is already offering free off-peak local calls through its one-2-one digital mobile phone venture. The market was cheered by bumper profits from Next. The shares firmed 4 1/2 to 208 1/2 p as several brokers upgraded full year profits expectations. They included BZW, which raised its forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 70m. However, one analyst said: 'I think the share price rise was muted because of worries about future growth given that productivity levels are already so high.' Sears firmed 3 to 118p ahead of interim figures due for release next Tuesday. Some brewers were affected by concern over a potential US tax on alcohol alongside possible tobacco taxes. Grand Metropolitan fell 7 to 414p, and Guinness eased a penny to 459p ahead of first-half figures expected today. Northern Foods succumbed to cautious comments from analysts on a two-day visit to the company. Several were reported to have been examining their figures with a view to downgrading profits expectations. The shares retreated 9 to 257p in volume of 3.6m. Food retailers remained under a cloud following Tesco's disappointing figures on Tuesday. Tesco shares eased 3 to 209p as further comment on its decline in margins was made, while J. Sainsbury lost 10 to 440p in sympathy. Dealers were more positive about Wm Morrison Supermarkets ahead of today's interim figures and the shares appreciated 5 to 129p. Media-based conglomerate Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, climbed 12 to 528p as SG Warburg reiterated its buy recommendation. Thorn EMI slipped after a US newspaper article talked of difficulties at Thorn's Rent-A-Center business in the US. The shares fell 23 to 965p in early trading as copies of the article were circulated in London. Nerves steadied later and the stock rallied to close a net 11 off at 977p, following above-average volume of 3.2m. Earlier this month, investors were unsettled by news of the disappointing performance in the group's defence business. Shares in GKN shed 3 to 492p after NatWest Securities trimmed its current year profits forecast. The securities house reduced its estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 110m to take account of difficult trading conditions at United Engineering Steels, in which it has a 39 per cent stake. Dealers were also concerned that there had been no confirmation of an order from Saudi Arabia for around 200 Piranha armoured vehicles that has been widely reported. Belief that September car sales in the UK might be lower than predicted weakened several motor stocks. Casualties included Lex Service, down 7 to 399p, T Cowie 3 to 243p, and Pendragon 5 to 265p. Engineering group Spirax-Sarco fell 10 to 362p, after a cautious results meeting. Interim profits improved from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.4m in line with market expectations and one researcher said: 'it remains one of the best quality stocks in the capital goods sector.' A broker's visit to the materials technology arm of Johnson Matthey to see the benefits of recent restructuring helped the shares rise 4 to 460p. Other statistics, Page 26</p>

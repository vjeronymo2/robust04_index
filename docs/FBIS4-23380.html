			<p>BFN     [Text] A demonstration in the Afar District of Arhiba was  violently repressed by police this morning, who used tear gas  and real bullets. According to medical sources, two people are  believed to have been killed, and several are reported to have  been wounded. The demonstrators are protesting against the  police, who for several days now have been destroying wooden  houses sheltering people displaced by war. About 10 days ago,  similar clashes led to the deaths of two people.</p>

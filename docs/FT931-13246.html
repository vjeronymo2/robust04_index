			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Economics: Markets focus on latest indicators for signs of renewed UK activity AFTER A week of worryingly bleak indicators on the UK economy, today's M4 lending figures and Confederation of British Industry manufacturing trends survey will be scrutinised all the more carefully for signs that consumer and business activity is stirring. M0, mainly notes and coins in circulation, has shown a strong rise for two consecutive months, but M4 bank lending - bank and building society lending  -fell by Pounds 600m in November. Most economists are forecasting only a moderate rise in December. 'It seems that underlying demand from both the personal and corporate sectors remains hesitant, though we expect some pick up in response to the lower interest rates over the next six months,' said Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London. The CBI survey will give an indication of business sentiment, activity and pricing intentions. Many economists are expecting a more optimistic survey than the last quarterly analysis which was carried out before most of the latest base rate cuts. This week also sees the last of the current series of UK trade figures. After Thursday there will be no more data for intra-EC trade until June while a new system, in line with the single market, is introduced. The black-out will be imposed on a sad state of affairs. The visible trade deficit in November was a worse-than-expected Pounds 1.4bn, with the value of imports up by more than the increase in exports. That took the cumulative trade deficit for the first 11 months of last year to Pounds 12bn. Here are some of the week's other economic highlights. The figures in brackets, from MMS International, are the median of economists' forecasts.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Klondikers' depress fish prices FACTORY SHIPS from the former Soviet Union are being accused by Scottish fishermen of depressing the markets for pelagic fish such as herring and mackerel in the North Sea by selling fish at below market prices to obtain foreign currency. The factory ships, known as klondikers because of the cash which they normally pay out for fish to Western European fishermen, are having to sell off part of their cargoes of herring and mackerel to buy fuel and provisions in North Sea ports. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the introduction of a market economy, the factory ships, although setting off from home with enough foreign currency to buy fish, are having to fend for themselves in meeting other needs. Mr Jim Slater, chairman of the Scottish Pelagic Fishermens Association, says that the problem is emerging in Germany, the main market for pelagic fish (which are free-swimming as opposed to bottom-feeding). 'It is not yet happening on a massive scale but the consequences for our industry could be frightening,' he says. Scottish fishermen alone sold about 150,000 tonnes of pelagic fish to Soviet and other eastern European factory ships in 1990. About 40 klondikers were in Scottish waters before last Christmas and about 25 are there now, he said. 'The Russian people are not getting all the fish they need and our market is being depressed,' he said. Mr Slater wants fish supplies to be included in the European Community's programme of food aid to the former Soviet Union or to be covered by export guarantees. If fish were part of the food aid programme the agents who handle fish sales would be able to accept roubles with the certainty of being paid back and the factory ships would need less foreign currency. At present the agents refuse to accept roubles. Scottish fishermen claim that one ex-Soviet ship at present in Denmark is in the process of selling off its entire cargo of 2,000 tonnes of frozen fish.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP FACES: THE JUNGLE BROTHERS ADDRESS GROOVY TOPICS  </P> <P> The Jungle Brothers are leaders of the Positive Rap movement -- a bouillabaisse  of peace and love and learned Afrocentricity built around a musical eclecticism  that includes sampled disco, calypso, Archie Shepp -- anything but the James  Brown stuff you'll find on any other hip-hop record. It's all blended smooth,  like they wish the world would be.  </P> <P> "We unite the music, and people like it," says Jungle Brother Mike G., putting  his feet up on a table in a record-company conference room in Burbank. "So why  can't we unite the people too?"  </P> <P> Their confederates, a quasi-formal New York hip-hop community the JBs call "The  Tribe," include rap stars De La Soul, Queen Latifah and Tribe Called Quest, all  known for positive outlooks and dance-floor jams.  </P> <P> The JBs, whose debut "Straight Out the Jungle," on the tiny Idler label, was  the underground rap smash of '88, were the first of The Tribe to break big.  Ironically, their hard-core attitude and street-savvy beats influenced the  gangster rap of N.W.A no less than it did the good-vibin' De La Soul.  </P> <P> "Hip-hop reflects life," says group leader Afrika Baby Bambaataa, "and there  are enough negative things out there to support an N.W.A or a Too ort. Police  are doing what they do; some brothers, unfortunately, are doing what they do.  We're trying to provide a balance to that."  </P> <P> On their major-label debut, "Done By the Forces of Nature" on Warner Bros., the  Jungle Brothers address such groovy topics as sunshine, mother nature, black  beauty, and the concept of AfriKa. Any coincidence between the JBs' music and  the early cosmic meanderings of funkmeister George Clinton is purely  intentional.  </P> <P> "We see De La Soul as the Parliament to our Funkadelic," Afrika says, "where  one group is commercial and the other -- us -- is down and funky. De La and us  are both known for the same things. We were all born in the '70s, and we think  the same way."  </P> <P> "Yeah," concurs Mike G. "The city's the jungle and we're the brothers."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia June 13 (CTK) -- Vladimir  Meciar is very disappointed that he has not succeeded in  corrupting the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and is currently  seeking to corrupt the election left coalition, SDL Chairman  Peter Weiss says in the daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD today. Meciar's  people pay visits to Slovak Social Democratic Party Democratic  (SDSS) [as received] leaders and try to create an impression  among the general public that the Green Party is also breaking  down because its leadership has entered into a coalition with  the SDL, Weiss says, adding that these are "rumours."    The isolation of Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS), and not only internationally but currently also  on the internal political scene is growing, Weiss says. "HZDS  leader has done everything in human strength to insult the other  politicians, other political parties. He has interfered in  their internal affairs and has thus broken down the basis for  serious cooperation," Weiss says. "Our problem is not our  relation towards the HZDS and least so towards the person of the  HZDS chairman but rather our relationship with the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH), Weiss says. He stressed that the KDH  unlike the HZDS is a transparent partner with whom the SDL has  managed to come to an agreement on fundamental principles such  as respecting democratic principles, the stability of the  constitutional system and further steps in the economic reform  process. "We do not cherish illusions about the KDH since it is  a right-orientated party while we are a left-wing one. But we  both are capable of respecting each other and of complying with  agreements," Weiss says.</p>

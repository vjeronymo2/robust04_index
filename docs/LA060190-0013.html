			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: NURSING AND ALCOHOL  </P> <P> Question: There's been a lot of information in newspapers and magazines and on  television about the harm that can be done to the baby if a pregnant woman  drinks.  </P> <P> But I don't remember reading anything about what might happen to the baby if a  nursing mother drinks. Could this have a harmful effect on the baby?  </P> <P> Answer: As is true in the case of pregnant women, the safest course of action  for nursing mothers is not to drink at all. Obviously, alcohol that has not  been consumed cannot affect the baby. However, there is some evidence to  suggest that no more than one alcoholic drink a day is permissible for nursing  mothers.  </P></p>

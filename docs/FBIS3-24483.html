Pisarzhevskiy, Kiev; UDC541.6+543.42+547.024]    [Abstract] The spin density wave (polaron) related to  charge transfer along the chain of conjugated -bonds of an  electrically conductive polymer causes polarization of spin  states. One approach to the study of these processes may be  based on the utilization of a model polymer containing  paramagnetic dopants. In the present work a study was made of  the possibility of preparing and the properties of polypyrrole  doped with tetracyanoethylene anion-radicals. A broadening in  the EPR spectral line after introduction of the anion-radical  was observed. This could have been caused by a slow spin-spin  exchange between the radical and the polar polymer chain. Figure  1; references 6 (Western).</p>

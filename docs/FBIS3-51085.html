			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Defense Minister-designate Edmundo Perez Yoma  stated on 26 December that the reform of the constitutional  article that establishes the unremovability of the Armed Forces  commander in chief is not a priority.    Perez Yoma made this remark to a television station.    He indicated that it is a question of principles because the  coalition [Coalition of Parties for Democracy] believes the  Armed Forces' leadership must be subordinate to civilian  authorities. But he stated that this type of reform needs a  broad consensus, and therefore he believes there will be no  action on the topic in the short term.    Perez Yoma said the topic "is neither first nor a priority,"  although he expressed his hope that "we can convince the rest of  the Chilean people and the Armed Forces" that the power to  remove the commander in chief must be returned to the president.

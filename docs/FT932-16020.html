			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Bank of France may announce interest rate cuts FRENCH franc money market rates continued to fall sharply yesterday amid expectations that the Bank of France might cut its official interest rates today. The cost of borrowing French francs for three months eased from about 9.5 per cent at the start of the day to around 9 per cent by the close of trading in London. Dealers said this was the lowest level at which 3-month French franc interest rates had been since November of last year. The fall in French money market rates came in spite of a smaller reduction than had been expected in the cost of borrowing wholesale funds from the Bundesbank. The German central bank announced yesterday that the lowest accepted repo rate for 14 days was at 8.13 per cent, and that it was at 8.15 per cent for 35-day funds. The market had been expecting the repo rate to be cut down to 8.10 per cent or even lower. Despite the smaller-than-expected cut, the French franc continued to strengthen against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.3834 in London from a previous FFr3.3840. Both the Belgian and Dutch central banks announced small cuts in their official rates in the wake of the move by the Bundesbank. Belgium's central bank cut its central money market rate to 7.9 per cent from 8 per cent, and the Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to the same level. The reduction in French money market rates brought the spread between 3-month French francs and 3-month D-Marks down to around 1.2 percentage points yesterday. It had been as high as 4 percentage points at the peak of the last two attacks on the French currency.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Turnaround at the table: Recession is hitting restaurants Had he not been born into a family of hoteliers, Rocco Forte, chief executive of Forte plc, would have made a very successful football manager. That is the conclusion many observers of the hotel and leisure industry, now one of the country's biggest employers, must draw after his two recent signings. Forte has just recruited Bob Payton, one of the most innovative restaurateurs of the 1980s, to take over the company's aesthetically stunning, but, until now, gastronomically unexciting, Criterion Brasserie in Piccadilly Circus. And on August 3, Nico Ladenis will relinquish his two Michelin stars and take over the stoves in the restaurant at Forte's flagship hotel, the Grosvenor House, to be renamed Nico at Ninety. Forte's acumen may eventually be proved to be beyond reproach although there is no doubt that both developments carry a considerable risk. But what his competitors are finding hard to digest are the commercial implications - why have two of the industry's strongest individuals pledged their futures to the leviathan of the industry? Ladenis and Payton made their names in an industry that has always welcomed the small entrepreneur. They started in the res-taurant trade more than 10 years ago at a time when few other businesses required such a small capital investment and unsoph-isticated means of production. And for financial reasons, and tax benefits, you could keep it in the family too. The business became more complicated with the introduction of VAT: the advent of the Inland Revenue's detailed scrutiny of service charges and the use of part-time staff, and the widespread disappearance of cash and its replacement by the ubiquitous credit card. Costs also rose - rents, the business rate and wages - and the 1990 Food Safety Act demanded a considerable level of sophistication and technology. But there were compensations. Everyone has to eat (a fact that causes considerable envy among the restaurant trade's sister, the drinks business) and eating out became a growth industry. For the well-situated restaurant there were two bites at the cherry every day: business-oriented lunches and social dinners. One of the maxims of the restaurant trade during the 1980s was that if you could secure satisfied customers paying with corporate credit cards at lunch, they would come back in the evening and spend their own money. For most of the 1980s, restaurateurs made substantial profits. But the trade is so open and competition so fierce - for the most attractive plates, the plushest chairs, the heaviest crystal glassware - that they were quickly spent. Chefs even tried to outdo each other behind the scenes. One restaurant opened in London's West End late last year with a range of ovens that cost Pounds 100,000. There was little left for the rainy days. The clouds burst in the late 1980s with the stock market crash and recession. Financial controllers put the squeeze on corporate spending, lunchtime bookings disappeared and as, personal disposable in-comes were cut, so were the restaurants' evening takings. The consequence, for the past two years, has been gloom and doom in the restaurant trade. Many have closed permanently; some have changed identity and reopened as brasseries, bistros or trattorias. Many have signed up with American Express in an attempt to improve their marketing - a strategy that five years ago would generally have been regarded as unnecessary. In three months this year, American Express signed up 722 new restaurant customers including a couple of two-star Michelin restaurants. And yet, in spite of the recession, many restaurants are busier than ever. This apparent paradox hides a significant shift in our attitude to eating out. The reliance during the 1980s on the corporate credit card is today a liability. What today's successful restaurants are doing is appealing to those who are spending their own money and are doing so with a discrimination not previously associated with the British diner. Those who enjoy eating out also seem to be combining an eye for economy with continued culinary pleasure. Industry estimates suggest that a household which would previously have allowed Pounds 100 per month for two evenings out has now decided to save 20 per cent and spend only Pounds 80. But they are simultaneously trading up and to make it a memorable occasion are spending the total on one dinner. This economy brings with it a natural conservatism. Rather than face disappointment elsewhere, many are choosing to re-turn frequently to their fav-ourite restaurant. Once a res-taurant has captured such customers the rewards can be significant. A considerable proportion of the restaurants which have opened in London in the past six months have already achieved this - Belgo, L'Accento, Stephen Bull's Bistro, The Square and Snows on the Green. Forte, and his shareholders, will be hoping that Ladenis and Payton will quickly achieve the same success.</p>

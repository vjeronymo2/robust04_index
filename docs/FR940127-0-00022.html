			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC has no intention of imposing this cost on banks that would prefer not to incur it. Thus, the FDIC wishes to reiterate that, at each bank's option, assets, including multifamily housing loans, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items that are eligible to be assigned to a risk weight category lower than 100 percent may be included in a higher risk weight category (e.g., the 100 percent risk weight category) than the category to which the assets or credit equivalent amounts are otherwise eligible to be assigned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Loss Sharing Arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment letters from two respondents addressed the treatment of loss sharing arrangements in connection with the sale of multifamily housing loans that was contained in the proposed rule. Both commenters agreed with the proposal's approach for handling a pro rata loss sharing arrangement (i.e., for the selling bank to treat the transfer as a sale to the extent that the purchaser shares with the seller on pro rata basis in any loss incurred), but took exception to the proposed treatment of other loss sharing arrangements. Under the proposal, other loss sharing arrangements were to be taken into account for purposes of determining the extent to which multifamily housing loans are treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under the risk-based capital framework in the same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the Call Report instructions. Hence, multifamily housing loans sold subject to loss sharing arrangements on other than a pro rata basis would treat such loans as sold for risk-based capital purposes only if the selling bank retains no risk of loss from the loans transferred resulting from any cause and has no obligation to any party for the payment of principal or interest on the loans transferred resulting from any cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter indicated that, in lieu of the proposed treatment for other loss sharing arrangements, the selling institution ``should retain capital in proportion to the risk retained but not for the whole loan.'' The other commenter who addressed loss sharing arrangements stated that the proposed treatment of other loss sharing arrangements does not ``provide an accurate measure of risk exposure or appropriately tailored incentives,'' ``may discourage lenders from limiting their recourse obligation,'' and is ``inconsistent with the statutory requirement.'' This commenter recommended that the FDIC ``adopt rules that distinguish different loss risks for non-pro rata arrangements, rather than the existing rule in the Call Reports'' and offered suggested approaches for doing so. This commenter also acknowledged that the regulatory capital treatment of asset sales subject to loss sharing arrangements is an issue that goes beyond multifamily housing loans and requires a comprehensive solution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

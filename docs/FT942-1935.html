			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Major under pressure to bring forward cabinet reshuffle Mr Kenneth Clarke emerged last night at the centre of a cabinet struggle over the shape of the government's legislative programme as Mr John Major faced pressure to bring forward from mid-July his planned cabinet reshuffle. Warnings from ministers that Whitehall decision-making has been paralysed by uncertainty over the reshuffle prompted speculation at Westminster that Mr Major might move to reshape the government as early as next week. Senior officials said mid-July - closer to the summer parliamentary recess - was still the favoured option. But they refused to rule out entirely the possibility that it might be sooner. Ministers said the uncertainty had added further confusion to the struggle within the cabinet between so-called consolidators and radicals over the legislative programme for next year. Mr Clarke, the chancellor, is waging a battle against the consolidators' attempts to limit the number of contentious bills in the Queen's Speech. Apart from giving determined backing to Mr Michael Heseltine's plans to privatise the Royal Mail, Mr Clarke is pressing for a further raft of privatisation measures. The industrial dispute at Railtrack has strengthened the Treasury's resolve to push the organisation into the private sector at the earliest possible opportunity. Mr Clarke is also pressing for legislation now to pave the way for the eventual introduction of electronic pricing of motorway journeys. Such charges could not be introduced until 1998 - but Mr Clarke believes early legislation would be an important positive signal of the government's resolve to control public spending and borrowing. Friends say his overall approach is based on the belief that the government's political fortunes can only be revived if it demonstrates it is 'firm and purposeful'. A clutch of privatisation and other economic measures - including the introduction of the Jobseeker's Allowance for the unemployed - would allow the government to make improved competitiveness the central theme of the Queen's Speech. But Mr Major has been joined by a series of other senior ministers in arguing for a much more cautious approach. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is among those pressing for the cabinet to put competence before ideology.</p>

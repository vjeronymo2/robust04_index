			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuri Lyashov: "Lithuania Extends Benefits to </F> Foreign Investors"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] The Seimas (parliament) and the government of the  Republic of Lithuania have adopted a package of legislative acts  regulating the sphere of foreign investments.    The attraction of foreign capital has been found to be a  boon  in Lithuania, and in the new legislative acts the republican  authorities envisage a number of benefits for foreign investors.  Thus, if a joint venture is instituted -- or investments are  carried out in any other way -- until the end of this year, then  part of the profit amounting to the share of the foreign  investor will for five years be levied with a tax decreased by  70 percent. True, on the condition that it has not been used for  the payment of wages. On the expiration of five years this tax  will for another three years be 50 percent less than usual.    If a JV is instituted or the investments of foreign capital  are made in the course of two subsequent years -- i.e., from  January 1, 1994, to December 31, 1995 -- the share of the  foreign investor's profit will for a whole six years be levied  with a tax diminished by 50 percent.    The dividends received by foreign investors in Lithuania  will  in general be tax free. Not liable to taxation will also be  their profits repatriated abroad. Moreover, it will be possible  to do this in the shape of goods and services purchased on the  domestic market.    Under Lithuania's laws, it is not only juridical but also  persons of other states, as well as persons without a  citizenship permanently residing abroad, that are recognized as  foreign investors. The latter category is granted the same  benefits, which may present an interest to some inhabitants of  the republics of the former USSR.    The decisions on the foreign investments of up to three  million dollars are taken by Lithuania's Ministry of the  Economy. For making investments in state enterprises enjoying a  monopoly position on the Lithuanian market there is already a  need to obtain a permission from the government. Considered to  be a monopoly owner is an enterprise manufacturing at least 50  percent of the products made in the republic, and the government  has even approved a list of enterprises whose controlling  interest can be purchased solely with its permission.    Enterprises run with the participation of foreign capital  and  instituted as joint-stock companies may be registered on the  list of Lithuania's enterprises solely after the payment by all  founders of initial fees to the tune of at least a quarter of  the nominal cost of the shares. The remaining fees must be paid  not later than in the two years after the registration date.    The term of the leasing of land by foreign investors may be  as long as 99 years with the priority right of its prolongation.  The size of the rent to be paid for the plot of land is not  liable to be changed throughout the term when the lease is in  force unless, of course, it envisages something different.    It is noteworthy that Lithuania's legislation envisages  guarantees for foreign investors. The loses sustained by them as  a result of actions by the republic's state managerial bodies  and officials must be fully compensated on the basis of the  international law norms. And the disputes on foreign investors'  rights or legitimate interests being violated may be considered  by the courts not only of the Lithuanian Republic, but also by  foreign or even international agencies.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (2): New ways to become lean and mean - Suddenly the phrase 'business process re-engineering' is on the lips of every computer industry pundit / Business process re-engineering IT SOUNDS innocuous, abstract even, but the term 'business processing re-engineering' (or BPR, for short) can mean losing your job. Unless, of course, you are a BPR consultant. Definition of the phrase varies, but many of the people who have been through the process seem to agree about two things. One is that they only discover the buzzword 'BPR' only after they have been through the process, and then recognise that business process re-engineering is a description of what they have done. The other definition - much more grim - is that business efficiency usually means making people redundant. 'Lean and mean' is a phrase that echoes from another decade, but it sums up the essence of BPR. Business process re-engineering really means re-examining an organisation and its operations. It is a matter of establishing what is at the core of the business, what makes a profit, what can be sacrificed. First, why do it? The conditions in which most businesses operate have changed, and the rate of change seems ever faster. Product cycles are shorter, margins are being cut, once faithful customers are offered with a wider range of choices. Once a business is up and running, people rarely think about how to change it because they are simply too busy running it. Doing more of the same is easier than accepting the need for change. So far, not a word about information technology - that is as it should be, because the process starts with the business, not the technology. But running a business more efficiently and with fewer resources inevitably involves technology. For all the organisations who volunteered their stories for this survey, getting the IT right was a large part of the equation. The role of IT can be in the actual organisation and administration of a company, where such tools as electronic mail, workflow systems and document image processing can make a difference. More often, the process is an intense self-examination which turns the spotlight outside the organisation itself to the needs of the customer. Several building societies are among organisations which have used BPR to effect. They are exemplary because of the changing pressures upon their particular market sector: competition with banks, the property recession, fierce competition, and a foray into estate agencies which has been a disastrous experiment for some. For them, as for insurance and banking companies, the computer system has become the essence of what they do. Flexibility, the need to adapt and keep adapting, is vital. The TSB recently carried out research which is having a fundamental effect on it business. It discovered that customers cared very little about the locality of branches, and were quite happy to have a wider range of services delivered by an 'impersonal' automatic telling machine (ATM). Pilot projects in Watford and Tyneside are already proving the point. Another project arising from the self-examination is a centralised customer database that will keep and relate all customer details. TSB wants contact with the customer at one point, so that customers do not get different communications from various sections of TSB concerning mortgage, insurance, savings, and so on. This will save form-filling, and enable TSB to offer services such as the single centralised 'financial health' statement. By relating products and people, it is already able to offer a Family Savings bonus, a unique offering according to TSB's marketing director Mike Sommers. Keeping costs down is one of the drivers of the project - 'it's a critical issue for all service companies to find a lower cost method of delivering a similar or better level of customer service,' says Mr Sommers. 'In fact,we can offer a better personal relationship at a lower cost by using technology, from its simplest applications - the telephone - right up to the sophisticated applications of expert systems.' Behind the message of efficiency and centralisation is another (less explicit) saving on manpower. At Bradford and Bingley, there has been an equal concern to respond quickly to changing opportunities in the marketplace. Bradford and Bingley has been through an re-engineering exercise with the help of Computer Sciences, whose management consultancy division CSC Index claims to have evolved the doctrine. The chairman of CSC Index is James Champy, joint author (with MIT professor Michael Hammer) of the book Re-engineering the Corporation. Champy is credited with having invented the phrase 'business re-engineering,' and has registered the term in the US. In a very similar exercise to TSB's, the project at Bradford and Bingley has been to provide a customer-based administration system, CBAS. The process of re-engineering started with the identification and analysis of 220 discrete business entities. These are brought together in a single database, with associated marketing and business applications, which now supports the core business of retail financial services with over 33 business processes and 390 separate functions. Index is sensitive to the 'human resource element' of re-engineering, known bluntly elsewhere as unemployment. Aware of the potentially disastrous effects on staff morale, it offers a special computer-lab for modelling the effects of the exercise on personnel, with the idea of avoiding trauma by redeployment wherever possible. Yet another term, 'enterprise engineering,' comes from the long-established industry pundit, Dr James Martin, chairman of James Martin and Co. 'Business re-engineering will only deliver its promises if it radically changes the organisation and all those who interact with it,' says Mr Martin. 'To do this, managers need to take a holistic view of an organisation - looking at strategy, process, technology and people - to create new ways to add value, improve quality, and ultimately gain customer satisfaction.' Software companies and consultancies have been quick to react by producing appropriate tools and methodologies. One system, now in use at insurance company Sun Alliance, is SES Workbench, a graphical tool for modelling business processes, from Scientific Engineering Software UK in Abingdon. It is used to model business projects and products in detail, including the software and hardw are underlying them, and they way they behave under different workloads. Even more specialised, software supplier JBA, a specialist in applications for the IBM AS400, has evolved a methodology called 'co-existent manufacturing.' This has evolved from customer-based systems in the food and drink industry, striving for more streamlined, same-day delivery. According to Susan Lock, international business development manager at JBS International, 'every layer of an organisation can really contribute to the notion of customer service and to the needs of the market.' One sad example of a company that has failed to attune itself to new conditions comes from the computer business itself. The world's largest computer manufacturer, IBM, is now faced with gross overmanning, and an overhaul of its fundamental thinking. Other computer manufacturers, such as Unisys, Olivetti, and Siemens-Nixdorf, have accepted that selling 'boxes' is no longer profitable enough. They have diversified into such areas as service and facilities management, applications consultancy, and are even keen to be seen as independent consultants. In the case of Unisys, this means not only competing with the better-established consultants such as AA (Arthur Andersen), but accepting that it might be obliged to recommend equipment other than its own where that is the best solution in the circumstances. Business process re-engineering seems to be a direct descendant of 'Organisation and Management' - studies of activity and costs, done for the health and continued development of the organisation. But it has two extra tools hidden behind the clipboard. One is a computer - the other is an axe.</p>

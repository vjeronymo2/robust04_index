			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAL FOR STRAWBERRY SEEMS TO MAKE FANS OF BOTH SIDES HAPPY  </P> <P> Should the Dodgers elect to keep Kirk Gibson, they would certainly have three  of the more pleasant human beings in the history of the game together in one  outfield, now that Darryl Strawberry has joined Kal Daniels on our merry blue  crew. It serves to remind us once again that it's not the person but the  performance that endears the athlete to our hearts.  </P> <P> JEB STUART  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

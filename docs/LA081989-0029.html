			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTRICTIONS SOUGHT ON LARGE HILLSIDE HOUSES  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky moved Friday to expand temporary  building restrictions throughout the hillsides of Sherman Oaks to prevent the  construction of big houses on small, sloping parcels of land.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky's motion would ban houses taller than 30 feet, require front and  back yards to be at least five feet deep and prevent houses from covering more  than half of their lots.  </P> <P> In May, the City Council approved the same limits for a swath of hillside land  between Beverly Glen Boulevard and Camino de la Cumbre. The expanded area would  include all hillside property bounded by the San Diego Freeway, Mulholland  Drive, Valley Vista Boulevard and Dixie Canyon Road.  </P> <P> Friday's proposed measure, which must win City Council approval, was prompted  by neighborhood concern over a developer's plan to build up to 20 houses along  Hopevale Drive, a narrow hillside street.  </P> <P> "Developers are building these gigantic homes on small slivers of land," said  Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "The houses are  totally out of proportion for the neighborhood. If 20 of them go up on one  street it could really create havoc."  </P> <P> Ralph Gould, a spokesman for CTC Management of West Los Angeles, said the  development firm has not finished plans for the homes it wants to build on  Hopevale and that only preliminary survey work has been done. The houses will  not be disproportionately large for the parcels of land, which average about  5,000 square feet, he said.  </P> <P> "We are not looking to build homes of the scale that they have been building in  Beverly Hills, the kind that people are complaining about," Gould said. He  added that residents will benefit from construction because it would stabilize  slopes against erosion.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Yaroslavsky said Friday he intends to move the expansion of the  restrictions through the approval process within 30 to 60 days, so that a  strict law will be in place before the developer begins construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subdivided in 1920s  </P> <P> The undeveloped Hopevale plots were legally subdivided in the 1920s and cannot  be changed, Yaroslavsky said. If the plots were subdivided today, more  stringent hillside construction standards would require them to be about three  times as large.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately we can't change the tract maps," Yaroslavsky said. "But we can  control the building."  </P> <P> If approved, the controls will be in effect for one year while planners and  community leaders draft permanent zoning restrictions to regulate hillside  building.  </P> <P> Residents along Oakfield Drive, known as "Stilt Street" for its eye-catching  row of historic houses built on stilts, sought restrictions on the construction  of large homes more than a year ago.  </P></p>

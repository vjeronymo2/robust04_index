			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: SEP jumps and plans Pounds 3m placing SEP Industrial Holdings, the USM-quoted group which has interests in manufacturing, distribution and international trading, reported a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 214,000 to Pounds 830,000 for the year to September 30. The group also announced a placing and open offer of 23.4m new ordinary shares to raise Pounds 3.2m and said that it planned to seek a full listing for its shares. Mr Paul Formby, chairman, said the result reflected the improved contribution from the distribution activities, loss elimination and interest savings arising from a reduction in group indebtedness. It was achieved on reduced turnover of Pounds 24m (Pounds 49.5m) but the interest charges were just Pounds 577,000 (Pounds 1.57m). Earnings per share came to 1.42p (0.27p) and a proposed final dividend of 0.35p (0.2p) brings the total to 0.65p (0.2p). Proceeds from the placing would assist the funding of the group's expansion programme, Mr Formby said, as well as any requirement for additional working capital. The shares will be placed at 14 1/2 p on the basis of one new share for every two held.</p>

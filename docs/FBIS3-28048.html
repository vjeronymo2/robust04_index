This  reflects the soldiers' limitless trust in and boundless loyalty  to our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il. The soldiers,  who created and announced more than 700 pieces of literary and  art works during last year, continue to create many literary,  art works this year.    The works emphatically sing of the great honor and pride of  the soldiers of the People's Army who are advancing along an  ever-victorious road under the leadership of the Comrade Kim  Chong-il, an iron-willed brilliant commander possessed of  extraordinary military intelligence and great commandership. The  works also displays well their single-hearted unity, and  steadfast faith and fiery pledge to remain unfailingly loyal to  the supreme comrade leader by wholly devoting their destiny and  future to him.</p>

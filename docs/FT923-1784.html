			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Result boosts Euro-sceptics MR JOHN MAJOR was last night facing growing domestic opposition to European economic and political union as leading Conservative Euro-sceptics warned that an attempt to push through ratification of the Maastricht accord in Britain would prompt fierce opposition from inside the Tory party. In spite of the welcome given by Mr Major, the prime minister, to the result of the French referendum, the narrowness of the vote in favour of the treaty will serve only to stoke up problems among Conservative backbenchers now convinced that they have it in their power to ditch the accord. The weekend also saw new tensions within the government on the timing of re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. Some pro-European ministers warned that Mr Major could not risk consigning Britain to the 'slow lane' of Europe by remaining outside indefinitely. Tory Euro-sceptics are determined to fill the vacuum left by last week's retreat from the ERM. Lady Thatcher's sharp criticism of Mr Major in a weekend speech in Washington was echoed by several acolytes in London yesterday, who demanded that Britain quit the ERM completely. Mr Major, speaking last night outside Admiralty House in London, where he has a temporary office, said there was no prospect that Britain would ratify the Treaty until Denmark, which rejected it in a June referendum, had clarified its position. In a reference to sterling's ignominious departure last week from the ERM, the prime minister said the EC leaders would have to consider the 'shortcomings' in the system. Mr Major then added to suspicion that he remains unconvinced that Maastricht is now back on course by warning that the special summit of European leaders called for early next month would have to respond to the concerns of European electorates about the pace of integrations. 'I think we do have to take account in public debate of the many concerns that have been raised throughout the Community over recent weeks,' he said. Responding to questions, Mr Major reaffirmed his support for the treaty but in terms which acknowledged the growing confidence of the Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party by saying that there was 'much' of value. One backbencher, Mr John Townend MP, chairman of the party's finance committee, was one among many said British voters should be allowed to express their views. Mr John Smith, leader of the Labour party, welcomed the outcome, saying: 'It is positive for the future of Europe.' However the result will also fuel difficulties for the Labour leadership which is beset with mounting resistance to the pro-Maastricht position adopted by the former leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, and taken up by Mr Smith.</p>

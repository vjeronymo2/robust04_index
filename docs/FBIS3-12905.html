The Israeli envoy presented the  Palestinian president specific Israeli ideas on overcoming the  crisis resulting from the attack on worshipers in the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque and on creating a general climate that will  allow the PLO to resume the negotiations.    President 'Arafat discussed with the Israeli prime  minister's  adviser the measures that have to be taken to protect the  Palestinians in the Arab territories. These measures include  the protection of the Palestinians, provision of security for  them, and a nonrepetition of the Hebron incident.    The radio correspondent also learned that the Palestinian  side stressed the importance of disarming the settlers,  restricting or dissolving the extremist organizations, removing  the settlers from Hebron and densely populated Palestinian  areas, and providing the necessary protection for the  Palestinians.

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HOME LOAN PACT IN JEOPARDY  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach Councilwoman June Williams said Wednesday that she now opposes an  agreement with City Manager Kevin B. Northcraft under which the city would loan  him $250,000 to assist him in buying a home in the community.  </P> <P> "It's been a public relations disaster," she said. "I was surprised by how  strongly people came out against this."  </P> <P> Williams joined Mayor Jim Rosenberger and Councilman Chuck Sheldon last week in  approving, 3 to 2, Northcraft's request for the loan, which would have come  from the city's $8-million investment fund.  </P> <P> Council members Roger Creighton and Etta Simpson had voted against the loan,  and Williams' change of mind likely means that the loan offer will be withdrawn  at the City Council meeting Tuesday.  </P> <P> Williams said she still thinks it would be a good idea for Northcraft, who has  a house in El Segundo, to live in the city where he works. And, she said, the  terms of the proposed loan, including a 120-day cancellation provision,  adequately protected the city against loss and carried a higher interest rate  than the city normally receives from its investments.  </P> <P> "But a lot of mistaken notions started circulating and the thing got out of  hand," she said.  </P> <P> Going ahead with the loan now, she said, would create bad feelings that would  make it hard for the city manager to work with the public. Northcraft was hired  about a year ago.  </P> <P> Williams said about 10 people told her they opposed the loan. "If even three  people call you in a small town like this, you'd better watch out," she said.  Hermosa Beach has a population of about 20,000.  </P></p>

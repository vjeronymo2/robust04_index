			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Eridania adds to Spanish oils operations Eridania Beghin-Say, the French agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Montedison, has taken control of Elosua, the Spanish edible oils company, only a day after getting European Commission permission for the deal, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. The purchase, for an undisclosed price, gives Eridania some 40 per cent of the Spanish edible oils market. It intends to merge Elosua with Koipe, its own Spanish subsidiary. The deal also brings to an end a long-running political controversy over control of the Spanish olive oil sector.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (2): Semblance of normality - The Economy Psychologically, the September 13 general election in Thailand marked the end of a big freeze for the economy. The Gulf crisis that began in August 1990 had suddenly taken bullish sentiment out of the speculative stock and real estate markets. With the coup of February 23, 1991, the country's politics and economy took on a transitional air as investors and the public waited for a new constitution to be drafted and elections to be held. The election on March 22 this year served merely to plunge the country into deeper crisis. It was only after the violent clashes in May were resolved and the military's wings clipped that a semblance of normality could return, with the September election and the installation of the Chuan Leekpai government. The task ahead for the Chuan government will not be easy, however. It will have to overcome the Bangkok elite's distrust of the economic management style of previous elected governments. At the same time, it will have to cater more for the rural electorate that was ignored under the two governments of Mr Anand Panyarachun. Within its first few weeks, the new government has therefore swung between the liberalism of the Anand governments, favoured by the modern business sectors, and pressure to intervene to support agricultural prices. Nevertheless, although these are still early days, some observers detect a new maturity in economic and political matters both in the government and the opposition. Foreign investors did not like the coup; nor did many urban Thais. But few were prepared to defend the overthrown Chatichai Choonhavan government, with its worsening reputation for corruption. Although the military, too, were blamed for corruption, elected governments were becoming tainted with accusations of economic mismanagement and a new crisis of confidence appeared to be in the making as the September election approached. Having overthrown the military and defended parliamentary democracy, the urban middle classes now faced the prospect of elected politicians who would grab as much as they could while in power, and rock the boat as much as they could while in opposition. Mr Chuan and his coalition colleagues have tried to prove that they, too, can place the economy in capable hands. Three senior bankers, unelected but with political inclinations, have been put in charge of the economy: Mr Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, former president of the Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Bankers Association, is finance minister; Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, former president of the Thai Military Bank, is deputy prime minister in charge of trade negotiations and other economic matters; and Mr Amnuay Viravan, former executive board chairman of Bangkok Bank, is another deputy prime minister with economic responsibilities. Observers have warned that the three could become rivals, but so far insiders say they have been working together well. One economist has welcomed the prospect of the first debates on economic policy - as distinct from sharing out economic spoils - within the Cabinet. One of the first issues they had to tackle was the budget for fiscal 1993, which should have been operational since the beginning of October. Earlier political turmoil delayed the bill's passage through parliament. Signalling their determination to retain Thailand's traditionally cautious fiscal policy, the three said they would submit a bill that essentially continued with the previous practice of balancing budgets. A new budget accounting method which takes account of when the money is likely to be spent - rather than in which year the spending is administratively handled - will give the government a slight deficit on paper, however. In the past few years, planned balanced budgets have actually yielded end-of-year surpluses for the government. The official treasury reserves now stand at about Bt200bn. Such a large figure has been tempting to politicians, some of whom are suggesting it could be used to write off farmers' debts. Most economists warn that drawing heavily on the treasury reserves would be inflationary and although Mr Tarrin initially toyed with the idea of making some use of the money, he has now changed his mind. Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is about 5 per cent, a level that few would want to rise. Despite the uncertainties and the slowdown in investment compared with the 1980s, investment has continued quietly. Some businessmen see signs that increased prosperity in a population approaching 58m could mean domestic demand serves to continue the momentum should the external climate take a downward turn. Exports are still expected to have risen by almost 16 per cent to about Bt835bn this year, with imports up a more modest 10 per cent to about Bt1,070bn. Earnings from tourism, a big foreign exchange earner, have stagnated since 1990. One economist has even forecast a return to the double-digit growth of the late 1980s. But most envisage economic growth of about 8 per cent for the next few years provided the international climate does not become too depressed. Opinions differ over how serious is the trade deficit in goods and services  -the current account. One of the causes of the deficit is a failure of domestic savings to cover Thailand's investment. Some economists, including those in the Bank of Thailand, believe that domestic savings can be increased sufficiently to keep the current account deficit at sustainable levels. But Mr Supachai, himself a former central banker, has expressed concern that the current account deficit could remain a serious problem over the next few years and therefore threaten the stability of the economy. This year, it is running at about Bt180bn a year or 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product, down slightly from last year's 8.25 per cent. With cautious fiscal and monetary policies likely to remain solid foundations for the economy, the big challenge for the government is likely to be its handling of the country's infrastructure bottlenecks. Large-scale road, mass transit and telecommunications projects have been prime targets for corruption and have been delayed as frequent Cabinet reshuffles and government changes have swung the odds for various bidders. The Anand government tried to reform the selection procedure for large projects in order to make selection more accountable and less susceptible to corruption. Whether the new government will continue along those lines remains to be seen. Mr Chuan is known to be clean, but he does not have the economic acumen of his predecessor and could place less emphasis on sound project screening.</p>

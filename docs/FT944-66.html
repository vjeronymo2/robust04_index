			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings Fenner is involved in a wide range of different businesses, writes Vivien MacDonald, of the Inside Track. Over the past 18 months, the rise in the price has been spectacular, although it has slowed recently. Since the announcement of final results at the begining of November, three directors have bought stock on the market. The non-executive chairman, Colin Cooke, has now increased his holding by a sizeable amount. The year-end report was good and three directors dealing together is usually a vote of confidence. Asprey has been in the press a fair amount over the past year, and it has not done the company much good. After weak interim results, the share price fell almost 350p to 135p. At this lower level, directors have started to pick up more stock again. JR Asprey has added further to his already considerable family trust while Naim Attallah, who wisely sold when the stock stood at 310p, has also been back to the market and has more than returned to his previous level of holding. Largest sale of the week was at Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group. David Abbott, chairman, and Peter Mead, chief executive, sold a total of 440,000 shares at 337p each but retain sizeable holdings. The share's performance has been good over the past 12 months.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Value       No of Company                  Sector      Shares  Pounds '000  directors  ------------------------------------------------------------------ SALES  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Abacus Group               Dist      80,651      134          4 Abbot Md Vickers           Mdia     440,000     1483          2 Allen                      BCon      10,800       17          1 Atlas Conv Equip            Eng       2,000       11          2 Azlan Group                EE&amp;E      11,463       14          1 Brammer                    Dist       6,206       22          1 Dickie (James)              Eng      10,000       17          1 Faber Prest                Dist      14,653       81          1 Haggas (John)              Text      15,795       13          1 London Clubs Intl.

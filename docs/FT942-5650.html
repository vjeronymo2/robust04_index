			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading Article: More unequal than others The very sharp increase in the number of people in the UK with incomes below half the national average, reported yesterday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, may come as a shock. It is, of course, possible to imagine a society in which growing income inequality coexists with rising living standards for all. Yet the evidence that the poorest in society are not benefiting from the economic growth enjoyed by the majority is now mounting. The government's own figures for households below average incomes show little change in real income for the poorest tenth of the population since 1979. When housing costs are taken into account, their real income has actually fallen during the 1980s. The IFS study confirms the government's figures and contrasts them with the 60 per cent increase in incomes after housing costs for the richest tenth of the population since 1979. There is no sign of the trickle-down effect for those at the very bottom of the income ladder. What has happened in the 1980s contrasts with the experience of much of the rest of the postwar period, when all income groups benefited to some degree from economic growth. There is concern over the emergence of an excluded minority which has little or no stake in society. Those at the bottom of the income ladder find themselves cut off from employment, dependent on benefits and trapped on problem public housing estates. A spiral of deprivation is created, with high rates of family break-up and growing numbers of single parents bringing up children in poverty. Growing bills This is not a recipe for a society at ease with itself. The more affluent majority with access to jobs, owner-occupation, cars and the rest cannot cut themselves off from it. They see its consequences in the increasing numbers of beggars on the streets. They must protect their homes and families from the lawlessness it engenders. They pay the taxes to meet the growing social security bills. Fortunately, there are many data in the IFS study that offer help in devising policies to break out of the spiral of decline. A central finding is the growing importance of unemployment as a cause of low incomes. In 1961, less than 4 per cent of those on below half average income were unemployed: by 1991, it was over a fifth. Unemployment is the dominant factor behind the increase in families with children in the poorest tenth: they now make up more than half this group, compared with only a third in 1961. Smoother transition Finding work opportunities for those who are unemployed is essential in providing pathways out of poverty for these individuals. Simply increasing benefits for the unemployed is unlikely to assist in this, because it may discourage them from taking low-paid jobs. Instead, the benefits system should be adjusted to smooth the transition to employment so that unemployed people can accept part-time or low-paid work without losing all their benefits. Another clear finding of the IFS study is the relative improvement of the position of pensioners. They formed almost half the poorest tenth in 1961, and now make up less than a quarter, despite their growth in numbers. Some of the improvement is marginal - the proportion of pensioners in the bottom fifth of the income distribution has declined much less. But the link between retirement and poverty is no longer as strong as in the past. Yet an increasing number of pensioners find themselves with less than half average income, enjoying little or none of the fruits of economic growth. They depend on the basic state pension which has been increased in line with prices since the ending of the link with average earnings in 1980. To tackle their poverty by restoring the link with earnings would be foolish, however. With the growth of occupational pensions and other forms of investment income, a growing minority of pensioners is in the top half of the income distribution. Far better to target additional resources on those who depend only on the state pension. There is nothing inevitable about the falling living standards of the poorest in a society that is steadily getting richer. But tackling the problem needs subtle if modest steps, rather than simple big ideas that grab the headlines.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Deyi [6392 1795 5030]: "The High-Flux </F> Engineering Test Reactor Research Laboratory"]    [Text] The State has invested 170 million yuan as a  first-phase project construction fund for the high flux  engineering test reactor in the China Nuclear Power Research and  Design Academy's High-Flux Engineering Test Reactor Research  Laboratory. Its neutron flux levels rank among the world's  leaders and it is number one in Asia. It attained criticality  for the first time on 27 December 1979 and has now operated  safely for more than 13 years. This reactor is used primarily  for nuclear fuel and materials irradiation tests, but it also is  used for neutron irradiation technology services and the  production of isotopes. The laboratory has 70 engineering and  technical personnel including 30 engineers and three senior  engineers, and it has 22 senior operating personnel and four  operating personnel who have received state reactor operation  licenses. Since its completion, this reactor has conducted a  series of tests and research on the special types of materials  used in nuclear power devices, on UO[.sub]2[/],  ThO[.sub]2[/], and  UO[.sub]2[/]-Gd[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] fuel samples and  UO[.sub]2[/] fuel microsphere samples, on reactor pressure  vessel steel, and on special types of materials used in  high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, fast reactors, hybrid  reactors, and other types of advanced reactors. It has carried  out development and production of industrial [.sup]60[/]Co  sources, [.sup]60[/]Co flaw detection sources, [.sup]192[/]  Ir flaw detection sources, [.sup]60[/]Co  therapy sources and afterloading sources, molybdenum-technetium  generators, tin-indium generators, and other radioactive  isotopes and R&amp;D on neutron irradiation monocrystalline  silicon  doping, precious stone irradiation coloring, and other things  and produced rather high social and economic benefits.    With the need for rapid development of China's national  economy, this laboratory will be playing an ever more important  role in nuclear fuel and materials irradiation testing, isotope  development and production, neutron irradiation processing,  nuclear engineering, radiation chemistry, nuclear medicine, and  other high-S&amp;T fields.</p>

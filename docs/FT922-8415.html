			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Environment: Deals set up trade in pollution permits THE first US deals to trade pollution rights were announced yesterday when the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority said it had agreed to buy allowances to emit 10,000 tons of sulphur dioxide, a key cause of acid rain, from privately owned Wisconsin Power &amp; Light. The Wisconsin utility, based in Madison, also said it sold allowances to Duquesne Light of Pittsburgh for emissions of between 15,000 and 25,000 tons. The exact terms of the sales were not disclosed but the price of each allowance was between Dollars 250 and Dollars 400 (Pounds 140 and Pounds 223), an official said. The deals are, in essence, forward contracts on allowances that will be issued next year by the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act. The act requires utilities to cut their sulphur dioxide emissions in half by the year 2000, or from a national total of 19m tons to 9m tons. The first deadline for partial compliance is in 1995. To help ease the high costs of converting to cleaner technologies, the US government has created a system under which 'dirtier' utility companies can buy allowances for sulphur dioxide emissions from 'cleaner' companies that have exceeded federal standards. The allowances have been allocated, but will not be in the hands of utilities until an auction in March 1993. Mr Erroll Davis, president of Wisconsin Power &amp; Light, said the transactions 'clearly demonstrate that a market-based approach can be an effective way to address environmental problems'. If a market develops for the allowances, it is believed the public will save on rates because utility companies will be able to meet their clean air requirements at a lower cost than building scrubbers or switching to harder, lower-sulphur coal. There is, however, scepticism over how well such a market can work, as state and locally controlled utilities have been slow to set clear policies for trading allowances. Among other matters at issue, such as whether a given community wants to be 'dirty' even at a lower cost, is how to price the allowances. But Mr John Henry, president of Clean Air Capital Markets, a Washington-based investment banking firm that arranged the TVA transaction, said: 'It's a shot that will be heard around the utility world.' Its significance, he says, is that it will publicly set a price on the allowances which is below the cost of most scrubbers. He also said such transactions are less disruptive than switching fuel that must be transported from more distant sources. Soft, high-sulphur coal is produced largely in the eastern part of the US, where most of the offending utilities are located; hard, low-sulphur coal is produced in the western states. The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's biggest futures market, plans to begin trading futures contracts on the allowances, to be dubbed pollution futures.</p>

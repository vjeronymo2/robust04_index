			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PIMLICO RACE TRACK REOPENS  </P> <P> More than a month after closing down because of unsafe track conditions,  Pimlico Race Course has reopened with a reconditioned racing surface that track  officials hope will be better suited to the variable weather conditions of  spring racing dates.  </P> <P> "The track was great. . . . There was a lot of bounce to it, very lively," said  jockey Greg Hutton, who rode Keep A Count to a wire-to-wire victory in  Thursday's first race, the first over Pimlico's renovated racing surface.  </P> <P> Pimlico, which is home to the Preakness, the middle jewel of horse racing's  Triple Crown, was shut down March 10 when jockeys refused to ride after the  seventh race. There were three spills in the seven races.  </P></p>

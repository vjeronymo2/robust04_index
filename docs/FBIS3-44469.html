			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["1993 Yearender" by staff correspondent Qin Jingwu (4440 </F> 0079 0582): "China's Rapidly Developing Energy Industry"]    [Text] China's sustained, rapid, healthy economic growth  has made greater demands on the energy industry and is  encouraging it to look for breakthroughs.  <H3>  Petroleum: Opening to the Outside World and Involvement in  Multinational Operations </H3>   By the end of November, the China National Petroleum  Corporation had produced 127 million tonnes of crude oil, up  1.38 percent from the same period last year, and 141 million  cubic meters of natural gas, up 3.6 percent from the same period  last year. In recent years, to speed up petroleum industrial  development, China has opened the southeastern part of the Tarim  Basin, Xinjiang, and part of the East China Sea to prospecting  by foreign petroleum firms. More than a dozen big firms from a  number of countries signed up to bid for these two regions. Ten  contracts have been signed on the East China Sea and one on the  Tarim Basin, signalling another breakthrough in the China's  petroleum industry's opening up to the outside world.    Another breakthrough this year: The China National Petroleum  and Natural Gas Corporation stepped out of the country to engage  in multinational oil and natural gas operations. Since  October, the corporation has signed four overseas oil contracts  and accords with Peru, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand.  So China is not only attracting foreign firms to prospect its  land and seas; its petroleum industry has also gone out of the  country in oil and natural gas prospecting.  <H5>  Electric Power: Strive for Sustained and Accelerated Growth </H5>   China's electric power industrial growth rates have been  astounding to the world. Since 1988, China increased its  installed generating capacity by 12 million kw, though power  supply remains short compared with its recent 20 percent  industrial growth rate. To ease power shortages as soon as  possible, the Ministry of Power Industry has decided to increase  financing and use of foreign funds for the power industry. From  now on, investment in the expansion and reproduction of the  power industry will take up another 25 percent over and above  its present proportion in the GDP. By the end of this century,  China's installed generating capacity will have increased from  the current 240 million kw to 310 million kw, which is expected  to basically ease the power shortage across the country.    This year, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang  progressed to the design and production stage, and the first  generator unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong  started generating power for electric grids this year,  signalling a new dimension for China's nuclear-powered  electricity.  <H5>  Coal: Diversified Operating Modes, Move Toward the Market </H5>   Coal accounts for over 70 percent of China's primary energy  structure and is vital. The state has decided to deregulate raw  coal prices and stop subsidizing its production in the near  future. State-owned coal mines are facing grim challenges. On  the basis of its diversified modes of operations, the coal  industry is quickening its move toward the market. The average  output value of coal production under diversified operations  between 1986 and 1991 annually rose 25 percent and by the end of  last year, the diversified part of the industry was employing  1.45 million people, generating 15 billion yuan in output value,  which is expected to hit 18 billion, and absorbing 150,000  people made redundant by staff cutting. The diversified  operating part of the coal industry has generated more than 20  different trades, set up close to 20,000 operating units and  factories and a number of Sino-foreign joint ventures or jointly  invested ventures. The development of diversified operations  has contributed to stabilizing raw coal production and reversing  losses in state-owned coal mines.</p>

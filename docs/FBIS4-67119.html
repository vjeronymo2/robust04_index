			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Khriso Andoniadhou] </F>   [Text] Cunning swindlers are establishing companies in  Cyprus as a public face covering operations to legalize the  dirty money coming from the smuggling of arms and narcotics,  organized crime, drugs, and tax evasion. According to I  SIMERINI's information, the swindlers are using various methods  and machinations to make their dirty money legal. In their  efforts they use Cyprus as a transit point. The following is  their most favored method: First, they choose a country that is  considered a suitable place for laundering dirty money. This  country is used as a transit station. The final destinations  are Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. The money  reaching those countries comes from all over the world.  Afterward, the swindlers choose a tax haven such as Cyprus for  their "shop windows" and to legalize their dirty money and, in  this case, acquire the seal of the Republic of Cyprus.    An offshore company is registered in Cyprus in line with  government legislation and Central Bank regulations. The  company is given a name that is approved by the office of the  Companies Registrar and an external account is opened with a  bank to facilitate the export of foreign exchange.    Millions, usually in foreign currency, are deposited in the  bank account while the offshore company issues some  insignificant capital. Later the company legally exports its  foreign exchange while it has its name registered in Cyprus.    In most cases, the foreign swindlers cooperate with Cypriot  economic circles, who help them in their transactions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Borodin, under the rubric "Problem": </F> "Russia Is Doing Everything It Can To Maintain Baykonur: But The  Cosmodrome Belongs, as Before, to a Foreign Power"]    [Text] The problem of the Baykonur rocket-and-space complex  occupies a special place in Russian-Kazakhstan relations and has  been under discussion for more than a year.    The military and diplomats of the Russian Federation are  making titanic efforts to persuade Alma-Ata to sign a bilateral  agreement for a lease of, preferably, 30 years and to recognize  Baykonur as a Russian base, if only de facto.    But Kazakhstan authorities prefer a different version, one  that is more attractive from their standpoint, one in which the  cosmodrome could become a facility of multilateral cooperative  efforts in which rich firms from the far-abroad could take part.    If that were to come about, it could take jobs away from  Russian space generals, who, unlike the specialists of the  middle and lower ranks, would have nothing to command. That is  why the military are continuing to try to prove to Moscow -- and  to the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Andrey Kozyrev,  who recently visited Baykonur -- that the lease is the only  acceptable version.    On the other hand, it's generally acknowledged that it is  the  Russian military who are maintaining the minimally required  conditions for the operation of the extremely complicated  assembly and testing complexes, the launch and firing centers,  and the municipal and everyday services of the city of Leninsk,  which has a population of 65,000.    Of the R47 billion allocated for maintaining the cosmodrome  in 1993, the lion's share was released from the Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense budget. The spending for 1994 has  been set at five times more (in absolute figures), but the money  promised is having a hard time making it to Baykonur.    In a 1992 interstate agreement, Russia assumed  responsibility  for 94 percent of the expenses for maintaining the complex, and  Kazakhstan was obliged to pay the rest.    By the will of the fates, the main facility for basing the  military-space forces of Russia is on foreign territory. But  then it's hard to call Baykonur a facility -- it's more like a  small state within a state. There are almost 1,500 kilometers of  roads running around the cosmodrome, and nearly 7,000 kilometers  of power lines. The fixed assets of Baykonur are valued at  nearly R4.5 trillion (at the prices for early 1994). Compared  with that, the R56 billion spent on housing and municipal  construction in Leninsk doesn't seem a very big amount.  Occupying a big chunk of the Kazakh steppe with an area of  approximately 50 x 110 km, the cosmodrome also controls huge  tracts of land that are used as drop zones and right-of-way  zones, and they're not only in Kazakhstan, but also in Russia,  Turkmenia, and Uzbekistan.    From a juridical standpoint, not to mention from simply a  human standpoint, the situation that has come to pass around  Baykonur can only be called nonsense. In the city and  settlements around it, there are two police forces -- one  Russian, one Kazakh -- and two court systems. True, there is  still only one prosecutor's office, but because of confusion and  the extremely complex living conditions, the staff members have  announced a strike. In the words of the deputy chief of the  cosmodrome, Maj.-Gen. Viktor Grafinin, the special conditions at  the Baykonur facilities for the military-space forces of Russia  that, for decades, were painstakingly hidden from "enemy eyes"  are now being maintained by officers that are under Kazakhstan's  jurisdiction, i.e., they are under the security service of a  foreign country.    According to Gen. Grafinin, there were 22 launches of space  vehicles with military and national-economy missions from  Baykonur in 1992. In 1993, there were four. This year, they're  still waiting for the first. The space industry is gradually  falling into decline. Judging from what civilian and military  specialists say, give it three -- at best, five -- years, and  the process of decay will become irreversible: equipment will  age, and the people will leave. The unique experience and  knowledge garnered at the expense of tremendous money and effort  will be left unused.    In the words of one Baykonur veteran who, over a 20-year  period, rose from a worker to director of a large affiliate of  NPO Energiya, the money that is being spent to mothball  facilities and keep them in working order is fully comparable  with the money that could produce an actual launch. In his  opinion, three or four successful launches would be fully  sufficient for attracting well- to-do clients who want to put  their cargoes in orbit and for providing them safety guarantees.  Moreover, the clients, in all likelihood, would want to be  assured that the expensive equipment transported to the  cosmodrome will not, one fine day, become someone else's  property. That requires specific agreements between Moscow and  Alma-Ata.    Kazakhstan's desire to get for Baykonur as much as possible  and, hopefully, the "green stuff" is entirely normal. But  Alma-Ata still needs to understand that Moscow is not in a  position to pay sums that go beyond the bounds of common sense.  Recent events around the long-suffering cosmodrome have shown  that within the next two months, that issue will be resolved by  the highest level, by the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan.</p>

A magnesium-lithium  superlight alloy developed at the Hannover University is half as  heavy as aluminum.    The alloy consists of 60% atom. Mg and 40%  atom. Li. Its  density is only 1.3 g/cm[.sup]3[/], making it weigh six times  less than steel and half as much as aluminum. The credentials of  this new material from Hannover demonstrate that the scientists  of the Hannover research team have, with their novel binary  alloying technique, come a whole lot closer to realizing the  dream of superlight materials.    Researchers have for decades been fascinated by the  challenge  to produce superlight materials with a lower than 1.5  g/cm[.sup]3[/] density by alloying with the lightest metallic  element, which is lithium. Magnesium alloys are an interesting  possibility as such a partnership, their density being 40%  lower than that of aluminum-based materials.    Such binary materials have encouraging properties: not only  a  much lower density than that of conventional magnesium alloys  but also a better formability. Their advantages are, however,  unfortunately attended by serious drawbacks: very low mechanical  strength and very low corrosion resistance.    "Alongside the basic concept of an integrated material  development is also considered the industrial aspect of  subsequent material production, i.e., evaluation of industrially  feasible alloy making processes and testing techniques", so does  Prof. Dr.-Eng. Heinz Haferkampf describe the scope of work done  by the Hannover research team as sponsored by the DFG (Deutsche  Forschungsgemeinschaft = German Research Association). Powder  metallurgy and nondestructive testing methods are accordingly  being refined for adaptation to the specific properties of that  new group of alloys.    Unfortunately, the new material behaves like a moody  primadonna. It poses serious problems in the magnesium and  lithium mixing stage, inasmuch as both metals are chemically  very active even in a normal atmosphere. A protective gas such  as argon shielding the material from air must, therefore, be  provided throughout the alloy making process.    Magnesium with its hexagonal basic crystal lattice is,  moreover, by nature brittle. Increasing the lithium content  influences the crystal structure in a way which improves its  formability. Because of the high lithium diffusion rate, on the  other hand, segregation takes place and the material becomes  nonhomogeneous.    Even after successful casting there still remain unrelenting  difficulties. Unlike aluminum-based materials, which form a  continuous oxide surface film protecting them against further  corrosion, magnesium-lithium alloys form steadily growing chappy  chemically active layers. A high lithium content in the alloy  and humid environment accelerate the loss of material.    Material researchers limit the mobility of lithium by adding  elements which appropriately inhibit the diffusion of lithium,  for instance by binding lithium into compounds. Addition of  hydrogen to the melt has proved to be very promising.    A material with much better properties is, however, obtained  by adding slight amounts of aluminum and zinc. This will  unfortunately result in accelerated coarsening of the structure  during heating and thus will not ensure the mandatory long-term  stability required of engineering materials.    Experimentation with additives such as silicon, cadmium, and  zirconium seems to have revealed a way out of this dilemma.  "Already slight amounts of silicon make the material more  corrosion-resistant and thus reduce the loss of material to half  the loss of conventional structural steel due to corrosion"  Professor Haferkampf states joyfully. "For goal-oriented  modifications of the alloy composition there are available  metallurgical techniques which will ensure a low contamination  level during treatment of highly chemical reaction prone alloy  melts and thus ensure reproducibility of alloy making and  treatment procedures."    The alloy making process involves homogenization of the melt  by stirring and its subsequent casting into steel molds.  Attendant conversion and heat treatment are designed to improve  the mechanical properties and to increase the corrosion  resistance.    A homogeneous melt can then be "frozen in" by rapid cooling.  Material combinations can thus be obtained which are not  obtainable by conventional casting methods. The melt is  subsequently atomized into small droplets by injection of a  high-energy gas jet. The finished material is a fine metal  powder consisting of globular particles. The diameter of  globules produced in a fully automatic spray-nozzle apparatus  ranges from 0.02 mm to 0.25 mm, depending on the process  conditions. This powder is then, by heat and pressure, converted  into a compact material.    Use of superlight cast Mg-Li alloys has been first  demonstrated on a 10 mm thick and 300 mm in diameter light  lamination (weighing only 0.7 kg) of a rotary neutron selector.  It withstood speeds higher than the minimum required 20,000 rpm.  Such rotors make it possible to select specific radiation  propagation velocities for analysis of magnetic materials,  electronic components, and plastics. Professor Haferkampf is  satisfied: "Excellent machinability and high neutron absorption  capacity, among lithium's relevant properties, enable this new  kind of alloy to reach a very promising application potential in  competition with fiber-reinforced plastic materials currently in  use."</p>

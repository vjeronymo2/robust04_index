			<p>BFN     [Text] The Jonassaint government is planning elections.  The provisional government issued a press release following a  ministerial council meeting on 22 June expressing its  determination to make all the necessary arrangements for  national elections as soon as possible and in compliance with  the concerned institutions. No dates have been set for the  elections or for the necessary steps to prepare for the  elections.    [Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French at 1030 GMT on 24  June reports: "Government sources have reported that the  Jonassaint government will have to summon Permanent Electoral  Council members next week to discuss national elections. On 17  June, provisional President Emile Jonassaint said that holding  elections is the only honorable way out of the crisis and that  elections will prove democracy can come to Haiti. Attorney  Mireille Durocher Bertin of the National Coalition agrees and  has suggested that a team be organized to open the files  necessary for holding elections in Haiti in the next few  months."]</p>

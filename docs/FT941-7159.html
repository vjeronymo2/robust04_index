			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Squeeze keeps ICI steady Keenly awaited full-year figures from ICI disappointed the market yesterday, although the shares found some support from dividend buyers. ICI announced a profit of Pounds 290m which was towards the bottom of the analysts' range. This was accompanied by a trading statement which was seen by most analysts as neutral to cautious. The shares fell 12 but then, to general surprise, turned the corner. While the rest of the FT-SE 100 was off by more than 65 points ICI was one of only three bright spots. It appeared that income funds, which buy stocks for the yield, were holding on for the dividend on March 14. This prompted a squeeze as a number of marketmakers had gone short ahead of the figures. There was also expectation of some US demand after the company's presentation in New York on Friday. Nevertheless, most UK analysts were unimpressed and some of the higher 1994 forecasts were reduced. James Capel and Kleinwort Benson came down to around Pounds 400m from Pounds 440m and Pounds 450m. One of the few securities houses to continue enthusiastic was Smith New Court which remains on Pounds 400m for this year and Pounds 700m for 1995, but argues 'there are the first signs of a real culture change in ICI.' It also reinforced its buy recommendation. However, the shares were finally unable to resist the general pressure and closed a net 2 lower at 750p.</p>

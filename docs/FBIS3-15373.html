RA [Republic of Armenia] Governmental press service informed  us, the main railway bridge was damaged after the first  explosion in December, 1993. A new temporary bridge was built  nearby, allowing transfer of trains over the bridge. One of the  supporting blocks of the new bridge has been damaged as a result  of the new explosion.    The RA Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan promised to deliver  the  grain and fuel to Armenia by air. Meanwhile the Minister of  Food and Resources David Zadoyan reported, trucks were sent to  Georgia for delivering the cargoes (particularly grain). The  reconstruction of the bridge will take 20-25 days at least, Mr.  Zadoyan reported.    The Armenian specialists left to the place of the explosion.  According to the official report, the reconstruction time will  be only known after investigating the situation on the spot.    This is fifth explosion at the railway, connecting Armenia  with the external world, during this winter. And therefore the  declarations of the Georgian parliamentarian Aleksandr Kavasadze  about "brotherly relations" between Armenia and Georgia, made on  March 1, sound rather strange.    Meanwhile the Yerevan-Tbilisi highway is being used starting  from March 2. The non-stable situation in Georgia didn't allow  to use this road before. The main difficulty is to ensure the  security in the Marneuli-Tbilisi section, which is now  guaranteed.</p>

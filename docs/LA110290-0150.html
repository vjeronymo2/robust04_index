			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: THE MIDEAST CRISIS MAY BE FADING AS FACTOR IN INVESTING  </P> <P> Does Saddam matter anymore?  </P> <P> As the Iraq-Kuwait crisis appears to be building to some kind of resolution --  military or peaceful -- more money managers are asking themselves whether they  care either way. For many, the decision to move back into stocks and/or bonds  now transcends whatever happens in the Mideast.  </P> <P> "Personally, I think we're in a whole new period for the markets," says Joe  Perrone, chief investment officer for the $24.5-billion Texas Teachers  Retirement System in Austin. A resolution in the Mideast, he says, "would be a  temporary deal, either way." Beyond that, "I look at the psychology of the  markets, and I don't think there's any question that it's going to get worse."  </P> <P> John DeGroot, portfolio management chief at U.S. Trust of California in Los  Angeles, also is far less concerned about the Mideast. "I think the Iraq  situation has been discounted in the market," whatever the outcome, he says.  </P> <P> Only a month or so ago, many investors were clinging to the belief that all  Wall Street needed was an end to the Iraq-Kuwait stalemate. Either war or peace  would have sparked a rally, many believed -- because any resolution was better  than continued uncertainty.  </P> <P> Now, more investors are looking deeper into the background of the economy and  the markets, and they're finding much more to worry about beyond Saddam  Hussein. Even though it can be argued that Iraq triggered the recession that  appears to be overtaking the economy, many investors now admit that all the  Mideast crisis did was expose the weaknesses that had long been underlying the  stock and bond markets.  </P> <P> "The bigger picture is that we're in a global liquidity crisis," says Martin  Sass of M. D. Sass Investors in New York. "It's the reversal of the  debt-creation frenzy of the 1980s." The Mideast crisis may be resolved in a  week, he said, "but you don't resolve the liquidity crisis so quickly."  </P> <P> Significantly, institutional investors' growing shift to these broader concerns  is a strong hint that the bear market has much further to go, even if Saddam is  overthrown soon. Elements of doubt have been planted in investors' heads --  worries about the value of long-term investments in the current world economic  climate -- and those doubts will take time to erase.  </P> <P> What's also interesting, however, is how many big investors seem sure that the  stock market low isn't far off -- while history and the investors' own negative  feelings suggest otherwise.  </P> <P> Echoing many of his peers, Charles Brandes of Brandes Investment Management in  San Diego says he would become "an out-and-out bull" if the Dow industrial  index falls to between 2,000 and 2,200, from 2,454.95 now.  </P> <P> At 2,200 or below, he says, there would be enough value in stocks to guarantee  excellent profits over the long term.  </P> <P> Likewise, Sass believes, the market "is probably within 10% to 15%" of what  will be at least its initial bottom. Having by now cut his aggressive accounts  to just 60% stocks and 40% cash, he says, "I'm not selling anymore. Rather, I'm  figuring when I'll be buying into the market again."  </P> <P> That reluctance to sell -- or to buy -- at current levels explains why the  market has been mostly churning in recent weeks. Many investors want the market  to go lower so they can buy, but they want someone else to drive it there. They  feel as if they've sold enough already.  </P> <P> But if the economy is in fact just entering a recession, history suggests that  the ultimate bottom for stocks is well in the distance. A study by Shearson  Lehman Bros. of the eight postwar recessions shows that market bottoms  typically aren't reached until just three to five months before the end of a  recession.  </P> <P> So if the current recession were to last until next June, the market probably  wouldn't reach its low until sometime between January and March.  </P> <P> Could that low be a mere 2,000 to 2,200 on the Dow, as many big investors  believe? Perhaps. But some experts worry that the negative psychology is  building to a point that could prove the 2,000-bottom group much too  optimistic.  </P> <P> If the market is carried to 2,000, some say, the momentum at that point is  likely to be strong enough to guarantee a fall to much lower depths.  </P> <P> Perrone, of the Texas Teachers fund, now has just 41% of the fund's assets in  stocks. But if the fund's trustees became convinced that the economy was  sinking far deeper than most experts expect, the fund could sell all the way  down to 35% stocks, he says.  </P> <P> He doesn't anticipate liquidating stocks to that degree, but he admits "I think  it could happen. There's no question they (fund trustees) are worried."  </P> <P> In the case of private money managers, terrified clients may ultimately force  liquidation, even if the managers believe that stocks are too cheap to sell.  After all, no hired money manager can balk when a client simply says, "Enough."  </P> <P> And if the bad news continues on the economy, the banking system, the dollar  and other fronts, there is little question that the list of get-me-out clients  will grow.  </P> <P> One portfolio manager remembers how on Oct. 19, 1987 -- the day of the crash --  he and other managers were at the mercy of clients, who had set up meetings  with the managers and simply demanded "let's sell everything."  </P> <P> Now, he says, "I think it's going to happen again, because they're starting to  ask for those meetings again."  </P> <P> WHEN WILL IT BE TIME TO BUY?  </P> <P> Assuming the economy is in a recession, many investors are wondering when the  stock market will begin looking ahead to a recovery. In the eight recessions  since World War II, the market typically bottomed three to five months before  the recovery began.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:2.33IN:2.77IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> between market  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> market  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> bottom and  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Recession  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> bottom  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> recession's end  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nov., 1948-Oct., 1949  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> June,1949  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> four  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July, 1953-May, 1954  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Sept., 1953  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> eight  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Aug., 1957-April, 1958  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Dec., 1957  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> four  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> April, 1960-Feb., 1961  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Oct., 1960  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> four  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dec., 1969-Nov., 1970  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> June, 1970  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> five  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nov., 1973-March, 1975  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Dec., 1974  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> three  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan., 1980-July, 1980  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> April, 1980  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> three  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July, 1981-Nov., 1982  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> July, 1982  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> four  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Shearson Lehman Bros.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOR WHEELCHAIR TENNIS ATHLETES, FORMER THERAPY IS SERIOUS SPORT  </P> <P> This was the Big Time. They came from Australia, England, the Netherlands,  Alabama, Tennessee -- California, too -- to play in the Seventh Annual World  Wheelchair Tennis Invitational. The prize money was the largest it has ever  been -- $12,000.  </P> <P> "The significance of the event is that we are showcasing the best men and women  in the world," said David Kiley, winner of the men's doubles, with his partner  Randy Snow, and host athlete for the event.  </P> <P> Eight men and seven women competed in the tournament, which began Thursday.  </P> <P> Championship wheelchair tennis -- as played Saturday at the South End Racquet  and Health Club in Torrance -- now is far more than therapy for the victims of  broken backs.  </P> <P> It has become a game of flat hard serves, deceitful returns and dazzling chair  spins. The only concession to limited mobility is a two-bounce rule.  </P> <P> The guys have mitt-crushing handshakes, biceps bigger than their atrophied  thighs, shoulders you could walk on -- and the steely-eyed stares of  competitors as fierce as any in able-bodied sports.  </P> <P> "We're out here to win," said Kiley, 35. "We aren't out to prove any point  about courage. The game is three times as hard as playing with your feet."  </P> <P> Dubbed "the best all-around wheelchair athlete in the United States," Kiley is  an unusual exemplar of the rule "once a jock, always a jock."  </P> <P> He works out five days a week, several hours a day, lifting weights, getting  aerobic conditioning. He can rip off three sets of 20 chin-ups.  </P> <P> A member of the U.S. Wheelchair Basketball team that won the gold medal in the  1988 Paralympic Games in Seoul, he led the Casa Colina Condors to six national  championships in the last nine years and has been named Most Valuable Player  five times by the National Wheelchair Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> He broke his back 16 years ago when an inner tube he was riding down a snowy  hill at Big Bear struck a tree.  </P> <P> "I was an athlete. That was all I did," he said. "I didn't care about anything  but sports." A point guard for the Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, he  became introduced to wheelchair basketball while undergoing rehabilitation.  </P> <P> At first, he was skeptical.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Wheelchair basketball, give me a break!' But this guy broke my  stereotypes real fast." It was the coach of a wheelchair basketball team: He  was dropping in back shots one after another, and Kiley decided to join in.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'For My Ego'  </P> <P> In the beginning, the sport was physical and mental therapy.  </P> <P> "I needed something for my ego," Kiley said.  </P> <P> But the old competitive juices started flowing. He took up tennis, skiing, got  married, became sports director of the Pomona-based Casa Colina Centers for  Rehabilitation, which sponsored Saturday's tournament -- and his ego no longer  needed the boost, he said.  </P> <P> Now he is in sports to excel.  </P> <P> "I never would have been at the top of any able-bodied sports. I have been most  fortunate to be at the top of wheelchair sports," he said.  </P> <P> But apart from the personal goal, Kiley and other wheelchair sports activists  also make the point that many with spinal cord injuries can do a lot more than  was dreamed possible before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Common Fallacy'  </P> <P> For example, the two children he fathered.  </P> <P> "It's a common fallacy that disabled people cannot enjoy the finer parts of  life," he said, with a knowing smile. "The doctors told me I couldn't have  kids. Huh, that's what they know. You have to learn not to listen."  </P> <P> Returning to the day's event, Kiley said that he hopes someday people will  watch wheelchair tennis on national television networks for its value as pure  sport.  </P> <P> "We believe that wheelchair tennis will become that attractive," he said.  </P> <P> FINAL RESULTS:  </P> <P> Men's doubles: David Kiley of San Dimas (ranked No. 3 in the world) and Randy  Snow, Birmingham, Ala. (No. 1).  </P> <P> Women's doubles: Monique Van Den Bosch of the Netherlands (No. 2) and Jan  McMorran of England (No. 8).  </P> <P> Women's singles: Monique Van Den Bosch.  </P> <P> Men's singles: Randy Snow.  </P></p>

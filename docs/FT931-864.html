			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Distiller is reviving the spirit of Hungary AFTER more than 40 years in exile, Mr Peter Zwack is back in Hungary making the liqueur which five generations of his family developed into the country's most popular drink. Zwack Unicum, a blend of more than 40 herbs and spices, was introduced in 1790. Known as 'the stomach fortifier,' it became a favourite tipple at the court of the Habsburgs, and between the world wars won increasing recognition in international markets. Mr Zwack intends to restore the company to its pre-communist eminence in the international spirits markets, with its liqueur, drunk as an aperitif or a digestive, ranked alongside the Underberg and Fernet Branca brands. Next month, Zwack plans a public offering of 25 per cent of its shares. Negotiations are also well advanced for the sale of a further 25 per cent stake to an unnamed international spirits group. The Hungarian company, with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 50m, will be listed on the Budapest and Vienna stock exchanges. Mr Zwack, in London yesterday to meet potential investors, said the group would increasingly concentrate on the production of high quality branded products and developing its exports. The public offering of 500,000 shares, which is being handled by Creditanstalt Securities, should raise 1bn-1.25bn forints (Dollars 11.6m-Dollars 14.5m). Forty per cent of the shares are expected to go to Hungarian investors, and the rest to international institutions. Mr Zwack and Mr Emil Underberg, owner of a German spirits company and partner in the purchase of Zwack from the state, will retain majority control. Having waited since 1948 to regain his heritage, Mr Zwack has no intention of losing it again. When the communists seized the family's distilleries in 1948, Peter Zwack fled the country with the secret recipe for the liqueur, settling first in the US and later in Italy. He was one of the first Hungarian businessmen to return home as the communist regime crumbled in 1989. Within a year, the partners restarted production of the liqueur, and in 1991, they bought the state-owned Budapest Liquor Company, the country's largest spirits producer, which had been making its own version of Unicum.</p>

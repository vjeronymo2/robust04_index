			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) --  Organisations of Japan denounced the authorities' anti-DPRK and  anti-Chongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan] campaign.    The 16th general meeting of the Miyazaki prefectural  committee for supporting the independent and peaceful  reunification of Korea adopted a letter of request to the prime  minister of Japan. The request said that to make a fuss over  the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK while covering up the nuclear  suspicion against Japan is obviously part of the hostile policy  toward Korea. It strongly demanded that the Japanese Government  pursue a policy of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of  the Korean peninsula and improvement of relations between Japan  and the DPRK and immediately stop controlling and suppressing  Chongnyon and Korean residents in Japan.    The Ibaraki prefectural headquarters of the all-Japan  prefectural and municipal workers' union in a statement adopted  at the 11th meeting of its executive committee on May 20  denounced the search of the Osaka organisation of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by Japanese  police under the pretext of "interference in the execution of  duties" as an unreasonable political repression and demanded  that the authorities immediately stop suppressing Chongnyon and  rectify their hostile policy toward Korea.</p>

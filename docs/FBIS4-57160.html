			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sandra Vergara from the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] President Cesar Gaviria has not regressed regarding  the elimination of sanctions for personal drug use. Today, he  warned the ruling of the Constitutional Court does not affect  the struggle against drug trafficking.    Today, the president of the republic, speaking at the  General  Santander National Police Academy, made categorical remarks on  the elimination of sanctions for personal drug use. He said he  does not agree with this decision because several fundamental  rights are at stake, including the right to security and  tranquillity of Colombians.    [Begin Gaviria recording in progress] ...who believe that  the  interpretation of Article 16 of our Constitution, which contains  the right to personal independence, cannot be taken to extremes  bringing us to an individualistic society. In this case,  various rights come into conflict and the Court should have  pondered the value of each right, should have tried to reconcile  them, and should not have disregarded the rights to security,  health, and tranquillity of Colombians.    The government believes that carrying and consuming drugs  for  personal use should continue to be prohibited. [end recording]    The president of the Republic concluded that severe  restrictions will be adopted so that drug consumption will not  take place in public places, schools, or universities, or so  that drugs will not be consumed by minors, pregnant women, or by  people doing jobs involving dangerous activities.</p>

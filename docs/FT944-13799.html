			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / French blood sport: Mitterrand must be amused by the conservatives' back-stabbing The frenzied struggle be-tween rival rightwing politicians in France, ahead of next year's presidential election, has now reached a pitch of ferocity that would be hilarious if it were not so murderous. Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR Gaullist party, is desperately trying to shove himself ahead of Mr Edouard Balladur, the Gaullist prime minister; Mr Balladur is equally desperately trying to shoulder aside Mr Chirac; and former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF grouping, is trying to outmanoeuvre both of them. None of these rivals is yet an official candidate. But the struggle has gone so far between the two Gaullists, that their henchmen are already rounding up rival supporters among the Gaullists in the National Assembly. In one camp are those who support Mr Chirac because, as leader of the party, he has a legitimate claim on the candidacy; in the other are those who support Mr Balladur because they think he has a better chance of winning. Last week Mr Balladur invited Mr Chirac and Mr Giscard d'Estaing to meet him at the prime minister's office. His declared object was to negotiate an end to mutual backbiting; but his purpose was also to assert his political ascendancy as leader of the government. Of course, his invitation was turned down. Mr Giscard d'Estaing issued a chilling communique: he would think about it. Mr Chirac tried to turn the tables, by issuing a counter-invitation of his own, calling on Mr Balladur to pay him a visit in his capacity as party leader. Mr Balladur studiously ignored this invitation. The confrontation recalls a medieval face-off between king and pope, with Mr Balladur representing the temporal power, and Mr Chirac the spiritual. It is the peculiar consequence of a political and a party system which does not have a recognised method of choosing between rival presidential candidates. President Francois Mitterrand said last week that he is more 'interested' than 'amused' by the back-stabbing on the right. One must assume that advancing age has robbed him of what used to be a mordant sense of humour. It is only 18 months since the forces of the right inflicted a crushing defeat on his Socialist party, and swept to a majority in parliament. It is hard to believe that Mr Mitterrand has not been enjoying some cackles at the spectacle of the conservatives tearing themselves apart in the struggle for the presidential succession. This struggle is increasing the pressure on Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, to enter the contest as the candidate of the left. Until recently, opinion polls showed him winning against Mr Chirac but losing against Mr Balladur. But now Mr Balladur's rating has tumbled, probably as a result of the corruption scandals affecting members or former members of his government. So it now looks as if Mr Delors could have a good chance of defeating either Mr Chirac or Mr Balladur, or both. Officially, Mr Delors is non-committal. He has said repeatedly that he is far too involved with his job in Brussels to start getting agitated about running for another job in France, when success is uncertain and there is in any case still plenty of time to make a decision. But many people in France, especially on the left, are starting to believe that he will be unable to resist the pressure to stand. Mr Delors is no doubt flattered to be solicited, especially by those socialists who always despised him for being too right wing; after 10 years in Brussels he has become a grand international figure; and to come home to the presidency would be the ultimate accolade of a public career. And yet I just wonder if he will really go for the prize. Last weekend, in Leiden in the Netherlands, he was presiding over a seminar about the future of Europe, attended by some 120 European intellectuals - professors, doctors, lawyers, sociologists, philosophers and the like. They were talking about such large subjects as identity, democracy and work. In practical terms, it was hard to say what it all added up to. On the other hand, the event was a revealing symbol of Mr Delors's attitude to politics and Europe. He believes politicians should hear what the intellectuals have to say; and just as important, should mobilise the intellectuals in the European cause. On Europe, Mr Delors is a conviction politician; he believes that the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference must face the fundamental political questions of Europe's ultimate destination. His convictions must be urging him to stand for president; that way he could press forward the European enterprise from Paris, as he has done from Brussels over the past 10 years. The problem is that Mr Delors apparently believes that France today is 55 per cent conservative. If he were to be elected president, precedent suggests he would dissolve the National Assembly, in the hope that his own election would help swing the voters behind the Socialist party. But if he is right that France is 55 per cent conservative, he would still be faced with a hostile conservative majority. And that would be a hard prospect for a man embarking on the presidency at the age of 69. If Mr Delors did not stand, he would remove the chief incentive for the conservatives to unite behind a single candidate; by staying aloof, he would maximise the odds that the Gaullists would split themselves asunder on the rock of personal ambition. But perhaps next spring the polls will persuade him that France is only 49 per cent conservative.</p>

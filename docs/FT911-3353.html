			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: The stop-go schools of motoring Sir, If the Cambridgeshire County Council would like to see a real traffic jam ('Paying the price of traffic jams', April 22), I suggest they visit Japan. They might also learn that loading motorists with an ever increasing array of charged penalties or other obstacles makes not a scrap of difference.

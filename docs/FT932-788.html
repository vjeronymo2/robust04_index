			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Money Markets: No co-ordinated cuts THE downward trend in European interest rates was given a small boost yesterday, when the Portuguese central bank became the latest European bank to reduce its key money rate, writes Gillian Tett. The Bank of Portugal cut its rate for absorbing money liquidity by 0.75 per cent to 10.25 per cent. But in the wake of the political controversy that has surrounded the French and German authorities' plans for interest rate cuts, it was speculation about the Bundesbank's plans for interest rate cuts that continued to dominate European money markets. Earlier in the week comments from Mr Edmond Alphandery, French finance minister, had fuelled speculation that Germany and France might be seeking a co-ordinated reduction in interest rates. But Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, yesterday sought to squash these rumours. With both Germany and France now facing mounting pressure for interest rate cuts, the mood in the markets yesterday remained fairly buoyant, with many traders still believing that the Bundesbank could cut rates next week. Although some traders interpreted Mr Alphandery's actions this week as evidence of the French intention to cut interest rates irrespective of the Germans, others pointed out that the Bank of France could not sustain interest rates that were lower than German rates for long. Amid the speculation and uncertainty, German futures drifted downwards amid a day of heavy trading, with the September contract for the Euro D-Mark closed at 93.10 per cent, around 13 basis points below its opening position. The London markets remained fairly quiet, in spite of a statement yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor indicating that the British Government had no plans for interest rate cuts. 'Although there were a lot of hopes about a rate cut earlier, that has all really faded now,' explained one dealer, who predicted that the British money markets were now 'in for a long, boring summer,' with technical factors serving as the main reason for market movement. After forecasting a shortage of 1.35bn, the Bank of England later removed almost all of this during the course of the day.</p>

Weight of evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> A ``weight of evidence'' approach to identifying an agent as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a neurotoxic hazard is almost always necessary. With the exception of therapeutic products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a single, complete, controlled study of an agent's effects on the nervous system, conducted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an appropriate representative sample of humans, is rarely, if ever, possible. Rather, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals charged with identifying hazard are usually confronted with a collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imperfect studies, often providing conflicting data (Barnes and Dourson, 1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several possible approaches, depending on the quality of the evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two examples are the use of data from only the most sensitive species tested and the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data from only species responding most like the human for any given endpoint. In assessing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity of therapeutic products, when human data are available and neurotoxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoints detected in animals can be clinically measured, the human findings supersede those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the nonclinical data base. Assuming that all available evidence is to be included,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations necessary for formulating a conclusion include the relative weights that should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be given to positive and negative studies. Sometimes positive studies are given more weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than negative ones, even when the quality of the studies is comparable. Experimental design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors such as the species tested, the number and gender of subjects evaluated, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of the test are given different weights when data from different studies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined. The route of exposure in a given study and its relevance to expected routes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human exposure are often a weighted factor. The issue of statistical significance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently debated. Some argue that an effect occurring at a statistically insignificant level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may nevertheless represent a biologically or toxicologically significant event, and should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> afforded the same weight as if the finding were statistically significant. In general, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only statistically significant measures should be considered in hazard identification. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power of various statistical measures is also considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5.2.2. Dose-Response Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In the second step of the risk assessment process, the dose-response assessment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the extent of damage or toxicity and dose of a toxic substance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various conditions of exposure is determined. Because several different kinds of responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be elicited by a single agent, more than one dose-response relationship may need to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed (e.g., neurochemical and morphological parameters).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When quantitative human dose-effect data are not available for a sufficient range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures, other methods must be used to estimate exposure levels likely to produce adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects in humans. In the absence of human data, the dose-response assessment may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on tests performed in laboratory animals. Evidence for a dose-response relationship is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an important criterion in assessing neurotoxicity, although this may be based on limited data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from standard studies that often use only three dose groups and a control group (Barnes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dourson, 1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most frequently used approach for risk assessment of neurotoxicants and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncancer endpoints is the uncertainty- or safety-factor approach (Barnes and Dourson, 1988;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kimmel, 1990). For example, within the EPA, this approach involves the determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference doses (RfDs) by dividing a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty factors that presumably account for interspecies differences in sensitivity (Barnes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Dourson, 1988). Generally, an uncertainty factor of 10 is used to allow for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially higher sensitivity in humans than in animals and another uncertainty factor of 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is used to allow for variability in sensitivity among humans. Hence, the RfD is equal to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOAEL divided by 100. If the NOAEL cannot be established, it is replaced by the lowest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) in the RfD calculation and an additional uncertainty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of 10 is introduced (i.e., the RfD equals the LOAEL divided by 1000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If more than one effect is observed in the animal bioassays, the effect occurring at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowest dose in the most sensitive animal species and gender is generally used as the basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimating the RfD (OTA, 1990). Sometimes, different RfDs can be calculated, depending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on endpoint or species selected. Selection of safety factors may be influenced by several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations, including data available from humans, weight of evidence, type of toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insult, and probability of variations in responses among susceptible populations (e.g., very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> young or very old). Established guidelines have been accepted by several agencies that use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety-factor approach to account for intraspecies variability, cross-species extrapolation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and exposure duration. In some instances, comparisons between these predicted values and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimental data have been conducted and the results appear comparable for some selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples (Dourson and Stara, 1983; McMillan, 1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The uncertainty-factor approach is based on the assumption that a threshold does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist, that there is a dose below which an effect does not change in incidence or severity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The threshold concept is complicated and controversial. As described by Sette and MacPhail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1992), there are several different ways in which the term threshold is used. Thresholds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined, in part, by the limit of detection of an assay. As the sensitivity of the analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method or bioassay is improved, the threshold might be adjusted downward, indicating that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the true threshold had not been previously determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another problem inherent with an observation of no discernible effects at low doses is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is impossible to determine whether the risk is actually zero (i.e., the dose is below a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold dose) or whether the statistical resolving power of a study is inadequate to detect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small risks (Gaylor and Slikker, 1992). Every study has a statistical limit of detection that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depends on the number of individuals or animals involved. For example, it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively unusual to conduct an experiment on a neurotoxicant with as many as 100 animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per dose. If no deleterious effects were observed in 100 animals at a particular dose, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be concluded that this dose level is below the threshold dose. However, we can only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be 95 percent confident that the true risk is less than 0.03. That is, if 3 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals in a population actually develop a toxic effect at this dose, there is a 5 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chance that a group of 100 animals would not show any effect. The observation of no toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects in an extremely large sample of 1,000 animals only indicates with 95 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence that the true risk is less than 0.003, etc. Because thresholds cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realistically demonstrated, they are therefore assumed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Dollar sector demand remains high THE FLOW of new issues in the dollar sector showed little sign of abating yesterday as underwriters rushed to take advantage of demand which the World Bank's oversubscribed Dollars 1.5bn global offering last week had failed to satisfy. However, the US Treasury market continued to weaken yesterday, creating a more uncertain environment. In addition, dealers were worried by increasingly ambitious yield spreads. Credit Local's Dollars 500m 10-year deal, launched on Friday by Deutsche Bank, was officially priced at a spread of 28 basis points above the comparable US Treasury, while Denmark tapped the market for Dollars 200m of five-year paper priced to yield 20 basis points above the five-year Treasury. Both deals were considered very aggressively priced - a good 5 basis points too tight, according to many dealers - and at current levels could prove a hard sell. Such pricing requires traders to take a view on the market: if the market moves favourably, the paper could become attractive. But with spreads at historically tight levels, partly because of pent up demand for current coupon paper, dealers are unsure how great a premium investors will pay for paper trading at or below par. Last week's World Bank offering of 10-year bonds tightened further yesterday to just four basis points above the US Treasury. Demand from Italian investors, for whom these bonds are tax exempt, may have boosted it. Swiss Bank Corporation, which arranged the Denmark deal, reported demand from Swiss retail investors, as well as institutional players. A Dollars 300m 12-year deal for the Republic of Austria, to be officially priced today, was launched yesterday at an indicated spread of 30 basis points above the 7 1/2 per cent Treasury and considered fairly priced. Traders said it should be comfortably placed, reflecting continuing demand for dollar securities at the right price. Meanwhile, a CDollars 1.5bn 10-year global deal for Ontario Hydro proved the most successful offering of the day, meeting strong demand in Japan, Europe and Canada. The deal was considered very fairly priced at 74 basis points above the comparable Canadian government bond. A CDollars 250m five-year deal for Deutsche Bank Finance met solid demand. Interest in Canadian dollar Eurobonds is boosted by a relative bulge in redemption payments of CDollars 3.6bn this month. In the D-Mark sector, the Kingdom of Norway brought a DM1bn five-year deal, silencing rumours of an offering in dollars or Ecu. Although the pricing was rather on the aggressive side, some institutional investors were attracted by the strength of the credit and the rarity of the name. Elsewhere, Britannia Building Society became the fourth UK building society to issue permanent interest bearing shares or Pibs. The Pounds 60m of notes are only convertible into Pibs provided a rule change is passed at the society's general meeting in April. This form of issue, completed for the first time, may have allowed the society to access the market before other potential borrowers. Investors will hold higher-ranking debt if the agreement is not passed. Elsewhere, Credit National launched a FFr2bn issue of seven-year bonds via Credit Commercial de France. Denmark is planning to launch an Ecu1bn offering of bonds listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange this year. The deal will be designed to target an audience of foreign investors, and will be underwritten mainly by foreign banks.</p>

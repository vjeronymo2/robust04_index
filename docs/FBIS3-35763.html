"Nothing is impossible in our world. A diplomat who says  that something is impossible, in principle is not a diplomat,"  he said.    He believes that the current Russian government is as  reform-oriented as its predecessor. "The Cabinet has only been  reorganized, so the current government is old, not new. That is  why the Cabinet's membership will not be submitted to the State  Duma for endorsement," said Kozyrev.    He noted that some of the departments had been reorganized.  "New appointments have been made and some of the Cabinet members  have been given a new status, say, a deputy prime minister has  become a minister. This does not mean, however, that the  government is new," he said.    Kozyrev emphasized that as before the Russian government  would promote reforms and that Russia's foreign policy will  definitely remain unchanged.    He told journalists who accompanied him on his way from  China  to Moscow that from the beginning he had not considered Gaydar's  resignation a necessity.    "I had serious doubts about this. I told Gaydar right away  that I respected his personal and political reasons. After all,  everyone has the right to long-range tactical and strategic  moves. However, taking into account prospects for the  democratic movement and the results of the recent parliamentary  elections, I thought that Gaydar should have stayed in the  government to defend his views. The democratic potential should  not have been weakened, particularly after a relative defeat  during the elections," said Kozyrev.    He pointed out that the "practice of resignation" would  hardly strengthen the democratic movement. Precisely because of  this, he has spoken out for a mediatory stance.    "I consider both my co-thinkers," he said referring to  Gaydar  and Chernomyrdin. "Yegor Gaydar's resignation from Yeltsin's  reformatory team was a shock for me," he said.    To quote Kozyrev, disputes do occur in the government and a  minister may find it difficult to defend his point of view.  "But after set-backs, one may raise the same question once  again. This is what I told Gaydar," said Kozyrev.    He expressed hope that after Gaydar's resignation, the  democrats would regroup their forces.    "It is the democrats' duty to tell the people what happened  during the elections and what they are going to do in connection  with this. The type of reform based exclusively on Boris  Yeltsin's popularity is no long viable. Reformers, particularly  the democrats who intend to form up a government, must win a  mandate of their own during elections," said Kozyrev.    He said that the relative defeat during the recent elections  would lead not only to a chain of dramatic resignations, but  also to a dramatic self-analysis in the democratic camp.

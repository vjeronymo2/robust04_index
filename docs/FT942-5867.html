			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wolseley expands with Dollars 42m US buy Wolseley, the heating and plumbing merchant, is expanding its photographic equipment distribution business with the purchase of Calumet Holdings of the US for Dollars 42.3m (Pounds 28m). Wolseley is already the leading distributor of professional photographic equipment in Europe and believes the deal will make it the largest supplier in the world. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, said that Chicago-based Calumet's expertise in mail order made it particularly attractive for Wolseley. 'We are interested in developing mail order and believe it may be appropriate for some of our other businesses.' Calumet, which is being acquired debt-free, made an operating profit of Dollars 5.06m on sales of Dollars 62.8m last year. Mr Lancaster said that Wolseley was paying about 12.5 times after tax profits and that the deal would enhance group earnings per share. Wolseley, which has a policy of funding acquisitions with shares, is raising Pounds 55m from a placing of shares with institutions at 748p. The new shares, which represent almost 2.9 per cent of the share capital, will also fund a number of further bolt-on acquisitions. Wolseley first moved into photographic equipment distribution in 1986 when it acquired Grovewood Securities from BAT Industries. This included a leading distributor, Pelling, which Wolseley subsequently expanded with the purchase of its rival Keith Johnson. Mr Lancaster said buying Calumet would improve the group's purchasing terms and make it a more attractive outlet for manufacturers. See Lex</p>

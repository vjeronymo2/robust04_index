			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing is to launch a nationwide campaign next  month to educate workers on the importance of industrial safety.    According to official statistics, at least 19 people were  killed in 17 industrial accidents in the first quarter of this  year in Beijing. The death toll was, however, significantly  lower than the 27 recorded during the corresponding period last  year. Officials said many of this year's victims were  inexperienced workers under the age of 35.    Last year, Shanghai witnessed a 50 percent surge in  industrial casualties, despite repeated cautions from the  Government. Labour officials said industrial accidents were  expected to soar as a result of the increase in the number of  migrant workers from rural areas arriving in big cities such as  Beijing and Shanghai. Many of these migrants were farmers who  had no experience in carrying out industrial work.    The lack of safety measures at building sites was a major  cause of concern. In Shanghai, three workers were buried alive  while working on an underground drainage project. Government  officials said that most migrant workers were not aware of their  legal rights with regard to a safe work environment. Many  employers failed to comply with safety requirements laid down by  the Government.    The officials said although the Beijing Municipal Government  had issued regulations four years ago requiring enterprises to  provide a seven-day course on industrial safety for new workers,  this was seldom carried out. A study in Shanghai found that  only two out of 17 township enterprises surveyed had set aside  special funds -- as the law requires for improving safety  measures. Some enterprises preferred investing in office  modernisation to improving safety.</p>

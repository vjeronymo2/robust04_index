			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: 600 jobs to be axed in shake-up at Seeboard SEEBOARD, distributor of electricity for the south-east of England, is to cut its headquarters staff by a fifth in one of the most significant decentralisation programmes implemented by an electricity company since privatisation. Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, announced the changes yesterday along with up to 600 job losses, boardroom changes and the appointment of a consultancy to manage computing and information technology activities. From the middle of next year Seeboard will move its headquarters to Forest Gate, Crawley, West Sussex. The eventual aim is to have 100 headquarters staff, compared with 500 at the existing base in Hove. About 100 jobs will disappear and the remainder will be transferred to other locations. Mr Ellis said the headquarters move would reduce overheads and improve operational management and control of the businesses. This would be reinforced by the creation of three 'business streams', each to be run as a separate profit making business with 'clearer lines of accountability and responsibility'. The company will be divided into distribution, responsible for the cables network and overhead lines; supply, responsible for buying and selling electricity and gas; and business, responsible for retailing, electrical contracting and other activities. Customer services will support distribution and supply through three enlarged units at Hove, Croydon and Hythe. Three other units will close. The computing and IT activities are to be run by Andersen Consulting. Mr Ellis said between 500 and 600 job losses would take place over the next year or so from the existing staff of 5,600. The company was confident this could be achieved largely through voluntary means, in conjunction with retraining and redeployment. About 400 people over the age of 55 had already indicated a desire to leave. The board changes involve Mr John Quinn, 53, who becomes group finance director, Mr Len Jones, 61, managing director of distribution, Mr Stephen Gutteridge, 38, managing director of supply, and Mr John Weight, 45, managing director of the business group. Three of them are already boardroom members. Mr Weight will join the board in July. Mr Terry Boley and Mr Maunder Wide are retiring this year from their jobs as corporate strategy director and company secretary. Both are board members. Other management appointments are Mr Rod Danes, 46, as director of customer services, Mr Tony Smith, 43, director of resources and Mr Mike Nagle, 40, company secretary.</p>

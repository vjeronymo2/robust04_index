			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETICS PITCHER DAVE STEWART IS THE GENUINE ARTICLE  </P> <P> Dave Stewart did not go to Disneyland after the World Series. He did, however,  go see the kids at the Ossian Carr Clubhouse, a chipped, cracked Boys Club  house in Oakland, not far from where he was raised. Stewart went so many times,  in fact, that he lost count.  </P> <P> He also spent a lot of time at another Boys Club house in Oakland, went into  seven elementary and middle schools to talk to kids, went into a dozen other  schools gathering toys for the underprivileged at Christmas, helped organize  four fund-raisers for victims of the Bay Area earthquake and testified before a  Senate subcommittee on the necessities of sports for kids.  </P> <P> Oh, and he also put on a charity picnic that raised $35,000, helped run his  non-profit organization and spent countless hours on the schoolyards and  playgrounds where he was weaned, playing basketball and baseball and just  mingling. "If there was a softball game going on and they had an extra glove, I  played," Stewart said Wednesday in the Oakland Athletics' clubhouse at Memorial  Stadium.  </P> <P> You would think he did not leave enough time to keep his pitching arm in shape.  Wrong. Coming off a year in which he won 21 games and was named the World  Series' Most Valuable Player, he is off to a 4-0 start after beating the  Orioles the other night, looking very much on his way to his fourth straight  20-win season. Baseball does not have a more dependable pitcher right now.  </P> <P> "But when the average person comes up to me on the street," he said, "they tell  me that while what I'm doing on the ball field is great, what I'm doing off the  field, going back into the community and giving back, that's what the people  tell me they really appreciate the most."  </P> <P> In these difficult, cynical days, with millionaire ballplayers charging for  autographs and bubble-gum cards trading for hundreds of dollars, we have come  to suspect that publicists are behind stories of warm-hearted athletes. We have  seen too many stars who lectured on drugs wind up in detox. Our reflex is to  deny the genuine article when it comes along. But you can't deny Dave Stewart.  You just can't.  </P> <P> He is 33 years old, earning $3.5 million a year and standing at the top of his  profession, and he has a conscience the size of his paycheck. He doesn't carry  on with this altruistic agenda because it looks good in the newspapers or  because his agent told him it was a good idea. "I've been doing this all my  life," he said. "Why should I stop now?"  </P> <P> It's true. He worked for the Boys Club in Oakland from age 12 all the way  through high school -- today he is on the board of directors -- helping keep  the clubhouses safe and functioning. He kept at it in the off-season after he  signed a contract with the Dodgers in 1975 and trundled off to the minors.  "They called me assistant program director back then," he said. "They called  all the kids that."  </P> <P> After he reached the majors in the early '80s, he would come home to Oakland  after the season, call elementary schools and offer to come speak about  education and drugs. The schools didn't call him. He just wanted to do it.  </P> <P> "I know a lot of people today feel that athletes are people who forget where  they come from once they make something of themselves," he said. "I don't know  if that's true. I hear a lot of fans say it. But I don't claim to speak for the  whole game. All I know is my parents didn't raise me that way."  </P> <P> He grew up in East Oakland, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. His father  was a longshoreman who believed in hard work and didn't want Dave to play  baseball because it had no future. His mother worked at a cannery down the  block. The temptations of inner-city life were all around, but Stewart did not  submit.  </P> <P> "I had the chance to grow up and turn into a pretty bad adult," he said, "and I  didn't. The reason in large part is that I was involved in projects and  organizations and sports, and around the right people. I received. That's why I  give now. I received before I gave. To me, if someone gives you a present, it  doesn't seem right unless you give them something back."  </P> <P> He is able to give much more since his sudden evolution into an All-Star  pitcher. He had a 30-35 career record and had been released by the Phillies  when the A's gave him a tryout in the visitors' bullpen at Memorial Stadium in  May 1986. "(Former Orioles general manager) Hank Peters didn't even come down  for a free look," he said. Since that day, he has a 75-39 record.  </P> <P> One of the byproducts of his success is that he became sufficiently rich and  famous to start Kidcorp, a non-profit group that solicits corporate support for  children's causes. It also operates support programs for teen-age mothers, drug  education programs and special-education classes, and sponsors four Little  League teams, two softball teams, a track team, a dance group and a summer  camp.  </P> <P> Stories of his hands-on work with earthquake victims were widely circulated  last fall. Now he is lobbying against the return of the Raiders, his lifelong  favorite football team, to Oakland.  </P> <P> "The timing (of the Raiders' move) is just all wrong," he said. "The city  government is talking about cutting out high school sports programs, and we're  off guaranteeing the Raiders hundreds of millions of dollars. It stinks. The  priorities are all wrong. We have pressing problems that need to be addressed  in Oakland, problems that cities all over the country have. We should address  them."  </P></p>

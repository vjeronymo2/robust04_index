			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] "The PSI (Italian Socialist Party) is returning to  the fray with a new symbol (a rose will replace the carnation as  the party emblem) and with the necessary renewal of the men and  women who must lead it." This is how (party secretary)  Ottaviano Del Turco closed the "PSI General Assembly."    Reiterating "the clean and final break with the party's old  leadership," Del Turco said that the PSI's place is in the new  progressive alliance (dominated by Democratic Party of the Left,  PDS). PDS secretary Achille Occhetto arrived unexpectedly in  the conference hall.    The choices made by the PSI will be ratified at the party  conference to be held on 1 May.</p>

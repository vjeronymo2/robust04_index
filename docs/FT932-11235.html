			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unilever expansion in China UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, plans to expand its presence in China by building a fabric detergents plant and an ice cream factory with local partners. The total initial cost is Dollars 60m (Pounds 40m), which is likely to double in the near future. The detergents plant is being built by Unilever Shanghai, in which Unilever has 70 per cent and Shanghai Daily Chemical and Shanghai Detergents each hold 15 per cent. Unilever began selling imported Omo concentrated detergent in Shanghai in February and said the potential market for washing powder was huge. The ice cream factory will be built in Beijing by Wall's Beijing, 85 per cent owned by Unilever the state-owned Sumstar holding the balance. The factory will make products under the Wall's name. Unilever already has three joint ventures in the Shanghai region making soap and shampoo, bakery fats and skin care products. Mr Michael Perry, Unilever chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday that failure to settle the Uruguay Round of trade talks would damage recovery prospects in the industrialised world and retard progress in developing countries. He also said that if the European Community did not ratify the Maastricht Treaty, it would be a big setback for business. After ratification, however, a 'more realistic' timetable should be drawn up for economic and monetary integration.</p>

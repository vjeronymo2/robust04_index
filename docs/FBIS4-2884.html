			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Commenting  this afternoon on the view of Sino-British relations put forth  in the British House of Commons report, foreign ministry  spokesman Shen Guofang said that the section on Hong Kong, in  total disregard of the facts, actually tries to defend the  series of erroneous practices of Chris Patten on the Hong Kong  issue and supports him to continue along his mistaken path.    Shen Guofang said that China has not yet received the full  text of the report and that a detailed comment would be made  following a full study of the report.    On the question of the British side's request for a dialogue  with China on human rights, Shen replied that the Chinese  Government is always ready to maintain contact with the British  side based on equal footing and mutual respect. At the same  time, China also maintains contacts with many other countries on  the question of human rights. China holds that the concept of  human rights covers a great deal of ground. The Chinese  Government has declared on numerous occasions that it abides by  the World Declaration on Human Rights and will make its due  contribution to defending human rights and basic freedoms.  China is willing to carry out international cooperation on  human rights.</p>

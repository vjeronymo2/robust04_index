			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRIBUTE TO UCI'S DANIEL ALDRICH -- AN EDUCATOR AND RENAISSANCE MAN  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago I served as the president of our community association. In  those days, we sponsored a candidate forum before each election.  </P> <P> On the docket was a forum for the upcoming school board election and I thought,  "Wouldn't it be great to have the UC Irvine chancellor, Dan Aldrich, moderate  it."  </P> <P> Off went an invitation filled with slightly veiled references to civic duty but  anticipating a polite "No, thank you." Surprise! I received an immediate  telephone call of his acceptance and a request to come by my house to work out  the details.  </P> <P> We met, discussed the event and had a delightful time sharing our common  interest in growing things and our equally common interest in education. I, who  nearly missed the college experience, suddenly realized why he was doing such a  spectacular job at UCI. Fortunately, others discovered that talent long before  me.  </P> <P> Thanks, Dan. Thanks from all of us.  </P> <P> CLARENCE J. TURNER  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

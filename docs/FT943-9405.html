			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Union reverses to Pounds 0.79m deficit Union, the City discount house, yesterday recorded pre-tax losses of Pounds 793,000 for the first six months of this year. The result reversed its return to profitability at the 1993 year end after two unprofitable years. In particular, Union suffered trading losses of nearly Pounds 2m on its holdings of long-term gilt-edged securities and has decided to withdraw from running positions in those securities for its proprietary trading book. 'Having got it wrong for the best part of the first half of the year, we have decided that this is a business we should not be in, at least for the time being,' said Mr Ian Martin, managing director. He added that while all discount houses were involved in similar risk-based activities, Union's had been somewhat larger relative to its capital base. However, those losses were offset partly by profits of more than Pounds 1m in the group's traditional money market operations and newly developed arbitrage activities, which would be expanded further. 'Although we anticipate a profitable second half, the overall performance of the group will continue to be influenced by the underlying volatility of the markets while Union remains in this period of transition,' Mr Robin Herbert, chairman, said. Union, which raised Pounds 11m in a 2-for-5 rights issue in March, said it planned to diversify into financial services. The interim dividend is restored via a 1.5p payment. The shares lost 8p to 128p.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead - Results due THREE OF the largest composite insurers are set to be back in the black by an impressive margin when they they report their results for the first half of 1993 next week, underlining the recovery in the sector after recent losses. General Accident, the first company to report on Tuesday, is expected to register pre-tax profits of between Pounds 90m to Pounds 120m (compared with a Pounds 21.2m loss at the half way stage last year). The advance at Commercial Union, which reports on Wednesday, is expected to be only slightly less strong with a rise to between Pounds 45m and Pounds 75m, compared with a loss of Pounds 18.1m last time around. Royal Insurance, which reports on Thursday, is also expected to record profits of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 66m compared with a Pounds 79m loss last time. Falling losses from mortgage indemnity insurance and improving claims trends are the main reasons for the improvement, while companies are also benefiting from currency factors. Meanwhile, BOC's healthcare division is likely to come under the microscope when the company announces its nine-month figures on Tuesday. Pre-tax profits are expected to be between Pounds 262m and Pounds 275m, against Pounds 250.5m last time, largely helped by a Pounds 23m gain on currency movements. Slow-growing Smith and Nephew, the bandages-to-Nivea healthcare company, has long been eclipsed by spectacular profits from drug companies. But Thursday's interims should reveal profits growth of as much as 20 per cent to Pounds 77m, helped by the fall in sterling. Standard Chartered, which also reports on Thursday, is expected to post pre-tax profits of between Pounds 160m and Pounds 190m, against Pounds 64m in the first half of last year. Earnings per share are expected to rise to between 40p and 50p, against 4.2p. When Unilever reports on its second quarter on Friday, the market will focus on what the consumer giant says about competitive pressure. The shares have been hit hard in recent months by worries over price wars in the US. However, the figures themselves are likely to be reassuring, with pre-tax profit of Pounds 545m expected for the quarter versus Pounds 511m last time.</p>

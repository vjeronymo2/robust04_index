			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Site Designation Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commentors participating in the mass-mailing were concerned that EPA was ``fast-tracking'' the designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process for the ocean disposal site off San Francisco.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has expended considerable effort to ensure adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for public input in the site designation process. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site designation process is now in its fifth year, as public scoping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings began in 1989. The Ocean Studies Plan (OSP), which was the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blueprint for the extensive biological and oceanographic studies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterized the study region, was developed with the consensus of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Long Term Management Strategy (LTMS) Ocean Studies Work Group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (OSWG). The LTMS is comprised of Federal and State agencies, regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific experts, public interest and environmental groups. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the studies performed, EPA evaluated alternative sites and selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preferred alternative site with the consensus of the OSWG. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draft EIS was then noticed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and issued for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment in December, 1992. Following revisions to the EIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on comments received, the Final EIS was prepared and noticed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in September, 1993. A Proposed Rule to designate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preferred alternative site as described in the Final EIS was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noticed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and issued for public comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 17, 1994. In addition, the proposed Site Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for this ocean disposal site was issued for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment under a separate EPA Public Notice on April 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period for this Public Notice ended on June 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, EPA believes that ample opportunities have been provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for interested parties to comment throughout the site designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Need for Ocean Dumping <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentors stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to designate the site for a 50-year period and for up to 300  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million cubic yards of dredged material was not based on an evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the actual need for ocean disposal based on comprehensive regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning. Other commentors stated that it is unlikely that as much as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6 million cubic yards per year of sediments meeting ocean dumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria could be dredged from the contaminated San Francisco Bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Final Rule has been significantly revised regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site capacity. An interim site capacity of 6 million cubic yards per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year is being established from the date of site designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until December 31, 1996, only. Site capacity following December 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 will be determined based on either a comprehensive long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management strategy for management of dredged materials from San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Francisco Bay (a Long Term Management Strategy draft EIS is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under development, and is expected to be issued for public review in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the spring of 1996) or, should a comprehensive Long Term Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Strategy not be available by that date, on a separate alternatives-based EPA evaluation of the need for ocean disposal. This new site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity will be established via a separate formal rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The volume of sediment assumed in the site designation Final EIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Proposed Rule to be dredged from San Francisco Bay over the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 years (400 million cubic yards total) represents a planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate provided by the Corps. The actual volumes dredged over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next 50 years cannot be accurately predicted because the overall need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for dredging will depend on many factors, including: Commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping trends (i.e., continued use of Oakland as a major cargo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> port); decisions to initiate port expansions (i.e., for larger deep-draft vessels); changes in the use of closing military facilities; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources available to undertake these projects (i.e., availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds or Congressional authorizations for specific projects).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, for ocean site evaluation purposes, EPA assumed that 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million cubic yards per year (which equates to 80% of the assumed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredging average of 8 million cubic yards per year) would meet EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ocean Dumping criteria, and used this volume for modeling the fate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredged material disposed at the alternative ocean disposal sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results indicated that disposal of this volume would not result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant impacts at the proposed disposal site; therefore, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site is being designated with an interim capacity of up to 6 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cubic yards per year. Additional modelling would be necessary if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater annual disposal volume were to be proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No matter the nominal site capacity at any time, it should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that site designation is not a blanket approval for disposal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any dredged material at the site. The actual need for ocean dumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is determined on a project-by-project basis at the time of permitting:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each and every project must be individually reviewed to determine both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its need for ocean disposal and the suitability of its proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredged material for disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Alternatives Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentors stated that EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed to consider a range of alternatives to ocean dumping of dredged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material. Other commentors recommended that the ocean site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation be delayed until other disposal alternatives can be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> via the LTMS process).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has determined that there is an overall need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designate an ocean disposal site for the San Francisco Bay region at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the present time, based on the present lack of available upland and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial reuse sites, policies of the state agencies to generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further restrict disposal at in-Bay sites to maintenance dredging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects, impending plans for large new-work dredging projects, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited existing in-Bay disposal site capacity. However, as discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the ocean site is now being designated with an interim capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only, which will be reevaluated based on the results of comprehensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management planning efforts now underway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Consistency Wth International Agreements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wrote that the ocean disposal site designation ignores the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precautionary approach which the U.S. has adopted in the context of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several international agreements, because the site designation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unconditional except for a very large annual dumping limit for the 50-year period. These commentors recommended that there should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precautionary conditions for site use, including: (1) A waste audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate all possible options to reduce the amount of dredged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials to be dumped at the ocean site and reduce the contamination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those sediments; (2) implementation of pollution prevention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures for San Francisco Bay and its drainage basin to guarantee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that less contaminated sediments would be destined for the ocean site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the future; and (3) specific limitations on the contamination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels in sediments to be dumped at the site, with progressive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in those levels over 50 years so that the site will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eventually only receive uncontaminated sediments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Final Rule has been revised to establish an interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site capacity only. In addition, even this interim annual dumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit is only one of many conditions for site use. As noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site designation is not in itself a permit for ocean disposal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredged material. Each project must be reviewed on a case-by-case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis to determine suitability of the proposed dredged material for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ocean disposal and to determine the need for ocean dumping (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the availability of alternatives that reduce the amount of dredging).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives such as beneficial use will be encouraged wherever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable. This process of evaluating disposal options already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs and will continue during permit reviews. Nevertheless, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to project-by-project alternatives analyses, overall dredged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material management alternatives are being evaluated via the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State/Federal LTMS process on a programmatic basis. The project-by-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project need for ocean disposal will be reduced as alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ocean disposal (including beneficial re-use sites) become available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Another side of life / A look at the latest with-profits bonuses 'MORE LIFE offices announced their with-profit bonuses this week. The most interesting figures come from two companies which do not do much business through brokers. Their results seem to strengthen claims that earlier pay-outs from other offices have not been supported by investment results, but were aimed at drumming up new business. Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses, which specialises in products for the health care professions, saw ten-year pay-outs decline by 3.0 per cent from Pounds 7,943 to Pounds 7,705 (assuming Pounds 30 premiums per month were paid by a policyholder aged 29 at the outset). This is the highest ten-year figure yet announced, overtaking Pounds 7291 from Tunbridge Wells Equitable. The lowest pay-out, from Guardian Royal Exchange, is Pounds 5,022. For 25-year policies, pay-outs have increased by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 63,680, the second highest pay-out yet announced. RNPFN expects to pay Pounds 28m in maturities this year, of which more than 90 per cent are for ten-year policies. Royal London, a 'home service' company which does not deal through brokers, also announced a high ten-year pay-out, which fell from Pounds 7,628 to Pounds 7,323 using the same assumptions. Its 25-year pay-out remains unchanged at Pounds 63,797. This will drop to Pounds 62,014 on February 1. Royal London uses a slightly different bonus system from most of the industry, and these figures are an interim position. A further valuation will be made at the end of March, and new maturities will apply from the beginning of May. Unlike offices such as Norwich Union and Sun Alliance, Royal London does not have to cope with a big bulge of ten-year maturities this year - ten-year pay-outs account for 23 per cent of ordinary branch business up from 21.5 per cent. For the industrial branch, the figures are 20 per cent, following 15 per cent. Scottish Mutual, which is owned by Abbey National, kept reversionary bonuses unchanged, but cut interim bonuses which will apply during the next year. This led to a 4.7 per cent cut in ten-year pay-outs, down to Pounds 6,613, but a slight increase in 25-year maturity values from Pounds 54,787 on the last relevant date to Pounds 55,107. NPI, a pensions specialist office, announced substantially reduced bonuses. On pensions policies, the cuts concentrated on reversionary or annual bonuses, to reflect its reduced expectations for investment returns. The effect is cuts of around 6 per cent in pay-outs for regular premium pension plans, but this varies according to the term of the policy.</p>

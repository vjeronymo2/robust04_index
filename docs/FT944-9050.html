			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / RPI up 0.1% in October: Increase in base rates and mortgage costs causes rise in inflation but prices remain level for other goods The recent rise in base rates and mortgage costs pushed the inflation rate up last month. But this was partly offset by flat prices in most other categories of goods, suggesting that high street price competition remains intense in the approach to Christmas. Overall, the Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the all-items retail prices index, which takes 1987 as 100, rose to 145.2 in October. This was 0.1 per cent higher than in September, and 2.4 per cent higher than in October last year. Most of this increase stemmed from the rise in base rates in September, which pushed up mortgage interest payments and added 0.4 percentage points to the overall inflation index. The CSO said this effect was exacerbated by a rise in outstanding mortgage debt. Prices in most other areas were flat, or even fell. Consequently, if mortgage interest payments are stripped out of the index - the measurement favoured by the government - 'underlying' inflation fell slightly in the month, and was only 2.0 per cent higher than in the previous October, the same as in the previous month. This figure was better than City predictions. Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets said: 'This is another excellent set of inflation data.' He pointed out that the most favourable aspect of the data was that the price weakness was concentrated in the 'core' consumer areas and did not stem from erratic elements. With prices flat in both consumer goods and many service sectors, the data suggest that the discounting mentality seen in food retailing last year is increasingly spreading to other consumer areas. Motoring costs fell 0.5 per cent between September and October, due to lower petrol and secondhand car prices. Big secondhand cars, for example, were up to Pounds 200 cheaper. The price of household service dropped 1.1 per cent in the month, and 1.4 per cent in the year to October, reflecting lower telephone charges. Food prices were 1.1 per cent higher in October than the year before, largely because of intense supermarket discounting last autumn. But food prices were 0.2 per cent lower than in September. Although seasonal food prices rose, there was discounting on bread, beef, sweets and prepared meals. Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'It appears that retailers are entering a further round of aggressive price discounting.' Clothing and footwear fell by 0.1 per cent during the month, even though clothing and footwear prices have risen in October in previous years as a result of new stock. The CSO said: 'There appears to be a new mid-season sales effect creeping in.' Nevertheless, some analysts yesterday warned that these factors could be reversed in coming months. Mr Adam Cole, economist at James Capel said: 'Several factors . . . suggest that we are close to a turning point and we expect a modest upwards drift in all measures of core inflation from here.'</p>

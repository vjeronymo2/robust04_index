			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Nissan's investment at UK plant passes Pounds 1bn Nissan's car plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, has become the first Japanese manufacturing venture in Europe to invest more than Pounds 1bn. The plant is entering a new phase likely to create a further 25,000 direct and indirect jobs - mostly in the hard hit north-east - over the next 10-15 years, according to Mr Ian Gibson, chief executive of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK). Nissan's UK manufacturing operations, which today mark their 10th anniversary since the foundation stone was laid on the 800-acre Sunderland site, have taken spending past the Pounds 1bn mark by starting construction of a Pounds 33m axle-manufacturing plant and a further upgrading of vehicle painting and other facilities. The axle factory is due to start production in 1996, when a replacement for the current Primera range of medium-sized cars is introduced. When operational it will mean that Nissan UK will have virtually a fully integrated production facility, including foundry and pressings facilities. The only significant components still expected to be imported from Japan will be engine blocks and gearboxes, accounting for about 8 per cent of each car's value. Mr Gibson made his jobs prediction 24 hours after the new frigate HMS Richmond slipped down the nearby River Tyne. After 18 months in receivership, its builder, Swan Hunter, now appears unlikely to escape closure, and the shipbuilding that was the region's economic mainstay for many years will end. The additional 25,000 Nissan-related jobs will not come, in the main, from the Sunderland plant, although it is expected to increase capacity from 300,000 cars a year to 400,000 by the end of the decade. Instead they will come from additional industrial and commercial activities for which Nissan UK is already acting as the catalyst, Mr Gibson said. 'If you go to Stuttgart, for example, you see a great heap of companies that no longer look like automotive businesses but which needed the presence of Mercedes and Porsche to get them going: metal fabricators, toolmaking, design services, all providing an industrial infrastructure for a range of activities which would not otherwise have existed. 'We're only now starting that infrastructure stage in the north-east. It will be another 10 years in growing, but there is an enormous growth in economic activity to come.' Nissan companies on the site employ almost 5,000 people, with nearly 10,000 more jobs estimated to have been created in Nissan's 200 component suppliers, 130 of which are UK-based.</p>

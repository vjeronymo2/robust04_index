Knight.    He pointed out that 248 of those persons were foreigners,  some of whom were part of an international network.    Mr. Knight was speaking on Tuesday at the opening of a  seminar on laws and practices related to the seizure of assets  of convicted drug offenders, hosted by the Faculty of Law of the  University of the West Indies and the United Nations Drug  Control Programme at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in Kingston.    He said 35,325 kilograms of ganja, 151 kilograms of cocaine,  580 pieces of crack and 70 kilograms of hash oil were also  seized during the period. Seven vehicles used in drug related  crimes were also confiscated.    "A part of the horrendous violence that has afflicted the  world has a direct link to the trade. Deals go sour, people end  up dead. Abusers need money to satisfy their addiction, people  end up dead," said Mr. Knight. He said the struggle against drug  trafficking was tantamount to a war to preserve the nation's  health, the people's safety and the children's future.    The five-day seminar was aimed at educating police officers,  prosecutors and magistrates in the laws and practices related to  the seizure of assets in drug trafficking. Other seminars will  be held in Barbados, Belize, Grenada and Guyana.</p>

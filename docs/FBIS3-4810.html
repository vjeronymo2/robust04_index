			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa is to hold separate talks with other party leaders in  the ruling coalition to seek agreement on reshuffling his  cabinet, political sources said Tuesday.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference, however, that it is unclear whether Hosokawa will  have talks with the coalition leaders.    Hosokawa reiterated his hope for an early cabinet reshuffle,  saying he will make up his mind in a day or two on whether to  make changes.    He told a House of Representatives panel on political  reform,  that the government has time to change the nearly  seven-month-old cabinet as it has overcome its most difficult  tasks -- political reform and completing the Uruguay Round of  world trade talks.    Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party's  [SDP]  Diet Affairs Committee, told a news conference his party is  opposed to an immediate cabinet shake-up. "We believe now is  not an appropriate time," he said. He also said it is better to  wait until after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994 state budget,  expected in early may.    Hosokawa is considering drastically shaking up the cabinet  and his planned reshuffle is expected to center on removing  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from that key post.    Hosokawa formed the cabinet last August to carry out  political reforms, and he apparently thinks the cabinet will  have accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political  reform legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or  Friday, the sources said. The legislation was enacted in  January.    Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, who is also director  general of the Management and Coordination Agency, said he is  opposed to the meetings between Hosokawa and the other coalition  leaders, which the sources said could take place as early as  Tuesday.    Ishida said the prime minister has the right under the  Constitution to make changes in his cabinet.    Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito, one of the seven coalition  parties, said in a lecture to a group of SDP Diet members that  he opposes a "drastic cabinet reshuffle," which he said would  trigger political confusion. Despite his opposition to a  large-scale shake- up, he backs the removal of Takemura from his  post.    Hata said he understands moves to remove Takemura from his  present post, adding that a party head assuming the post of  chief cabinet secretary has a difficulty in helping a prime  minister as a close aide in the coalition government. Takemura  heads Sakigake, a coalition party with close ties with  Hosokawa's Japan New Party.    Hata, who is also deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, said party leaders do not necessarily share the prime  minister's views, as they belong to different parties.    For his part, Hata flatly denied he will assume the post of  chief cabinet secretary.    The coalition parties have split over Hosokawa's reshuffle  plan, with SDP, the Democratic Socialist Party and Sakigake  opposed to dumping Takemura, while Shinseito and Komeito support  the plan.    Meanwhile, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama reiterated his  opposition to an immediate cabinet reshuffle, saying Diet  passage of the national budget for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1  should be the top priority.    "It is necessary to have the budget passed through the Diet  as quickly as possible,'' he told a news conference. He said  Hosokawa ''should restrain himself and avoid a cabinet shake-up  at this time."    Murayama said he will reiterate his opposition to an early  cabinet reshuffle when he meets with Hosokawa later Tuesday.  The premier has yet to ask for a meeting, he added.    The SDP chief predicted Hosokawa will eventually have to  give  up his plan for an immediate reshuffle.    He said a cabinet shake-up should wait until after the  budget  program wins Diet approval.    Asked what he would do if asked to join a new cabinet,  Murayama said he has not given serious thought to such a  possibility, and that "I haven't heard any such proposal at all."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ex-Finance Minister Boris Fedorov by Yelena </F> Levina; date and place not stated: "Boris Fedorov Believes  Dollar Will Be Worth 10,000 Rubles"]    [Text] [Levina] Boris Grigoryevich, after some spasmodic  leaps, the rate of exchange for the dollar has risen quite  smoothly. Last year, your forecasts turned out to be by far the  closest to what actually happened. How do you evaluate the  prospects for and the situation with the regulation of the rate  of exchange by the Central Bank today?    [Fedorov] I think the rate of exchange would now be, maybe,  3,000 rubles [R] to the dollar but for attempts to restrain it.  But the reserves for restraint are almost exhausted. If we get  the $1.5 billion from the West on which the talks with  [International Monetary Fund Managing Director] M. Camdessus  centered, then, of course, they will be thrown onto the market.  And this will retard the process further. But I am sticking to  the forecast I made in December: It is perfectly feasible that  the exchange rate may be R10,000 to the dollar by the end of the  year.    By restraining the exchange rate the Central Bank has, so to  speak, gone against its own nature. Now it is even letting the  premier down in some respects. Because a certain amount of  credit, for instance, has been held back deliberately. In  reality, there are between 2 and 3 trillion in liquid money on  the market, and if you reduce the volume of credit issued, then  this is sufficient to affect the rate of exchange. But any  forecasts are made on the assumption that the Central Bank and  the government will not fix the rate.    [Levina] Do you consider this realistic?    [Fedorov] I think it is doubtful, because this would be a  blatant deviation from market principles. But now, as you can  see, those in the upper echelons are trying with all their might  to show that the reforms are continuing, and that there will be  no deviation. And as soon as they fix prices, the exchange  rate, or drastically cut, say, interest rates, or remove  something or other from commercial banks, it will be impossible  to preserve the image of reformers. But nevertheless,  Chernomyrdin is somehow trying to maneuver between two  rockfaces: nodding approval to one side, and not moving too far  away from those on the other. But, as we know, a person cannot  be in two places at once....    [Levina] And what can be said about the crux of the question  on the liquidation of commercial banks?    [Fedorov] Ultimately, roughly one-half of all banks will  disappear or merge with others, and this is a fact. After all,  even today many major banks survive only at the expense of state  funds. A huge quantity of preferential credits and subsidies is  released via commercial banks, and this keeps them afloat. A  whole series of very well-known banks are actually giants with  feet of clay -- and these are banks which are particularly  friendly with the Central Bank.    But those on less friendly terms with the Central Bank are  far stronger, because they have drummed up real business, they  have a genuine clientele, stable resource sources.    Take, for instance, the "Stolichnyy" Bank -- it is fiercely  unpopular with the Central Bank. The "Stolichnyy" managers may  or may not be likable, but the fact is that this bank will not  go under because it is engaged in specific financial business.    And there are other banks which deal in specific business  and have their own reliable sources. But those banks -- even  very respectable and famous ones -- with a balance sheet showing  between 75 and 80 percent centralized resources will be the  first to go under because they are not competitive. This even  concerns certain banks in, say, the oil and gas industry. But,  I hear you cry, this is where all the state money and resources  are, surely? But I get the feeling that some of them are  breathing their last. While oil workers had a lot of money --  they prospered. But when the need arises to do business, to  seek out depositors -- then they are weak.    [Levina] Right now, at a time when the discussion of the  budget is under way, everybody is concerned by one question:  Will the same type of monstrous inflation witnessed last year  continue in 1994? Why are such diverse figures cited on this  score in official documents?    [Fedorov] When a situation emerges whereby on virtually the  very same day the president says inflation will be between 3 and  5 percent by the end of the year and the premier says it will be  between 7 and 9 percent (while at the same time naming  percentages of 10, 14, and 15 in various speeches), this means  that they have lost their bearings and there is no clear policy.    In principle, were we to set ourselves a limit of 3 percent,  this could be done without any problems. This does not require  any new discoveries, and no IMF will ever tell us anything new,  no matter who's in charge there. Everything the IMF knows, we  know ourselves.    [Levina] So what is the problem?    [Fedorov] This is a question of political will, and that  alone. It is quite possible to stop the printing presses for a  month. But this is painful. Likewise, it is perfectly feasible  to cease emissions for six months. It is essential to look at  which expenditure is inefficient. A great deal of it! And I  have repeatedly suggested halting the issue of government  decrees such as, for instance, the one on setting up an  organizing committee to mark the 300th anniversary of a small  boat belonging to Peter the Great. There is no need to spend  millions on this nowadays!    But there are dozens of these decrees. They represent the  whim of useless administrative bodies. From government bodies  downward. Why are there so many departments? Or what does the  so-called center for information science policy under the  government do? Of the 1,000 people making up the government  apparatus, I believe that 700 could be pruned. And why are  there 10 telephones on every bureaucrat's desk? You know, this  means at least five types of specialist communications  facilities. What for? There is a very great deal of  unnecessary expenditure in our country. Resources are  squandered with frightening gusto.    In the last six months I have made repeated representations  to Chernomyrdin to tear apart the expenditure base of the budget  with an iron hand, and I brought him a list of 60 senseless  decrees which ought to be abolished in view of the huge and  unnecessary expenditure entailed by them. He referred them  repeatedly to the government for examination, and discussions  were organized. On several occasions the premier even took up a  pen to sign something, but was then unable to do it. As a  result, everything boiled down to the suspension of just one law  on land, which was highly offensive and "cost" 100 trillion....    [Levina] Tell me, how are planned volumes of emissions  determined in practice?    [Fedorov] There is a very specific correlation: The  percentage growth of emissions in the next quarter must be lower  than the rate of inflation in the previous quarter. Now,  however, we are officially preparing for the second quarter with  a growth in emissions which is not lower but higher than  previous-quarter inflation. That is, the spiral is twisting  toward even greater inflation....    [Levina] Why?    [Fedorov] There are solid lobby interests in parliament.  Each group is fighting to increase expenditure on a particular  budget item.    And for some reason, nobody senses that by increasing the  deficit you are making the country's position worse.    [Levina] Does the Central Bank have too few powers?    [Fedorov] On the contrary. In our country the Central Bank  even has somewhat more powers than should really be available to  any normal Central Bank. It deals with payment transactions and  sundry other things, and if it were to be given the chance to  offer credits directly too -- well, then there would be a lot of  very happy people there. The oversight of banks is their  favorite job. Because the psychology of old State Bank staffers  -- to engage in small, specific matters -- is irrepressible.    [Levina] What, in your view, should the Central Bank be  doing in principle?    [Fedorov] In any country the department of the Central Bank  involves itself in two things: First, economic analysis, on the  basis of which it gives the center a signal to rectify monetary  and credit policy. Second, cash in hand. In some places the  oversight function also exists. But this differs from country  to country. But just you try to ask the following question of a  Central Bank representative in any region of our country: "How  do you analyze the economic situation in the region?"    And he will immediately begin to complain to you about the  sowing campaign, the railroads, the problems besetting  enterprises, and that his ceiling is low and credits cannot be  issued. And then it becomes clear: That is not what I would  call a Central Bank.    But without this, without the precisely and intelligently  calculated guidelines and a firm political will to reduce the  budget deficit, inflation and impoverishment cannot be halted.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wm Baird suffers setback to Pounds 25m A DEEPENING recession in clothing and engineering left William Baird's pre-tax profits 25.7 per cent lower for the year to end-December at Pounds 25.1m. The closure of several businesses, largely in the Darchem engineering operation, were reflected in extraordinary charges of Pounds 3.89m (Pounds 428,000). 'We have no plans to announce further closures,' said Mr Donald Parr, chairman, yesterday. Earnings per share emerged sharply lower at 16.5p (24.1p). The dividend is maintained at 8.9p with an unchanged final of 5.35p. This is the first time dividend cover has been less than twice since the recession of 1981. Current trading remained difficult. 'There is no evidence of any real recovery in the UK,' said Mr Parr. 'The group is not anticipating an early end to the recession.' The proceeds from last year's Pounds 39m rights issue have not yet been spent on the promised acquisitions and gearing fell 26.2 per cent to 3 per cent. Overall group turnover rose from Pounds 519.6m to Pounds 532.8m, but this masked a sharp fall in sales by Darchem. Orders dried up especially in the automotive and building services sectors. Turnover fell to Pounds 113.1m (Pounds 120.2m) and operating profits were reduced to Pounds 7.9m (Pounds 12.8m). Textiles held up relatively well, helped partly by a growing share of Marks and Spencer's sales. The company cut costs by sourcing a greater proportion of its garments outside the UK. Turnover rose to Pounds 419.8m (Pounds 399.4m), although operating profits slipped to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 27.1m). Clothing margins were additionally hit by the company having to absorb a proportion of the increase in VAT imposed in the 1991 budget. Within branded products, Dannimac rainwear increased both turnover and profits because of 'a better balance between capacity and demand' and a move towards higher unit prices. COMMENT Baird's businesses in textiles and engineering went into recession together and late. They will be among the last to recover too because clothing and insulation are downstream operations in their respective sectors. But while business is bad, finances are good. The company could eliminate borrowings entirely this year as cash flows into the business. Last year's harsh cost cutting should be replaced this year by a judicious acquisition or two - good timing from the point of view of the business cycle. Profits are set to recover modestly to about Pounds 31m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of 11.5, about 10 per cent less than the market. Baird is being cushioned from the worst of the recession by being one of Marks and Spencer's favoured suppliers. But it remains the textile sector's biggest play on a UK recovery and the shares are therefore good value only in the long term.</p>

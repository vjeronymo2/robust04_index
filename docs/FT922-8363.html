			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / BP sells Canadian stake for CDollars 374m BRITISH Petroleum, in the wake of disappointing results last week, is selling its 57 per cent stake in its Canadian subsidiary BP Canada for CDollars 374m (Pounds 174m). The move marks BP's withdrawal from oil and gas business in North America, apart from ventures in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. BP has been in Canadian oil exploration since 1953. Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration, said the sale was a further step in the process of rationalising and focusing the company's exploration and production activities. 'We have to make choices, on a worldwide basis, about the allocation of the resources we have available,' he said. The sale follows disposals of BP's Houston-based subsidiary Tex/Con last year, and of its stake in the Canadian Hunter joint venture in British Columbia earlier this year. It will be lead-managed by RBC Dominion Securities. Shares will be priced at CDollars 13, to be paid in three instalments over the next two years. Analysts said yesterday it could eventually represent a book profit of around Pounds 100m. BP Canada has been reorganised in the past three years into a focused oil and gas business with significant interests in the deep gas fields of the Western Canadian Basin. Its gross reserves are 40m barrels of oil and 743bn cu ft of gas. Total market capitalisation at the current market price is CDollars 688m. A wholly-owned subsidiary of BP, BP Canadian Holdings owns 56.94 per cent of issued shares. BP disappointed the stock exchange last week with an 80 per cent drop in first-quarter profits on a replacement cost basis - insufficient to cover its dividend. When stockholding losses are taken into account, the company made its first-ever quarterly loss, of Pounds 61m, compared with a Pounds 10m profit a year earlier. Analysts said the BP Canada sale was consistent with BP's policy of divesting its North American interests and concentrating on more significant projects in fewer countries. The sale will also help to ease BP's heavy cash flow burden. BP shares gained 5p to 257p in London yesterday, although analysts said this was largely on the back of a rise in New York.

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Friday's blast leads to dull equity trading Wall Street US SHARES lost ground yesterday afternoon after starting the day on a modestly firmer note, with some traders suggesting that Friday's bomb blast at the World Trade Center was having a delayed psychological effect on the equity market, writes Nikki Tait in New York. Although there was no direct impact from the blast on either the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, which are housed in a different part of Manhattan's financial district, some market participants said the explosion underlined the area's vulnerability to terrorist attack. Dealing yesterday morning began quietly, and end of day volume was somewhat below recent levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 15.40 at 3,355.41. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.37 at 442.01, while the American SE composite was 0.70 firmer at 407.54. The Nasdaq composite shed 1.26 to 669.51. Trading volume on the New York SE was 237m shares. The only economic data yesterday had little influence on the market. The National Association of Purchasing Management's survey of business activity in February showed the first decline since September, with the index standing at 55.8 last month compared with 58 in January. Many of the most actively traded 'mainline' stocks were mixed throughout the day. Wal-Mart Stores gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 33 and IBM rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 . Two of the drug stocks rallied, Glaxo improving Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 19 1/4 and Merck Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/2 . By contrast, Philip Morris continued to feel the weight of worries about a tobacco tax and ended Dollars 1 7/8 lower at Dollars 65 1/4 . Compaq Computer also declined sharply, by Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 , while Chrysler slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 . Among some of the smaller stocks, Thermedics, a bomb detection equipment maker, rallied in the wake of the World Trade Center blast, by Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 13 1/2 . Sensormatic climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 on news that Wal-Mart, the nation's top-selling retailer, plans to install the company's electronic article surveillance system in more than 100 additional stores. Canada TORONTO stocks closed mixed for the third consecutive trading day in active trading. The TSE 300 index lost 19 points to 3,432.7, but rises outnumbered falls by 333 to 288 after volume of 44.2m shares. The mining sector posted the day's biggest loss - 1.69 per cent. Alcan Aluminium, which said it has formed a 50:50 joint venture with a Fiat subsidiary to produce components for the automotive industry, declined CDollars 5/8 to CDollars 23 3/8.</p>

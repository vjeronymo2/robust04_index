			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Political reform sustains Milan bourse  -Analysts are positive ahead of this month's general election The Italian equity market, one of Europe's best performers last year, has been looking remarkably resilient as the country prepares to go to the polls on March 27 and 28, for what is arguably the most important general election since 1945. The Comit index posted a 38 per cent advance during 1993, as heavy domestic demand was augmented by buying from the UK, Germany and France. US investors have joined the fray this year and the market has risen a further 9.9 per cent, boosted by the successful privatisations of the IMI financial services group and Banca Commerciale Italiana, and the planned fusion and privatisation later this year of the telecommunications sector, a long time favourite with foreign investors. But turnover, while still high, has slipped this month from the record levels seen in February when it surged to a daily average of almost L955bn, peaking at around L1,200bn on some trading days. Last year's strong performance took place against an unpromising background of political uncertainty and the fast unfolding and widening corruption scandal. Few doubt that the market faces a period of uncertainty while the new coalition government, whatever its ultimate composition, finds its feet. However, most analysts are positive on the medium term outlook. Mr Lorenzo Stanca at Credito Italiano expects that the generally acknowledged need for constitutional reform will trigger the formation of a broad coalition, but not perhaps for 45 to 60 days after the polls, as parties jockey for position. He says that the next cabinet will have room to continue the policy of cutting the budget deficit begun by the Amato and Ciampi administrations. The financial markets, he expects, will react negatively in the immediate aftermath of the election, before picking up again as the identity of the new government becomes clearer. Mr Nicholas Potter, his colleague, expects to see the Comit index up at the 760 level within a year, from 680 yesterday. He says the economic picture facing the incoming administration will include inflation falling as a result of structural changes in the labour, service and retail markets. However, he thinks that the official target of 2.5 per cent inflation by the end of this year, compared with last month's provisional 4.2 per cent, is optimistic. Mr Potter adds that service sector employment is falling rapidly for the first time in nearly 20 years, which will leave consumption flat in 1994; and he thinks the aim of reducing the public sector borrowing requirement as a proportion of gross domestic product will need to be achieved through spending cuts rather than new taxes, which are already becoming unbearably high. Mr Fabio Basagni of Actinvest, an independent research group, sees no reason to change his forecast of a rise to around the 800 level in the Comit index by August, before the market stages its traditional reversal during the autumn as complex negotiations get under way for the 1995 finance bill. He expects a moderate, centre right-inspired coalition government to emerge from the election and believes that the equity market has already decided that this would be a vast improvement on previous administrations. The market, he says, will continue to be driven by strong liquidity, the accelerating privatisation process, the positive outlook for the lira and the strength and speed of an export-led economic recovery. Mr Mark Howdle at JP Morgan expects Italy to be the strongest performer among the main European markets this year, and he believes that shares could rise by a further 35 per cent over the coming 12 to 18 months, taking the Comit index above its life-time high of 908 set in May 1986. 'Italy's partial catch-up with other European markets over the past 18 months was a period of rehabilitation, when a chronically underperforming market began to react to prospects of structural reform in Italian society,' he says. But this year and next should be a period of 'rerating', in which its financial markets adjust more fully to the radical political and economic changes already achieved, as well as those still to come.</p>

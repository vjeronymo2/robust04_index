			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: How employers can trim NI bills - David Cohen looks at benefit loopholes The government's latest attempt to block avoidance of National Insurance contributions (NICs) was announced this week by Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, who said that these will be levied on payments to staff in the form of diamonds and fine wines. But even if this really is the final bell for artificial avoidance schemes - and, until now, whenever one loophole has been closed, another has been discovered swiftly - there are still several straightforward steps which employers can take to mitigate their liabilities. Both staff and employers must pay NICs. In each case, contributions are a percentage of earnings - up to 10 per cent for employees and 10.2 per cent for employers. The key difference, however, is that while there is an upper salary limit (now Pounds 430 a week) above which no further employee contributions are due, there is no limit at all for employers. Hence, a director receiving, say, Pounds 100,000 a year would have to pay only around Pounds 2,000 personally - but the company would have to find Pounds 10,000. There was an upper limit for employers until 1985, and it was the abolition of that which transformed NICs from a minor irritant to a major corporate expense. Responding to demand from clients with bevies of high earners, tax advisers blew the dust off their copies of the NIC legislation and found themselves in a loophole-seeker's paradise. The weakness of the NIC framework is that, generally, it catches only salary and not perks. The recurring theme of the many techniques deployed by NIC-dodgers over the past nine years was that the employee got a non-cash benefit that could be converted, almost immediately, into cash. Gilt-edged stock, equities, unit trusts, gold bullion and, finally, expensive wines and gemstones were exploited by the avoiders before, in turn, being outlawed by the authorities. The enduring mystery is why the government did not simply extend the definition of 'earnings' for NIC purposes to include non-cash benefits; this has been the case with income tax for several decades. Sooner or later it will, presumably, do the rational thing. So long as benefits remain outside the net, companies continue to have plenty of opportunity to provide them to staff. Larger companies presumably will confine themselves to standard items such as pensions, medical insurance and cheap loans, but smaller ones might also think of such perks as holidays or suites of furniture. These are lawful provided the order is placed by the employer and the employee cannot opt for cash in lieu. Even more significant savings may be available for the substantial number of private companies run by owner-managers. Instead of paying themselves extra salary, they can extract money NIC-free in the form of dividends. And if payments are not precisely proportional to shareholdings, the problem can be overcome by dividend sacrifices, or 'waivers'. (Say that A and B each owns 50 of the 100 shares in X Ltd but they have agreed that A should get twice as large a year-end bonus as B. The money can all be paid as a dividend provided B waives his entitlement in respect of 25 of his shares). A decision to pay dividends rather than salary, however, should never be taken on NIC grounds alone. The downside of a switch to the dividend route is that it will reduce pensionable earnings and land the company with an advance corporation tax bill. It might also increase the value used by the Inland Revenue to assess inheritance tax liability on any future gift or bequest of shares. Neither furniture suites nor extra dividends will be a practical proposition for public companies with substantial work forces. They, however, may be able to take advantage of a small chink left open when the equities loophole was closed in 1991. Payment to an employee in the form of shares is still outside the NIC net if the shares are those of the employee's company or its parent. Although designed to benefit genuine long-term employee share schemes, the exemption would apply equally to a one-off share transfer followed by an immediate sale. While this is a blissfully simple solution from an NIC perspective, it is fraught with legal complexities. Issues to be considered include whether the transaction requires shareholder approval; the timing of the sale (so as not to infringe the insider dealing rules); and the tax deductibility of the costs incurred by the company.

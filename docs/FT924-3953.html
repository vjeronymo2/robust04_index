			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat Pounds 39m in red as property losses take toll PRE-TAX losses at Greycoat, the property investment company which in September rescinded its recommendation to pay the 2.9p final dividend for the year to March 31 only two days before shareholders were due to approve it, grew sharply from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 39.2m in the six months to September 30. The interim dividend is passed (2p). No preference dividend was paid on October 1; nor is one likely on April 1. However, Mr Richard Guignard, managing director, finance, said his company was 'a million miles away from Rosehaugh', the property company that called in receivers this week. Greycoat's operating profits declined to Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 17.7m), but there was a loss of Pounds 13m from properties with a book value of Pounds 85.8m sold for Pounds 72.8m, a loss of Pounds 15m from the Pounds 27.5m sale of its interest in Finsbury Avenue, and Pounds 7m (Pounds 8m) provisions against properties at cost. Mr Guignard said Greycoat's aim was to pay down its debt via the 'not reckless' sale of assets, adding that, unlike Rosehaugh, its assets were in excess of its debts. Losses per share emerged at 47.4p (12p).</p>

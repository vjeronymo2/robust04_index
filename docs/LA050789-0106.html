			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE LIFE OF AN OLD ACTOR;  </P> <P> LAST CALL BY HARRY MULISCH; TRANSLATED BY ADRIENNE DIXON (VIKING: $19.95; 288  PP.)  </P> <P> The house of translation has many rooms. Some are large, like French; others  small. How fortunate when the door of a smaller room -- here the Dutch -- opens  and a work of art emerges.  </P> <P> If English were Harry Mulish's native language, he would need no introduction.  His reputation would be as established as the quality of his writing and the  subtlety of his plots; however, only in 1985, with the publication of "The  Assault," were American readers given their first opportunity to read this  exceptional novelist.  </P> <P> Now with "Last Call," Mulisch again offers us a remarkable work. A rigorously  condensed tale, this novel is like an onion being peeled away by the narrator's  hands, until nothing is left -- then the peeling continues, undoing the very  fabric of nothing itself.  </P> <P> Translation is like reaching into a stream to retrieve a bright-colored fish  and instead holding up a gray stone. The operation of lifting living language  out of its habitat petrifies words, no matter how skillful the translation.  </P> <P> A critic must remember that the language used to translate a novel is closer to  this side of experience, reading, than the other, writing. In the case of "Last  Call," Adrienne Dixon has worked hard to preserve the linguistic integrity of  Mulisch's brilliant tour de force.  </P> <P> The protagonist, Uli Bouwmeester, 78, was an unsuccessful actor in his youth.  During World War II, he entertained Dutch SS soldiers and was ostracized by the  theatrical community after the war.  </P> <P> Now widowed and living with a sister in the Dutch polder, that blank landscape  seized from the sea, Uli exists in an atmosphere that recalls Beckett or Pinter  -- two souls waiting for death in a cold house filled with nothing but  recrimination, remorse and brittle memories.  </P> <P> Uli's life is a set stripped to the bone.  </P> <P> Suddenly comes a call to enter into a different dramatic universe, one much  closer to Pirandello. Uli is visited by two strangers who offer him the lead in  a new play. With his last role, Uli realizes that he can transform a lifetime  of small parts into an oeuvre.  </P> <P> Soon Uli senses that the role for which he has been chosen reverberates with  louder and louder echoes from his own past. The play is that most dangerous of  devices -- a dramatic Ouroboros -- a play within a play within a play. Uli is  to portray the early 20th-Century Dutch actor Pierre de Vries, giving his  farewell performance in "The Tempest," itself a play effacing the difference  between reality and illusion. There is linkage not only from Uli to Pierre, but  from them to Prospero as well.  </P> <P> The meshing of the plays with Uli's life forces dark secrets from his past. In  playing another, Uli is truly revealing himself. As he enters into his role,  the hidden parts of his life emerge -- and we see a human iceberg rising before  us.  </P> <P> Moving closer and closer to his last call, Uli believes that he will soon  appear on the stage as though before the extended audience of his life and at  last receive the critical vindication he deserves -- as person and actor.  </P> <P> Alas, waiting in the wings is reality, which through three different tragic  encounters, usurps Uli's hopes and replaces them with an awareness that the  final curtain is doming down before it had a chance to go up.  </P> <P> A stunning remark is made by the play's director (himself a character in the  narrator's mind -- again, a role created by Mulisch):  </P> <P> ". . . An actor never crawls into the skin of a character. That is an old  misconception. The character must crawl into his skin. As an actor you do not  become another person, the other person becomes you."  </P> <P> The reader of "Last Call" finds himself a telescopic audience -- viewing  simultaneous performances of Uli's life, memories and relieved past, mixed with  that of De Vries' role and Prospero's magical part.  </P> <P> "Last Call" is not the sort of book one can put down to later pick up --  without feeling confused, much as the protagonist does, riddled with the  question: Not, where am I? But who?  </P> <P> This labyrinth of a novel offers only the frayed string of a narrative to help  the reader find his way. If there is an Ariadne, it is Mulisch himself --  removed, waiting for the reader to emerge from his a-maze-ing novel with a new  awareness of role, character, personality and part. These terms of the theater  and psychology become so thoroughly blended that we do not know how to answer  Yeats' haunting question: "Are we anything more than the masks that we wear?"  </P> <P> In Zen gardens -- no matter where one sits in relation to the stones -- one is  always missing. Move as one will, a stone remains unseen.  </P> <P> The whole is forever beyond our grasp.  </P> <P> Uli's life seen through the magnificent rehearsal of "Last Call" is an  extraordinary attempt to locate the missing stone . . . or is it soul?  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BROADWAY SAM' COHN STILL HOLDS COURT IN NEW YORK  </P> <P> Above the door hangs a black top hat with glittery letters that read "Broadway  Sam."  </P> <P> On the walls are the obligatory posters touting clients -- Meryl Streep,  Sigourney Weaver, Woody Allen, Diane Wiest, Mike Nichols, Robert Benton, Fred  Schepisi, Susan Seidelman.  </P> <P> And, in the middle of it all, sits Sam Cohn: co-founder of ICM and, by some  accounts, the greatest talent agent in the world. "He is what we should all  aspire to be," insisted one ex-protege, who worked closely with Cohn before  leaving ICM to join a competitor.  </P> <P> Other colleagues argue that Cohn, while dominating New York's talent business  for the past 16 years, also hurt ICM by isolating his domain from the company's  large West Coast film operation.  </P> <P> "Things change," Cohn responded to that criticism. During an hourlong interview  at ICM's West 57th Street office, the 60-year-old agent said he's not only  talking more often with his California counterparts but also eventually expects  to join them weekly in coast-to-coast video hook-ups.  </P> <P> Regarding other matters, Cohn had some pointed thoughts to share.  </P> <P> On Michael Ovitz and CAA: "Michael and I have butted heads, oh, sure. . . .  (But CAA's presence) in New York is minuscule." (According to others, CAA  grabbed Cher, Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg from Cohn's client list but  didn't seriously diminish his empire.)  </P> <P> On studio chiefs: "I can tell you exactly what the qualities that make a great  movie executive are. And 95% of the guys running things don't have them."  </P> <P> On California: "I haven't been to Los Angeles for a meeting (with Hollywood  executives) in 10 years. I don't think I've ever been out to meet with  (Universal's) Tom Pollock or the newer crop. They all come here. . . . More  talent wants to live in New York now. If they can pull it off, they want to be  closer to the serious side of things."  </P> <P> On the dismantling of Josephson International: "The idea is to spread the  equity around (among agents). . . . We didn't, as a talent agency, want to end  up paying for purchases we didn't want." MICHAEL CIEPLY  </P></p>

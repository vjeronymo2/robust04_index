			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Burmah strong Activity in Burmah Castrol expanded as the recent BZW auction of shares from the scrip dividend filtered through the market. The stock also benefited from a buy note from Hoare Govett which stressed improved quality of earnings on the stock and dividend progression. The price put on 3 at 775p in turnover of 1.9m. Another auction of scrip dividend stock was announced - by SG Warburg and James Capel - on Enterprise Oil. The brokers are to sell shares valued at Pounds 25m. The stock eased 4 to 472p. Strong turnover in Premier Consolidated Oilfields was one of the features of the sector, with the stock continuing its recent run of attracting investor interest. Volume was a hefty 6.4m but the price lost a penny to 26 1/2 p. The two camps of investor interest in Lasmo reinforced the two-way pull in the stock after the previous day's announcement that the company's finance chief was to quit. Some bullish sentiment remained, while others were disappointed by the spirit of Lasmo's statement on its boardroom change, complaining that the move had been made reluctantly. A couple of brokerages pushed negative stances following the news, while one shifted its position from sell to hold, believing that it was too early to tell which sentiment would win out. The shares slipped 3 to 142p in moderate turnover. An institutional sale of 1.3m shares was behind above average turnover in Pearson. The stock receded 4 to 565p in a volume of 3.5m. A chill wind blew through the life insurance sector after a press report said that Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, is considering charges of widespread mis-selling against at least three of the best known life insurance companies. Although no companies were named, the report led to nervous trading, bringing a sharp retreat for some of the biggest stocks in the sector, although general profit-taking was also said to have played a part in the decline. The day's falls included Prudential Corporation, which gave up 8 to 363p in trade of 5.1m, and Legal &amp; General, 9 down at 528p. Lloyds Abbey shed 7 to 456p. President Clinton's presentation of his health care proposals to Congress yesterday kept drugs stocks in a nervous mood. Glaxo lost 9 to 682p; SmithKline Beecham 'A' gave up 7 to 422; Wellcome, which reports results today, receded 9 to 803p; and Zeneca weakened 15 to 775p. A stock overhang in Delta left the shares 17 lighter at 491p, following a large trade in the closing minutes of Tuesday's session. Smith New Court was reported to have bought a block of around 1.1m shares at 500p, below the ruling market price, and is believed to have sold around 850,000 at 501p, leaving the overhang. NatWest Securities was said to have called the stock lower early yesterday. Old talk that French group BSN might be eyeing one of the market's favourite bid targets, United Biscuits, produced a flurry of buying interest early on. The shares faded to close 3 ahead at 370p. Milk price war worries undermined Unigate, the shares declining 8 to 378p. Strauss Turnbull was said to be renewing its positive stance on Northern Foods, which firmed 3 1/2 to 242 1/2 p. A rise of 13 was achieved by Courtaulds Textiles, taking the price up to 568p. But with turnover small, one analyst put the rise largely down to the illiquidity of the stock, although it may also still be enjoying positive sentiment from its recent acquisitions. Hefty turnover in building materials group MB Caradon, 5 off at 332p, was put partly down to a large agency cross. Volume in the stock was 9.6m shares, with 4m of that attributed by market sources to an agency cross by Cazenove. News that British Airways is to reduce its package holidays to Euro Disney knocked the theme park operator, the shares tumbling 30 to 568p. BA slipped a penny to 374p. The annnouncement that the managing and finance directors of Eurocamp had been buying the company's shares saw the stock climb 17 to 219p.

International conglomerate BTR rose 5 to 374p after NatWest Securities issued a 'buy' recommendation. Talk that the extension of the Jubilee tube line will be announced at the end of this week boosted BICC, finally 9 ahead at 403p. Plans by P&amp;O for a US flotation of more than 6,000 US apartments owned by Laing Properties, its joint venture with Chelsfield, the private property group, cheered the market. The shares gained 8 at 570p in turnover of 3.2m. MARKET REPORTERS: Joel Kibazo, Christopher Price, Christine Buckley. Other statistics, Page 36</p>

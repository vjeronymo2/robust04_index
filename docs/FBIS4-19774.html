			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Y. Karelias] </F>   [Excerpts] The outcome of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] congress will set in motion a series of developments  and at the same time clarify the terms of the game that Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou will be expected to play when he  jumps over to the Presidency and abandons the leadership of the  party he established.    The PASOK Central Committee will confer immediately after  Easter to elect a new secretary and a new Executive Office.  This means:  <H5>  Changes </H5>   -- If Akis Tsokhatzopoulos chooses to stay with the party,  he must resign his post as interior minister. Yesterday he  said: "I have been with the party for 20 years and I feel at  home." Close associates believe he will choose the position of  secretary. According to the same associates, Papandreou will  support him. -- A Cabinet reshuffle will follow because there  will be a vacancy at the Interior Ministry and possibly in other  ministries if Papandreou decides that others--except  Tsokhatzopoulos--must stay only with the party. With the  revision of the PASOK Constitution the day before yesterday, at  least nine of the 19 members cannot be ministers. Information  has it that Konstandinos Simitis and Yerasimos Arsenis are not  expected to leave their ministries, while it is not known what  will happen with Theodhoros Pangalos, who shot up to the Central  Committee's second slot after Yeoryios Yenimatas. [passage  omitted]    The governing party is directly interest in electing a  secretary and an Executive Office. If Tsokhatzopoulos is a  candidate and has Papandreou's support, then there may be no  second candidacy, although many who want the position do not  reveal their intentions. If Tsokhatzopoulos decides to stay with  the government or if the prime minister does not support him  openly for the position of secretary, other members of the party  will surely contest the top slot.    Kostas Laliotis said yesterday that "Akis [Tsokhatzopoulos]  has the first word. He must evaluate the facts and make his  decisions." Asked whether he would have preferred the position  of secretary or a ministry, Dhimitrios Tsovolas said: "The  position of secretary--to upgrade the party." Theodhoros  Pangalos appears to be "indifferent." He said that he wanted to  get elected to the Central Committee but had no interest in the  position. No one knows what he will do at the meeting.  Besides, it is well known that Pangalos is one of the few  Executive Office members who was elected to the Central  Committee without being proposed by Papandreou. [passage omitted]</p>

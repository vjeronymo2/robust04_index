			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> UNRAVELING MYSTERY OF THE TIE-BREAKER  </P> <P> The NFL's tie-breaking procedures are supposed to reveal who's in and who's out  of the postseason. But heading into the final weekend with six teams coveting  three remaining slots, we are reminded again that deciphering the Dead Sea  Scrolls probably was easier.  </P> <P> And if the NFL keeps adding to the burden -- remember, this season is the first  with three wild-card slots available in each conference -- it is hardly going  to be worth the effort.  </P> <P> Under the league's rules, as many as nine steps might be applied if the tie to  be broken involves teams in the same division; eight if tie-breaking is needed  to determine the wild-card teams. But the only step that most people readily  grasp, under either scenario, is the last one: Flip a coin.  </P> <P> "Really, you'd be surprised at how many fans are knowledgeable about this  stuff," said Pete Abitante, whose job it is to determine the AFC playoff  entrants. It kept him working late into the night Sunday at the league's  headquarters. "In a sense, it's like learning a foreign language -- you're  always trying to figure which situation applies in which case.  </P> <P> "But there are obviously a lot of other people doing it. I get plenty of calls  around this time of year from people who say, 'I've got it figured this way,'  and they ask if there's anything they might have missed."  </P> <P> "And when you straighten them out," he added, "they really thank you for it."  </P> <P> Abitante has no way of knowing how many of the callers happen to be employed by  the NFL as general managers, coaches or players. But it's a safe bet that the  long-distance lines from the four cities still chasing the two remaining AFC  spots -- Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Houston and Seattle -- to his extension in New  York will be humming in the days to come.  </P> <P> Under one punishing scenario, the Steelers, who are alone at the top of the AFC  Central Division this week, could be out of the playoffs altogether by this  same time next week.  </P> <P> A Pittsburgh loss at Houston, coupled with a Cincinnati victory over the lowly  Cleveland Browns, would leave all three teams at 9-7. But Cincinnati would  claim the AFC Central title by virtue of beating the Steelers in head-to-head  contests.  </P> <P> Houston or Seattle would then get the wild-card berth, leaving Pittsburgh out  of it.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's better that we have to win," Steeler cornerback David Johnson said.  "If we knew there was a chance we could lose and still make the playoffs, who  knows? Maybe we'd relax."  </P> <P> If it's any consolation to Johnson, the Bengals and the Oilers won't be  breathing any easier next week. Seattle also could finish 9-7 (or 8-8 if both  Cincinnati and Houston lose as well), and because of this head-to-head  business, nose out either of them for the wild card.  </P> <P> The NFC, thankfully, is easier to figure because only two teams -- Dallas and  New Orleans -- are circling the last musical chair. If the Cowboys win Sunday  against the Falcons, regardless of how the Saints do against the Rams, they're  in. If both lose, Dallas still wins.  </P> <P> But that kind of simplicity carries a price; under that both-teams-losing  scenario, the Cowboys, at 7-9, would mark the first time a team with a losing  record made the playoffs.  </P> <P> It was that very danger -- diluting the product -- that was raised earlier this  year when the NFL announced in March that it was expanding the playoffs by  adding a third wild-card team to each conference.  </P></p>

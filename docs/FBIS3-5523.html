Ajit Singh, who is attending the three-day closed-door  Special Senior Asean Officials Meeting (SOM) in Bangkok, said  the ECO had expressed an interest in closer ties. It was also  in line with the decision of the third Asean summit in Singapore  in 1992 to develop closer relations with other regional  groupings.    "It will be a preliminary, exploratory visit to study the  possible scope of relations between Asean and the ECO," he said.  The 10-member ECO groups Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan  and the former Soviet Muslim republics of Kazakhstan,  Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.  Ajit Singh will visit Pakistan on the return trip.    Last year he led a delegation to China that concluded with  Beijing opening a new chapter in science and technology  cooperation with Asean. He recently made an official visit to  Vietnam and Laos, who became Asean observers in 1992.    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suwit Simasakun said yesterday  Burma must be brought into the mainstream of regional affairs.  Asean members had agreed in principle that Burma should be  invited to attend the Asean meeting in July, but there was still  no agreement on what status Rangoon should have.    The SOM meeting, attended by senior Asean foreign affairs,  security and intelligence officials, yesterday reviewed security  in the region and made preparations for the first Asean Regional  Forum (ARF) on July 25. An Asean official said the regional  issues touched were on Burma, the South China Sea, the Korean  peninsula and Cambodia, relations with major powers like China,  the US, Japan and Russia.    The political cooperation issues covered included the Asean  role in Zopfan -- the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality --  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and confidence-building  measures.</p>

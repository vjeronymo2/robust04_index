			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT ON CHILD ABUSE  </P> <P> Bravo! Rehnquist has finally said it! No hedging, no beating around the Bush.  The Supreme Court rules that "Nothing in the language of the due process clause  itself requires the state to protect the life, liberty and property of its  citizens against invasion." Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's loud and clear: The  Administration is washing its hands.  </P> <P> If a policeman walks by while you are clobbered on the street, and he doesn't  move a finger to protect you, under the new ruling you can't sue him or anybody  else. If the possibly exonerating evidence in your trial is "lost" by the  officials (biased or not), you have only yourself to blame. Yes, you are on  your own.  </P> <P> Naturally, you still have to pay your taxes; the Constitution does not protect  you from the IRS, but whether or not the services in return will be forthcoming  is left to the benevolence of the state agencies. See if they feel like it. If,  in the midst of a disintegrating welfare system, skyrocketing medical and  insurance costs, inflation, bailouts, homelessness, drugs and cultural  deprivation, you still had any doubts as to whose interest this Administration  is representing, set them aside now. Just look up and count your thousand  points of light!  </P> <P> ENDRE HULES  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev--Valeriy Sirenko, deputy head of the main  ecological inspectorate at Ukraine's Environmental Protection  Ministry, told a UNIAN correspondent on 31 May that the joint  commission of the Environmental Protection Ministry, the Defense  Ministry, the State Oil and Gas Committee, the State Housing  Services Committee, and the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine  representatives--the commission of which he is in  charge--completed preliminary calculations with regard to  expenditures required to restore the environment damaged as a  result of activity by the Black Sea Fleet. The sum of this  damage is around 19.6 billion dollars.    An approximate 4 billion dollars is needed to resolve the  ecological problems of Sevastopol alone, with 108 million  dollars required specifically to regenerate 2,016 hectares of  land in places where Black Sea Fleet units and facilities are  deployed and to decontaminate the soil saturated with petroleum  products.    Account should also be taken of expenditures required for  cleansing the harbors to remove oil and other harmful substances  that are constantly being dumped into the sea and to improve the  health of the population that is being affected by the  ecological calamity.    Sirenko said: "The state of the environment around  Sevastopol  is infernal. Harbors are polluted with trash and oil. The  fleet's oil collectors are defunct. The command of the Russian  Black Sea Fleet, however, has failed to find time to meet  Ukraine's Environmental Protection Ministry commission."</p>

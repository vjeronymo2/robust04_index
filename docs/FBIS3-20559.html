Answer: In 1994 Heilongjiang will be faced with  very good opportunities for reform and development and will  encounter unprecedented challenges. We will concentrate on  doing a good job with large- and medium-sized enterprises and  stress doing a good job of handling enterprise reform and  upgrading. By reform we will free up current productive capacity  and through upgrading we will develop new productivity. The  organic integration of the dual tactics of reform and upgrading  simultaneously employed will lay a firm foundation for the  establishment of a modern enterprise system and promote  sustained, coordinated, and sound development of the industrial  economy.    Question: Intensifying enterprise reform is one of  the keys to industrial economic tasks throughout the province in  1994. So, what is the thinking on enterprise reform?    Answer: The overall thinking on Heilongjiang's  enterprise reform in 1994 is: To lay a foundation of enterprise  operational autonomy closely centered on doing a good job with  the core sector, large- and medium-sized state enterprises,  fully promoting reform of the property rights system, and  striving to achieve progressive breakthroughs. We will  fundamentally convert the mechanisms of large- and medium-sized  state enterprises that are prepared and establish a modern  enterprise system suited to the demands of a market economy. At  the same time, in accordance with the requirements for  structuring a modern enterprise system, we will accelerate  comprehensive reform of the macroeconomic control system, the  market system, and the social security system. We also should  speed up progress on converting the internal mechanisms of  enterprises and improvement of the external environment.    Question: In recent years Heilongjiang has adopted  several policy measures to do a good job on large- and  medium-sized state enterprises. What new plans are there in this  respect for 1994?    Answer: In 1994 we will adopt some new measures  based on the new situation and tasks that reform and development  are facing and speed up progress on large and medium-sized state  enterprises.    First we will actively and safely promote a modern  enterprise  system. In 1994 the state is selecting 100 large- and  medium-sized enterprises to establish an experimental modern  enterprise system. Heilongjiang is recommending three  enterprises, the Qiqihar Steel Mill, the Jiamusi Paper Mill, and  the Heilongjiang Polyester Factory, to the State Economic and  Trade Commission to participate in the national experiment. At  the same time, the province is selecting 15-20 enterprises to  establish an experimental modern enterprise system at the  province level. In 1994 we also will expand the scope of the  experimental stock system and select 100 large- and medium-sized  state enterprises to conduct the experiment, concentrating on  selecting 60 of these large- and medium-sized state enterprises  that are relatively well managed and have upgraded technology.    Second, continue to intensify the implementation of  Regulations on Converting Enterprise Operating Mechanisms and  the Regulations on Supervision and Control. The provincial  economic committee with relevant departments can strictly  investigate and prosecute violations of the legitimate rights of  enterprises. We should formulate detailed rules and regulations  for Heilongjiang to implement the Regulations on Supervision and  Control of state assets and institute supervision and control of  the state assets of Heilongjiang's experimental enterprises and  stress the implementation of the responsibility system for asset  management and the experimental appointment of a control  commission.    Third, we should accelerate enterprise restructuring and  improve the internal mechanisms of enterprises. First, we should  accelerate the reform of the three enterprise systems. Second,  we should increase efforts to strip away the logistics services  system. Third, we should resolutely institute bankruptcy toward  enterprises that have been losing for a long time and have no  hope of turning around the losses or funds to offset their  debts. In 1994 the state will set aside 7 billion yuan in bad  debt reserves to be used as loans to cancel the bad debts of  bankrupt enterprises. Heilongjiang will actively use this  opportunity to plan the bankruptcy of about 80 state industrial  enterprises (two to three of these large- or medium-sized  enterprises).    Fourth, in accordance with the demands of the market economy  we should enhance enterprise management and administration.  Presently quite a few enterprises are striving to convert their  mechanisms. But a considerable number of enterprises have lax  internal administration and management is "slipping." In 1994  the state will institute "convert mechanisms, stress  administration, practice internal skills, and increase  efficiency," and "in-depth economy results" activities. As the  state launches these activities, Heilongjiang should continue to  stress activities to improve quality and decrease consumption  and tap potential and increase efficiency targeted at "100 Red  Flag" enterprises and, based on economic returns, set up an  evaluation to publicize the top five in 110 industries  throughout the province.    Fifth, reduce unreasonable enterprise burdens. In accordance  with relevant state stipulations on credit interest owed on  allocations changed to loans, economic committees at every level  with relevant departments can do a good job on the remaining  credit interest owed on the 1.46 billion yuan Heilongjiang  industrial enterprise allocations changed to loans between 1983  and 1985. Using the base of the remaining credit interest owed  on state allocations changed to loans, we should select ten  cities and by category and by time period explore experimental  opportunities for concrete solutions and strive to include  Harbin in the list. We also should have multiple channels for  supplementing enterprise circulating funds and permitting large-  and medium-sized state enterprise, based on 1 percent of their  sales income, to draw their own circulating funds, be exempt  from income taxes, and figure it in their production costs.  Enterprises that have not recently submitted after-tax profits  should draw 50 percent of their retained profits to be used to  supplement circulating funds. We should once again appraise  enterprise adoption of medium-term loans within the quota and  give short-term loans outside the quota.    Question: Reform of Heilongjiang's small state  industrial enterprises has made a good start. How will this be  advanced in 1994?    Answer: In recent years, especially in the last  three years, Heilongjiang's small state industrial enterprises  have remained in a slump, holding back industry throughout the  province. Based on the provincial party committee and provincial  government plan, localities have generally picked up the pace of  small state enterprise reform consisting mainly of reform of the  property rights system. The provincial economic committee, on  the basis of surveys and research, top to bottom integration,  and one factory one policy, has formulated the plan for the  Reform of Small Heilongjiang State Enterprises. The plan's  overall goal is to essentially complete reform of 2,585 small  state industrial enterprises throughout the province in about  two years, concentrating on reform of the property rights  system, to lay a good foundation for the transition to a modern  enterprise system and move small state industrial enterprise  development to the fast track. According to the plan, reform of  small state industrial enterprises will take thirteen specific  forms: a stock system; a stock cooperative system; "grafting"  restructuring; leasing operations; "one enterprise, multiple  systems," asset contracts, participation in and organization of  enterprise groups, mergers, selling off assets, stripping off  operations, shutting down, bankruptcy, and other types of  reform. We already have "tallied" the 2,585 enterprises  according to the thirteen forms described above. Beginning in  1994, in accordance with the plan, we will put all of our  efforts into advancing reform of the property rights system of  small state industrial enterprises and in that year we will  complete the reform of 1,210 enterprises.    Question: Since upgrading enterprise technology is  as important as reform, what new measures will be taken in 1994  to promote the technical upgrading of enterprises?    Answer: Although in recent years Heilongjiang has  increased investment in upgrading technology, the rate of  increase has always been less than the national average and the  gap with some provinces has become greater and greater. As of  now, only 40 percent of Heilongjiang's large and medium-sized  enterprises are conducting systematic upgrading and have some  upgrading. If this situation does not change, it will be very  difficult for Heilongjiang's industry to make great progress. In  1994 we will speed up the promotion of the upgrading of  enterprise technology in three respects.    First, explore new avenues for reforming the investment  system for upgrading Heilongjiang technology. Based on  Heilongjiang's situation, the area of investment in technology  upgrading is divided into two categories. One category is policy  investments, which is related to the national economy and  people's livelihood. They have good social benefits, but small  benefit to enterprises. Their investment cycle is long and risks  are great. They are mainly supported by policy and their source  of funds comes mainly from policy investments and loans. Another  category is commercial investments. Their economic returns are  good and they are able to pay back principle and interest on  loans. Their source of funds comes mainly from commercial loans  or financing. Reform of the investment system for upgrading  technology concentrates on doing three tasks well: The first is  to select state policy investments for technology upgrading  projects in Heilongjiang's industries with long investment  cycles and great risks such as transportation, energy, and  defense; the five major mainstay industries and ten major  projects; and current enterprises that are applying new high  technology upgrades, and strive for the state's opening up bank  support. The second is to enhance macroeconomic controls on  technology upgrades and guide the orientation of investment  funds. The third is to transition from a project approval system  to a project filing system. Beginning in 1994, except for  special state loans for key projects and major provincial  technology upgrades for which state loans are requested, the  provincial economic committee will no longer approve general  projects and as a rule it will be changed to a filing system.    Second, coordinate and integrate technology upgrading with  reform of the enterprise system and external economic technology  and broaden channels for funds and increase investment returns.  First, rely on key projects and promote reform of the stock  system and, based on a good grasp of the base of the  experimental reform of the stock system in such enterprises as  Qiqihar Steel Mill, Heilongjiang Polyester Factory, Hualin  Rubber, Jiamusi Paper Mill, and Yichun's Guangming Furniture,  select some enterprises that have key technology upgrade tasks  to actively and safely conduct stock system reform. Second, step  up the use of foreign investment "grafts" to upgrade current  enterprises and continue to implement the plan to use foreign  investment to upgrade 100 large- and medium-sized enterprises  and stress the implementation of matching domestic funds for  projects solicited from Hong Kong and Korean businesses and  organize mature projects by levels for activities directed at  different countries to solicit businesses and introduce funds  and convene the Mudan River "grafted" upgrading on-site exhibit.    Third, concentrate efforts on especially stressing major  technology upgrading projects. In 1994 Heilongjiang plans to  arrange for investment in technology upgrading on the scale of  of 4.5 billion yuan, a 28 percent increase over the previous  year, and concentrate on 37 key projects such as Jiamusi Paper  and Qiqihar Steel. In 1994, 701 projects will go into production  or achieve production and they are expected to earn a value of  output of 3.34 billion yuan and 850 million yuan in profit  taxes, and earn US$38.04 million in foreign exchange.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] A national meeting of commodity price bureau  directors closed in Wuhan on 8 April. Chen Jinhua, minister of  the State Planning Commission, pointed out at the meeting:  Effective measures must be taken to curb excessive commodity  price increases and to ensure an overall stable situation by  strengthening regulation and control.    Chen Jinhua said: A conspicuous economic problem at present  is worsening inflation. Market prices have increased rapidly,  and the increases are particularly excessive for those things  which have an important bearing on the people's daily life and  the nation's economic development, such as basic daily  necessities, basic services, and basic capital goods.    Chen Jinhua said: Recently, the State Council adopted a  series of measures to stabilize commodity prices. Commodity  price departments at all levels should resolutely implement the  four measures formulated by the State Council --to set up a  grain risk fund, to exercise effective supervision over the  prices of the people's basic daily necessities and services, to  enforce the rule of clearly marking commodity and service  prices, and to carry out a general inspection of commodity  prices. Resolute efforts should be made to successfully  stabilize soon the prices of rice, nonstaple foods, and fuel for  the people.    Chen Jinhua pointed out: Under the current state of market  prices of most commodities, it is imperative for us to establish  a perfect price regulation and control system during the course  of deepening reforms. In the meantime, however, regulation and  control must be exercised with new thinking and new methods  which conform to the market economy. Commodity price  departments at all levels should make active explorations, have  the courage to do practical things, strive to establish as soon  as possible a pricing system under the conditions of the  socialist market economy, and ensure that price management will  gradually be governed by regulations.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand moves to bolster solvency of units UNI Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, yesterday announced a series of measures to restore confidence in the group and strengthen the solvency of subsidiaries. The group's holding company was last month put into the hands of state administrators following its inability to repay NKr3.8bn (Dollars 664m) in short-term debt. Mr Oeystein Eskeland, chairman of Uni Storebrand New, the group's recently-formed holding company, said Uni Storebrand New would increase its stake in Skandia, the Swedish insurer, to 28.3 per cent by paying NKr200 each for 13m Skandia shares from the group's non-life, life and international subsidiaries, in a deal to strengthen the entities' solvency ratios. However, Mr Eskeland said the Skandia stake would be written down according to its market valuation as of August 31, when eight-month accounts of Uni Storebrand New were closed. At that time Skandia's shares were traded at SKr68 each on the Stockholm bourse, which implies the acquisition will be written down by an estimated NKr3.3bn against eight-month accounts. Mr Eskeland explained that Uni's holding company would transfer an estimated NKr360m in assets to the group's life insurance business in a move to bolster the entity's capital adequacy to 8 per cent. The group's international business, comprised of reinsurance and direct insurance, will also be reorganised. Direct insurance - which handles marine and oil industry business - will become a separate subsidiary, making it the group's fourth operational unit alongside life, non-life, and international businesses. The Oslo bourse yesterday delisted Uni Storebrand's shares until November 14. Uni's shares were suspended on August 24. Mr Eirik Keiserud, last month appointed by the state as chairman of the old Uni, which is in talks to hammer out an agreement with the company's creditors, said that an international brokerage firm would soon be named to undertake a thorough examination of the group.</p>

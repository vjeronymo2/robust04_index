			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: How to disguise the embarrassment of riches / Preview of the electricity companies' preliminary results season Britain's electricity companies are a cautious bunch. In the four years since privatisation began, the 17 quoted companies in the sector have established a tradition of holding back from the maximum possible when declaring profits. It has not stopped them from announcing profits way above pre-privatisation expectations. But taking a 'prudent' approach on issues like provisions for bad debts and business restructuring has enabled them to reduce the potential political flak which would have arisen from even stronger financial performances. If, however, the sector has in the past hidden its financial light under a bushel the temptation for most companies this time will be to dig a deep hole for it. As the sector's seven-week preliminary results season begins today, with an announcement from Scottish Power, the focus of attention for 14 of the 17 privatised companies and their investors is a review that Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, has launched into their distribution businesses. The review takes in the two Scottish companies as well as the 12 recs in England and Wales but the latter will be most affected since a larger proportion, in some cases virtually all, of their profits comes from distribution. Early indications in a letter from Prof Littlechild to the distributors are that some companies may have to reduce their prices by as much as 20 per cent from next April when the new regime comes into effect. Desperate to avoid this fate, companies will be doing their best in the results season to disguise the embarrassment of riches that have flowed their way since privatisation. 'Caution will be the watchword,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Hoare Govett. 'Anything which could be interpreted as excessive will make the regulator's job more difficult and may worsen the outcome of the review from the companies' point of view.' Mr John Wilson, analyst at UBS, detects a considerable slowdown in regional companies' cost control exercises ahead of the review. He says there may also be a reverse of the traditional dividend race in which companies appear to have been in competition with each other to see who can pay out the biggest increase to shareholders. But however hard they try, the regional companies are bound to show exceedingly healthy profit increases from 1992-93. UBS expects average pre-tax profits for the recs to be about Pounds 163m in 1993-94, against Pounds 140m the previous year. Growth in sale volumes might be low, perhaps up 1 per cent to 2 per cent if half-year results are anything to go by, but the companies are still benefiting enormously from the improvements in efficiency that have been effected in the last four years. Most of the companies will have had cash in hand by the end of last March - the end of the financial year. That would have been the case even if they had not benefited from customers paying more than Pounds 500m of their bills in advance to avoid paying value added tax which the government introduced from April 1. Companies' plans for the pre-payments will be one of the side issues around the results. The Labour party and consumer groups are stepping up their pressure for the money to be set aside for helping disadvantaged customers rather than be used to boost company profits. However, the issue that every investor and analyst will try to resolve at the regional companies' presentation of results will be how each company will come out of the distribution review. With company executives under strict instructions to keep secret the progress of their negotiations with Offer, the industry regulator, the questioners may be disappointed. The large generating companies will be less constrained in giving their results, particularly the two serving England and Wales. National Power and PowerGen have just come through their own regulatory review and are still smarting from the results. Over the two years from last month their profits could be depressed by about Pounds 120m in total as a result of the price cap negotiated with Prof Littlechild, according to SG Warburg Securities. The cap will not affect their results for 1993-94. However, the companies will be attempting to show the City that they can still grow profits and dividends by impressive amounts because of continuing cost cuts and expansion overseas. North of the border, Scottish Power will also be emphasising its improved efficiency with some analysts expecting the company today to show job cuts in the last year of 7 per cent to 8 per cent. Hydro-Electric's results will be watched for the company's latest word on the weather, which the company warned recently would depress profits this year because low rainfall had reduced the scope for generation through hydro electric power. However, most clouds have a silver lining and some Hydro watchers hope heavier rainfall so far this year will produce an equally freakish result - this time in Hydro's favour. The star of this year's results could turn out to be Northern Ireland Electricity, the smallest company of all. Having come to the market just last year, it does not face a big regulatory review for three years. This gives it stability and the company appears to be using the opportunities well by cutting costs vigorously. Hoare Govett's Mr Hawkins thinks earnings growth could be as high as 30 per cent, facilitating one of the highest dividend increases among power distributors.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           POWER PRELIMINARIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Pre-tax profits              Net Dividends                            ------------------    ----------------------                                  Fore-   Fore-           Fore-   Fore-                                  cast    cast            cast    cast                                    by    Hoare            by     Hoare                                   UBS   Govett           UBS    Govett Company            Date    1993   1994   1994    1993    1994    1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eastern         June 29   183.4    221    212    19.2      22      22 East Midlands   June 20   155.1     60*    50*   19.5    22.7    22.7 London          June 15   145.5    183    190    19.5    22.4    22.2 Manweb          June 21   111.2    129    126      21    24.1    24.1 Midlands        June 28   167.1    201    195      20    23.2      23 Northern        June 28   111.4    123    128   21.44    24.6    24.7 Norweb          June 27   157.1    179    175      20    22.3    22.7 Seeboard        June 28   112.7    125    125      10    11.6    11.6 Southern        June 23   187.3    215    218    19.6    23.4    22.5 South Wales     June 16      87     99    104    22.3    25.3    25.3 South Western   June 30   101.1    116    115      20    23.3    23.3 Yorkshire       June 17   156.3    175    175   20.42    23.5    23.2 NIE              June 1    57.9     81     81   10.02    11.3    11.4 National Power   May 18     580    670    660    10.6    12.2    12.3 PowerGen         June 9     425    472    485    10.5    12.3    12.4 Scottish Power   May 11   297.1    350    345   11.15    12.4    12.4 Hydro-Electric   June 8   146.6    160    170   11.38    12.6    12.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Taking into account yesterday's statement  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

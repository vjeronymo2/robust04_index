			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> EX-SALESMAN SUES FIRM OVER FIRING  </P> <P> A former concrete pipe salesman has filed a $26-million lawsuit against a  Fillmore manufacturer, alleging he was fired because he revealed that the  company sold defective drainage pipes to county and federal governments.  </P> <P> Willard Dobrzensky of Ventura filed the suit Wednesday in Ventura County  Superior Court against Hurst Concrete Products, which he said fired him Feb. 28  after employing him for four years.  </P> <P> Hurst General Manager Al Franzen said Friday, "We do not produce substandard  material."  </P> <P> Franzen declined to comment on the suit because he has not seen it and said he  prefers that the company make its case in court. But he confirmed that  Dobrzensky no longer works at Hurst.  </P> <P> Franzen said Hurst has been supplying pipe and concrete products to the  counties of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange and San Luis Obispo, and the U.S.  government since the 1920s.  </P> <P> Dobrzensky's suit charges that he learned Hurst had been selling substandard  and potentially dangerous concrete pipes and vaults to those customers. The  suit does not specify how the pipes are substandard nor where or when they were  installed.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Franzen and Hurst administrator Tim Wayment harassed  Dobrzensky in an effort to make him quit after he told them that he planned to  inform customers that the concrete products were substandard.  </P> <P> Dobrzensky's suit also alleges that Hurst then fired him without cause,  breaching an oral contract he said it made upon hiring him in July, 1986.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Dobrzensky suffered from attacks of anxiety, nervousness,  insomnia, high blood pressure and stress from being harassed.  </P> <P> Dobrzensky and his lawyer, William O'Neill III, could not be reached Friday for  comment.

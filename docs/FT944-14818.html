			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Fayed sets out 'sham of men in high office' Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods, last night defended his decision to leak information about two ministers taking his money to ask questions in the Commons. However he said he was backing off from making any further revelations about the case because of the threat of being involved in legal action. Mr Michael Cole, Mr Fayed's spokesman, said: 'Mr Fayed considers he has done his public duty by exposing the sham of men in high office and the rottenness of an establishment that was prepared to have him vilified.' He added: 'We are not considering naming any more names or providing any more documentation. The legal situation makes it very difficult. We have to keep clean.' Mr Fayed spoke to several newspaper editors in recent weeks and told them about the allegations regarding the two ministers before The Guardian published them. According to Mr Cole, concern that Mr Fayed was about to go public led to Mr Ian Greer, the lobbyist linked to the MPs, calling for and obtaining a meeting with the Harrods chairman on September 22. During the meeting Mr Fayed confirmed his allegations while reiterating his grievance against what he claimed was a violation of his rights at the hands of the government. He expressed his continuing anger with the Department of Trade and Industry's report into the Fayed brothers' takeover of House of Fraser in 1985. The report said that Mr Fayed and his two brothers had misrepresented their origins, wealth, business interests and resources and had submitted false evidence. The Fayeds have always disputed these conclusions, although an appeal against it was rejected by the European Court of Human Rights the day before the meeting with Mr Greer. Mr Fayed also referred in his meeting with Mr Greer to his anger that his younger brother Ali had had his application for British citizenship 'blocked' by ministers. However Mr Cole last night denied that Mr Fayed had asked Mr Greer or any other intermediary to convey the substance of the meeting to the prime minister as a way of putting pressure on the government. Although rejecting any implication of blackmail against the government, Mr Major yesterday confirmed he had been informed about the allegations three weeks ago by an unnamed third party. Mr Major said that he had made it clear he was 'not prepared to come to any arrangement with Mr Fayed'. Last night however Mr Cole insisted that Mr Fayed's continuing wish was that the government should 'discredit' the DTI report.</p>

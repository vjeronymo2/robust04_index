			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Heseltine has to deliver the back benches: Andrew Adonis says the cabinet has yet to be convinced of the merits of a Post Office sell-off This week could see the final act in the long-running saga of government dithering about the future of the Post Office. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has to convince his cabinet colleagues that he can carry Tory backbenchers in support of privatisation. If he fails - as appears increasingly likely - then a year of preparatory work may have been in vain. If the status quo continues it will be partly as a result of the fears raised by opponents of privatisation. But it will also be a consequence of the government's failure to give serious consideration to the 'middle way' option of granting the Post Office full commercial freedom in the public sector. The government is looking at such an option, but has spent the last four months deriding it as impractical. The government tried to meet many of the concerns raised by opponents of privatisation in its consultation paper published in July. A Labour party leaflet delivered across north London at the weekend says that the government's plans 'will lead to local post offices facing closure, an increase in the price of stamps and cuts in postal deliveries'. In fact, under government plans the Post Office's counters division - which is responsible for high street and village post offices - will remain in the public sector. So the future of post offices - urban or rural - would be a matter for the government if they appeared to be under threat. As for the price of stamps, the latest increase - 1p on first and second class letters last November - followed a sharp increase in the Treasury's levy on the nationalised industry's profits. Last year the Post Office had to pay the Treasury Pounds 182m. This year it is Pounds 226m, a sum higher than the Post Office's post-tax profit for 1993-94 and nearly twice as much as a reasonable dividend payment if the industry were in the private sector. The government is also proposing to establish a postal regulator to ensure that price increases are justified by costs. Oftel, the regulator of the privatised telecoms industry, is imposing sharp price cuts on British Telecommunications - whose charges are substantially less, in real terms, than they were at privatisation a decade ago. It is arguable that the government's proposal to split the counters division from the Royal Mail will make rural and high street post offices more vulnerable than they are now. Some critics have called for more detailed regulation. The government could offer further guarantees on both fronts. But as one Tory MP put it yesterday: 'Unfortunately, such adjustments don't really matter. The fears our opponents are deploying so successfully would not be reduced.' He added: 'The experience of water privatisation, which remains bitterly unpopular and probably should not have gone ahead, has not helped.' The government could still, however, call the Labour party's bluff and propose to give the Post Office full commercial freedom in the public sector. Mr Bill Robinson, a former adviser to Mr Norman Lamont when chancellor, has set out such a course in a paper for the consultancy London Economics. He says that privatisation of the Post Office will not necessarily make it more efficient, and criticises the government for not looking hard enough at the case for a publicly-owned future for the Post Office. Having examined previous privatisations, London Economics concludes: 'Privatisation itself is not a fundamental driver of efficiency improvement. Competition, effective regulation and a determination to restructure the business when necessary matter more.' The Treasury has until now been resolutely opposed to granting the Post Office full commercial freedom in the public sector - however categoric the statutory and regulatory safeguards. The Treasury justifies its stance by citing rules on the compilation of the public accounts, and by arguing that a public-sector company could not, in practice, be allowed to float free while the government acted as ultimate guarantor for its debts. Mr Robinson cited the cases of New Zealand and Sweden, where state-owned postal services have been granted full commercial freedom and are flourishing. He said: 'It would be a major new departure in Britain, and the Treasury fears it would open the floodgates. But there isn't much else left in the public sector to come flooding through.' The Post Office has in any case been run for years as a profitable commercial organisation. It now faces 'the worst of all possible worlds', as one senior Post Office executive put it. Having dissipated its energies on a politically impossible privatisation scheme the government might simply leave the Post Office where it is. 'And that does nothing to meet our original concerns about survival in an increasingly competitive market,' he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA prepared estimates of the cost to owners and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators of implementing the requirements of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP at facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be subject to the rule. The total nationwide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital investment cost to purchase and install the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission controls that would be required by the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is estimated by the EPA to be approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $49 million. The total nationwide annual cost of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, as proposed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is estimated to be approximately $24.5 million per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 112 Statutory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section was comprehensively amended under Title III of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The term ``stationary source''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means any building, structure, facility, or installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that emits or may emit air pollutants. Under the amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA section 112(b), Congress listed 189 chemicals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds, or groups of chemicals as HAP. The EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed by the CAA section 112 to regulate the emission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these HAP from stationary sources by establishing national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards (i.e., NESHAP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A 1990 amendment to section 112(c) of the CAA requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA to develop and publish a list of source categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that emit HAP for which NESHAP will be developed. The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required to list all known categories and subcategories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``major sources.'' The term ``major source'' is defined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAA to mean ``any stationary source or group of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary sources located within a contiguous area and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under common control that emits or has the potential to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emit, considering controls, in the aggregate 10 tons per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year (ton/yr) or more of any HAP or 25 ton/yr or more of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of HAP.'' The EPA's initial list of categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of major sources of HAP emissions was published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each NESHAP source category listed by EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards must be developed to control HAP emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both new sources and existing sources in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific statutory directives set out in CAA section 112, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended. The statute requires the EPA to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards under a NESHAP to reflect the maximum degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in HAP emissions through application of maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievable control technology (MACT).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statutory minimum or baseline to the level of HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control that the EPA can select to be MACT for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular source category is defined under CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 112(d)(3). This minimum HAP emission control level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is referred as the ``MACT floor.'' For new sources, the MACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor is the level of HAP emission control that is achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in practice by the best controlled similar source. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute allows standards under a NESHAP for existing sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be less stringent than standards for new sources. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of MACT floor for existing sources is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent on the nationwide number of existing sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the source category. For a source category with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 or more existing sources, the MACT floor is the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limitation achieved by the best performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 percent of the existing sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the MACT floors are determined for new and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing sources in a source category, the EPA must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish standards under a NESHAP that are no less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than the applicable MACT floors. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may promulgate standards that are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than the MACT floor when such standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the EPA to be achievable taking into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration the cost of implementing the standards as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy requirements listed in CAA section 112(d)(2). All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners and operators of sources within the source category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must comply with the promulgated NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

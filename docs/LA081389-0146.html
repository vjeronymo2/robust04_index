			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BERGER UPSETS EDBERG IN U.S. HARDCOURT SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> Jay Berger upset top-seeded Stefan Edberg, 6-4, 6-2, and John McEnroe took  another step in his drive to regain the world's No. 1 ranking by defeating  Aaron Krickstein, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), Saturday in the semifinals of the U.S.  Hardcourt Championships at Indianapolis.  </P> <P> McEnroe, seeded second, plays Berger, No. 5, in today's title match.  </P> <P> Berger had to wait through a rain delay of 2 hours 40 minutes to defeat Edberg,  the world's third-ranked player. The match was delayed by heavy rain and hail  after Berger won the first set, 6-4, and took a 1-0 lead in the second set with  a service break.  </P> <P> Berger, ranked No. 22 in the world, held serve in the first game after play was  resumed. After Edberg held, Berger won the next three games for a 5-1 lead.  Edberg held in the seventh game, but Berger closed out the 77-minute match on  his second opportunity when Edberg was wide with a return.  </P> <P> McEnroe, who had lost only 14 games and one set in reaching the semifinals,  lost only eight points as he took the first five games in just 18 minutes.  </P> <P> McEnroe won 92% of his successful first serves in the opening set.  </P> <P> In the second set, Krickstein took a 5-3 advantage before McEnroe came back to  force the tiebreaker.  </P> <P> The victory gave McEnroe, 29-4 in tour matches this year and ranked sixth in  the world, a chance for his third championship of 1989 and his 75th overall as  he tunes up to seek a fifth U.S. Open title.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Brad Gilbert broke fourth-seeded Jim Courier five times in seven  chances in a 6-2, 6-0 victory to advance to the final of the Swiss Army Knife  Open at West Orange, N.J.  </P> <P> Gilbert, the No. 9 player in the world, needed just 66 minutes to eliminate  Courier after rain delayed their match 10 hours.  </P> <P> Gilbert will meet Jason Stoltenberg of Australia in today's final. Stoltenberg  defeated Chris Bailey of England, 6-4, 6-3, in a match that started on an  outdoor court at Newark Academy and ended on an indoor court at the West Orange  Tennis Club.  </P> <P> Gilbert did not have any problems with Courier, 18, who has risen from No. 360  to No. 36 in one year.  </P> <P> "I hammered him," Gilbert said. "I hammered him in every phase of the game."  </P> <P> Stoltenberg will be making his first Grand Prix final appearance.  </P> <P> Fourth-seeded Nicole Hummel of San Marino defeated fifth-seeded Jill Brenner of  Lakeland, Fla., 6-0, 6-3, to win the United States Tennis Assn. girls'  16-and-under national championship at Charleston, W.Va.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sa'ib 'Urayqat, local government </F> minister in the Palestinian National Authority, in Jericho, by  Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not given; from the  "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, good morning. We  welcome you to the Voice of the Arabs.    ['Urayqat] Good morning.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You have been selected minister of local  government in the Palestinian National Authority. Can you tell  us about the authority's makeup?    ['Urayqat] So far, 15 portfolios have been selected. Of  course, the president, brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], is  the head of the Palestinian National Authority. The posts that  have been given out are as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Health                                |Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Education                             |Yasir 'Amr                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Justice                               |Furayh Abu-Middayn                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Finance                               |Zuhdi al-Nashashibi                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sports and Youth Affairs              |'Azmi al-Shu'aybi                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tourism and Antiquities               |Ilyas Frayj                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Social Affairs                        |Intisar al-Wazir                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Labor                                 |Samir Ghawshah                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Housing                               |Zakariya al-Agha                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Culture and Arts                      |Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Post and Telecommunications           |'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transport                             |'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Planning and International Cooperation|Dr. Nabil Sha'th                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Economy and Trade                     |Ahmad Quray'                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Discussions on filling the other portfolios is continuing,  including the Ministry of the Liberated and Injured Affairs [as  heard], Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Information  Ministry, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Religious  Affairs, Environment Ministry, and Interior Ministry.  Appointments to these posts have not been settled yet and  deliberations will continue for several days.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Are there any obstacles to the appointment  of  the remaining ministers?    ['Urayqat] It is not really a question of obstacles. We are  keeping two issues in mind. First, we are trying to represent  the largest possible sector of our people in the National  Authority. Contacts are taking place on several levels for this  purpose. We hope that these contacts will produce a broad  representation of the political movements in the National  Authority. The second issue is that what we are doing now is  not as easy as in other countries. We are starting from square  one. We are facing huge challenges and difficulties, including  the devastated infrastructure left by the Israeli occupation in  Jericho and the Gaza Strip and the ruined infrastructure we are  expecting to take over when the Israelis evacuate the other  areas. The gaps found in the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement  present further difficulties. The challenges and  responsibilities are great. This is why we are making further  contacts. We need more time so we can include the broadest  possible representation in the National Authority while keeping  in mind that the people filling the posts must have the  necessary qualifications.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What criteria were used in selecting the  Palestinian National Authority's ministers?    ['Urayqat] There were several criteria. We had to keep in  mind the mingling of Palestinians living abroad with those  living inside. As you will notice, several PLO Executive  Committee members and people from other PLO institutions have  been given portfolios. We believed in the importance of  qualifications and experience but also in the appointees'  patriotic commitment and their willingness to accept the  challenges. We are passing through an interim phase  unprecedented in modern times. Above all, we must preserve the  Palestinian people's unity at this stage, regardless of where  they live.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, in this interim period you  are certainly facing immense difficulties that, as you say, are  a product of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.  What are your working plans for the future?    ['Urayqat] As you know, our work began immediately after the  occupation troops left. Still, no matter how fast we act, we  will remain somewhat behind. We must remember that normal  development in the occupied Palestinian territories was  effectively halted in 1967. No matter how fast we work and  implement our programs, we will remain a little behind because  we have a lot to do. We have already done something in the  short time that has passed since the end of the occupation of  Gaza and Jericho. All government departments are now using  documents and letterheads bearing the Palestinian National  Authority's stamp. New departments have been established. Some  temporary appointments have been made in all the areas. Now  that the portfolios have been distributed, every ministry will  build up its organizational structure and draw up plans and  projects for the first 100 days. We must work quickly now. We  want to finish our present work in the next few hours, not days.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, Israel consistently casts  doubt  on the Palestinian National Authority's actual ability to  govern. Israel is saying that the Palestinians were always ruled  by others and casts doubt on their ability to govern themselves.    ['Urayqat] We are really facing two types of Israeli  campaigns. First, media campaigns trying to undermine our  efforts -- we have been expecting this -- and second, Israeli  actions that violate the clauses of the agreement or create  faits accomplis as in Jerusalem and the settlements. They are  expanding the existing settlements. I believe that what we are  doing is an experiment that involves factors of success and  failure. I can definitely say that if Israel continues its  current actions and fails to alter its occupier attitude to a  neighborly attitude that involves respecting an adjacent nation  that the experiment will fail. So far we have heard only  accusations and incitements from the Israeli officials. They  are also carrying out conspicuous, blatant violations of the  agreement.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, we wish success for the  Palestinian National Authority. We hope that the fraternal  Palestinian people will fulfill their aspirations in the next  stage, now that they have begun to restore their national  rights. Thank you very much.    ['Urayqat] You are welcome. I would like to say one last  word. The current stage is one of planting, not reaping. It is  a time to tighten our belts. It is a small step on a long  route. We hope, however, that in the next few years our efforts  and struggles will be crowned by the establishment of an  independent state.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] God willing.    ['Urayqat] God willing. Thank you.</p>

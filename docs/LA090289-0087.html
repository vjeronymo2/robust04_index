			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS WITH POLYGRAM CONFIRMED;  </P> <P> CO-FOUNDERS OF A&amp;M RECORDS CONSIDERING SALE OF COMPANY  </P> <P> A&amp;M Records founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss confirmed in a memorandum  distributed to employees Friday that they are "having conversations with  Polygram regarding future business opportunities."  </P> <P> The one-page memo did not disclose the terms under discussion for the company,  which was founded by the pair in 1962 in trumpet player Alpert's Fairfax  district garage. However, N. V. Philip's Polygram unit has reportedly offered  about $500 million for closely held A&amp;M in a deal said not to include the  company's real estate or music publishing interests.  </P> <P> "Should these talks materialize into some sort of business transaction, you  must know that we would only consider such a move if it strengthened our  position in the industry," the A&amp;M executives, both 54, wrote in their  memo. "Along with our artists and producers, A&amp;M's management and staff  continue to remain our biggest asset and our highest priority for now and for  the future."  </P> <P> A&amp;M officials would not comment on the memorandum, and Polygram officials  could not be reached Friday. However, a spokeswoman for A&amp;M said that,  although there was "a lot of discussion" about the memo among A&amp;M's staff,  it was "business as usual" at the company.  </P> <P> An acquisition of A&amp;M would be Polygram's second purchase of a large  independent record company this summer and would continue a trend of  consolidation in the recording industry.  </P> <P> Polygram, which ranks third in record sales behind Time Warner's labels and  Sony Corp.'s CBS Records, announced last month that it had bought Island  Records for a reported $331 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Industry 'Pretty Consolidated'  </P> <P> Polygram already distributes A&amp;M's records in Europe. RCA Records is the  U.S. distributor of A&amp;M Records, which has only a 2% market share and has  long been rumored to be up for sale.  </P> <P> If Polygram completes the purchase, analysts believe that it would help  position the company for a run at CBS Records' second-place standing in the  record industry. A purchase would leave only Geffen and Virgin records as  major, independently owned labels.  </P> <P> "The industry was pretty consolidated even before this rumor surfaced," said  James C. Goss, an analyst for the Duff &amp; Phelps investment house in  Chicago. "You already had a near oligopoly."  </P> <P> However, Goss said he didn't believe that the proposed deal would result in  increased record prices or reduce opportunities for new recording artists.  </P> <P> Finding hot new talent has lately been problematic for A&amp;M. Although the  Hollywood-based company had been one of the industry's most consistently  successful labels for more than 25 years, it has performed poorly this year.  </P> <P> A&amp;M has annual sales of between $220 million and $300 million, according to  analysts' estimates.  </P> <P> A&amp;M currently has just one album in the top 100: "Surprise Attack" by the  hard rock group Tora Tora Tora. However, the company has high hopes for a  forthcoming release by Janet Jackson, whose last album, "Control," sold nearly  5 million copies in the United States.  </P> <P> Many in the industry expected that Alpert and Moss might wait until A&amp;M  climbed out of its current slump before selling the company. And some sources  close to the talks said Friday that Alpert and Moss may consider selling only a  minority stake in their company.  </P> <P> Others say that if Jackson's album is released soon and sells well, Alpert and  Moss may wait for a better offer.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. reportedly has expressed interest in A&amp;M as a music  operation to compete with entertainment industry rivals MCA Inc. and Time  Warner. But analysts contacted Friday said the Polygram bid was too far along  for A&amp;M to be considering other offers.  </P></p>

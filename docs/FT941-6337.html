			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Democratic right of Swiss Sir, As a Swiss citizen I felt rather uncomfortable reading your article, 'EU up in arms over Alpine truck ban' (February 22). The Swiss people decided in a democratic vote to ban trucks from travelling through the Swiss Alps. That the EU now threatens Switzerland with retaliatory measures leaves me with the impression that the EU does not respect a result of a democratic decision. This position will not make it easier for the new candidates (all rather small countries) to join the EU since, under the Maastricht treaty, decisions such as that taken in Switzerland would simply be overruled by an institution with weak democratic foundations. But different opinions are also held within the EU. The former environment minister, Carlo Ripa di Meana, said he hoped this was 'not an isolated case but a turn of the trend' in European transport policy.

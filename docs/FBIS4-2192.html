			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The China Automobile  Import and Trading Center should be the main channel for  importing automobiles, said Vice-Premier Li Lanqing.    He told a working conference of the center that the center  should do well in services and not seek profits.    The premier said that there should be other channels for  importing automobiles but they should be subject to  macro-economic control.    He encouraged automobile importing firms to import more  technology in order to upgrade China's auto industry which is on  the road to maturity.    The China Auto Import and Trading Center, a legal entity,  was  approved by the State Council in June last year. Since then, it  has imported 14,000 automobiles from the United States and  formulated relevant marketing rules. It has also carried out  bonded businesses for imports and barter trade.</p>

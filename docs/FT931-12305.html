			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC up 34% CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, the US television and newspapers group, yesterday turned in a fourth-quarter 1992 net profit of Dollars 137.9m, or Dollars 8.38 a share, an improvement of 34 per cent year-on-year. The results, which included a moderate rise in revenues at the ABC Television network, were struck on total revenues of Dollars 1.64bn, some 5 per cent better than in the same quarter of 1991. For the year to end-December 1992, Capital Cities/ABC earned Dollars 389.3m before taking special charges for changes in accounting standards, up from Dollars 374.7m before charges in 1991. After an accountancy-related provision of Dollars 143.2m, the group's net income for 1992 fell to Dollars 246.1m, against a net of Dollars 343.5m the previous year. Operating income for the year was Dollars 721.8m, down from Dollars 761m in 1991. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 5.34bn, down slightly from Dollars 5.38bn in 1991. Net revenues for ABC Television were slightly lower, primarily because of the absence of 1991 added revenues from special-event sports programming. Although the group does not state operating profits for ABC Television, it is understood these came to just below Dollars 100m for 1992, against an estimated Dollars 135m the previous year. The decline is believed to be related to a series of internally recorded special charges caused by buy-outs being offered to some executives and other cost-cutting measures. On Wall Street, the Capital Cities/ABC share price closed Dollars 2 3/4 higher at Dollars 481.</p>

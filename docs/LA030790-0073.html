			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIP LEADS TO $500,000 IN STOLEN PROPERTY AND 15 ARRESTS  </P> <P> A South El Monte electrician who thought a neighboring business seemed  suspicious led Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies to a warehouse where  $500,000 in stolen goods was seized and 15 people were arrested, officers said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Most of the merchandise, which ranged from refrigerators to picnic tables to  cans of tuna, was still packaged and appeared to have been taken from the  storerooms of several San Gabriel Valley businesses, deputies said.  </P> <P> Detectives are investigating the possibility that the cache may be connected to  an interstate ring involving millions of dollars in stolen goods, but no other  details about the operation were available, Deputy George Ducoulombier said.  </P> <P> The 15 people arrested ranged in age from 21 to 45 and were in or near the  12,000-square-foot warehouse on the 1800 block of Floradale Avenue when  officers arrived Monday night, deputies said. They were taken to the Temple  City sheriff's substation and booked on suspicion of receiving stolen property.  Bail was set at $5,000 each.  </P> <P> Jeff Smith, 30, an electrician next door at Walton Winding Service, said he had  long wondered what went on at the warehouse in a cinder-block building with a  sign in the window reading "JCC Video Star."  </P> <P> But Smith said he did not get concerned until he heard a big rig with two  trailers come screeching down the dead-end street and pull up to the warehouse  about 5 p.m. Monday. Men started throwing boxes from the trailer into parked  cars, he said.  </P> <P> "It just didn't look right," said Smith, adding that he once repaired a small  electrical tool for a man who worked at JCC Video.  </P> <P> When deputies arrived, they stopped two men on the block driving what turned  out to be a stolen tractor-trailer, Ducoulombier said. Deputies then went into  the warehouse and discovered dozens of stacked cardboard boxes, at least some  of which have since been claimed by a Home Club store in the City of Industry  and a local supermarket, he said.  </P> <P> Deputies said they did not know whether the video company had any connection to  the theft ring.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> DEPTH OF COMMITMENT TO BE MEASURED;  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> Movie-going in Orange County will be stronger and more mainstream than ever  over the next decade, industry insiders say, in tandem with an ambitious  building program by the county's major theater chain.  </P> <P> Edwards Cinema, which operates 200 screens for first-run commercial fare  throughout Southern California, plans to add another 100 screens during 1990  alone. Advertising director Bladen Thompson says most will come in Orange  County, where Edwards now has 105 screens, with the main concentration in South  County.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the high price of real estate is likely to keep the number of  art-movie houses basically where it now is for the early '90s. So says Stephen  Gilula, president of the San Francisco-based Landmark Theatre Corp., which  operates the Balboa Cinema in Newport Beach and the Port Theatre in Corona del  Mar among 82 screens nationwide.  </P> <P> Landmark expects to reopen the old Fox Theatre movie palace in Fullerton as a  renovated three-screen complex showing both mainstream and art-house fare in  late 1990 or early 1991. But the chain doesn't anticipate any further expansion  in the county over the next few years.  </P> <P> "I think the market for art films is strong down there," Gilula said, "but not  strong enough to justify the extremely high cost of real estate. You have to  have big-grossing films to support that kind of investment." JAN HERMAN  </P></p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Viag net hits record DM405m VIAG, the fast-growing German conglomerate, has revealed record sales and profits for 1991. It said it was confident of further growth despite tough economic conditions. Profits after tax rose 20 per cent to DM405m (Dollars 245.4m), matching company forecasts. Sales, however, fell short of predictions from Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director, who in December promised a 25 per cent increase. Even so, turnover was up 22 per cent at DM23.7bn, thanks mainly to the effect of acquisitions during the year. Viag, which was formerly government-owned, has increased sales four-fold since privatisation started in 1986. Announcing the provisional 1991 results, the company said acquisitions made during the year - notably the purchase of packaging group Continental Can Europe - had helped it offset the effects of weaker performances in chemicals and divisions supplying the iron and steel industry. Aluminium sales also fell 10 per cent during the year. However the glass and energy divisions improved. The group, which is planning to float off a 49 per cent stake in its VAW aluminium division, last year increased investment in the business by 53 per cent to DM487m, fulfilling Mr Obermeier's promise to 'dress up the bride'. VAW is awaiting monopolies clearance for its agreed bid for Eisenwerke Bruhl, a motor components supplier.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buying programme lifts shares at the close - Market Report The UK stock market rounded off the third trading quarter of the year with a sudden burst of optimism as a Pounds 100m buy programme, reportedly from UBS, the Swiss investment bank, helped spur the FT-SE 100 Share Index comfortably above the 3,000 mark. The final reading put the Footsie at 3,026.3, the best of the day and a net gain of 33.8 on the session. The December stock index futures contract closed strongly just above 3,040. Almost all the advance in the equity sector came towards the close of trading when markets also responded to reports, later denied, of a favourable settlement to the US-Japan trade negotiations. For much of the session, the market moved uncertainly, regaining and then losing the Footsie 3,000 benchmark in very modest trading volume. The big securities houses were still digesting the Pounds 250m trading programme of the previous day, which had proved the final straw for trading books already hit several times this week by sizeable sell programmes. Some dealing houses are believed to have suffered severe losses as share prices have moved sharply and often erratically. However, retail business in equities has remained at a profitable level for the London securities industry. Market confidence was not helped when SG Warburg, the London based investment bank, trimmed its year-end forecast for the Footsie Index from its long-standing target of 3,500 to 3,250 because of the continued weakness in UK gilts. Boosted perceptibly by yesterday's late upswing, the stock market ended the third quarter with a gain of around 3.7 per cent, or 107 points on the FT-SE 100 Index over the three months. This week has brought further pressure on UK equities, with some institutions moving into bonds and some preferring to face their quarterly meeting with trustees with increased weightings in cash rather than equities. The stock market had settled won with a very modest gain at mid-afternoon yesterday when equity traders had effectively balanced their books for the end of the quarter. Consequently, the Swiss bank's buying programme, accompanied by a sharp jump in the Dow Average on the US-Japan trade talk rumours, sent the market ahead sharply. The gain in the Dow was also trimmed to 10 points in UK trading hours. Trading volume was slow to develop and the Seaq total stood barely above 3,000 shares in early afternoon. By the time the market closed, the trading programme had lifted the Seaq total to 551.1m shares, still lagging behind the 586.8m of the previous session. Blue chip stocks attracted most of the interest yesterday, non-Footsie business making up only about 54 per cent of the total. On Thursday, retail, or customer activity remained fairly high, with a value total of Pounds 1.44bn. The broader range of the market, less closely linked to stock index futures, played little part in the late rally in the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued to fall, closing a further 9.2 off at 3,494.8. Long-dated British government bonds closed firmly, encouraged by improvements in German and US bonds. Though sluggish for most of the day, the long dates ended with gains of nearly half a point. The short gilts, still nervous over the near term prospects for domestic base rates, had a quiet day and ,lacking supporters, ended a shade off on the session. The UK markets are expected to open the final quarter of the year on a cautious note, with investors focusing on important economic data due next week in the UK and from Washington. The most serious test of the Federal Reserve's policies and the market's nerves is expected on Friday when the latest US payroll and unemployment figures are due.</p>

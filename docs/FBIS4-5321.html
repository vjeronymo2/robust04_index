			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 8 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  expects to spend [Malaysian ringgit] RM16.2 billion (about US$6  billion) on development of the telecommunications industry for  the next five years from 1993, Deputy Energy, Telecommunications  and Posts Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said Friday.    Only through sustained investment in domestic research and  development could the country ensure a steady, if not  spectacular, growth in the industry and contribute towards  Vision 2020, he said at the opening of the  Telemex/Elec-Com/Electrical '94 Exhibition, here.    Tajol Rosli said that given the rising demand for  telecommunications services, joint-venture projects with  multi-national manufacturers to produce or assemble  telecommunications equipment locally were encouraged if Malaysia  were to be a strong contender in the telecommunications  equipment export area.    In this respect, he noted that Telekom Malaysia was leading  the way by investing RM670 million (about US$248 million) in its  local network, RM160 million (about US$59.25 million) in its  international network and RM1.7 billion (US$629 million) in the  development of rural telecommunications.    It is hoped that other telecommunications corporations would  follow suit and work towards making Malaysia the regional centre  for telecommunications activities, he added.    The six-day exhibition on telecommunications system, office  automation, electronics and electrical equipment, is staged by  54 exhibitors including those from China, Germany, Japan and  Singapore.</p>

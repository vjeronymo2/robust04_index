			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Tories jump the gun in war on Smith MR JOHN SMITH will take up the Labour leadership today against a barrage of invective from senior Conservatives, a Liberal Democrat appeal for co-operation and the first questioning of his physical fitness by The Sun. Mr David Hill, Labour's communications director, expressed mild satisfaction that Mr Smith had succeeded in provoking attacks even before taking office. That the Conservatives needed to round on Mr Smith so soon after their general election victory showed the 'fragile state' of a government under attack over Europe and the economy. The confirmation of Mr Smith's accession to the leadership will come shortly after 2.30pm today at a delegate meeting at London's Royal Horticultural Halls. It will be followed by the announcement of Mrs Margaret Beckett's successful bid for the party's deputy leadership. The 1,500 delegates will hear addresses from both victors, with Mr Smith scheduled to round off the day with a rallying call to the party. His speech will stress his intention to open up Labour's agenda and to modernise the party. Three cabinet ministers and Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, yesterday all issued speeches attacking Mr Smith. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, described him as 'yesterday's man', claiming his views were 'firmly rooted in Labour's past'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, held out an olive branch, calling on Mr Smith 'to commit Labour to joining in the building of the new politics'. Yesterday also saw the first shot against Mr Smith's leadership from the Tory-supporting tabloid press. Under the headline 'He's fat, he's 53, he's had a heart attack and he's taking on a stress-loaded job', The Sun claimed Mr Smith would be lucky to get a life insurance policy.

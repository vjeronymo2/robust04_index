An equimolar quantity of  CuCl[.sub]2[/][.sup].[/]2H[.sub]2[/]O solid crystal  hydrate was added to a solution of 0.3 mmol of ligand in 5 ml  CH[.sub]3[/]CN at room temperature. The mixture was stirred  intensively until the salt dissolved and then held for 2 days.  The resultant light green crystals were filtered off, rinsed  with hexane, and dried over CaCl[.sub]2[/]. When chemically  pure acetone was used as the solvent, small acicular yellow  crystals were formed. The CuCl[.sub]2[/]L complexes were  subjected to x-ray crystallographic analysis on a CAD-4  diffractometer, infrared spectroscopy on a Specord 751R, and EPR  studies on an SE/X-2544 EPR spectrometer (Radiopan). The  crystals of the compounds formed were classified as triclinic  with lattice parameters as follows: a = 8.391(1), b = 10.486(2),  and c = 6.42(7) angstroms; _a_ = 81.07(3), _b_ = 87.27(3),  and  _g_ = 72.04(1); V = 962.5(6) A[.sup]3[/]; Z = 2; and  limiting boundary = P1. The x-ray crystallographic analysis  established that in the complex, the  cyclohexanedioneisoquinoline functions as a bridge ligand that  is coordinated to its two neighboring copper atoms through the  oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups of the cyclohexanedione  fragment of the molecule. The studies further established that  the ligand in the complex has the very same tautomeric form as  in a uncoordinated state. The spectrochemical characteristics of  the tautomeric form and the method of coordination of  dihydroisoquinolinecyclohexanedione were determined. The EPR  spectroscopy studies confirmed Cu-Cu magnetic interaction in  polycrystalline samples of the complexes. The degree of  polymerism of the polycrystalline specimens studied was found to  depend on the quantity of crystallization water present in them.

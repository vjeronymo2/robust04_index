			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Harmony Leisure agrees to boardroom changes MOVES TO oust the board of Harmony Leisure, the pubs and restaurants group, appeared close to collapse yesterday after the company agreed to demands by leading shareholders for board changes and an independent review of its loss-making operations. Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, and Southend Property Holdings, which together control almost 20 per cent of the share capital, have nominated two senior officials to join the board. Mr Martin Marcus, joint managing director of Queens Moat, and Mr John Main, a director at Southend Property, will become non-executive directors. Harmony will also allow Guiness Mahon, the merchant bank, to scrutinise its trading performance and future prospects following accumulated losses of Pounds 6.9m over the past three years. Rebel shareholders seeking the removal of Mr Stanley Lever, the managing director, welcomed the changes and said they would no longer press for the appointment of new executive directors, which was due to be considered at an extraordinary meeting today Their decision signals a partial victory for the board and Mr Lever, who has been fighting an increasingly bitter struggle for control of the company. 'The dissidents are just marauders involved in a wasted effort,' the company said yesterday in its latest salvo against the rebels.</p>

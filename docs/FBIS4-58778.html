			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)-- Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz  al-Dali, member of the Political Bureau of the Yemen Socialist  Party [YSP] and personal envoy of Yemeni Vice President [title  as received] 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    Following the meeting, al-Dali stated that the urgent  meeting  of the Arab League Council is a positive step toward solving the  Yemeni crisis. He said he hopes the meeting will stop the  bloody war between northern and southern Yemeni troops in good  time.    He added that the YSP supports any step the brothers at the  Arab League take and the Egyptian initiative on Yemen.    Al-Dali said the current infighting in Yemen is not a  domestic but rather a pan-Arab affair, adding that the YSP will  demand Arab assistance if the Yemeni parties fail to stop the  fighting.    Touching on the Egyptian proposal to send Arab peace-keeping  forces to Yemen, al-Dali remarked that the YSP will welcome this  if it becomes necessary, even if Yemeni leaders refuse to stop  fighting.    He appealed to all Yemeni leaders and brothers in Egypt and  other Arab states to take action to end the ongoing fighting in  Yemen.</p>

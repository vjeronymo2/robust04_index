			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. GERMANS OFFER LIMITS ON FORCES;  </P> <P> UNIFICATION: BONN IS WILLING TO NEGOTIATE THE SIZE OF FUTURE ARMY. ALLIES NEAR  AGREEMENT ON RESHAPING NATO. GORBACHEV MAY BE INVITED TO ADDRESS ALLIANCE.  </P> <P> West Germany declared for the first time Thursday that it is willing to  negotiate limits on the future military forces of a united Germany as the  Western allies neared agreement on a historic declaration designed to reshape  NATO and reassure the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> As part of their effort to convince Moscow it has nothing to fear from a  unified Germany inside NATO, leaders of the alliance's 16 member nations  prepared to accept a set of proposals by President Bush that include inviting  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to address the alliance and pledging to  use nuclear weapons "only as a last resort" in a conventional war in Europe.  </P> <P> Under present doctrine, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United  States have refused to rule out early use of nuclear weapons in the event of  such a conflict.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, second only to Bush as a force in  determining the shape that NATO will assume in response to the dramatic  political changes that are transforming Europe, announced his country's  willingness to limit its own forces during the opening session of a two-day  NATO summit here.  </P> <P> Referring to negotiations now going on in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw  Pact nations over reducing conventional forces in Europe, Kohl declared, "In  Vienna, the federal government will be willing to negotiate on the level of  forces to be maintained by a united Germany."  </P> <P> It was the first time that Kohl, who has repeatedly driven home the point that  a united Germany must be accepted as a fully sovereign and equal member of the  Atlantic Alliance, had agreed to cap military forces. Only last month, when  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze advanced the idea during talks  on German reunification, Bonn, joined by the United States, Britain and France,  the other Western governments involved in the talks, rejected the idea.  </P> <P> West German government sources conceded that Kohl's new willingness to work out  such limits is part of an effort to obtain Soviet acquiescence in German  reunification and in a unified Germany's belonging to NATO. Even so, German  sources made it clear that a cap on its future armaments could come only as a  decision by a sovereign German government, not as something imposed by Moscow  or by its own allies.  </P> <P> While Bush and Kohl took the lead in efforts to show sensitivity to the Soviet  Union's vested interest in the NATO discussions taking place here, a West  German spokesman said it was clear that "everyone wants a dramatic signal to be  sent out reassuring the Soviets" that they should have no fear of a surprise  attack by NATO.  </P> <P> In a similar vein, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at a news  briefing after the closed-door discussions at London's historic Lancaster  House:  </P> <P> "As the adage goes, seeing is believing. And the President proposed to give the  Warsaw Pact countries a special view of NATO that could help change their  perspective on our years of adversarial relations.  </P> <P> "He proposed to invite President Gorbachev to attend a NATO meeting and he  proposed to establish some kind of liaison between the Warsaw Pact countries  and NATO," Fitzwater said. "The President said, 'We will show that NATO has a  new dimension of cooperation with the Soviet Union and with the new democracies  of Eastern Europe,' "  </P> <P> A summit declaration redefining NATO's mission and including such assurances  will be issued when the leaders conclude their meetings today. Although their  discussions Thursday were so free of contention that the leaders ended an  afternoon session half an hour early, the final declaration is considered so  important that the foreign ministers of the 16 nations worked late into the  night hammering out its exact wording.  </P> <P> The Associated Press, quoting diplomatic sources, reported that the foreign  ministers agreed early today on a 20-paragraph draft communique that includes  an invitation to the Warsaw Pact to sign a mutual non-aggression agreement.  </P> <P> The tentative proposal "is basically stating that various countries who sign it  are no longer adversaries and should refrain from threat or use of force," one  source said.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the opening discussions centered on proposals that Bush had made  before the summit and, while no final decisions have been made, there has been  a "generally positive response" from the allies.  </P> <P> Bush's proposal that Gorbachev be invited to address NATO has not yet been  raised with the Soviet leader, nor have the allies yet formally agreed to such  an invitation. But U.S. officials left little doubt that they expect the  invitation to be extended and Gorbachev to accept.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources said Gorbachev will be invited to address a session of the  North Atlantic Council at NATO's headquarters in Brussels in December. A senior  U.S. official said Bush and the other Western government leaders almost  certainly would attend if Gorbachev accepted.  </P> <P> Georgy Shakhnazarov, a personal aide to Gorbachev, said late Thursday that the  Soviet leader is prepared to accept any such invitation. Shakhnazarov was  interviewed on the U.S. Public Broadcasting System's "MacNeill-Lehrer  Newshour."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said a Gorbachev appearance, as well as a Bush proposal that the  Warsaw Pact nations be invited to establish a liaison office at NATO  headquarters in Brussels, was intended to give the Soviets the kind of access  to NATO that would reassure them of the alliance's commitment to peaceful  cooperation.  </P> <P> The proposal to alter NATO's policy on when it would use its nuclear weapons by  stipulating that they would be unleashed only as "a last resort" was agreed to  in principle by all the allies, although both British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand had reservations about it.  Both warned that NATO should do nothing to diminish the value of its nuclear  arms as a deterrent to Soviet attack, noting that Moscow will retain enormous  military power regardless of any changes the future may bring .  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials had been eager to paint the proposal to make  atomic arms the "weapons of last resort" as a significant shift in NATO  strategy, but felt compelled to backpedal when Thatcher balked at the proposed  wording.  </P> <P> When Thatcher complained that such a declaration would weaken the alliance's  nuclear deterrent posture, U.S. officials hastened to assure her that the new  phrase was principally a rhetorical gesture designed to send a conciliatory  note to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> It would not, the officials assured her, change the Atlantic Alliance's  longstanding commitment to use nuclear force if Western Europe were in danger  of being overrun by Soviet conventional forces.  </P> <P> In the end, Thatcher, the lone holdout against the "last resort" language,  acceded to the Bush initiative.  </P> <P> In her opening statement, Thatcher said, "We are at a turning point in Europe's  history, a turning point which is as full of promise as was 1919 and 1945. And  we know that it is the existence of NATO and its sure defense which have helped  to change the direction of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union from the dictate  of government towards the democracy of the people."  </P> <P> The signal from the NATO summit, she said, "must be one of resolve in defense,  resolve and unity in defense, coupled with willingness to extend the hand of  friendship to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> She also told of receiving a message from Gorbachev that British officials  later described as a two-page letter expressing hope for constructive results  from the NATO summit, but also expressing interest in next week's economic  summit at Houston, where the United States and six other industrialized  countries -- Canada, Britain, France, Italy, West Germany and Japan -- are  expected to discuss aid to the Soviet Union along with other economic matters.  </P> <P> A British spokesman said that while Gorbachev expressed an interest in  receiving such aid from the allies, his letter did not request it.  </P> <P> The issue of aid to the Soviet Union was not raised at the summit here  Thursday. The U.S. position has been that Western aid should not be extended  until the Soviet Union ends its own aid in Third World trouble spots and adopts  further reforms to transform its planned economy into more of a free-market  system.  </P> <P> French officials, meanwhile, were so eager to give wide circulation to  Mitterrand's views on the reshaping of the NATO mission and his concern about  the continuing Soviet military threat that they released an English translation  of his opening statement, something they ordinarily do only long after an  official meeting.  </P> <P> While Mitterrand agreed with the "spirit" of Bush's proposals and agreed that  it is time to establish new relations in Europe, he urged that in adopting a  strategy for the future, NATO retain "truly a concept of deterrence, i.e., that  its unambiguous objective should be to prevent the outbreak of war and not  simply to try to win a war."  </P> <P> "I do not think an open conflict can escape from its logical progression,  namely ever greater use of arms, until the atomic bomb," he declared.  </P> <P> In the evening, German officials spelled out in greater detail their position  on setting limits on the military forces of a united Germany.  </P> <P> "For the Soviets, the future of a united Germany's force levels is important,"  commented a senior member of the West German delegation.  </P> <P> The Bonn government stressed, however, that it is only prepared to consider the  issue in a way that would not single out Germany for punishment as a result of  its defeat in World War II.  </P> <P> For that reason, West Germany, supported by the United States and other NATO  countries, wants to cover the matter in the Vienna talks and not the so-called  "two-plus-four" unification negotiations among the two German states and the  four major victorious World War II powers -- the United States, Britain, France  and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "We don't want to be singled out," commented a member of the German delegation.  "We're thankful that the Soviets say this should be discussed in Vienna."  </P> <P> Theoretically, the German troop limitation would be contained within a general  agreement concerning all military forces in Central Europe, to avoid singling  out Germany. However, it seems certain that in practice the limit will apply  primarily to Germany.  </P> <P> The first round of the 23-nation conventional forces talks is expected to be  concluded before the end of this year. There probably is not time enough to  include a German troop limit in that round, but a ranking U.S. State Department  official said the Soviet Union is demanding some sort of resolution of the  German troop issue before it agrees to remove the last of its World War II  occupation rights.  </P> <P> "The Soviets have a very substantial interest in knowing what the forces are  going to be in the central region of Europe, before they agree to all of the  external aspects of German unification," the U.S. official said.  </P> <P> He said the limit could be included either in a supplement to the first  conventional forces agreement or in immediate follow-on talks.  </P> <P> "You've got to make sure it's a procedure that the Soviets are happy with so  they'll go forward with a final (reunification) settlement," the official said.  "There's no difference of approach between us and the Germans."  </P> <P> A leading West German newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, reported  earlier this week that Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and  Defense Minister Gerd Stoltenberg agreed in secret talks to consider limits on  the united German army. The newspaper said that Stoltenberg favored a limit of  400,000 while Genscher supported a 350,000 ceiling. West Germany now has about  494,000 troops and East Germany has at least 130,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization pact was signed April 4, 1949, in  Washington. In it, the United States, Canada and 10 European nations --  Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,  Norway and Portugal -- aligned themselves against any military threat from the  Soviet Union. Greece, Turkey, West Germany and Spain later joined the alliance.  The treaty says, "The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of  them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them  all." France, Spain and Iceland are not part of NATO's integrated military  structure.  </P></p>

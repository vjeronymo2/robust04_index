			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / The Property Market: The heat is still on - Despite a recent revival, pressure remains intense on surveyors Abbey National's costly exit from the estate agency business with the sale this week of its Cornerstone chain illustrates the depressed value of residential property agencies. This is in contrast to commercial property agencies, whose values are fast recovering. Over the past year, the share prices of many in the quoted surveying sector have risen sharply. Fletcher King's shares have advanced by 44 per cent; Savills by 152 per cent; DTZ Debenham Thorpe by 150 per cent; Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith by 311 per cent; and de Morgan Group by 220 per cent. Only Herring Baker Harris, which is picking itself up after recent management upheavals, has bucked the trend with a fall of 55 per cent over the same period. The share prices of commercial property agents have clearly bounced back after a long period in the doldrums. Anyone who bought shares in a property consultancy five years ago would have seen the value of their investment drop by between 48 per cent and 88 per cent. But some commentators and surveying practices are concerned that the surge in commercial property agents' share prices reflects exaggerated optimism. 'My feeling is that they (shares) have been re-rated too far. Business is still very tough,' says Mr Selwyn Jones, a broker at Credit Lyonnais, a french bank. The main factor influencing surveyors' relative good fortune is the resurgence in the property investment market. Savills recently announced a return to profits on the back of a sharp increase in investment activity and cost cuts. DTZ Debenham Thorpe followed with an announcement of sharply increased profits, partly because it had arranged many deals for German investors into the Central London office market. But the upturn in investment activity is favouring a relatively small number of the larger companies. The de Morgan Group struck a warning note about the increase in number and value of property investment transactions. 'The pace of recovery is likely to be affected by a shortage of suitable investment property and the reduced availability of loan finance for property,' it said. Some other pockets of business such as valuation, management and rate assessments, are proving robust. But property advisers are still struggling with agency work - the bread and butter of most businesses. Agents say that an upturn in enquiries has not translated into a take-up of space. Although retail property is begining to stabilise, few agents expect a general upturn in rents before next year. Rent review work is also sharply down as a result of the slump in rental values. Taken as a whole, the value of the property services market has fallen by more than 6 per cent to Pounds 843.3m over the past year, according to the Chartered Surveyors Survey, published by the Economic Development Briefing, a research group. The survey found that agency and financial services suffered a decline in revenue of more than 25 per cent over the past year. Only professional services such as rate assessments, valuations and legal and planning produced increased revenue. The practices which have fared best have been those with valuation, management and rating businesses; the hardest hit have been those which depend on income from lettings and deals. Yet many practices remain in severe difficulties; there have many instances of cash calls on partners to ensure a partnerships's survival. These pressures on practices have spawned a wave of mergers. The problems have been most acute for medium-sized firms, which have neither the breadth and credibility of their larger rivals nor the low overheads and specialist expertise of the smallest firms. 'A polarisation is taking place, between the large surveying companies and smaller niche players, and those occupying the middle ground are being squeezed,' says Mr Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. At the root of the problem lies the sector's rapid expansion between 1976 and 1992; during this period the profession grew by an average of 3 per cent a year. This has left a legacy of overcapacity, which is likely to encourage more mergers and more job losses. The recent spate of mergers has caused some consolidation in what is still a highly fragmented sector. The top three surveying practices, DTZ Debenham Thorpe, Chesterton and Jones Lang Wootton, each have a market share of more than 5 per cent, according to the Chartered Surveyors Survey. 'It must be likely that with too many firms of surveyors chasing a contracting traditional market for fees, more mergers will follow, with more hardship for individual employees,' says Mr Lewis. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the shake-out of staff has begun to ease. In any event, demand for new recruits is likely to remain subdued until there is more convincing evidence of a market upturn. 'It is still pretty bleak,' says Ms Vivienne Packer, an executive search consultant at Alexander Hughes. She notes, however, that there is demand for some specialisms such as facilities management, which are are expanding in an effort to offer a more complete service. Nonetheless, the industry has shown little evidence of having benefitted from the shake-out and capacity cuts. As existing partnerships have shed staff, many of those displaced have formed their own practices. This has boosted competition and kept fees down to barely profitable levels. Until there is a convincing recovery in the property market, the pressure will remain intense on all but the best-placed practices.</p>

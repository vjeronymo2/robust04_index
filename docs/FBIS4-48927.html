			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- In an interview with  this reporter today, State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen  said that the momentum of continuous commodity price increases  was effectively restrained and that the prices of consumer  goods, capital goods, and services in the nation's urban and  rural areas declined noticeably in March.    Ye Zhen said: According to statistics, compared with  February, when commodity prices rose dramatically, consumer  prices in the nation's urban and rural areas declined by 1.5 and  0.1 percentage points, respectively; the prices of services  declined by 0.3 percentage points, and the prices of capital  goods declined by 5.1 percentage point in March, thus  demonstrating that the momentum of commodity price increases has  been alleviated. The preliminary results achieved in  controlling commodity prices can be attributed primarily to the  greater efforts exerted by the central government and local  governments at all levels. As a result of the actions taken by  local governments at various levels as well as the efforts made  by the State Council in intensifying the control over  investments in fixed assets as well as consumption needs, in  promoting agricultural production, specially the "food basket"  project; in supervising the prices of people's living  necessities and services, and in conducting nationwide price  inspection, preliminary results in controlling price increases  were achieved within a short time.    In analyzing the causes of the sharp commodity price  increases early this year, Ye Zhen said that they were primarily  caused by irrational phenomena -- such as the mentality of  jumping on the bandwagon as well as unscrupulousness in raising  prices -- following the introduction of the new tax system.  Market prices rose quite rapidly especially after price  controls for most commodities were removed and before mechanisms  for effective macroeconomic regulation and control were  established or improved. This phenomenon to which the masses  responded strongly was particularly noticeable in the prices of  basic necessities, such as food, clothing, services, and other  items closely related to people's daily life.    Although macroeconomic regulation and control over commodity  prices have produced results, Ye Zhen stressed: Compared to the  same period in 1992, the nation's retail prices during the first  quarter still increased 20.1 percent. The extent of this  increase is still way above the target set by the state. All  quarters must therefore continue to exercise strict control over  commodity prices and should not lower their guard in the least.</p>

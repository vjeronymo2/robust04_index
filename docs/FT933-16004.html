			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Downturn at Scott Pickford Scott Pickford, the USM-quoted petroleum consultant, blamed tighter trading conditions for a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 404,000 to Pounds 231,000 for the year to the end of March. Turnover dipped from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.33m. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 97,000 incurred in an aborted acquisition left attributable profit at Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 267,000). Earnings per share were 0.93p (3.79p) and an unchanged single final dividend of 0.8p is recommended.</p>

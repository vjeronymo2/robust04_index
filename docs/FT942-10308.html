			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Sainsbury alters cola packaging to avoid legal action J Sainsbury, the supermarket group, is making minor changes to the packaging of its look-alike cola to ward off the threat of legal action from Coca-Cola, in a dispute which exemplifies the growing row between brand manufacturers and retailers over shops' own-label products. Sainsbury, however, will retain the 'Classic' name, which Coca-Cola uses in the US, and all the core elements of the design and the colour. Mr Tom Vyner, Sainsbury's deputy chairman, said customers would not notice the difference in the packaging. 'What we have agreed to do is minor,' he said. Sainsbury is modifying the type face of the vertically printed 'cola' inscription and removing the squiggle underneath it. Mr Vyner said there had been a 'gi-normous' upsurge in sales in the three weeks since the cola was launched. A survey by market research group AGB shows that in the third week since it appeared in the stores, Sainsbury's Classic has captured approximately 15 per cent by value of all cola sales through UK retail outlets, compared with the 2.5 to 3 per cent share held by Sainsbury's previous own-brand cola before the launch. The dominant shares of Coca-Cola and PepsiCola have both been squeezed but there has also been an 8 per cent increase in overall sales of cola through grocery outlets, following the Sainsbury initiative. Mr Vyner said the rapid surge in Sainsbury's sales in part reflected the great media attention the product has received. A TV advertising campaign is likely within two months, he said. Coca-Cola has taken the Sainsbury threat so seriously that negotiations have been led by its Atlanta head office, largely bypassing UK-based executives. The dispute has been keenly watched by other manufacturers, increasingly angry at the damage to sales of market leading brands by supermarkets' own-label look-alikes. Under existing UK law, it is difficult for them to take legal action for 'passing off'. Sainsbury has consistently denied that its product could ever be mistaken by customers for Coke's. However, Mr Peter Stokes of Coca-Cola, said it had carried out surveys which showed customers were 'readily confused' about which product was which. Sainsbury said it disputed the findings but was happy to make the changes. Mr Vyner said: 'What we have achieved is the elimination of any danger of confusion.' The design changes are believed to have eliminated any possibility of Coca-Cola's taking legal action for alleged passing off. This will disappoint other brand manufacturers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the John Hopkins University analysis (raw data originated from the FAA), airman certification data, and annualized pilot exposure data, a decision model was prepared for the FAA that determined the best age-specific duration plan for the third-class medical certificate population. We determined that the best plan would provide for maximum regulatory relief without public safety decrement. For further discussion of duration analysis, see this docket's copy of the regulatory evaluation at pages 25&hyph;26, 58&hyph;64, and 77&hyph;80.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the model and the decision criteria previously discussed, the FAA proposes to lengthen the validity period of third-class airman medical certificates for most persons under the age of 40. Persons under age 40 would be required to undergo a physical examination every 3 years for a third-class medical certificate. Third-class medical certificates for persons age 40 but less than age 70 would continue to be valid for 2 years. Persons age 70 and older would be required to undergo a physical examination every year when applying for a third-class medical certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These ages and examination periods were selected because they will allow no significant increase in undetected pathology between required examinations. Regulatory and economic relief can be provided without a significant effect on aviation safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that the frequency of routine examinations can be reduced in the case of younger airmen who are less likely to suffer medical disability and who have undergone an initial examination and certification prior to first solo flight. Those individuals manifesting conditions that represent a risk to safety will be denied certification or, after individual evaluation, will be restricted in their flying activities or examined more thoroughly and frequently, or both. Those individuals who meet the published medical standards but whose conditions require more frequent scrutiny will, under the new amendment, be issued medical certificates with a validity of 2 years rather than the longer period which they may otherwise be granted. With routine medical examination frequency increasing with age as proposed, aviation safety will be maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the AMA report and the Hopkins' analysis confirm the greater incidence of medical pathology in older persons. FAA analysis also confirms that the incident of accidents generally increase with an increase in age. It is prudent, therefore, to leave the current routine periodic examination requirement unchanged for persons age 40 but less than age 70 and to increase the frequency of examination for persons age 70 and older.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All third-class airman medical certificates or third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate issued prior to the effective date of a final rule will remain valid for 2 years from the date of issuance unless the validity period has been otherwise limited by the FAA. The period of validity for all third-class airman medical certificates or third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate issued on or after the date of a final rule will be calculated according to the provisions of the final rule unless the validity period has been otherwise limited by the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the increased public responsibilities associated with commercial pilot privileges, the FAA does not plan at this time to change the frequency of examinations for first- or second-class medical certificates for operations requiring an airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, or air traffic control tower operator certificate. Similarly, the agency does not plan now to revise the validity period of student pilot certificates, now 2 years as set forth in &sect;61.19, though these are usually issued in combination with the third-class medical certificate. A student pilot whose student pilot certificate has expired but whose third-class medical certificate remains valid, may obtain a new student pilot certificate from an FAA operations inspector as provided in &sect;61.85(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 61.53 of the FAR provides that: ``No person may act as pilot in command, or in any other capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember while he [or she] has a known medical deficiency, or increase of a known medical deficiency, that would make him [or her] unable to meet the requirements for his [or her] current medical certificate.'' This amendment does not change &sect;61.53, and the FAA continues to require airmen to comply with that rule. In reducing the frequency of required periodic contacts with knowledgeable health professionals, self-monitoring and personal attention to health become a more important part of the individual airman's responsibility for flight safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also proposes to amend &sect;61.39 to require that applicants must possess at least a third-class medical certificate or the third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate valid under proposed &sect;61.23 in order to be eligible for a flight test for a certificate, or an aircraft or instrument rating. The proposal amends &sect;69.39 to coincide with the duration changes in &sect;61.23, as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the FAA developed its proposal through review of the literature, survey of the medical practices of the Department of Defense, analysis of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident data and its own aeromedical certification data, consideration of the data developed by the Johns Hopkins University, and in consideration of the part 67 proposal announced in this notice. The proposed examination spacing represents the agency's view of an optimum schedule in terms of estimated detectable pathology in the airman population and of the burden of required examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

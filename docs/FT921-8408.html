			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Letter: Minister denies UK put brake on single market Sir, Your article on February 10 ('UK plans to put brake on single market') suggests that the UK is now the reason why there is no Investment Services Directive. Nothing could be further from the truth. The UK has always welcomed and encouraged proposals that promote more cross-border trade and open up Community markets to companies and individuals from other member states. We have consistently supported a market opening Investment Services Directive. Unfortunately, some other member states see the Investment Services Directive as an opportunity to put back the clock and to limit the amount of cross-border trade currently under way in the Community. This is against the spirit of the Treaty of Rome, against the spirit of the single market and would be undesirable to all those who are interested in promoting more intra-European business. The UK is not prepared to promote a protectionist proposal, but has supported efforts to reach a compromise to try to obtain an Investment Services Directive that would be market opening. That remains the British government's position. John Redwood, Minister for Corporate Affairs, Department of Trade and Industry, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1B 6RB</p>

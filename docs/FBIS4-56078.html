			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Excerpt] The long-awaited visit by General Michael Rose,  commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to Gorazde  yesterday lasted only 20 minutes. During that extremely short  time General Rose spoke with (Ferid Buljubasic), commander of  the Eastern Bosnia Operative Group of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army in Gorazde. The issues touched upon in this blitz  conversation were the cooperation of the military authorities in  Gorazde with the units of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR],  and the problems connected with the implementation of the UN  Security Council Resolution 913.    The general returned to Sarajevo with his associates, while  the people of Gorazde remain in the same situation as prior to  his visit. The aggressor's soldiers, dressed in uniforms of  so-called Serbian police, yesterday afternoon inflicted severe  wounds on a 10-year-old boy in the city district of Bare with a  M-84 machine gun.

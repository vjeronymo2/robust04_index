			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Ministers go into battle over surcharges: A controversy about poll tax that continues to dog the government's footsteps WHO IS having to foot the bill for the poll-tax non-payers? 'The vast majority of law-abiding citizens in this country - that's who', Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, declaimed recently. In the run-up to the general election, the government continues to be haunted by controversy over the poll tax. In particular, the surcharge for non-payment which is shown separately on poll-tax bills, has been the cause of much anger among many voters. While formally the surcharge appears on the bill as 'other adjustments' which include items such as the revenue from the standard community charge on second homes, it is broadly seen as the extra needed to make up for non-payment. Ministers and officials privately admit that this was a political and presentational mistake. One minister said: 'It illustrates in microcosm the basic problems with the poll tax.' These problems are very visible, especially for a tax which raises so little revenue. The poll tax itself has too high a profile, considering that it raises only about 15 per cent - or under Pounds 10bn - of local-government spending in England and less in Wales and Scotland. The surcharge will raise only a fraction of that amount, yet it still has a distinct identity as a separate charge. By contrast, VAT in 1990-91, its last year at 15 per cent in raised Pounds 31bn. The poll-tax surcharge is hard to collect. Beyond the familiar difficulty of collecting a personal local tax when people regularly move house - which helps to account for the existence of the surcharge in the first place - it engenders particular resentment among those who do pay their poll tax. It is difficult to assign blame for non-collection. For every time that Mr Heseltine lambasts Labour councils' inefficiency, Labour can point to the prime minister's own characterisation of the tax as 'virtually uncollectable'. Anecdotal evidence is already being produced about a new class of voters who realise that they are being asked to subsidise non-payers and refuse to do so. One or two Tory MPs have been drawn close to making the moral case for not paying. 'I see no reason why people who have paid their contribution to local services should have to contribute to services for those who have not,' one said during Commons discussion of the council tax. The surcharge will ensure that some poll taxes will be forced over the Pounds 300 mark, which is seen by many voters as an upper limit of acceptability. Ministers have already admitted that their target poll tax of Pounds 257 will be overshot. The government estimates its target figure will be overshot by about Pounds 15 but that is lower than a forecast from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, representing most local authority treasurers, which puts the overshoot at about Pounds 21. The decision to show the level of surcharge so clearly on poll-tax bills derives from the work of Mr David King, a senior economics lecturer at the University of Stirling. When advising the government on the poll tax, he made the case for greater transparency in bills. At that time, with a much weaker regime for capping local expenditure, ministers were concerned with council overspending rather than prospective poll-tax non-collection. Mr King's proposal to itemise charges was endorsed by Mr Michael Howard, then local government minister. The belief - which remains unfulfilled - was that when local taxpayers saw how much more they had to pay than the government had planned, they would press their council to be more efficient. It seems that the lesson of spelling out the surcharge has not been lost on the government. 'You won't find a similar figure on the council-tax bill,' one minister said.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA  </P> <P> Customers of a La Jolla restaurant have been told that they may have been  exposed to the more infectious form of hepatitis -- type A -- and should see  their physicians immediately for gamma globulin injections, county public  health officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Diners who ate dinner salads or drank from glasses decorated with strawberry  and pineapple garnishes at Aloha Louie's, in the 1100 block of Prospect Street,  between 5 and 10 p.m. on Nov. 6 and 7 may have been exposed, officials said.  </P> <P> The advisory was issued after county health officials learned of a case of  hepatitis A in a worker at the restaurant. The employee has not worked since  Nov. 7.  </P> <P> "We urge people to see their physician as soon as possible, since the gamma  globulin is only effective if it is given within two weeks of exposure," said  Dr. Nancy Bowen, acting county health officer. "Gamma globulin is not available  at county public health clinics."  </P> <P> "It is possible that some people might have been infected before the 6th of  November at the restaurant," she said. "However, gamma globulin will not help  these people. It is important, though, for them to be aware of the symptoms of  the disease.  </P> <P> "Initial symptoms are a sudden onset of fever, tiredness, loss of appetite,  nausea and abdominal discomfort, which may be followed within a few days by  jaundice, a yellowish color to the eyes and skin. The degree of the illness  varies from person to person, from very mild to severe. Infectious hepatitis  can take anywhere from 15 to 50 days to develop, usually a month."  </P></p>

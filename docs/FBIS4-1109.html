			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Rwanda, the Patriotic Front still has the  military intiative on the ground. Kigali is still subject to  shelling and sporadic gunfire. In the north of the country, the  Patriotic Front has taken the town of Byumba, an important  strategic center. This time the news has been confirmed by the  United Nations. Francois Rijkmans reports:    [Rijkmans] [passage omitted] Violence is continuing up  country. This time it is clear that the Butare region in the  south, which until now had been miraculously preserved from the  massacres, is now getting its full dose. People who have taken  refuge in schools or churches are being killed. The militia are  barring the roads, which are crowded with thousands of people.  Militiamen are slaughtering on the spot those who are fleeing.    At the frontier, on the road between Butare and Bujumbura,  people trying to get into Burundi have been killed. Dozens of  people with machete, bullet, or shrapnel injuries have arrived  in the hospital of Butare where there is a Medecins Sans  Frontieres team. There is a large Tutsi minority in the Butare  area, but traditionally there has been harmonious coexistence  between the two groups there, to such an extent that certain  Hutu radicals from the north suspect the southern Hutus of being  too close to the Tutsis.    The day before yesterday the prefect of the region and the  military commander, two moderates, were replaced by people close  to the radicals.</p>

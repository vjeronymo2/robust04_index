			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Leading Article: England's local shambles England's local government commission is about to complete its preliminary recommendations for shaking up the existing structure of county and district councils. But it is not too late for the government to call a halt to the process and avoid what threatens to be a shambles in local government. Radical institutional reform can only be justified by urgent necessity. Of no English institutions is that more true than local councils, which have been chopped and changed almost to death in recent decades. Yet no adequate justification exists for the proposal to restructure English local government wholesale, for the second time in 20 years, abolishing a host of local councils on the one hand while setting up a host of new ones on the other. The decision to establish the local government commission was part of the move to scrap the poll tax in 1990. It was essentially a political ploy to reduce the humiliation of retreat. The ostensible argument was that a single-tier local government system would improve accountability and enhance the links between voters and their councils. It is no surprise that district councils which stand to gain from the abolition of county councils are enthusiastic at the prospect. However, beyond a handful of large cities anomalously subject to county councils, and a handful of counties - the product of the last reorganisation - enjoying little local loyalty, there is no evidence of widespread popular demand for the proposed revolution. Derisory responses The reverse is true. Postal referendums conducted by the commission on proposed reorganisations have yielded derisory responses of little more than 5 per cent. The commission's chief executive claims that such a response would 'utterly delight any commercial concern'. But that spectacularly misses the point that reorganisation can only be justified as a response to strong local demand. Then there is the cost, highlighted this week by the government's announcement that all the costs - estimated at about Pounds 1bn - will fall on localities. Local electors should not be fooled by talk of prospective savings, or the government's concession that it will allow councils to borrow for 'unavoidable' costs. Unlike the transitional costs, the financial benefits are largely hypothetical, and would certainly be negated by any decision of a future non-Tory government to establish strategic authorities above existing district councils. Such a decision is almost inevitable if most county councils are abolished, since districts are too small to conduct the strategic planning functions which many on the left believe should be carried out at sub-national level. If counties are retained, they would be the obvious building blocks for that task. Grave weakness That, in turn, highlights another grave weakness of the commission. Its remit is to consider boundaries and tiers, not functions. Yet some of the weaknesses of the present regime could be tackled by a clearer allocation of functions between existing tiers, and in some cases by a straight transfer of functions downwards. Instead of wholesale restructuring, the government should adopt a more pragmatic approach. Where change is believed to have strong public support - in Bristol or Humberside, for example - district authorities should be allowed to hold referendums on divorcing themselves from their county council. Only if more than 40 per cent of registered voters support such a change should it go ahead. That leaves the problem of local democracy, which is indeed in a sorry state. The solution, however, is not to be found in expensive musical chairs. It lies in the introduction of measures which render councillors truly reflective of, and accountable to, their voters. Two necessary reforms stand out. Proportional representation for council elections would end local one-party states. And the use of advisory local referendums would give electors a direct say on local matters of concern to them, and force their councillors to say why they disagree if they refuse to follow. In the long term there is also a case for making councils responsible for raising more of the money that they spend. But a short while after the abolition of the poll tax is not the time to revisit the local tax system.</p>

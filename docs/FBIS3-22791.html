			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, February 11, LETA -- The daily DIENA reported  about certain aspects of the mysterious case involving the  purchase of alkali metals and a plane-crash over the Bodensee in  Germany. Initial reports of the German press claimed that the  plane might contain radioactive materials bought in Riga.  However, when the plane had been recovered neither bodies nor  metals were found in it. Ilgvars Samins, a top official of the  Latvian Prosecutors Office, said that by now there were no  grounds to allege that the missing persons had bought rubidium  and cesium in Riga. It is more likely that the metals have come  from the East.    I. Ruemmele and K. Eichler, whose names appear in materials  of the Latvian Prosecutors Office and German press, are the  former employees of the East Germany's intelligence service  while Pavel Minarzik, said to be an interpreter, actually was a  former captain of the Czechoslovakia's secret service. For many  years he had been working for the radio station "Free Europe"  but later was convicted for the attempt to blow up the same  radio station. Minarzik also was the author of the book titled  "The Come-back of a Secret Service Man".    The name of a certain Klaus Peter Nedvig, the former colonel  of Berlin Criminal Police, could also be found in the  prosecutors files. On October 24 they were in Riga, negotiating  a purchase of 66 kilograms of rubidium and 6 kilograms of  cesium-133 for a price of $2 million. Meantime the subject of  the deal was stored at the airport of a Swiss town. The talks in  Riga focused on the term of payment which the foreigners asked  to postpone as the final customer for the metals had yet not  been found.    Following the talks at the office the guests were rounded up  by 6-8 masked and armed men. They were pushed into a minibus and  whisked to a cottage on the outskirts of the city where the  demands for money were put up to the victims. Eichler was left  hand-cuffed to a radiator, but the rest of the captives were  freed soon and given "advice" to leave Riga. After 10 days  Eichler managed to escape. The mediator of the deal, a Riga  resident named A. Korizno, who apart from $2.2 million demanded  extra $17,000 for his services, was arrested. The Latvian  Prosecutors Office said that in Riga only laundering of money  took place, therefore at present the case have been filed only  for taking hostages.</p>

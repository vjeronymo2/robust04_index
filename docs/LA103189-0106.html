			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: 'MARRYING UP' COULD BE THE BEST DIET FOR WOMEN  </P> <P> Women who "marry up" to men with greater education tend to be leaner, stay  leaner and become even thinner over time than women who "marry down" to men of  lower educational levels, finds Stanley M. Garn, a professor of nutrition in  the University of Michigan's School of Public Health. "The higher the husband's  educational level," says the researcher who correlated weight and educational  degrees of more than 1,000 husbands and wives, "the leaner the wife."  </P> <P> Garn, who published his findings in the current American Journal of Clinical  Nutrition, speculates peer pressure plays a vital role in weight control: Women  who marry up are more likely to be surrounded by lean women than those who  marry down.  </P> <P> Although the nutritionist found the husbands' weight wasn't influenced by their  wives' education, Jody Lander Spector, a dietitian who directs a weight-loss  program at St. Vincent Medical Center, counsels several couples who obviously  got fat together. "I blame it on getting too comfortable with each other,"she  says.  </P> <P> Next on Garn's research agenda: To investigate whether second wives of highly  educated men stay as thin as spouse No. 1.  </P> <P> Infant Sleep  </P> <P> To sleep-deprived parents of newborn babies, it's a promising bit of folklore:  Feed them cereal at bedtime, and they'll sleep through the night.  </P> <P> Cleveland Clinic Foundation researchers tested this homespun advice by  comparing the sleep habits of more than 100 infants fed bedtime cereal starting  at five weeks and at four months of age. Parents kept track of their kids'  fussiness, crying and sleep times. In the end, the Ohio researchers found no  significant differences in sleep habits between the two groups.  </P> <P> They concluded what some parents have always suspected: kids sleep through the  night when they're developmentally ready -- regardless of their bedtime snack.  </P> <P> According to a spokeswoman, the Committee on Nutrition for the American Academy  of Pediatrics recommends holding off on solid foods such as bedtime cereal for  five or six months. "Introducing foods too early may decrease a baby's interest  in nursing and increase an likelihood of allergies if there's a family  history,"says Audrey Naylor, San Diego pediatrician affliated with the  committee.  </P> <P> Still, the news for sleep-weary parents isn't all bad. The Ohio researchers  discovered their subjects, however fussy, eventually let their parents get some  shut-eye. By age 12 weeks, most of the babies slept six straight hours and, by  age 20 weeks, eight hours at a stretch.  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Stop promising heaven, Rafsanjani told: Domestic criticism of economic policies is mounting as Iran suffers from weak oil prices Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani is facing mounting criticism at home as the economy continues to suffer from weak international oil prices. Iran is dependent on oil for 85 per cent of its foreign exchange income and it is estimated that every Dollars 1 fall in the international price of oil results in a loss of Dollars 1bn in Iran's annual revenues. President Rafsanjani recently attempted to play down the economic crisis by saying that Iran could continue with its development programmes regardless of oil prices. But the bravado cannot mask the real economic problems the country faces. Prices have mounted steeply since the government unified three different exchange rates last March, leading to an effective devaluation from IR70 to the dollar to IR1,400. The rial has subsequently fallen to more than IR2,000 to the dollar. The English-language Kayhan International, complained that spiralling prices were making the lives of many Iranians a misery. 'Galloping inflation, open mismanagement of the economic sector, indifference towards the common strata, decline in the international price of oil - all will get together to make life intolerable and miserable for this nation of over 60m people,' it wrote. As subsidies to the poor are lifted, the import of luxury goods is being seen as a symbol of skewed priorities and corruption. In a Friday prayers sermon delivered in Qom last month, Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, speaker of the assembly of experts, the body that elects the spiritual leader, said: 'Instead of promising heaven, the government should also be thinking about solving this deadly inflation. But I know that this problem of high prices will not be solved until those who have luxurious lifestyles. . . and who do not feel social problems and who use their expertise to manage their own affairs are no longer in power. And there are many of them.' Jomhuri Eslami, a Tehran daily, chastised the government for promoting International Monetary Fund-style measures of privatisation and reductions in subsidies. It accused Mr Rafsanjani's economic team of being overawed or deceived by liberal western economic theories and urged the government to restore some state controls. Trade has also suffered as a spending boom which began in 1990 has resulted in Iran's formerly exemplary payments record being badly tarnished. Until last summer, foreign exporters with Iranian letters of credit were having to wait six months before receiving payment but the arrears have now mounted to one year. Estimates of the size of the total debt vary from Dollars 16bn up to Dollars 30bn. At least Dollars 8bn of this is estimated to be in arrears and is costing the country about Dollars 3bn a year to service. The Dollars 30bn figure would include letters of credit which have been opened but which will be abandoned by exporters unable to find export cover. 'There is a serious problem,' said one European banker. 'But at the same time Iran's debt load is manageable because it is almost all short-term.' The most exposed countries are Iran's main trading partners, Germany and Japan. Imports have been cut, aided by the refusal of foreign banks to confirm Iranian letters of credit and by the country being in effect off-cover for most export credit agencies. Under these circumstances, foreign investment, which Mr Rafsanjani has sought for a number of years, remains only a possibility. Attempts at rescheduling the debt over the medium-term have not yet met with success both for practical reasons but also because of Iran's poor international image. The US has put Iran back on its list of favourite enemy nations and Iran has done little to help itself by failing to lift the death sentence imposed on British writer Salman Rushdie. 'The sentiment in Europe is somewhere between regret and frustration,' said one banker. 'Iran has not had a bad name in trade circles in the past but the Iranians do everything to make it difficult to love them.' Mr Rafsanjani has quashed suggestions that Iran's second five-year development plan, due to begin at the start of the Iranian year on March 21, should be postponed. The plan which is due to take over where the first five-year plan leaves off, assumes an annual average income of Dollars 15.5bn from oil, but the price of Iranian oil has dropped to less than Dollars 12 a barrel. This year Iran will be lucky to earn Dollars 14bn, compared with official projections of Dollars 17bn. The second plan is aimed at extending the government's privatisation campaign, reducing subsidies, authorising the government to seek Dollars 2.4bn in long-term loans for the construction of four dams, as well as seeking foreign investment in the form of joint ventures. Nevertheless there are many government officials who share the view of Mr Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the speaker of the Iranian majlis (parliament), who said last month that the legislature wanted to postpone the start of the five-year plan for a year 'because one cannot study a plan in a crisis'.</p>

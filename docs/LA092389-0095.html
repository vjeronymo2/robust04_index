			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMBODIA CAN REPEL REBELS, DEFENSE CHIEF SAYS  </P> <P> The defense minister said Friday that Cambodian government troops can defend  the country against a guerrilla coalition, despite a surge in nearby fighting  that has accompanied the withdrawal of Vietnamese soldiers.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Tea Banh spoke at a farewell ceremony for departing soldiers  on the second day of the withdrawal of the last Vietnamese troops. Vietnam has  promised to have all of its 26,000 troops out of Cambodia by Tuesday.  </P> <P> Vietnamese troops invaded in December, 1978, to oust the Khmer Rouge, which is  blamed for the deaths of a million Cambodians by execution, disease and  starvation during its rule from 1975 to 1978.  </P> <P> The Khmer Rouge is the strongest in the three-party guerrilla coalition  fighting the government installed by Vietnam. Many analysts say Cambodia's  army, estimated at 50,000, is poorly trained and led and could have problems  fighting the guerrillas alone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Battle May Test Troops  </P> <P> In Battambang province in western Cambodia, government and rebel forces were  engaged in what could be a major battlefield test of government troops without  the support of experienced Vietnamese forces.  </P> <P> Deputy Defense Minister Ke Kim Yan said Friday that as many as 450 Khmer Rouge  guerrillas were shelling the Pailin area of Battambang province, 12 miles from  the Thai-Cambodian border, with up to 2,000 mortar rounds per day. The  guerrillas maintain bases along the Thai-Cambodian border.  </P> <P> "We are mobilizing all our men so we will not lose Pailin," Ke Kim Yan said in  an interview with reporters in Phnom Penh.  </P> <P> Pailin's forests and mountains could provide good hiding places for the  guerrillas, while gem mines in the area could help bankroll the opposition  forces.  </P> <P> "If they get Pailin, it is not only a gain toward their military strategy, but  is also a gain for their economic strategy," Ke Kim Yan said. "Already the  Khmer Rouge are making money to support their battle from nearby mines rich in  rubies and amethysts."  </P> <P> He said the capture of Pailin would allow the Khmer Rouge to move troops and  supplies more easily into the Cambodian interior, and the fall of the district  capital, held by the government for the past 10 years, would be a major  psychological victory for the resistance.  </P> <P> "If we give up territory, it will show the enemy is superior to our side," he  said.  </P></p>

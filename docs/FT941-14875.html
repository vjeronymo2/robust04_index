			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank links with Winterthur Winterthur Insurance is to take control of DBV Versicherung from Commerzbank, a move which will make the Swiss group the 10th largest primary insurer in Germany by premium income. Winterthur, which has been seeking for several years to build up a substantial presence in Germany, will pay Commerzbank a combination of cash and shares for a 75 per cent interest in the holding company which has a 50.1 per cent stake in DBV. Winterthur will also transfer its own German insurance businesses to the holding. Mr Peter Spalti, Winterthur chairman, said that no offer would be made to the minority shareholders of DBV, as there would be no change in the direct ownership of the Frankfurt-quoted group. Commerzbank will retain a minority 25 per cent in the enlarged holding. Both it and DBV-Winterthur will exploit each other's sales networks for banking and insurance products. Mr Spalti said that the takeover would transform Winterthur, the Swiss market leader, into a truly European group. The company already has a substantial stake in the UK through its Churchill motor insurance subsidiary and Provident Life, but earns less than a 10th of its premium income in Germany. The combined 1993 premium income of DBV and Winterthur's German operations was about DM4.9bn (Dollars 2.8bn). Nearly 60 per cent of DBV's DM3.4bn premium income last year came from life insurance; 27 per cent from health insurance; and the rest from non-life insurance. Winterthur's subsidiaries in Germany earned DM1.5bn in premiums, some two-thirds of which from non-life business. Mr Manfred Broska, chief executive of DBV, will continue to lead the enlarged group. Mr Broska said that the German insurance market was going through a difficult period, because of recession and liberalisation. However, he said he was confident that DBV, with its connections with Commerzbank and Winterthur, was well placed to succeed. Mr Broska said that the group expected to achieve a satisfactory result for 1993 and that there was room for another dividend increase. In 1992, it had net income of DM32.6m and paid a dividend of DM8 per share. Mr Spalti said Commerzbank would acquire a less than 5 per cent stake in Winterthur as a result of the takeover and that Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, Commerzbank's chairman, would join the Winterthur board.</p>

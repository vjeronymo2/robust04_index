			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: 'Monopoly' under fire - Commission queries private medical practices A COMPLEX monopoly situation exists in private medical care and the behaviour of parts of the medical profession and private health insurers could be against the public interest, according to a letter from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which is investigating the industry. The inquiry started in September and one of its provisional findings is that 9,500 NHS consultants last year fixed more than half of their fees for private medical services at, or very close to, figures in the British Medical Association guidelines or scales set by the British United Provident Association and Private Patients Plan, two of the main private medical insurers. 'We think that this conduct - of following what are, in effect, tariffs - restricts competition,' the commission said in a letter to consultants and others affected by the inquiry. But it emphasised that it had not yet reached a conclusion on whether the effects of this were good or bad. The commission's final report could be published in October. 'We have identified a number of 'issues', or respects in which the behaviour of the BMA, Bupa and PPP, or of consultants, might be thought to be against the public interest,' the commission said. The issues include whether fee-scale publishing has led to charges being higher than would otherwise have been the case, or has reduced regional variation. At present, patients must be referred to a consultant by a GP before medical insurers will meet a claim, and they will not pay for services not provided by an NHS consultant or someone holding another approved qualification. The commission questioned if these practices were bad for competition and against the public interest. If it decides they are, the way could be opened for non-UK qualified consultants to practice in the private medical sector. The letter also asked 'whether any benefits to the public interest result from the practices of fee scale-following by consultants or fee scale-publishing by the BMA, Bupa and PPP.' Bupa's David Bryant said of the letter: 'There could be some major implications for the industry. Our schedule of procedures is mentioned; and if that had to be removed, then that would change the basis on which we conduct our business with our customers and the medical profession. We would need some other method of paying claims.' He suggested that Bupa's schedule of benefits actually acted as a ceiling for medical costs. Charges on the BMA scale are usually higher than BUPA's schedule. Among possible remedies put forward by the commission - on which consultants and other interested parties have been invited to comment - were: Prohibiting the BMA from publishing its guidelines. Stopping consultants fixing charges with reference to published guidance. Prohibiting private medical insurers from reimbursing claims according to a tariff. Requiring consultants to itemise their charges. Stopping differentiation between insured and non-insured private patients.</p>

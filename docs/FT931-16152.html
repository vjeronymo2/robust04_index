			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Targeting Saddam PRESIDENT SADDAM Hussein of Iraq has once again staged a confrontation with the west, by moving anti-aircraft missiles into the no-fly zone imposed by the US, Britain and France in southern Iraq last August. The western allies have responded with the firmness he should by now have learnt to expect. Why does Mr Saddam keep on doing it? The idea that he is testing the incoming US administration seems implausible, given that it is not yet in office. More probably he calculates that any confrontation with the west, even one that ends in yet another humiliation for him, will rebound to his political advantage. He certainly knows that other Arab states are unhappy about the west's self-imposed role as military protector of certain categories of the Iraqi population, sharing his view that the operation to save the Kurds in 1991, and the no-fly zones subsequently proclaimed in both north and south, go beyond anything authorised by UN Security Council resolutions. So he may well prefer to focus attention on that issue, at a time when food prices in Baghdad are skyrocketing, when there are rumours of unrest in the armed forces, and when the Kurds in the north have joined Arab opposition forces in exile to form an Iraqi National Congress, with offices in London. The question western leaders should ask themselves is not whether to respond to Mr Saddam's provocations, for they have little choice. Rather they should ask whether it is sensible to leave him the initiative. They have justified their intervention in both north and south by reference to Resolution 688, which demanded that Iraq put an end to repression, called for a dialogue 'to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected', and insisted on 'immediate access by international humanitarian organisations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq'. Manifestly those demands have not been met. Repression in the south continues, with virtually no access for any international organisations. In the north the Kurds are denied energy and fuel supplies in an exceptionally harsh winter. The west should take the initiative. It should turn the southern no-fly zone into a safe haven - obliging Mr Saddam to remove not only his anti-aircraft batteries but also his repressive forces, as he has done in the north; and it should strengthen the safe haven in the north by ordering him to remove his troops from Faida, where they are blocking the main supply route from Turkey into Iraqi Kurdistan. The longer-term objective must be to make the whole country a 'safe haven' by making it impossible for Mr Saddam to continue his repressive regime. If President George Bush will go down in history as the liberator of Kuwait, it is within the grasp of his successor to become the liberator of Iraq.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Downturn at City of London PR In spite of a better second six months compared with the opening half, full-year profits of the City of London PR Group, a USM-quoted provider of specialist investor and press relation services, fell by 14.5 per cent to Pounds 520,827 pre-tax. Consolidation of IRB International, a market research business acquired some 12 months ago, boosted turnover for the year to end-March from Pounds 689,000 to Pounds 2.19m. The IRB offshoots made a small profit in the final quarter but are budgeted to make a 'significant contribution' for the year ahead. Earnings emerged at 4.78p (4.9p). The dividend for the year is being lifted to 3.18p (3.09p) via an increased final of 2.14p.</p>

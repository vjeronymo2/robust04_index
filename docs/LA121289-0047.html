			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROMINENT SKATING COACH JIM HULICK DIES OF CANCER  </P> <P> Jim Hulick, who coached Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo to the national  championship in pairs figure skating this year, died of cancer at 38 Sunday  night in a West Covina hospital.  </P> <P> Hulick coached the pair for the last time at the prestigious NHK championships  16 days ago in Kobi, Japan, where they finished fourth. Complaining of fatigue,  Hulick checked into the hospital upon his return.  </P> <P> "It always seemed like he blocked out his sickness for us," Galindo said Monday  from his home in San Jose. "It was like he was living through us. I really do  have admiration for him, to put all the medical things aside to do something  for us.  </P> <P> "I'll never forget him standing there just before we would go out onto the ice  and saying, 'Just go out there and have fun.' "  </P> <P> Hulick, a West Covina High graduate, teamed with Cynthia Van Valkenburg in  winning the national junior pairs championship in 1971 and began coaching four  years later. Operating in recent years from a rink in Dublin, Calif., he had  about 30 students before learning in August, 1988, that he had colon cancer.  </P> <P> Although frequent trips to Southern California for treatment prevented him from  maintaining a full schedule, he remained with Galindo and Yamaguchi.  </P> <P> In 1987, Hulick coached Galindo to the world junior championship. The next  year, Galindo and Yamaguchi won the world junior pairs championship.  </P> <P> But the highlight of Hulick's coaching career occurred on Feb. 11 at the  Baltimore Arena, where Yamaguchi, 17, and Galindo, 19, skated a near-perfect  long program to win the national senior pairs championship.  </P> <P> Hulick's family requested that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be sent to  the USFSA's Memorial Fund, 20 First Street, Colorado Springs, Colo., 80906.  </P> <P> Funeral services will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday at Forest Lawn Chapel in  Covina Hills.  </P></p>

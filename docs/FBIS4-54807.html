			<p>BFN     [Text] My visit was a result of very important and  specific changes in both our countries, Indonesian Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas said at a news conference today prior to his  departure. He pointed out that in addition to developing trade  and economic relations, the two countries must seek together  third markets in their regions, the Balkans and the Far East.    Regarding the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the guest said  that the ethnic basis of the conflict must not be ignored and  that Indonesia supports dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina into three  ethnic parts -- provided it is done in a just way and in  accordance with the country's independence.</p>

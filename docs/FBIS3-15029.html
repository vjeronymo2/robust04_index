			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 01, BNS -- Vasiliy Svirin, head of the  Russian negotiating team, today assured the Estonian team that  press statements made by Russian Foreign Ministry official A.  Udaltsov February 28 do not reflect official Russian government  policy.    Despite continuing attempts by the Russian side to make  withdrawal conditional and despite a spiraling Russian campaign  of accusations and intimidation, the Estonian negotiating team  described the withdrawal agreement as "practically ready" going  into the current round of talks being held March 1-2 outside  Tallinn. The final date for full withdrawal, August 31, 1994,  was agreed upon at the 16th round. The Russians still have not  presented a timetable, however.    The slow-down in both the withdrawal of troops and the  turn-over of military installations to Estonian authorities  began in October 1993 and has continued to date. Although the  number of Russian troops stationed in Estonia is now about  2,600, hundreds of military sites, bases, training fields,  depots, airfields, housing units and intelligence and  communications centers remain under Russian control. These are  mostly located in the capital city of Tallinn and in surrounding  Harju County. About 70 of these are of particular concern to  Estonia due to their size, strategic importance or the presence  of hazardous materials.    Important Russian military storage facilities include  Maenniku and Klooga ammunition dumps (3500 tons), the 2748th  Mine Storage Facility, the 2753rd Mortar Shell Base (7500 tons  of ammunition and explosives), the 690th Chemical Storage (300  tons), the 2577th Technical Storage, the 2754th Mine and Torpedo  Base, the 2394th Mine and Torpedo Storage, and the 3063rd Fuel  Storage (above ground tanks plus underground storage 400 meters  long). High levels of radioactivity detected at the Chemical  Storage has caused further delays there. On the positive side,  according to the Russians, the number of mines stored on  Naissaar has been reduced to 450, all scheduled to have been  burned by April 1.    The Russian armed forces are primarily stationed at the  Tallinn Naval Base, the 144th Motorized Division, the 93rd Naval  Training Center with two nuclear reactors in Paldiski, the  Russian Navy's Radio Intelligence Unit, and the Naval Auxiliary  Control Center.    According to Russian negotiators, nearly 6,000 of the  pensioned Russian military in Estonia are men under the age of  sixty. Over 1,000 of these are under the age of fifty, with  fully 360 younger than 45 years of age. In addition, there may  be as many as 5,000 officers who have left or are leaving the  Russian military without qualifying for pensions. There is no  way for Estonian authorities to record or check such  individuals. According to the Estonian Security Police Board,  the continuing presence of former Soviet occupation troops in  Estonia increases political tensions, destabilizes society, and  directly increases crime.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS AT ALL-GIRL WESTLAKE PROTEST MERGER PLAN WITH ALL-BOY HARVARD  </P> <P> A group of parents of girls attending Westlake School are demanding an  explanation and a voice in the decision announced last week to merge the  prestigious girls' school with Harvard School for boys.  </P> <P> Parents circulated petitions at an open house Tuesday night seeking a 90-day  delay during which parents, students, faculty and alumnae would be consulted  about the proposed plan to go coed. Nearly 200 parents, representing the three  junior high classes alone, signed the petitions.  </P> <P> Flyers headlined, "Save the Westlake School for Girls," with for girls  underlined, were plastered on parents' cars, urging parents to attend an  all-school meeting tonight.  </P> <P> Parents complained that they were presented last week with a fait accompli.  Many were left with questions about the necessity of the merger and fears that  their daughters will lose an educational atmosphere that encourages them to  reach their potential and enhances self-esteem.  </P> <P> Parents said their first inkling of the merger came when their distressed  daughters called them from pay phones at school after an assembly at Westlake  last week. Westlake is located in Holmby Hills, where the seventh, eighth and  ninth grades will be taught if the schools merge as planned in 1991. The upper  grades will be taught at Harvard School in Studio City.  </P> <P> "It makes a drastic change in the lives of 700-odd girls and their families and  no one asks them (their opinion)," said Karen Hill-Scott, a UCLA professor with  a daughter in the 10th grade. "The absence of communication casts an overall  negative pallor for many, many parents," she said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> David Higgins, as did many other parents, voiced his concerns to Westlake  Headmaster Nathan Reynolds at the open house. "The underlying objection is the  haste and the secrecy," said Higgins, who has two daughters at the school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Support Merger  </P> <P> Some parents expressed their support of the merger to Reynolds and suggested  that they may be a silent majority. But disgruntled parents said they found  deep dissatisfaction during a telephone tree process to invite parents to  tonight's meeting. They said their position is: Convince us that this is in the  best interest of our daughters.  </P> <P> Harvard will dominate the newly formed board of trustees by a 2-1 margin in the  merger plan. The Harvard headmaster will be in charge and the new school will  be named Harvard-Westlake, leading Westlake parents to worry that Westlake got  the short end of the merger. "What did Westlake get out of this?" one parent  asked.  </P> <P> The composition of the new board was based on diversity, not which school the  board member came from, Reynolds said. However, he acknowledged that while the  board members from Harvard had been selected, the Westlake representatives had  not.  </P> <P> The merger was placed on the agenda of the Westlake Board of Trustees meeting  last week without warning, said several parents who requested anonymity. The  parents said that when the 12 or 13 board members present voted on the subject,  they had not had adequate time to evaluate the data on which the merger was  based. Three trustees voted against the merger. The plan was presented to the  board by a subcommittee that had been negotiating with Harvard without telling  the rest of 23-member board.  </P> <P> Reynolds defended the secrecy as necessary for the success of the plan, saying,  "They would have never gotten as far as they did" if the process was open to  public scrutiny.  </P> <P> Earlier attempts to merge, one of them six years ago, were stymied by  opposition.  </P> <P> Reynolds said the merger was based on confidential information about the future  enrollment base for Westlake. The concern was that if Harvard went coed on its  own, as it was prepared to do, it would siphon off some of the top girls from  Westlake, turning it into a second-rate school.  </P> <P> The 24-year Westlake veteran said it was more important to maintain the quality  of the student body and faculty than to continue as a girls school. "I'm  talking about first-rate education for young women and young men," he said.  </P> <P> Some parents said they find such talk ironic in that Reynolds has always sold  Westlake's all-girl composition as superior to coeducation. At the open house,  they distributed a reprint of a Wall Street Journal article on research that  concluded boys receive more attention from teachers, which undermines the  self-esteem and damages the morale of girls.  </P> <P> They were originally given the article, and others like it, by Reynolds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Can Empathize'  </P> <P> Reaction at Harvard School has been more positive, according to Headmaster  Thomas C. Hudnut, who will run the merged schools. "I can empathize with  Westlake parents who feel a great sense of loss, but I hope their sense of loss  will give way to the conviction that we're preparing for a better future."  </P> <P> A coeducational environment is preferable, he said, "because the world out  there is a coed world."  </P> <P> Hudnut said it was appropriate for the trustees to make the decision to merge.  "I think trustees who are charged with management of an institution must be  able to carry on their deliberations confidentially."  </P> <P> Some parents believe that they may be able to block, or at least postpone, the  merger, which must be voted upon again by the Westlake board. That opinion is  not shared by the administration. Seventh-grade girls who were circulating  their own petitions to keep Westlake an all-girls school were advised at an  assembly that their effort was futile because the matter had been resolved, one  parent said.  </P></p>

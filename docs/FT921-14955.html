			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Reform of executive pay awards urged PAY and benefits for senior British executives in quoted companies should be decided by panels of non-executive directors, according to a report published today. The recommendation by Pro Ned, an organisation which promotes the role of non-executive directors, follows sharp criticism over pay awards for top executives, particularly in privatised industries, over the past year. Remuneration is one of the issues being examined by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance set up by the Department of Trade and Industry. Today's recommendation from Pro Ned gives a strong indication of what is likely to be one of the committee's conclusions. The committee, which is due to report in the next few weeks, is chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, a former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, who is also chairman of Pro Ned. Pro Ned's guidelines being circulated to companies today include the following recommendations: All quoted companies should have a remuneration committee made up of independent non-executive directors. Members of the committee should be named in the company's report and accounts. The committee's policy on the separation of salary and bonus elements of executives' pay should be set out in the report and accounts. There should be an explanation of how performance pay and bonuses are arrived at. Remuneration committees are already common among UK companies. A survey by Pro Ned of the top 100 quoted companies found 86 per cent have a committee. Of those, 56 per cent were made up of non-executive directors, while a third published committee details in the annual report. An analysis in the summer by the Financial Times found a large disparity between the pay increases of senior industrialists and the performance of their companies. Pay rose in the years between 1981 and 1990 by an average of 350 per cent, compared with average increases in companies' earnings per share of 166 per cent. Moreover, the pay of top executives rose at more than three times the rate of increase in UK average earnings. 'Going rate' still applies in pay, Page 6 Letter, Page 13</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce rises Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce firmed 2 to 149p on suggestions that the rump of its Pounds 307m rights issue had been placed. Researchers were surprised by reports of an 87 per cent take-up of the issue, in view of the poor sentiment that initially greeted the cash call. Hoare Govett, the group's broker, was understood to have successfully placed the rump of around 31m shares yesterday at 145p, following a bought deal in which it is believed to have paid 144 1/2 p for each of the shares. The stock was said to have been quickly taken up, with two large institutions purchasing the majority. However, concern remains that part of the new shares may have been taken up by overseas institutions. Earlier this year Rolls-Royce said that overseas holdings had reached 29.5 per cent, the limit allowed under its articles of association. The owners of the new stock will not be known until the registration date of October 25, but analysts are confident that the government will soon make an announcement raising that ceiling to around 49 per cent. Mr Brian Newman at agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite remains positive on Rolls-Royce and predicted: 'With the balance sheet straightened, and the raising of the limit on foreign holdings, the shares could rise to the original issue price of 170p.' Closing volume on the Seaq screen remained at 3.1m shares.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FAILING BANKS MAY DRAIN NATIONAL INSURANCE FUND  </P> <P> The nation's bank deposit insurance funds could be wiped out by losses that  banks are experiencing from declining real estate values and risky investments,  congressional auditors said today.  </P> <P> At least 35 of the nation's 200 largest banks are likely to fail or require  assistance over the next year at a cost to the government of $4.4 billion to  $6.3 billion, the General Accounting Office said in a report to the Senate  Banking Committee.  </P> <P> "Not since its birth during the Great Depression has the federal system of  deposit insurance for commercial banks faced such a period of danger and  uncertainty," Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher said. "We have a lot of  situations out there that could wipe the fund out."  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. already faces losses of $2 billion this  year atop losses of $5.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, the accounting office said.  In addition, it said, the FDIC has a contingent liability of $8 billion for  troubled loans now held by the acquirers of already-failed banks in Texas.  </P></p>

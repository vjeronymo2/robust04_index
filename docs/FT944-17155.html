			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Australia The US is not the only country where markets are looking to see whether the authorities will push up interest rates. The chances are growing of a further rise in Australia after the jump to ADollars 2.14bn in the August balance of payments deficit, the largest monthly figure since early 1990. Last week Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's Treasurer, sought to down play the payments figures, citing the drought in Queensland and New South Wales and rising imports of capital goods as reasons for the disappointment. If that was why the payments deficit was rising, there would be less need for a monetary policy response. Evidence that companies are finally stepping up their investment would be a sign of sustainable recovery. The nagging worry remains, however, that Australia's current account is once again revealing the country's structural weakness as a commodity exporter with a relatively small domestic manufacturing base. Mr Willis points to 16 per cent compound growth in manufactured exports since the mid-1980s as evidence of change, but the base was small and the August trade figures showed a slowdown in non-farm exports. While such concern persists, Australia will need an eye on the limits to growth - still officially forecast at 4.25 per cent in the current financial year. Neither the currency nor the bond markets are likely to tolerate for long inaction by the Australian authorities once US rates rise again. Sydney equities have fallen 17 per cent since their peak in February. They may not yet have fully discounted further interest rate rises in the pipeline.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Recent developments in Bangladesh's foreign  relations have raised several questions in people's minds.  These questions are not being widely discussed due to the  prevailing political crisis in the country. The visit of the  governor of the Tripura state of India, Romesh Bhandari, to  Dhaka in the third week of April and the subsequent six-day long  visit of the Chief of Staff of the Indian Armed Forces, General  Bipin Chandra Joshi, to Bangladesh has had an impact on the  politics of the country. Earlier, a review was made regarding  the tour of Bhandari to Bangladesh, but one aspect of his visit  was not discussed. Bhandari made this visit as a special envoy  of New Delhi. It is needless to say that some changes have been  observed in New Delhi's policy towards Dhaka, but these changes  are in the interest of India. During this visit, talks were  held with Bhandari regarding the sharing of the waters of the  Ganges River. Bangladesh has identified this water sharing  issue as the main impediment towards the solution of other  problems with India. It is understood that India is now giving a  fresh thought on the water sharing issue. Apart from this,  India wants to improve its ties with Bangladesh to maintain its  dominance in South Asia. Let us see how India wants to achieve  this objective. For instance, India has softened its stand on  the water sharing issue after Bangladesh started taking the  necessary preparations to raise this matter at the United  Nations. At this stage it is necessary that Bangladesh should  be more cautious. Asafuddowla -- the official -- who strongly  advocated the cause of raising this issue at the United Nations  has now deviated from his earlier stand. Does this indicate  that there is a possibility of resolving this water sharing  issue with India through bilateral means? Asafuddowla is not  acceptable to the Indians. Did the government make a different  evaluation of him with India? People have a question in this  regard.    India does not want to restrict the forging of better ties  only to the spheres of water sharing and market economy. It  also wants to expand ties in the area of regional security.  Many people think that this was one of the objectives behind  the visit of General Joshi to Bangladesh. Official sources  however described it as a routine visit. Actually, this visit  had an important aim.    It is understood that India wants to capture Bangladesh's  military market. Though India has always opposed the military  development of Bangladesh, they now want to "dump" the military  equipment built in their country on Bangladesh. It is understood  that during his visit, General Joshi not only talked about  military cooperation but also mentioned the export of military  hardware to Bangladesh. At present, Bangladesh receives a large  chunk of its military equipment from China in the form of  grants. Later, these grants are waived. If new spare parts are  needed then Bangladesh imports them from China. India has said  that China is providing old equipment to Bangladesh, but it  [India] will provide her with new equipment. Hence, Bangladesh  will not need to import any spare parts.    Earlier, India had proposed to Bangladesh the holding of  joint military and naval exercises. Bangladesh has not yet  conveyed its decision to India. Many people believe that if  joint military exercises are held then India will be able to  develop contacts in the Bangladesh Army. Others say that if  joint exercises are held then Bangladesh will be able to  acquaint herself with the techniques of the Indian Army and also  become aware of their motives. Joint military exercises between  India and Bangladesh will create a new wave in regional  politics. It is believed that this may have a negative impact.    At present, Bangladesh is in need of an Armed Personnel  Carrier, APC. This carrier is used in different parts of the  world by the UN peacekeeping forces. The soldiers of Bangladesh  are not very familiar with these carriers. To ensure  Bangladesh's future participation in UN peacekeeping operations,  its army should learn how to use these carriers. At present,  India wants to supply these APC's to Bangladesh but a political  decision has to be taken in Bangladesh whether or not to bring  these from India.    General Joshi held talks on this issue during his visit to  Dhaka. India is also concerned about the tribal insurgency in  the northeastern parts of that country, which is being aided by  Pakistan. India believes that the Inter Services Intelligence  of Pakistan is abetting these rebellions and it [New Delhi] is  seeking the assistance of Bangladesh to curb these activities.  India also believes that these terrorists are being trained in  Bangladesh, but the latter has repeatedly refuted this  allegation. Despite this, India is not willing to accept the  denial of Bangladesh. A report published by the Indian Army in  April 1993 alleged that Bangladesh is supporting the rebels in  the northeastern states of India. India believes that the  tribal insurgents are using Bangladeshi soil to carry on their  activities in India. It has been learnt from reliable sources  that these issues came up for discussion during the visit of  General Joshi.    During the visit of General Joshi to Bangladesh, Indian  planes violated Bangladeshi airspace and India massed its troops  along the border of Lalmonirhat District while Bangladesh was  conducting excavation work along two of its rivers -- the Feni  River and the Dharala River. The foreign secretary of  Bangladesh once said that the government is observing the  situation along the border. He also questioned newsmen about  the veracity of newspaper reports published in this connection.  However, after this the Home Ministry lodged a strong protest  with India centering the tension along the border. It is now  known that Bangladesh apprised the visiting Indian Army chief  about these incidents. People want to know about these issues.  It is known to all that India had always opposed Bangladesh for  moving in an independent direction.</p>

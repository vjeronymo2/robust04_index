			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Hilario Gomez] </F>   [Text] Panamanian economist Guillermo O. Chapman, Jr. will  be President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' planning and  economic policy minister. In exclusive statements to EL PANAMA  AMERICA, Chapman explained what his first actions will be as  planning minister.    First he will "draw up a current account budget with work  programs and investments that reflect the priorities of the new  government. This is an essential instrument for governing, " he  stressed.    Law No.32 of 31 December 1993 established the State General  Budget at 3.9034 billion balboas, 1.9286 billion balboas of  which correspond to the central government's budget.    "I believe the budget policy must be guided by the objective  of generating savings in the current account -- in other words,  more revenue than operational expenses -- so we can use the  savings to finance the investment program," Chapman said.    The central government's 1994 budget plans for 1.4158  billion  balboas in current revenue and 512.8 million balboas in capital.  Of these, 324.3 million balboas will come from external credits  (IFI's [International Financial Institutions], credits,  donations from governments and other institutions).    Chapman admitted that the reality of this country and of all  countries is that governments do not have the capacity to  finance investment programs themselves. "If we want to  undertake the ambitious investment program that the country  requires, we need foreign financing. That is inevitable," he  added.    "From a basic standpoint, the country needs to draft its own  economic plan that emphasizes national priorities based on the  new government's viewpoint," he said.    According to Chapman, "the economic program must serve as a  guide for the implementation of subsequent budgets and for  Panama's relations with the IFI."    "My intention, and I have spoken about this in detail with  the president-elect, is to invert the traditional relationship  that Panama has had with the IFI. Throughout this relationship,  we have responded to their initiatives rather than to our own,"  the economist added.    The new economic plan will bear in mind the positive aspects  of the current Strategy for the Modernization of the Economy.  The economist indicated that "perhaps due to the political  structure of the Endara government, it is an incomplete  strategy. It lacks some key elements for improving the  economy's productivity."    "For a program to be successful domestically, it must be  gradual and coordinated. This tells us that so-called shock  treatments make no sense. I do not believe in that," the  president of the Investigation and Development Company (INDESA)  said.    A third priority for the future planning minister "is to  develop, simultaneously with the two previous priorities, a  social action program organized on a scientific basis with clear  national objectives.    The main ills affecting Panamanians are unemployment and  poverty. According to official figures, unemployment is at 14  percent and poverty and extreme poverty affects 50 percent of  the country.    According to Chapman, the initiatives to fight poverty must  be directed at the poorest sectors while achieving economic  growth.    In the last four years, the Panamanian economy has  registered  growth rates of 3.4, 5, 8, and 5.9 percent. Nevertheless, this  behavior is due to special situations related to the economic  and political crisis of 1988 and 1989.    The future planning minister said "this high growth will not  be maintained." Nevertheless, the country is sustained by  strong foreign exchange stemming from mature industries that are  condemned to slow growth while others will disappear, such as  the military bases. [sentence as published]    "The objective of the economic plan is to achieve  competitiveness to attract the foreign investments that have not  come to Panama over the past 10 years. This will generate more  jobs and improve purchasing power," Chapman said.    Asked about the populist and producer-state theories  promoted  by the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) in the 1970's,  Chapman said: "Only God and rocks do not change. Ideas and  people change."    Chapman indicated that privatization is not a panacea. If it  is not done well, it could create serious problems.  Privatization is justified when it produces social benefits or  accomplishes objectives that could not be reached otherwise."    A serious obstacle the new administration will face  beginning  1 September is the servicing of the commercial debt, which in  December 1993 reached $1,978,200,725, not including interest,  which amounts to more than $1.2 billion.    "This is a serious problem that must be handled carefully,"  Chapman said. Meanwhile, the negotiating team of the current  administration is trying to reach an agreement that will benefit  the country.    The economist said educating Panamanians to meet today's  demands is another priority task. "There is no reason why  Panamanians cannot have the same productivity as the Japanese,  Koreans, and Chileans."    Chapman told EL PANAMA AMERICA that "there are great  expectations in the private sector about the opening of specific  opportunities for investment."    "I am very optimistic about Panama's future, even though we  have such serious problems as the commercial debt, poverty, and  unemployment. I have accepted the post because I want those  opportunities to materialize," Guillermo Chapman said.</p>

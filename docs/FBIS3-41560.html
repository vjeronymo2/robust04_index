The proposal was made in a statement issued Tuesday at the  end of a forum sponsored by the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  the largest of seven parties in the ruling coalition.    The statement also called on the government, local  autonomous  bodies and universities to undertake studies to safeguard the  environment and promote management of fishery resources.    The SDP hopes to convene the sea of Japan governors' summit  around next June, a party official said. The party has already  gained basic endorsement for the summit plan, the official said.    The governors of Fukuoka and Hokkaido, the largest of the 16  prefectures facing the Sea of Japan, have both won elections  under the SDP's backing.    During the two-day forum attended by some 220 people,  academics, prefectural and municipal officials, international  exchange experts, and fishery representatives discussed a wide  range of themes concerning regional exchanges and development.    The Sea of Japan rim prefectures range from Hokkaido in the  north to Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki Prefectures in the south.    Development in those prefectures, particularly on Honshu  island, is far behind that of prefectures facing the Pacific  which include Japan's three biggest business centers of Tokyo,  Osaka and Nagoya.</p>

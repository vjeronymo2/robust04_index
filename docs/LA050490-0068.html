			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SENATOR ASKS FIRM TO PULL GREETING CARD OFF  SHELVES  </P> <P> A state lawmaker has asked a Burbank greeting card company to withdraw a card  from stores that he says is demeaning to victims of sexual assault and to  women.  </P> <P> The card, printed by The Thought Factory card company, has a drawing of a  police officer and says: "Prevent sexual assault. Cooperate."  </P> <P> Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), who noticed the card while browsing in a  Santa Clara County store, said this week that he "immediately saw red."  </P> <P> Debra Pierson, sales manager for The Thought Factory, said the firm no longer  sells the card "because we did feel it was offensive. . . . It had been brought  to our attention."  </P> <P> But Pierson said the company does not plan to remove the card from retail  stores because "we never had that big a distribution of it. I can't tell them  (the stores) to pull it. . . . I don't get into that kind of form of  censorship."  </P></p>

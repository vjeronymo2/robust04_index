			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Industry doubtful but resigned INDUSTRIAL reaction to the carbon tax proposal yesterday was mixed. Heavy consumers of energy winced at the added costs, but the majority adopted a resigned approach, expressing doubt that the impact would be as great as feared. Many companies argued that the tax was misdirected. Greater energy savings could be achieved by, for example, investing in measures to clean up eastern Europe. National Power, the UK electricity generator which is one of Europe's largest coal consumers, said it did not believe the proposal was either practical or appropriate. 'There are other ways of achieving emission reduction targets,' it said. The airline industry emphasised that it had no alternative to jet fuel and that a carbon tax would inevitably be reflected in increased fares. Airlines also stressed that civil aviation only accounts for about 2-3 per cent of total CO emissions and that significant advances have been made in fuel efficiency. British Airways, for which fuel accounts for 12.5 per cent of costs, argued that revenues from such a tax should be used to help improve the infrastructure of civil aviation, especially air traffic control. The tax could encourage airlines to 'tank' fuel outside the EC with the risk of increasing further CO emissions. Ford yesterday took a lead in proclaiming itself in favour of the EC proposals. 'We have long supported the concept of a carbon tax as one of the most immediate and effective actions that can be taken in terms of environmental protection,' it said. However the tax has to be bad news for the vehicle industry. Lower mileages as a result of costlier fuel could be expected to slow the rate of vehicle replacement. A trend to smaller, lighter vehicles would be accelerated, to the detriment of large, luxury cars which provide manufacturers with more profit per unit. However, Ford and other car makers say they regard both trends as long-term inevitabilities even without the CO issue, as oil becomes an increasingly scarce commodity. The freight transport industry believes a carbon tax at the level suggested will have little effect on fuel consumption. 'Fuel costs are so high that economy is already a top priority,' said the UK Freight Transport Association. In the oil industry, some company executives said the tax would be impractical and unlikely to reduce emissions. Shell, which has taken a high profile on the environment said it was too early to comment on the tax.</p>

Jennifer  Wilson has the details:    [Wilson] According to the news agency, Reuters, three of the  26-member cabinet said this week that the drug trafficking  scandal had reached crisis proportions. They called on the  president to act immediately. Zambia's leading Western donors  said at a consultative meeting in Paris earlier this month that  an end to drug trafficking and corruption was a precondition for  aid. Zambia already has a balance-of-payments financing gap of  $96 million for 1994, which donors said they would not cover  until the government rid itself of corrupt individuals.    The ministers said four of their colleagues, whom they did  not name, were involved in drug dealing. Most of the deals  involved shipping highly addictive mandrax sedatives from India,  where they are made, to South Africa. The three ministers said  their concerns were shared by many of their colleagues, and a  cabinet walk-out was possible. Chiluba, a devout Christian, won  a landslide victory in elections in 1991, ousting Kenneth  Kaunda, who took office on independence from Britain in 1964.</p>

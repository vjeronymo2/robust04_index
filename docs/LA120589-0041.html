			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A no-bail bench warrant for the arrest of Ruby Mae Brown was issued Monday by a  judge after Brown failed to show up to begin her 89-day jail sentence for  cruelty toward dogs in her now-closed kennel.  </P> <P> Brown, 61, was sentenced Thursday by San Diego Municipal Judge Robert McDonald  to 89 days in jail after she refused, through her attorney, to agree to a  probation condition requiring her to surrender her guns for the next three  years.  </P> <P> Her attorney, Hodge Crabtree, said Monday that he did now know where his client  was.  </P> <P> For years, Brown operated Kelly's Pet Hotel on Morena Boulevard, which was  raided frequently by animal control officers because of unsanitary conditions.  It is now closed.  </P> <P> A jury convicted Brown Oct. 25 on four counts of animal cruelty and one of  interfering with a county official in the performance of his duty, all  misdemeanors.  </P></p>

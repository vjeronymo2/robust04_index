			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Thomson Directories bought by US West US West, the regional telecoms company covering 14 midwestern US states, is increasing its stake in the highly competitive UK telecoms market with the purchase of Thomson Directories for about Pounds 70m. The move pitches US West into competition with British Telecommunications for UK business directory services, which it believes are underdeveloped. It views the purchase as an important means of gaining access to businesses for the development of multi-media services. US West's international strategy centres on mobile communications and combined cable television and telephone networks, which it plans to develop for inter-active services. In the UK it has a 50 per cent stake in Mercury One-2-One, a cellular mobile network, and a similar stake in TeleWest, a cable company claiming more than 150,000 telephone subscribers. Thomson Directories, which publishes 155 business directories in the UK serving 1.6m businesses, is owned by the Thomson Corporation, the Canadian publishing and travel group, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US information products and services company. It started life in 1966 publishing Yellow Pages for the Post Office under contract. Since going it alone it has engaged in protracted disputes with BT over access to BT's numbering database. Mr Alain Treille, US West director of international marketing, said the dispute had now been 'resolved satisfactorily'. BT has about 85 per cent of the directory advertising market with its Yellow Pages division, and has been diversifying with products such as Talking Pages. US West said it saw 'massive potential' for developing the European directory business, still largely in the hands of state-owned telecoms operators. The company also has a business directory concern in Poland, and is looking to expand in the directory market across Europe. In the US, moves are advanced to extend the Yellow Pages concept to other media. Last December Nynex, the Baby Bell company serving the north-east, announced a partnership with Prodigy, a national computer information network owned by IBM and Sears, to introduce a Yellow Pages service for personal computers.</p>

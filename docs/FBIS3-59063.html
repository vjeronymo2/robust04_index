What an  immense retreat that will be after we had all shouted together:  Long live freedom! Those who waited for it for half a century,  three quarters of a century, who suffered in concentration  camps, those who saw their nearest ones, their parents, their  brothers, their children, die in pain and under torture, will  turn away from freedom, and will stop believing in it.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Impala Platinum down 25% IMPALA Platinum, the world's second largest producer, saw earnings tumble by 25 per cent in the six months ended December, as weak prices negated improved production. Income from platinum mining fell 38 per cent to R137.6m (Dollars 44.2m) and net attributable earnings fell to R93.6m from R124.7m. The dividend is being cut from 55 cents a share to 45 cents. Tax was lower but income from associates fell 66 per cent, with both Western and Eastern Platinum not paying a dividend. Earnings per share fell by 25 per cent to 150 cents. Impala seems to have overcome recent production and industrial relations problems. Mr Michael McMahon, managing director, said: 'We think we have fixed everything that is fixable at Implats.' A 6 per cent increase in recoveries from the refinery contributed to Impala lifting refined platinum production by 46 per cent to 559,000 ounces. Total operating costs of producing an ounce of platinum fell by 22.5 per cent to R1,548 per ounce compared to the same period in 1991. Although platinum sales rose by 16 per cent from 1991, and rhodium sales by 33 per cent, soft prices saw revenue per ounce of platinum sold decline by nearly 18 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EX-BANK WORKER CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLING $660,000  </P> <P> A former employee of Bank of America in North Hollywood was indicted this week  on charges of embezzling $660,000 from bank customers, officials said.  </P> <P> Phyllis R. Isenberg, 64, was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on six  counts of bank and mail fraud, said Grace Denton, a spokeswoman for the U.S.  attorney's office.  </P> <P> Isenberg allegedly took customers' money that was intended for deposit but  never actually placed it in an account.  </P> <P> Instead, she issued phony receipts to the customers and kept the money for  herself, Denton said.  </P> <P> When customers came to withdraw their money, Isenberg gave them money taken  from the accounts of other customers.  </P> <P> Officials discovered her activities after she retired from the bank in 1988 and  determined the fraud had gone on since 1983, Denton said.  </P> <P> "When she retired, she could not do that anymore," Denton said.  </P> <P> If convicted, Isenberg could receive a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison  and be fined up to $1.26 million.  </P> <P> She will be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Sept. 4.  </P></p>

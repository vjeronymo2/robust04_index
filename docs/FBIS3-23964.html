			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr Frenkel, </F> under the "A Forecast" rubric: "Russian Industry in February"]    [Text] Since the beginning of 1994, the situation in  industry has worsened sharply. According to the current data, it  looks as if the decline of production in January will be more  substantial than had been presented in our January forecast.    There will be 20 work days in February 1994--the same number  that there was in February 1993. A sharp decline in production  will continue in an absolute majority of industrial sectors in  all regions of Russia. Output of more than 85 percent of  varieties of products produced will decline. The output will  decline by more than 20 percent in most machine-building  sectors, the chemical industry, a number of sectors in the  construction materials industry, production of home appliances,  and the light industry.    The value of the physical volume index of the output will  measure in February in Russia as whole at 0.802 (in December it  was to 0.839 as compared to the forecasted value of 0.854--see  DELOVOY MIR, 10 December 1993), that is, production will decline  by 19.8 percent. The average daily output of industrial  production will decline in February also by 19.8 percent as  compared to 1993. (In December, the average daily output  declined by 14.1 percent as compared to the forecasted value of  14.6 percent--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 December 1993).    The financial situation of most enterprises is unstable. To  a  large extent, this is associated with the exacerbating solvency  crisis. According to the Russian Goskomstat [State Committee for  Statistics] data, as of 1 December past due payments owed to  suppliers by consumer enterprises amounted to 8.304 trillion  rubles [R] and increased over the month by 30.3 percent. Past  due indebtedness will continue to increase in February.    The situation in the fuel and power generation complex  sectors in February will change only insignificantly as compared  to the preceding winter months. Production of oil will decline  over the month by 3 million tonnes (11 percent) and will amount  to 26.8 million tonnes. Oil production in Tyumen Oblast, which  accounts for two-thirds of all oil production in Russia, will  decline in approximately the same proportion. The drop in the  output results in cutbacks in primary processing of oil, which  will reach 10 percent in February. This in turn will cause a  decline in the production of automotive gasoline by 9 percent,  diesel fuel by 12 percent, and boiler oil by 9 percent. Gas  production will decline somewhat in February--by 1 percent (0.5  billion cubic meters). The decline in production is the result  of the difficult economic situation in the industry and the  strained circumstances of consumers of its output. The problem  is that the current level of production lately on the whole  corresponded to domestic needs in gas. At the same time,  consumers' insolvency in near-abroad countries results in  cutbacks of its deliveries there and, as a consequence, cutbacks  in production.    Electric power generation at public utilities will decline  over February by 2.6 billion kWt/hr (3 percent), which will be  brought about mainly by a decline in power generation at heat  and power plants (by 4 percent) and hydroelectric stations (also  by 4 percent). Production decline in power engineering results  to a large extent from disruption in fuel deliveries (especially  coal), as well as cutbacks in deliveries of electric power to  consumers with whom the utilities have outstanding unpaid bills  for many months. The structure of fuel consumption by heat and  power plants in the beginning of 1993 was as follows. The share  of gas in all fuels used equals 64 percent, coal--24 percent,  and petroleum products--12 percent.    Production of coal in February as a whole will drop off by  1.2 million tonnes (4 percent), including coal for coking--by 2  percent. A number of mines have declared a prestrike condition.  Many of them are delaying shipments of coal to consumers because  of considerable past due payments to coal producers.    In ferrous metallurgy, the decline in operations of iron ore  enterprises continues to accelerate. In February iron ore mining  will drop by 8 percent as compared to last year. Deliveries of  scrap metal, whose collection will fall off by almost 40  percent, also will diminish. The result will be that the  proportion of more expensive pig iron used in steel smelting  will increase and that the less expensive scrap metal will  decrease. These negative processes will take place against the  background of a declining supply of fuel to the industry: Coke  burning will decrease over the month by 9 percent. In addition  to an insufficient supply of raw materials to the industry, its  development is substantially affected by a problem common for  the entire of industrial production--considerable insolvency on  the part of consumers. As of 1 December 1993, past due arrears  on the part of buyers for the products shipped by metallurgical  enterprises amounted to R1.547 trillion. All of this is  seriously undermining ferrous metallurgy, which is already in a  critical condition even without this. As a result, the output of  pig iron in February will decline by 18 percent, steel  smelting--by 24 percent, and that of finished rolled metal--by  23 percent. There is a continuing decline in the production of  steel pipe, which will reach 50 percent in February. To a  considerable extent this is related to the declining demand for  the sector's output. The situation in machine building continues  to worsen dramatically. The output of more than 85 percent of  categories of products counted in periodic reports will decline  in February. With respect to a considerable share of items, the  output will decline by 30 or more percent. Among them are  forge-press machines, whose output will drop off by 73 percent;  metal-cutting machine tools--by 49 percent; bulldozers--by 50  percent; and excavators--by 30 percent.    The situation in transportation machine building will worsen  substantially. The output of diesel locomotives will fall off by  50 percent, electric locomotives--by 90 percent, railroad cargo  cars--by 30 percent, railroad passenger cars--by 20 percent, and  trolleys--by 33 percent.    Production of agricultural machinery also will continue to  decline: The output of tractors will drop off by 90 percent,  tractor hitches--by 93 percent, and grain harvesting  combines--by 67 percent.    While the volume of production in automotive machine  building  had been increasing until recently, in February the picture will  change. The output of trucks will decline by 47 percent,  passenger automobiles--by 17 percent, and buses--by 5 percent.    The output of equipment for light industry also will  decline:  production of spinning machines will decline by 11 percent, and  weaving looms--by 20 percent. Production of ball bearings will  drop off by 45 percent.    The situation in the chemical industry will worsen in  February. A considerable decline in production will take place  first and foremost with respect to the output of the sector's  raw materials. For instance, the output of synthetic ammonia  will decline by 17 percent, sulphuric acid--by 31 percent, soda  ash--by 40 percent, and caustic soda--by 19 percent.    The decline in production of mineral fertilizer will  exacerbate considerably. In February it will reach 32 percent.  This is related first and foremost to the shortage of  mineral-chemical raw materials, which has developed as a result  of depletion of mineral reserves, as well as the lack of modern  equipment and technologies for more complete extraction of  minerals used in production of mineral fertilizer. As a result,  the structure of mineral fertilizer production has changed. In  1993 the share of nitrogen fertilizer amounted to 52 percent,  while the proportional share of a more effective phosphorus  fertilizer, whose production is more labor-intensive, amounted  to only 24 percent. The share of potassium fertilizer also  amounted to 24 percent. Second, the exacerbating insolvency  crisis put the sector's enterprises in an extremely difficult  financial situation. As a result, serious difficulties arise  with respect to purchases of raw materials and components, which  leads in turn to lesser utilization of capacities. Even more  considerable will be the decline in production of  microbiological feed protein--by 41 percent; production of  chemical fiber and filament will drop off by 32 percent.    In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry in  February the decline in production will increase as compared to  the preceding winter months. This is associated first and  foremost with a disruption in the operations of the  timber-logging sector, which serves as a base for  timber-processing productions. For instance, the outtake of  round timber declined over the month by 22 percent, which will  be the main factor in the expected 38 percent decline in the  production of commercial timber. The technical base of the  sector is extremely backward. The equipment is extremely  obsolete, while the financing for accumulation of  between-seasons reserves of timber are allocated belatedly and  in insufficient volume. The sharp increase in railroad tariffs  creates difficulties in transporting timber from Siberia and the  Far East to the European part of Russia, where the greatest  number of timber-processing enterprises are located. The limited  supply of timber material to enterprises will lead, in turn, to  a decline in the output of lumber by 29 percent, plywood  laminate--by 22 percent, and wood particleboard--by 8 percent.  Serious deficiencies in deliveries of wood materials and the  extremely poor technical condition of equipment are the main  causes of the declining output of paper and cardboard, which  will fall in February by 21 percent and 30 percent, respectively.    In the construction materials industry, the decline slowed  down somewhat in the fourth quarter of 1993, which was caused by  a pick-up in housing construction (individual, as well as  construction done by joint-stock companies and other nonstate  organizations). However, at the beginning of 1994 this trend  will change. Production of cement will decline in February by 12  percent, of asbestos-cement sheeting by 62 percent,  asbestos-cement pipe and couplers by 43 percent, construction  brick by 8 percent, prefabricated ferroconcrete by 14 percent,  soft roofing materials by 30 percent, and window glass by 34  percent.    In the beginning of 1994, the trend toward a decline in the  production of most varieties of complex home appliances, which  emerged in the fourth quarter of 1993, has settled in. Only the  output of refrigerators and freezers will increase by 2 percent  in February of 1994. Production of most other categories of  complex home appliances will be declining: washing machines by  45 percent, electric vacuum cleaners by 55 percent, tape  recorders by 40 percent, radio receivers by 36 percent,  television sets by 23 percent, sewing machines by 66 percent,  and bicycles by 66 percent. The reasons, which have already  become habitual for many industrial sectors, are the shortage of  material and financial resources and the declining demand  because of a substantial increase in prices. The output of  synthetic detergents will drop off by 37 percent.    In light industry in February, as during the preceding  months, the output of cotton fabrics will be increasing and will  reach 222 million square meters (133 percent). Production of  other most important categories of the industry's output,  however, will be falling: woolen fabrics by 42 percent, silk  fabrics by 40 percent, knitwear by 28 percent, hosiery by 26  percent, and footwear by 51 percent.

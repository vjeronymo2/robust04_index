			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Poland on a detour FOR 11 months Ms Hanna Suchocka, the Polish prime minister, gave the impression that Poland had found a new political stability. This was a tribute to her political skills and the competence of a handful of ministers, particularly in the finance and privatisation ministries. Yet the seven-party coalition was always a minority government. It could not even count on all the 186 votes of its members in the 460-seat lower house. This was due to the political differences between the two core parties in the government, Ms Suchocka's Democratic Union and the Liberal Democrats, on the one hand, and the smaller catholic and peasants' parties, on the other. The government lost Friday's no-confidence motion because just a handful of coalition votes was not cast. The initial reaction, written on Ms Suchocka's face, was dismay. She had repeatedly told parliament that it would be irresponsible to bring down a government committed to economic reform without any alternative in sight. Poland, she argued, needs political stability to persevere with tight fiscal and monetary policies and retain foreign financial support. At home, Poland must implement a series of reforms, including a new tax system, bank restructuring and privatisation, if it is to make its incipient economic recovery sustainable. Parliament ignored these warnings. In response, President Lech Walesa opted to dissolve parliament and called on Ms Suchocka to lead a caretaker government until elections can be held this autumn, probably in September. Poland faces three or four difficult months. But there are reasonable grounds for believing that these early elections could turn out to be a blessing in disguise. More stable For a start, Mr Walesa has indicated that he will sign the new electoral law, passed by parliament shortly after the no-confidence vote, in time for the elections. The new, German-style electoral barrier means that smaller parties which fail to obtain 5 per cent of the vote will not gain representation. This should make it easier to form more stable coalitions. As important, Mr Walesa signalled his support for the outgoing government's tough fiscal stance by vetoing a 21,000bn zloty (Pounds 840m) bill for increased pensions. Parliament had approved the package in the face of government objections that it would breach the budget deficit limit of 5 per cent of gross domestic product, which was agreed with the IMF in return for a Dollars 660m standby agreement. High rating Mr Walesa, an intuitive politician, has evidently been impressed by the high rating given to Ms Suchocka in opinion polls. Apparently, at least 60 per cent of the electorate understand the need for sacrifices if Poland's transition to market democracy is to be sustained. These are the people who have either benefited or see prospects of benefiting from the transition process. While industrial output has slumped 40 per cent since 1989, they have also seen an explosion of private business, an internally convertible currency, full shops and latterly even a recovery of industrial output from both state and private firms. Unfortunately, around 40 per cent of the electorate feel excluded. Their numbers include many favoured by the old regime, like steelworkers and coalminers, or protected, like farmers, teachers and other public sector workers. In these groups are those who have suffered most from high inflation and rising unemployment. Not surprisingly, these people also resent the wealth flaunted by the newly rich. This dichotomy is to be found in all the post-communist states. The only way of dealing with the problem is to combine sustainable economic growth with high employment and a financeable social safety net. The EC could help by opening markets. Also beneficial would be a reduction in Poland's Dollars 12.1bn commercial bank debt, which would stimulate greater foreign investment. But there are no short cuts, as the majority recognise. They need to maintain support for the parties pledged to continue the reform which is now showing its first fruits.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : ITALS AT MUSIC MACHINE: PUSHING TOO HARD  </P> <P> The Itals stood conventional roots reggae wisdom on its head during an hourlong  performance at the Music Machine on Friday. Reggae is often criticized for  being too laid back, but the Jamaican vocal trio's harmonizing was more edgy  and shrill than the smooth, rounded singing offered by, say, the Mighty  Diamonds.  </P> <P> The difference was exciting at first but gradually became grating, but the  Itals made a dramatic comeback during an encore that lasted as long as the set  proper.  </P> <P> There, the group didn't push the singing at the audience so relentlessly, the  fuller, deeper singing of Ronnie Davis took the lead from Keith Porter on a  couple of numbers (particularly a great snippet of the Temptations' "Ain't Too  Proud to Beg"), and the eight-piece band borrowed from second-billed Ras  Michael grew more accustomed to backing the Itals.  </P> <P> In his opening set, Ras Michael's use of Nyabinghi drumming (the "heartbeat"  rhythm early reggae drew from Rastafarian devotional music) and Arabic-tinged  melodies was unusual enough to overcome some ragged stretches.

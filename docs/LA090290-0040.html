			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A PLEA TO LIMIT PURCHASE OF HANDGUNS  </P> <P> County residents are aware by now of the senseless murder Aug. 19 of three  young men at the store in Tustin where they worked. Our son's close friend,  Russell (Rusty) Williams, was one of the victims. We and the community have  suffered a heartbreaking loss by his death.  </P> <P> Their murder by a handgun fired at close range is alleged to have been  committed by a former fellow employee at the store, who had earlier borrowed  the weapon from another employee and then returned it the same night as the  triple slaying. As easy as that. Pull a trigger four times. Three irreplaceable  lives ended.  </P> <P> By necessity, the Revolution was fought by volunteers from armed state militias  called up by the Continental Congress to secure our independence from an  oppressive England. In 1791, when the Bill of Rights was enacted, state  militias made up the only standing army the nation could call upon to defend  itself. Thus, the Second Amendment specifically coupled the "right to keep and  bear arms" with "a well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a  free state."  </P> <P> The founding fathers' necessity has become our tragic burden. According to  statistics, more than 30,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. Such  numbers reveal social insanity.  </P> <P> If citizens really want to reduce this slaughter, they should write their  lawmakers, particularly local congressmen, expressing their outrage. Ask about  their stand on the Brady Bill, HR 467. It mandates a short waiting period  before a buyer can purchase a gun.  </P> <P> If America can remove millions of Tylenol bottles from store counters because  of seven poisoned users in October, 1982, and at enormous cost one month later  require all non-prescription drugs to be in tamper-proof containers, it surely  can do something to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of just anybody who  wants to own or use a gun. A letter now might save some other young Rusty  later.  </P> <P> ROD BRIGGS  </P> <P> LOIS BRIGGS  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

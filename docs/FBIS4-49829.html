			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "China's Nuclear System Meets World </F> Standards"]    [Text] China's nuclear regulatory system meets  international standards, a review team announced on Monday after  a two-week inspection.    The study was the first conducted on China's nuclear plants  by an international group.    It inspected units and offered suggestions including  improving backup systems and expanding the role of the China  National Safety Administration (NNSA), the nuclear industry's  independent regulatory body.    NNSA, which invited the team from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), was set up in 1984 to oversee the  structure, organization, regulations, safety review, licensing  and commissioning of nuclear plants .    The international team said the NNSA provides a good model  for countries developing nuclear programmes.    "The licensing and review process employed at the Daya Bay  and Qinshan units conforms with international practice," said  Morris Rosen, IAEA's assistant director general.    Huang Qitao, director general of NNSA, said the group's  visit  demonstrates the importance the government is giving to nuclear  safety.    He said the evaluation also helped China locate shortcomings  in its programme and gain advice from overseas experts.    "This will help ensure the safe operation of nuclear  installations in China and protect the public and the  environment," Huang said.    The review commission said the NNSA should pay more  attention  to operational experience feedback systems in accident  prevention.    Such systems, common worldwide, can identify problems ahead  of time, thus allowing preventive measures to be taken.    The group also said the NNSA should take a more active role  in nuclear industry decisions and provide advice to provincial  governments and the National Nuclear Accident Emergency  Committee.    Two nuclear plants have gone into operation the past two  years: one at Daya Bay in Shenzhen and another in Qinshan,  Zhejiang Province.    Two more 600,000 kilowatt units have been authorized for  Qinshan and additional units are also planned for Daya Bay.    The areas reviewed included nuclear safety legislation, the  role and responsibility of the regulatory body, regulations and  guides, the licensing process, applicant requirements,  inspection and enforcement, and emergency preparations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bulletin No. 1 issued by the Electoral Tribunal at the </F> Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City; read by TE Press  Secretary Doris Chong Guardia -- live]    [Text] The following is the first official bulletin issued  by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] on the development of the 8 May  elections:    The first report was received from the Veraguas Provincial  Directorate, where 535 voting tables have been set up.  Provincial Director Gilberto Estrada reported that the  elections began normally with good voter turnout, who said they  wanted to vote quickly. Only one voting table reported problems.  Two officials scheduled to be present at a voting table at the  Juan Demostenes Arosemena School did not show up, so they were  replaced at 0830. The voting table is now fully staffed. The  10 electoral delegates are all performing their assigned tasks.  A candidate for representative in Veraguas Province was caught  in a government vehicle that was loaded with campaign  propaganda. He was detained.    In Concepcion Bugaba District, Chiriqui Province, one person  was caught distributing ballots outside a voting site. This  person has been remanded to the appropriate authorities.    Reports received at 0900 indicate that the voting process is  proceeding normally in Bocas del Toro Province, with 212 voting  tables; Cocle Province, with 410 voting tables; Chiriqui  Province, with 830 voting tables; Herrera Province, with 281  voting tables; Los Santos Province, with 248 voting tables;  Panama Province, with 2,290 voting tables; and Veraguas  Province, with 135 voting tables.    The sources reported that a vehicle rented to the TE was  involved in an accident near Colon. The driver, Roberto  Salcedo, was admitted to the Amador Guerrero Hospital for  observation.    We have reports that a heavy rain has been falling in Colon  since early this morning. The weather is clear throughout the  rest of the country.    The sources consulted all stressed the large voter turnout,  especially in Herrera, Los Santos, Panama, and Veraguas  Provinces. The sources also stressed the order and discipline of  the voters at the various voting sites, especially in Panama  Province, where there are 2,290 voting tables, 45 percent of the  country's total number of voting tables.    This has been the first official bulletin issued by the TE  on  today's elections. We will have more reports for you in the  next few hours . Thank you.</p>

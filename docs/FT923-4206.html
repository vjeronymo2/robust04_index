			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: The company that admits it made mistakes / A look at how Outokumpu is coming to terms with its record loss It is still unusual for senior managers of large companies to admit mistakes publicly without being forced to do so. But Outokumpu, the Finnish metals and mining group, owns up in its latest annual report. New chairman, Mr Jyrki Juusela, says: 'We did not react to change quickly enough.' Consequently, Outokumpu last year suffered the biggest loss in its long history. The setback has come at an unfortunate time because Outokumpu is being lined up for sale to international investors. Next January, non-Finnish investors will for the first time be able to buy Outokumpu shares. And the Finnish government has passed legislation to enable the state's 57.5 per cent shareholding to be reduced to 30 per cent when market conditions improve. Mr Juusela hopes that in a year or so Outokumpu's shares will be quoted on the London and New York stock exchanges as well as in Helsinki, where employees and some domestic institutions have been able to trade them since October 1988. Like most of Finland's business leaders, he hopes that by 1995-96 his country will be a member of the European Community and that its trade barriers will be down and capital will flow more freely across its borders. 'I believe, for example, that Japanese investors would then be more willing to invest in Finland. We need such investment for the economy to grow. The capital generated in Finland is not enough.' Mr Juusela's appointment as chairman and chief executive in January was sudden but it had nothing to do with the fact that Outokumpu had reported record losses of FM768m (Dollars 191.3m) on sales of FM12.6bn for 1991. It was because his predecessor, Mr Pertti Voutilainen, was snatched away by the government to become chief executive of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's largest commercial bank and state-owned, which had run into severe troubles. While Mr Voutilainen was president and subsequently chairman, Outokumpu became one of the world's biggest integrated multi-metal companies. Its size tripled in the 1980s, mainly through vigorous acquisition activity. This strained its financial resources because the Finnish government was not willing to provide much extra equity funding. Mr Juusela points out there will be no jolting changes of direction following his appointment. He has spent his entire working life with Outokumpu and for the past five years has been on the board. He says: 'We are taking fewer risks, mainly for financial reasons. We are concentrating on those areas where we think we are good and stepping out of those businesses where we are not so good.' It will take two or three years more to reshape the group, he suggests. But Outokumpu will stick with its present four division structure developed during the past five years: base metals production; copper products; stainless steel; and technology. Copper products present the group with its biggest headache. Outokumpu has assembled one of the world's biggest copper semi-fabrication businesses and is probably the only global player in this highly competitive industry where there is substantial over-capacity. Mr Juusela says: 'Perhaps we grew too fast in copper semis. But with acquisitions you must seize the opportunities when they come along.' For example, Outokumpu had intended to restrict expansion to Europe at first but then it had the chance to acquire (for about Dollars 200m) American Brass, the second-largest copper semi-fabricator in the US with a 20 per cent market share. Mr Juusela says: 'The only problem is that we bought it just before the US market went into recession. Apart from that it has done very well.' In fact, he says that only five of the 25 profit centres within the copper products division are loss makers - 'but those losses are very large'. Mr Juusela says: 'The (copper semis) market changed. The growth in demand was not as great as predicted. Competitors did not drop out as fast as we expected. There are many small plants close to individual markets and reconstruction of the industry is taking longer than we anticipated. We were too optimistic about the shape of the business.' To stop the losses Outokumpu has shut down its hot and cold rolling operations in Sweden and has moved out of rolled products in Spain, where it bought Iberica del Cobre (Ibercobre) in 1989. The group is setting up a joint venture with SMI, the Italian company, to merge some of their copper semi-fabrication operations in Spain and negotiations are going on with the Spanish authorities and banks about Outokumpu's remaining copper semis operations in that country. These should be concluded by the end of this year. Outokumpu has allocated FM150m towards the cost of restructuring the copper semis operations but Mr Juusela remains convinced that the copper semis business 'will be healthy in the 1990s'. Losses are flowing from the technology division which has an array of embryonic companies involved in special services and frontier-type technologies associated with Outokumpu's mainstream operations but is suffering from a lack of orders. Action is being taken to merge some of the technology operations with other companies both inside and outside Outokumpu. Mr Juusela says Outokumpu's capital spending will remain at its normal rate of about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of group sales. In the immediate future most will be spent on developing new copper projects in Chile and nickel projects in Australia. Equity represents only 20 per cent of Outokumpu's total assets today. The group aims to lift this to 30 per cent in two to three years, 'but to be healthy it needs to be between 40 and 50 per cent', Mr Juusela insists. Only when the balance sheet is in good order will the group spend some more risk capital. 'The most important thing is for us to make a good profit.' He looks for a 15 per cent to 20 per cent return on capital employed over the business cycle. Last year it was a lowly 1.9 per cent, down from 4.5 per cent in 1990. Mr Juusela says that the bottom of the recession for the group was reached in 1991. 'Our markets in the US are now quite good. German metals consumption is still holding up.' Outokumpu made a profit in the first four months of 1992 - it reported income before extraordinary items of FM3m - and 'it doesn't look too bad for the rest of this year'.</p>

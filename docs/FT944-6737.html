			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (7): Spurred on by foreign investors - Stock Market Expansion In a year when the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has been forced to suspend trading in at least two new share issues, amid concerns that investors' interests were at risk, no one can take for granted the safety of investment in Pakistani stocks. However, the potential damage has not been enough to inhibit the market's fast growth or a sharp rise in seat prices on the KSE. In a closed shop of just under 200 members, prospective brokers need to spend up to Rs27.5m (Dollars 800,000) to buy a licence in the open market - three times more than was charged four years ago, when the country's economic reforms allowed the entry of foreign investors. Those reforms have attracted up to Dollars 800m from foreign investors. Although still a small portion of the overall market capitalisation of Dollars 13bn, the entry of foreign funds has prompted increased investment by domestic investors. The market's average daily turnover has trebled to 10m shares since 1991, while capitalisation has almost doubled in the past three years. As a result of increased business activity, at least six new brokerage houses have been formed. The changes have also given birth to a new breed of 'yuppies' who are fast emerging in the market. According to Mr Nasir Bukhari, chief executive of Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari, a leading brokerage firm, up to half of the new graduates from the country's two top management schools now want to join a brokerage house. Before the reforms, virtually none wanted to. But behind the impressive change, the KSE is still faced by concerns over lax laws and a potentially 'overheated' environment. 'We asserted ourselves in such a way that we pre-empted any chance of the small investor being misled,' is how Mr Yasin Lakhani, president of the KSE, defends his record. Critics argue that this year's suspension of two new issues hardly gives reason for comfort. The action was prompted when one announced an excessively generous rights issue; while another did not deliver share certificates to the public, even after receiving subscription money. The market 'is not becoming unsafe for investors - there are scandals and dubious issues, which come in every market of the world,' comments Mr Farrukh Khan, chief executive of BMA Capital Management, a leading brokerage house, who also defends the record. However, he concedes that there is room for changes to protect investors' interests. He wants to see tighter regulations, to require underwriters to take full legal responsibility for the prospectus issued before shares are brought to the market. Mr Lakhani says the government is planning to increase the powers of the KSE management, which can only suspend trading or delist a company. Among other concerns, some foreign fund managers and their representatives also complain of inadequate mechanisms to clamp down on insider trading. 'The market is still not geared to deal aggressively with such issues,' says one. 'This is not the New York stock exchange, but still, if it wants to be taken seriously, it will have to prove that its taking action to prevent fraud.' Even if regulations are tightened, that alone will not resolve issues which could prevent further growth. Investing in the market is yet to become a popular concept for small Pakistani investors, many of whom still rely upon bank deposits as their main investments. According to Mr Khan, the KSE growth could take off if open-ended mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies from the domestic market were allowed to invest freely. The government is reconsidering the rules on these matters, but it is not clear how soon changes, if any, will be announced. To keep up the investment momentum, Mr Lakhani is also urging the government to announce a further five-year extension to a capital-gains exemption before it expires next summer, to avoid uncertainty and large-scale speculative trading. Many brokers also see developments in the market as an important element in the success of Pakistan's privatisation programme, especially the plans to sell government-owned utilities. A beginning has been made this year with the first international and domestic share offers in the giant Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC), the biggest company to be listed on the KSE. The government is considering plans to offer some of the power-generation plants run by Water and Power Development Authority - Pakistan's largest power company - during the next year, and at least one of the two largest public-sector banks. It proposes that part of this will be through the KSE, although the exact size of the offer has not yet been announced.</p>

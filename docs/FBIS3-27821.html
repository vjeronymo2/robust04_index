			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The son of North Korean  President Kim Il-song, now managing the impoverished country's  domestic affairs, will not take over all his father's powers  while the elder Kim is living, a source in Beijing said Tuesday  [1 February].    "There will be no final transfer of power to Kim Chong-il as  long as Kim Il-song lives," the president's younger brother, Kim  Yong-chu, reportedly said, according to an East European source.  The source also said the youngest Kim will remain a "crown  prince" until his father's death. Such a scenario contradicts  predictions by foreign watchers who believe that Kim Chong-il,  also chairman of the National Defense Commission, will soon take  over his 82-year-old father's duties as president and general  secretary of the Korean Workers' Party.    Kim Yong-chu, however, confirmed that the youngest Kim is  already handling all domestic affairs while his father remains  responsible for foreign policy decisions, the source said.  According to the source, Kim Yong-chu, 72, made the statements  in a surprisingly open conversation with a Third World diplomat  in Pyongyang last week, where he denied "any differences"  between himself and Kim Chong-il.    Disputing rumors that he poses a threat to the "model of  succession," Kim Yong-chu said he "firmly supports the dear  leader Kim Chong-il" and denounced speculation that China, North  Korea's strongest ally, would prefer to see him instead of Kim  Chong-il as future leader of North Korea. Kim Yong-chu, who was  appointed a member of the Central Committee of the Politburo of  the party and vice president last December after nearly 17 years  out of the public eye, has been the center of rumors concerning  North Korea's future leadership.    During the hour-long conversation, Kim Yong-chu did not  explain his political decline during the 1970s, which, according  to official versions, was due to a "serious illness," the source  said.</p>

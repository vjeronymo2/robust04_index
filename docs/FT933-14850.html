			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Prices climb despite lure of German bonds THE UK inflation optimists remain in the ascendancy. Gilt prices continued to climb last week in spite of the competing attractions of German government bonds which soared as investors re-appraised the outlook for the German economy and the D-Mark. Ten-year gilts gained nearly a quarter of a point on the week, after a half point rise the week before. Little happened to change the consensus view that inflationary pressures would be muted for some time. That sentiment could be tested this week, which sees a spate of economic data including the latest numbers for unemployment and retail price inflation. Even though senior officials at the Bank of England continue to sound warnings about the possibility of increased price pressures in the next few months, the balance of opinion in financial markets is shifting towards commentators such as Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University who are claiming that inflation is dead. According to Prof Minford, one of the Treasury's panel of seven outside economic advisers whose second report came out last week, recent changes in company behaviour and in the labour market have made the re-appearance of serious inflationary problems in the near future extremely unlikely. He says he is 'frustrated and depressed' that much of the mainstream UK economics community tends more to the official Bank line on inflation. According to Prof Minford, the UK economy is 'straining at the leash' and could be capable of strong non-inflationary growth this year if the government were to loosen economic policy. This could be done, he says, by a cut of 2 percentage points in interest rates by the end of the year to 4 per cent. He also would like the Treasury and Bank to combat the generally upward drift by sterling. Even though few in the gilts market are quite so sanguine about price pressures in the economy as the Liverpool professor, the broad direction of yield movements during the week lend his views some support. The yield of the 8 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2003 was quoted on Friday night at 7.51 per cent, 13 basis points down on the week and 50 basis points down over the past month. It closed on Friday at a price of 103 5/16. The 10-year area of the gilt curve performed particularly well last week, with some selling at the short end as investors reckoned they might have over-reacted the week before to the possibility of a cut in UK base rates in the near future. In generally quiet trading due to the absence of any significant UK economic data, gilts were largely unaffected by the strong move into German bunds during the week. One gilts specialist said: 'It reflects the strong support for gilts, particularly from non-UK institutions which see the securities as cheap.' Other strong buyers of gilts in recent weeks have included UK insurance companies, unit trusts and investment groups. Pension funds have been among the least enthusiastic buyers of the bonds. Among the other members of the Treasury's economic panel, Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs is less optimistic than Prof Minford about inflation. He is keen in particular to draw attention to the effects of the tax increases planned for next April which will push up prices for some goods and services. Mr Davies reckons the government's favoured measure of underlying inflation  -the year-on-year change in the retail prices index excluding mortgage payments - will push up close to the 4 per cent Treasury ceiling by the end of 1994. In the year to last month, this measure of underlying inflation is thought likely to move to 3 per cent, from 2.8 per cent in the year to May. The exact figure will be announced by the Central Statistical Office on Wednesday. The headline inflation rate - the retail price index by itself - is thought likely to come in at 1.5 per cent, after 1.3 per cent in the previous month. Attention will also focus on the change in unemployment last month, which is reckoned to have shown a generally flat trend after the surprise of four successive monthly drops in the jobless figure.</p>

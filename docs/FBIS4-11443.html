			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the  Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], has responded to  Ernesto Zedillo's, presidential candidate for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], invitation to debate. Cardenas  suggested 16 May for the debate.    [Begin Cardenas recording] I have accepted the debate  invitation made by the ruling party's presidential candidate.  Furthermore, I had asked for this debate and had expressed my  wishes to the PRI and PAN [National Action Party] candidates.  We are in contact now to establish the format for this first  debate. I think it should be held on 16 May. This may be a  debate between three candidates, but it is important that all  presidential candidates have a similar opportunity before 21  August. I hope Dr. Zedillo and I will have several  opportunities to present our ideas and proposals to the voters.    We want to overcome the political, financial, and social  crisis we are experiencing. The only solution is a democratic  transition. We demand a clean and democratic campaign.  Likewise, we demand clean and democratic elections so a truly  legitimate, clean, and democratic government will be elected.    I wish to reiterate my invitation to Dr. Zedillo so we can  meet several times before 21 August. I think these debates will  be the best way for voters to see what each candidate  represents, the interests the candidate represents, and what the  candidate can do for the voters and the country. I hope these  debates will contribute to your knowledge of the candidates and  that your vote will further our country's progress and  democracy. [end recording]    After hearing Cardenas' response, Ernesto Zedillo sent a  letter to the PRD candidate stating the following:    The people will decide objectively if our proposals are  contradictory in this campaign. I do not agree with your  attempts to disqualify other candidates registered by law, nor  can I agree with your attempt to underestimate other parties  that represent the ideological plurality and diversity of the  country's political life. I wish to reiterate that my invitation  said I trust that throughout the campaign there will be  opportunities to compare positions with all candidates from all  parties.</p>

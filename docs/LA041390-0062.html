			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN TALK;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY WINDOW ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS  </P> <P> 24 days left to register to vote before the May 7 deadline. 53 days left until  the June 5 primary election.  </P> <P> Gender: Now that a woman stands in serious contention for the governorship of  California, the buzz is all about gender and Dianne Feinstein and women in  politics.  </P> <P> Consider this one: Robert Shrum is the political TV advertising consultant who  just lost a brutal primary runoff campaign in Texas -- Shrum working for the  losing man, Jim Mattox, and against the winning woman, Ann Richards. Now Shrum  heads west where his client is John Van de Kamp up against, yes, Feinstein.  Your move, Bob.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Gender: If somebody had to wander right into the thorn bush over gender  and politics, it might as well be a representative of a macho American  stereotype. And so it is that the Peace Officers Research Organization endorsed  the Republican in the gubernatorial race, Sen. Pete Wilson. The group dismissed  Van de Kamp because he is personally opposed to the death penalty. And they  nixed Feinstein because: "I don't think the voters are ready for a woman  governor," Assn. President Larry Malmberg told the Sacramento Bee.  </P> <P> Next day, Malmberg was pulling his brogan out of his mouth: "That was my  personal opinion . . . I apologize. There was no discussion of this at the  board meeting. In fact, there was little or no discussion of the candidates at  all."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Down the tubes: Voter Revolt and its leader Harvey Rosenfield have pulled the  plug on a rather half-hearted effort to get an initiative on the November  ballot that would establish state-run auto insurance. Rosenfield, the author of  the 1988 auto insurance reform measure Proposition 103, said he will use  students this summer and try for the 1992 ballot. It is the second initiative  flop for Voter Revolt, following last fall's failure to get on the ballot a  measure that would raise property taxes for businesses while lowering them for  homeowners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking ahead: Voters still might get a chance to see Democrats Feinstein and  Van de Kamp debate face-to-face. Aides for both campaigns met quietly this week  and reached a debate agreement that they are taking back to their respective  bosses. A joint announcement by the campaigns is expected next week.  </P> <P> SOUNDINGS  </P> <P> From actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr., critiquing politicians:  </P> <P>  "There's too many weather vanes out there and not enough compasses."  </P> <P> From Jeff Greene, 21-year-old candidate for the Republican gubernatorial  nomination, on front-runner Pete Wilson:  </P> <P>  "He is truly a Democrat in elephant's clothing . . . Pete would like you to  think he's a conservative. But, hey, I know conservatives. Conservatives are  friends of mine. Pete Wilson, you are no conservative."  </P> <P> From The Green Party, in announcing a voter registration drive:  </P> <P>  "The Green Party will work toward a radical shift in California's political  debate by providing California voters with a new political alternative based on  ecology, social justice and grass-roots democracy."  </P> <P> EXIT LINE  </P> <P>  "I'm a Brown, but a different shade of Brown." -- -- Kathleen Brown,  Democratic candidate for state treasurer, explaining that she is differernt  from her father and brother, both former governors.  </P> <P> Where the Voters Are  </P> <P> The 5 Counties with the Biggest Voter Registration  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.33IN:2.44IN:2.00IN:2.22IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> County  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Registration  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Democrat  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Republican  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Other  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Los Angeles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,564,440  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 55%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 35%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Diego  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,206,971  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 39%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 47%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Orange  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,140137  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 34%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 55%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Clara  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 705,618  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 37%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alameda  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 667,707  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 63%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Counties That Added the Most Voters in the last 2 years  </P> <P> Los Angeles------171,997  </P> <P> San Diego--------113,065  </P> <P> Orange-----------102,607  </P> <P> San Bernardino----87,550  </P> <P> Riverside---------79,740  </P> <P> Source: The Secretary of State's Report of Registration for January 1990.  </P></p>

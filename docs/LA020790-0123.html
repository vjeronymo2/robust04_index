			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH MAY USE GOATS ON FIREBREAKS  </P> <P> City officials, tired of depending on human solutions to maintain firebreaks  necessary for protection of the community's pristine hillsides, voted Tuesday  to consider hiring up to 800 goats for the job.  </P> <P> "I'm very interested in saving the people of Laguna Beach thousands of  dollars," said Councilman Robert F. Gentry, "but we have to work through the  environmental questions."  </P> <P> If an agreement is reached with state and county officials on environmental  issues as well as sharing the costs, the goats would work on about 12 miles of  firebreaks around the perimeter of the seaside colony. The goats would be  helped by shepherds, dogs, horses and occasional hand crews.  </P> <P> "This is a natural program," goatherder Ken McWilliam said from his Los Angeles  station Tuesday afternoon. "It's an art and a science."  </P> <P> But Laguna Beach residents Tuesday night said they feared goats would ravage  the landscape, import lime disease, get loose or breed uncontrollably.  </P> <P> The council voted to study the environmental issues before making a final  decision. Because the land abuts county and state land, city officials want  those governments to share the costs.  </P> <P> McWilliam said he has had goatherds working in Topanga Canyon and in Northern  California. Laguna Beach Deputy Fire Chief Richard Dewberry visited the herder  and his goats last December. Now he wants them in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> "I was very impressed," Dewberry said. "He has so much experience that he can  do things (with goats) that I never knew could be done."  </P> <P> Dewberry said the goal is not to clear all growth but to "feather," or reduce  the amount of fuel for fires.  </P> <P> "Goats can do that when used properly," he said. "It's all a matter of timing."  </P> <P> McWilliam said his goats are bred for jobs like this.  </P> <P> "They can eat as much as a cow, but they don't pull out the roots," he said.  "They prune, rather than destroy. And they can eat a lot of poison plants that  would knock a domestic goat right out."  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach move toward goat recruitment is the latest step in a history  of efforts to maintain firebreaks that were originally constructed in the '50s  and '60s by California Department of Forestry and Orange County Fire Department  crews made up of jail inmates, Dewberry said before the meeting.  </P> <P> "In the early '60s, political and philosophical opposition to the breaks began  to mount," Dewberry said. "Awareness (about fire danger) wasn't as good as it  is today. People didn't like to look at firebreaks and inmate crews."  </P> <P> By 1981, only traces of the breaks remained, but by then people had again  rallied to the necessity of fire protection.  </P> <P> In 1982, state and county crews began to reinstall the breaks, Dewberry said.  Now, firebreaks exist from Emerald Canyon to Laguna Canyon, from the Alta  Laguna Park to Moulton Meadows and intermittently south to about the middle of  South Laguna.  </P> <P> Dewberry said those efforts are commendable but insufficient for the  never-ending job.  </P> <P> "The biggest problem is to do it more efficiently, more cost-effectively and to  get the job done," he said. "The inmate crews are great, but there are just not  enough to go around. And other crews are spread thin and are hard to keep in  one place for long-term projects because of demands from other services."  </P> <P> Goats are cheaper, too.  </P> <P> Dewberry said goats and related equipment cost from $600 to $800 an acre.  Figures from the California Department of Forestry cite a manpower cost of $800  to $1,800 per acre, he said.  </P> <P> "If this plan goes, we would hire McWilliam, who already has the goats," he  said. "People have been talking about using Catalina goats, but they have to be  trapped and transported. That presents a logistical problem."  </P> <P> Dewberry also said the wild Catalina goats could die being trapped. "The goats  we would use will be fenced at night for protection from wild animals," he  said. "We're looking at areas near breaks which would work for that."  </P> <P> Dewberry stressed that environmental concerns would be addressed.  </P> <P> "People actually see deer grazing better (than before the break) once the grass  grows in," he said. "And we will make them as attractive as possible and be  very sensitive to rare and endangered species of plants."  </P> <P> Dewberry said he has an appointment with state fire officials later this month  to discuss the proposal.  </P></p>

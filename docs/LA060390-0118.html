			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: POINT MUGU;  </P> <P> NAVAL AIR STATION COMMANDER NAMED  </P> <P> A new commanding officer has been appointed to run Point Mugu Naval Air  Station.  </P> <P> Capt. Paul J. Valovich assumed command of the station last week.  </P> <P> He had been vice commander and deputy laboratory director of the Naval Weapons  Center at China Lake since 1986.  </P> <P> In his new position, Valovich is responsible for a huge spectrum of station  activities, said Lt. Commander Gene Okamoto.  </P> <P> "It's like a small city here, and he's sort of like the city manager or the  mayor," Okamoto said.  </P> <P> Valovich is responsible for the public works, housing, supply, security,  recreation and administration departments, as well for aircraft maintenance and  the chapel on base.  </P> <P> Valovich, a native of Charleroi, Pa., graduated in 1965 from Purdue  University's Naval ROTC program with a degree in mechanical engineering. In  1973, he received a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from the Naval  Postgraduate School in Monterey. Valovich is also a graduate of the Navy  Fighter Weapons School, and flew more than 200 combat missions in Southeast  Asia.  </P> <P> Valovich has no authority over the Pacific Missile Test Center, which is run by  Rear Adm. George H. Strohshal, and located at the Point Mugu Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> "PMTC is like a renter on the base," Okamoto said, terming the arrangement  between PMTC and the Naval Air Station "tenant command."

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: Apple share price falls to lowest since October 1990 APPLE Computer's share price plunged Dollars 7 1/2 by noon yesterday and slipped a further Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 27 1/2 , its lowest since October 1990. The fall followed disclosure of the personal computer pioneer's worst quarterly losses and signs that sales of its Macintosh computers are slowing. Apple reported third-quarter losses of Dollars 188m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, after the market closed on Thursday. The losses included a Dollars 321m pre-tax charge - much higher than analysts had expected - to cover the costs of 2,500 job cuts announced last week. Analysts were also shocked by Apple's weak operating results. Excluding the restructuring charge, pre-tax profits slumped to Dollars 17m, from Dollars 212m in the same quarter last year. Revenues of Dollars 1.86bn also failed to meet analysts' expectations of around Dollars 2bn. The results were the worst in the history of the company, which was hatched in a Silicon Valley garage in 1976 and went public four years later to become one of the most influential forces in personal computing. Apple said shipments of its Macintosh PCs increased by 20 per cent in volume in the quarter, but revenues rose only 7 per cent. Apple has been forced repeatedly to cut Macintosh prices as it struggles to maintain market share. While expressing confidence that Apple could quickly return to profitability, Mr Michael Spindler, Apple's new chief executive, warned the company 'must significantly - and permanently  - lower our cost of doing business'. Mr Spindler replaced John Sculley as chief executive last month. He had previously been Apple president. Mr Sculley remains chairman of the company in charge of strategic alliances. In spite of denials by the company, Mr Sculley is widely rumoured to be planning to leave the company. He is currently on sabbatical. Yesterday several Wall Street analysts downgraded their recommendations on Apple's stock and revised projections for future earnings. They expressed concerns that additional restructuring charges may be needed.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SHOOTINGS IN LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> I read with great interest your editorial "When Should a Cop Shoot?" (Feb. 18).  The editorial noted that there was a major difference between New York and Los  Angeles police officers in that Los Angeles police officers were twice as  likely to use deadly force as New York police officers.  </P> <P> As a person who was a practicing attorney in both New York City and Los Angeles  County, the reason for such disparity is easy to understand. In New York City,  the minority groups have political clout; here in Los Angeles they do not. And  most of the deadly force used by police in Los Angeles is in the minority  communities.  </P> <P> Until the minorities have enough political "juice" to enable them to have  meaningful input as to the selection of a chief of police or the sheriff of the  county, the "restrained response" that you call for from law enforcement  leaders will not arrive very quickly.  </P> <P> BURTON BACH  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The South Korean puppets have committed a grave  military provocation inside the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ].    The South Korean puppets on 8 May committed a grave military  provocation by deploying armored cars into the DMZ south of  Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, Kangwon Province in the eastern section  of the front line.    On the same day at around 1855, the puppets mobilized  armored  cars from the direction of Sowha-myon, Imje County of South  Korea's Kangwon Province to the DMZ near the Military  Demarcation Line and assumed a firing posture aimed at our side.    Prior to this, the puppets, on 1, 3, and 4 May deployed  recoilless guns and large-caliber machine guns to the DMZ  southeast of Kijon-ri, Changpung County, in the western section  of the front line and set up a position.    On 5 May, they ran madly about by firing some 70  large-caliber machine gun bullets from the same position.    In the meantime, at around 1115 on 6 May, hundreds of puppet  Army bandits armed with large-caliber machine guns and automatic  weapons sneaked into the DMZ south of Peak No. 1211 in the  eastern section of the front line, frantically staged a war  exercise for a Northward invasion in broad daylight, which  extremely irritated us.    In addition, the South Korean puppets, at around 0846 on 2  May, committed a hostile act of dragging some 10 vehicles loaded  with hundreds of heavily armed bandits into the DMZ south of  Mabang-ri, Cholwon County, Kangwon Province, in the central  section of the front line.    From 1 to 8 May, the number of armed bandits brought in to  build military facilities and positions inside the DMZ and to  conduct war exercises reached approximately 6,400.    The recent arms buildup -- timed to coincide with the South  Korean puppets' war exercises for a Northward invasion staged  with the U.S. imperialists under various titles by mobilizing  the latest equipment of mass destruction -- is a deliberate and  premeditated military provocative act designed to drive the  situation surrounding the Military Demarcation Line to a  dangerous phase.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should  squarely see the touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula  due to the rascals' war provocative commotions and should not  act recklessly.</p>

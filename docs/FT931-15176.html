			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: Romances with ignition trouble - Cinema SOFT TOP, HARD SHOULDER (15) Stephan Schwartz MAN TROUBLE (15) Bob Rafelson SINGLES (12) Cameron Crowe SARAFINA] (15) Darrell James Roodt Spring is here, give or take two months, and it is time to fall in love. As this week's movies show, anyone can do it anywhere. Dog trainers do it, sopranos do it. Scotsmen surrounded by cattle do it; even grunge rockers in Seattle do it. You can do it at home or at work. You can even drive deep into the country to do it, so long as your car starts. Or your movie, as the week's first love entry demonstrates. A special branch of the AA should be on 24-hour duty to rescue British road movies from breakdown or ignition failure. But where exactly should they attach the jump leads in Soft Top, Hard Shoulder - to the first item or the second? The soft top belongs to Peter Capaldi as the pea-brained hero, scion of an Italian-extracted Scottish ice cream firm who is motoring from London to Glasgow for Dad's 60th birthday and (tsk, tsk, mercenary fellow) a promised inheritance. The hard shoulder belongs to Elaine Collins as the Scots girl he picks up en route in his battered sky-blue Triumph. To cry on this icy gamine's shoulder is to weep on a glacial moraine. At least until she begins to melt a little - but there, we are giving away the story. Shot on a wide screen without matching panache in the use of colour or lighting (cameraman Henry Braham, director Stefan Schwartz) the film seems at first an unwieldy gas-guzzler with seen-better-days bodywork. But do not run away: it is also, after a short struggle, charming. As England melts into Scotland and the film gets over its starting troubles (Frances Barber as a caricature publisher, too much let's-set-up-the-story), the plot turns into a modern-dress 39 Steps: two likeable oddballs handcuffed together by fate while even odder balls come out of the scenery. I especially relished the old widower who runs a bed and breakfast and shows the newcomers round with a bad-news pronouncement on every stair: 'My wife choked on a Penguin . . . My mother came here to die . . .' Capaldi, who also screenwrote, is winning beanpole with a doleful line in Italo-Scottish epigrams. And Collins, who would vanquish all rivals in a Frances De La Tour lookalike contest, is tartly funny as the un-gentler sex. Man Trouble is another odd-couple romance with ignition trouble. But this time the engine coughs impotently for the whole 100 minutes. The premise of Carole Eastman's screenplay - good heavens, did she once write Five Easy Pieces? - is straight out of a game of Consequences. Guard-dog trainer Jack Nicholson meets opera singer Ellen Barkin in sun-kissed Los Angeles. He says to her (in essence), Do you want to rent a dog? She says to him (in essence), Thank you, I'll take the German Shepherd and I think I'm falling in love with you. The consequence is . . . Well, the consequence is the movie. Bob Rafelson - good heavens, did he once direct Five Easy Pieces? - urges his stars to make funny faces as their vehicle stutters through farce, romance, an all-sorts supporting cast (Beverly d'Angelo as Barkin's kidnapped sister, Harry Dean Stanton as nutty crook) and much covert sermonising about gender politics and sexual role-playing. In short - but if only it were - a mess. Seattle, as you will know if you have been there, is a major centre of Grunge Rock. So it is no wonder that grunge rocker Matt Dillon, in the film Singles, is adored by blonde single girl Bridget Fonda, whose friend and neighbour is handsome Campbell Scott, who has taken a shine to emotionally bruised chance encounter Kyra Sedgwick, who has been loved and left by an on-the-make Spaniard. And now, as the saying goes, read on. As the music track fills with Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and Soundgarden (never heard of any of them but grunge rock friends tell me they are big), writer-director Cameron Crowe choreographs this fast-growing daisy chain of amours. Crowe's first feature Say Anything was a riotously charming comedy about love across the American caste system. Poor boy John Cusack met rich girl Ione Sky and the twain had many a mishap trying to bridge the chasm between Ivy League and Poverty Row. But Singles is too many plots competing for one charm franchise. Crowe runs from one romance to the other like a conjuror with his spinning plates, but the only charisma on offer is of the 'Keep smiling at all costs' kind. Signs of strain are evident in the over-mathematical matchmaking and the winsome asides-to-camera. (Film-makers should give up the idea that the same matey rapport can exist between a movie character and his audience as between their live theatre equivalents.) However I liked the safe sex party that enjoins guests to 'Come dressed as your favourite contraceptive.' And please note director Tim 'Batman' Burton's piquant cameo as a dating agency video-maker dubbed 'the new Martin Scorsese.' Sarafina] is the one film of the week in which no one 'meets cute'. But that is no commendation. The Soweto-set South African musical has stepped off the stage into the quicksand of location shooting. The sinking feeling is instantly recognisable. Massed singalongs and fervent knees-ups by the black schoolchildren who are both chorus and main characters - including pretty, progressively politicised Sarafina (Leleti Khumalo) - erupt all over the township and surrounding desert. Yet these big musical scenes always seem to be falling out of frame, upscreened by the vaster sky and heat-shimmering scrubland. Whoopi Goldberg throws herself wholeheartedly into the mayhem, as the schoolteacher for whom South African history began with the first black man, not the first over-celebrated white man. (Cue appropriate classroom scene with no yawning children.) A machine-gun behind her fridge at home signals Whoopi's guerrilla sympathies and connections, but also telegraphs her early demise at police hands. After that it is songs and torture scenes in roughly equal measure. Director Darrell James Roodt, adapting the hit show by Mbongeni Ngema (of Woza Albert), has no idea how to unify its tone for the screen; or, if unity is impossible, how to make the razzmatazz-versus-verismo contrast seem pointful rather than accidental. When artifice and reality are passed simultaneously before the camera lens, its eye will always focus sharply on the second, turning the first into a frothy blur. So here. Sarafina] the fledgling docudrama kicks the life out of Sarafina] the would-be musical. The last film of the week should have been Man Bites Dog. But I never got there. Stuck between Clapham South and Clapham North for twenty minutes - to a Trappist silence from London Transport - I knew all hope of seeing the week's most curious-sounding film was draining away. I shall review it, LT willing, next Thursday.</p>

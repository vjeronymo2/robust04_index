			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from roundup of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ITAR-TASS </F> reports: "`Niva' With Altay Engine"]    [Text] The "Rostselmash" plant has completed the  readjustment of production for the output of "Niva" grain  harvesting combines with engines from the Barnaul "Altaydizel"  joint-stock company.    Previously the "Niva" was produced only with engines from  the  Kharkov "Hammer and Sickle" plant. But the Ukrainian enterprise  has shown itself to be a not entirely reliable partner and the  complication of tax procedures when crossing the border between  Russia and Ukraine has aggravated the problem.</p>

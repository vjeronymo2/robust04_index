			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Administrative `By-Pass' Will Be a Way Out of </F> the `Impotent Votes'" Problem; part two of two-part editorial  entitled "Let Us Think About Politics and Governance at This  Time of Transition"]    [Text] Public distrust in politics can be called public  distrust in policies. Politicians and bureaucrats are not fully  aware of this.    The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has been trying to revive the  idea of raising the consumption tax rate after its idea of  instituting the national welfare tax was scrapped. Has the  ministry even once asked the general public about what they were  thinking in regards to such an idea? Nor will the public  distrust of this out-of-the-blue idea of a "7-percent rate" [for  the consumption tax] dissolve just because the government Tax  Commission has started to review the matter. Everybody knows  that the Tax Commission, as all commissions are, is only a  puppet.    The MOF went out all out to work on Diet members of the  ruling and opposition parties. They "sought understanding" from  influential businessmen as well. When told that raising public  utilities charges would offset the effect of the [income] tax  reductions, Tadashi Ogawa, director of the MOF Tax Bureau,  countered: "All you have to do is not ride taxis anymore."    We were shocked by such dogmatism. Can they not see anything  beyond political interests?    Let us view politicians and the administration as  "intelligence models." Both politicians and the administration  are media that reflect the public will on policy matters -- the  politicians do so through elections and the administration  through services they provide.  <H5>  Gap That Comes by Adopting a Party-Oriented System </H5>   The parliamentary democracy system cannot but be an  incomplete system. That is because it cannot reflect promptly  enough the needs of the constantly changing economic society.  If the single-seat district system becomes a reality, there  will be many more impotent votes [shihyo--votes for the losing  candidate] than before, thus further widening the gap [between  the parliament's actions and actual needs].    In a two-party system, the parties need to present all of  their policies -- ranging from those concerning welfare to  national security -- in one package. The voters have no choice  but to choose from the given packages, and are given no chance  to vote on individual policy issues, such as the consumption  tax. But in a complicated and fast-changing economic society,  it is close to impossible to simply say yes or no to policy  packages presented by political parties. The party-oriented  system can catch the public will only in "rough image scanning  lines," and frustrations from "impotent votes" are bound to  develop.    Underneath the existing mood of political distrust  represented in the existence of so many parties are the  politicians' lack of ability to formulate policies, the  structural problem of the politicians scrounging for interests,  and the disappointment of the voters, who voted for major  parties, about becoming "impotent votes."    On the other hand, the administration does not have  organizations to absorb private-sector needs other than  bureaucrat-elected review councils and public hearings. The  inevitable consequence of such a closed system is that the  bureaucrats get themselves deeply involved in politics by  manipulating to get their own views adopted [by the review  councils and public hearings].    Last fall, General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito  [Japan  Renewal Party] came up with a concept of inaugurating  parliamentary deputy minister posts. No doubt, the situation of  the politicians' failing to do their homework and having to  depend on parliamentary specialists to answer questions in the  Diet is regrettable. On the other hand, Ozawa's concept will  enable the politicians to get too close to more political  interests, while failing to offer any way of minimizing the  "impotent votes" issue. It would be too simple-minded if one  believed a large number of politicians -- just because they are  armed with petitions from their constituencies -- represent the  public will in reality.    An alternative to that is to create a by-pass that can  minimize the "impotent votes" issue not on the political side  but on the administrative side.    Since the existing Constitution allows national referendums  to be conducted only on a Constitutional amendment and on  national review of the Supreme Court; it does not allow the  referendum to be conducted on individual policy matters, it will  not be easy to expect the legislature to go all out for a  national referendum on policy matters.    But we must recall that, testifying before the House of  Representatives Budget Committee on 3 February 1978, Sanada,  then Cabinet Legislation Bureau director, said: "I do no think  instituting a system whereby the Diet can conduct national  referendums to determine the general will of the people on  individual matters and to use it in reference to the Diet's  deliberations on bills would constitute a violation of the  Constitution."    (Then) Prime Minister Fukuda, who spoke after him, then  stated: "Public opinion surveys conducted under Diet initiative  can be useful." We can find a model for the by-pass in this  statement.    The "green papers" system that made its debut in the United  Kingdom in 1967 is worth considering as well. The UK House of  Representatives proceedings define the green papers as "written  government documents concerning proposals to be presented to the  people of the nation in quest of discussions -- except the  matters of policy already decided on."    In the UK, the government policy outlines are presented to  Parliament in the form of white papers, and legislative bills  are formulated based on these white papers. But when the  bureaucrats decide it is necessary to ask for views of the  public, green papers are prepared and issued as reference  materials before formulation of the white papers. The people  who prepare the green papers are groups of officials concerned  from ministries and agencies. Hundreds of organizations  concerned, intellectuals, and the general public are asked to  comment on the green papers, and then the green papers' contents  are revised to reflect these views. Once that is done, the  contents are incorporated into the white papers.    It will not be easy for Japan to jump to the green papers  system that was born in the custom law system of the UK. But  Japan should accept and adopt the function of the green papers,  which is aimed at having the public will absorbed in new  policies of the matters that have much to do with the people's  lives -- for instance, those on welfare and tax.    Some people are cautious about the national referendum  system. They assert it is "a direct democratic system which  jumps over the indirect, parliamentary democracy system." But  the green papers system is an "indirect democratic system on  policies" that supplements Diet efforts for deliberations; nor  does it make light of the legislature.  <H5>  Public Opinion System Being Formed </H5>   Suppose Japan decides to adopt a by-pass system. In what  manner should it operate?    It is unrealistic to ask the general public on all policy  matters. Hence, its application should be limited to those  matters that concern the lives of all the people, but over which  interests could differ -- such as those on the consumption tax  or pensions.    Second, the subject matters must be those for which policies  are yet in the process of being formulated. If the people are  to review draft policy matters already in the parliament as  legislative bills, the parliament will lose the reason for its  existence. If the system serves the purpose of a "public  opinion survey" to collect information necessary in formulating  policies, that should be good enough.    The administration should make analysis and predictions as  detailed as done in formulating the green papers, and should  present results of its review, offering a number of specific  possible policies to choose from. It should never do such a  thing as presenting a proposal to increase a tax, but hiding the  increase rate it seeks from the public.    The existing government office think tanks, closed as they  are, are busy day and night preparing materials to be used in  review councils and drawing up answers to be used in Diet  interpellations. If the think tanks can use more of their time  in coming up with alternative policies that are convincing to  the people, the organizations can become more "open  organizations" indeed. The surveys need not cover all the  eligible voters. If they are of enough scale to eliminate the  deviation prone in statistics, that should be good enough, even  though a some sort of braking system may be necessary. The  results of the surveys may be only for information, but the  politicians cannot ignore such results.    Distance between policies and the public will is causing the  "closed society" to be closed even more. If we cannot expect  the politicians to reform themselves, there is no choice but to  open up the shell of the administration, and put a pipe of the  public will through it.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Complications of a relief plan for Lloyd's Names and a need for better marketing (1) Sir, In his profile of David Rowland as chairman of the Lloyd's Task Force Report (January 18), Richard Lapper stated that the weakness of the report is that it does not tackle the problem of the crippling losses of those Names affected by the disastrous business conditions of the late 1980s. Let it be said from the outset that the Association of Lloyd's Members has every sympathy with such Names and has given them practical assistance in forming action groups. The reality of the situation is that the only way to relieve Names of these losses is for other Names to assume them, either indirectly by way of the central fund or because Lloyd's directs that they should be reapportioned by some process of mutualisation (this assumes we are not dealing with fraud as in the case of PCW). This can only be done by obtaining the prior consent of members without risking litigation on their behalf. In the current climate, with most Names facing losses for the 1989 year of account, how forthcoming would that consent be? A recent Mori poll revealed that 62 per cent of those polled were likely to reject mutualisation to help fellow Names. When dealing with the strengthening of the capital base, the Task Force Report spells out the reasons why that could not be implemented retrospectively to help Names in distress. It would represent a fundamental change to the basis on which Names agreed to participate at Lloyd's and would be open to legal challenge. Furthermore, if the scheme was to be introduced retrospectively, those Names would also have to be given the chance to resign and this might weaken the capital base more conclusively.

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Fierce bids as Ukraine goes under hammer IRYNA IASMYSKA is one of Ukraine's new entrepreneurs. Iryna, 30, now owns the general store she used to run, along with six of her co-workers. They bought it at the weekend in the first of Ukraine's privatisation auctions. In all, 17 small restaurants, shops and businesses were sold at the auction in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov. The sale could presage rapid privatisation of the rest of the economy, 94 per cent of which is still owned by the state. Another buyer is Oleh Horbatiuk, a bulky, 42-year-old businessman. He bought a grocery shop for 28m coupons, and a textiles factory for 20m coupons. Mr Horbatiuk once served time in a Siberian prison for illegally trading in hard currency. 'I came out of jail and I became a capitalist,' Mr Horbatiuk cheerfully explained. Nine of the 17 enterprises sold in Lvov went to workers who used their 30 per cent discount off the bid price and the right to make a 30 per cent downpayment and pay the rest over a year. Opening the auction, Mr Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary commission on economic reform, said: 'With the bang of this hammer, I declare the beginning of mass privatisation in Ukraine.' Iryna and her colleagues bid 48m coupons (the equivalent of Pounds 13,200) for the store, although they will get their 30 per cent discount. They had hoped to buy the store more cheaply, but bidding was fierce enough to raise 784m coupons in all, more than 100 times the book value of the businesses on sale. 'Because of an auction, we had to pay 48m coupons (up from a book value of 150,000 coupons),' said Iryna. 'Until we pay off this debt, I think I will earn less as an owner than I did as a state manager.' But Iryna, who won a bottle of champagne as the first successful bidder, believes the store is a going concern. 'I have a very big task before me, but I know I will succeed. There is such a great shortage of everything in our country that I am confident we will be able to sell everything that we offer our customers.' Lvov municipal officials said they hoped this weekend's auction would become a twice-monthly or even weekly event in their city, which has 4,000 businesses available for privatisation. The sale, run with the help of the International Finance Corporation, the privatisation arm of the World Bank, is the strongest indicator yet that the government of prime minister Leonid Kuchma is committed to market reform. Mr Vadym Vasyliev, deputy head of the State Property Fund, responsible for privatisation, said he hoped for similar auctions in all of Ukraine's regional centres by the end of March. Several large-scale projects are in the pipeline, including the transformation of an association of 10 meat processing plants in Odessa into an open joint stock company under the IFC's auspices, and privatisation of the state river shipping company, Ukrichflot, with advice from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. But there are still obstacles: many businesses are being run under lease between workers and the government. There is also opposition from bureaucrats, who fear erosion of their power, and many workers' collectives are worried about losing jobs under privatisation.</p>

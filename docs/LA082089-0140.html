			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: WARNING STICKERS SEEM TO HYPE ALBUMS' APPEAL  </P> <P> Being banned in Boston never hurt a book's chances of making the best-seller  lists, right? It just piques people's interest by making the book seem  forbidden.  </P> <P> Some music retailers are saying that the same is true of record albums that  carry parental advisory stickers. Under pressure from the Parents' Music  Resource Center, most major record companies agreed two years ago to put  warning stickers on albums with explicit lyrics.  </P> <P> But instead of warning people off, the stickers are often red flags  </P> <P> signaling to customers that the album is racy and provocative.  </P> <P> The top new entries on Billboard magazine's pop album chart for the past two  weeks have carried stickers warning of explicit lyrics. Both are rap albums:  the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique" and the D.O.C.'s " No One Can Do It  Better."  </P> <P> "It's very possible that by stickering, you attract attention and cause a  frenzy to get the album," said Gary Ross, executive vice president at the  700-store Musicland chain, based in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Mitch Perliss, director of purchasing for the 50-store Music Plus chain, agreed  that stickering doesn't inhibit sales. "It probably even helps a little bit  because it adds a little titillation," he said.  </P> <P> But not all the attention the stickers attract is positive. Some department  stores, including Target and K mart, refuse to stock stickered albums. As a  result, record companies have to either forfeit those sales or come up with  alternate versions of albums with the offending language deleted.  </P> <P> At stores carrying both versions, it's no contest -- and really no surprise --  which one sells better: the stickered versions.  </P> <P> Chuck Lee, director of music buying for the 240-store Wherehouse chain, said  that the "street version" of LL Cool J's recent Top 10 album, "Walking Like a  Panther," has outsold the cleaned-up "radio version" by a margin of 10 to 1.  </P> <P> "We buy both and make both available, but our customer is telling us they like  the hard-core version better," Lee said.  </P> <P> Jerry Heller, an executive at Ruthless Records, which released the D.O.C.  album, agreed that customer response is far greater to the original, stickered  albums than to the toned-down versions. He based that conclusion on sales last  spring of N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton" and Eazy-E's "Eazy Does It."  </P> <P> "We've gotten two negative calls from parents who bought albums not knowing  that they had explicit lyrics and I've gotten literally hundreds of complaint  calls from kids who have gotten the watered-down version thinking it was the  real thing," Heller said.  </P> <P> "I've got to believe there are more people out there that want the regular  version than a clean version."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 INDICTED FOR ALLEGED SCHEME TO BUY 11 S&amp;LS;  </P> <P> AIDE TO FORMER SENATOR AND 2 BUSINESSMEN ACCUSED OF BRIBERY, CONSPIRACY,  RACKETEERING  </P> <P> Glen N. Mauldin, administrative assistant to former Sen. Chic Hecht (R-Nev.),  has been indicted in Texas along with two businessmen on charges of bribery,  conspiracy and racketeering in an alleged scheme to acquire 11 savings and loan  institutions, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Mauldin, who denied any wrongdoing, was named in a 22-count federal indictment  unsealed in San Antonio that also charged the defendants with seeking to use  Hecht's office to further their investment plans on the island of Grenada.  </P> <P> Ray Jahn, an assistant U.S. attorney, said Mauldin, Washington lobbyist Vincent  P. Lachelli and Houston businessman Darrell A. Tomblin were charged with  corruptly promising Mauldin a 10% interest in their venture in return for his  assistance in getting the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to approve acquisition  by Tomblin's group of 11 thrifts in Texas and other states that were "in poor  economic condition."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hecht Not Charged  </P> <P> The plans did not reach completion, authorities said, and none of the  institutions was actually acquired. The identity of only one of them was  disclosed -- Suburban Savings &amp; Loan of San Antonio.  </P> <P> A fourth defendant, financial consultant William Murray Abroms of New Orleans,  was charged with five counts of perjury on grounds he lied to grand jurors  about the activities of the other three men.  </P> <P> Abroms was identified as a longtime associate of Tomblin.  </P> <P> Helen Eversberg, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas, said Hecht  "is not charged in the indictment and has cooperated with the FBI."  </P> <P> Hecht, defeated in his Senate race last fall, has been named by President Bush  as ambassador to the Bahamas.  </P> <P> Mauldin, aside from serving as Hecht's administrative assistant, also was  campaign treasurer of Hecht's reelection committee, the indictment said.  </P> <P> Eversberg said Tomblin, who was also charged with extorting $250,000 from  Suburban Savings of San Antonio, "made an application for control of this  savings institution and others, and Mr. Mauldin was going to use his influence  with the bank board to help accomplish it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Year-Long Investigation  </P> <P> The offenses charged in the indictment occurred between November, 1987, and  November, 1988, Jahn said.  </P> <P> Authorities said the indictments follow a year-long investigation by FBI  agents, federal prosecutors in San Antonio and Tampa, Fla., and attorneys from  the Justice Department's public integrity section in Washington.  </P> <P> Mauldin, Lachelli and Tomblin were also charged in the indictment with seeking  to engage in the petroleum and fishing business on the island of Grenada  through the use of "corruptly obtained political influence."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grenadan Officials Helped  </P> <P> According to the indictment, the defendants "would and did utilize the  corruptly obtained influence of the office of a United States senator to obtain  concessions from the government of Grenada, financing in the form of loans and  grants and the intervention of various agencies of the United States . . . to  further the defendants' business plans."  </P> <P> The indictment said Mauldin obtained a letter on Hecht's official stationery  "introducing the conspirators to the prime minister of Grenada and endorsing  their business plans."  </P> <P> Eversberg said Grenadan officials assisted the FBI in bringing this aspect of  the investigation "to its logical conclusion."  </P></p>

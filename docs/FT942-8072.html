			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Loan for Russian banking sector The World Bank and the European bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will provide the bulk of a Dollars 390m (Pounds 260m) loan to build up a core group of 30 to 40 Russian commercial banks capable of acting as a catalyst for wider development of the banking sector. The aim is to improve the quality of banking services and enable the core group to form the basis of a private clearing bank system. Technical and other assistance will also be provided to help them qualify as 'on-lenders' of World Bank and other international credit lines. The World Bank, whose board approved its 17-year loan for Dollars 200m of the total, said the loan would promote 'twinning' with western banks and modernise and standardise management and information systems. But it would also be used to train central bank inspectors and create early warning systems to detect problem banks. The World Bank also approved a Dollars 175m loan to support private enterprise in Romania, of which Dollars 102m will finance projects to raise the competitiveness of industrial exporters and Dollars 70m for export finance. Loans will be channelled through five selected Romanian banks.</p>

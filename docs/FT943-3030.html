			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Media chief to face probe Mr Jean-Louis Dutaret, head of a state media holding company, has been detained for questioning by a judge investigating the possibility of a link between the financing by water company Lyonnaise des Eaux of newspapers supporting Mr Alain Carignon's re-election as mayor of Grenoble and the fact that this company subsequently won a contract to run Grenoble's water service. Mr Dutaret, the head of Sofirad, which manages various state holdings in broadcasting stations including Radio Monte Carlo, was a close aide to Mr Carignon, who resigned in July from the post of communications minister to contest charges of receiving the proceeds of a corporate fraud.</p>

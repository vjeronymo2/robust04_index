			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Slower US growth eases economy fears New signals of slowing economic activity yesterday took the edge off remaining fears that the US economy might be growing at an unsustainable pace. The Commerce Department reported that disposable personal incomes fell by 0.2 per cent in April, while spending on personal consumption fell by 0.1 per cent. Higher wages and salaries raised total personal income by 0.4 per cent, a more modest gain than in recent months, but increased tax payments as last year's budget took effect on higher income taxpayers depressed disposable income. At the same time, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell by 7 per cent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 683,000 homes, while consumer confidence dipped sharply, according to the Conference Board's May index. 'What we are seeing is that the economy was growing faster than could be internally sustained, particularly in the consumer sector, and now it is slowing to a pace which is more sustainable,' said Mr Bruce Steinberg, manager of macro-economic analysis at Merrill Lynch, the US stockbroker. Yesterday's data followed an unexpected upwards revision on Friday in the Commerce Department's estimate of growth in the first quarter, to an annualised rate of 3 per cent. Although the US economy is expected to show stronger growth in the second quarter than in the first, as the country shakes off the frosts of January and February, it is also starting to feel the effects of a series of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board. April's drop in home sales showed the impact of rising interest rates on the construction sector, even before the Fed's most recent half percentage point rise two weeks ago. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which dropped to 87.6 in May from 92.1 in April, also appears to reflect a reaction to higher interest rates. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, came under fire last week from senior Democratic senators who complained that he was stamping out the recovery by raising interest rates long before there were any real signs of inflation. But most private sector economists still see a strong pace of growth, and will be looking more closely at today's purchasing managers' index and Friday's report on employment in May than at yesterday's signals of slowdown. 'We are slowing from a 5 per cent pace of growth at the end of last year, and I think there is still some ambiguity over whether we are slowing to a little under 3 per cent or a little under 4 per cent. Our view is that the slowdown is only gradual,' said Mr Robert Mellman of JP Morgan, the New York bank, which is forecasting a 6 per cent growth rate in the second quarter, slowing to a rate of 3.5 per cent by the end of the year.</p>

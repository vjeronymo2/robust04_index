			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kang Xinwen (1660 2450 2429] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 21 May (XINHUA) -- In an interview with  Chinese reporters around noon today, Zhu Xun, member of the  Standing Committee and secretary general of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] who is accompanying Li Ruihuan during his  tour of five European nations, briefed reporters on Chairman  Li's visit and answered their questions.    [Reporter] Secretary General Zhu, would you please give an  overall account of Chairman's Li tour of the four Nordic nations  and Belgium?    [Zhu Xun] At the invitation of the Governments of Finland,  Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and the Belgian Senate and Chamber  of Representatives, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee, made an official goodwill visits to these five  nations from 2 to 21 May. During the tour, Chairman Li met  leaders of the five nations; had extensive exchanges with people  from all walks of life in the five nations; visited some  industrial, agricultural, transportation, and energy facilities,  enterprises, schools; received representatives of Overseas  Chinese communities, foreign nationals of Chinese descent, and  Chinese students studying abroad; and called on the personnel of  Chinese embassies in the five nations. Chairman Li was also  invited to speak in Sweden and Belgium on China's reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive and its foreign policy.  Governments and parliaments of the five nations took Chairman  Li's visits seriously and accorded him warm and friendly  receptions. The visits achieved the goal of enhancing  understanding, expanding exchanges, and increasing friendship  and cooperation. They were a complete success.    [Reporter] Would you please tell us more about the  achievements of the visits?    [Zhu Xun] Chairman Li's visits are the first to Western and  Northern Europe by a chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.  They represent a major step on the part of the CPPCC toward  expanding international exchanges and cooperation. The  achievements are numerous, and the three major ones are as  follows:    First, mutual understanding and friendship between China and  the five nations were enhanced. Chairman Li had frank and  friendly [tan cheng you hao 0982 6134 0645 1170] exchanges of  views with leaders of the five nations on further expanding  bilateral relations and on some major current international  issues, reaching a common understanding with them on many of the  issues. Chairman Li briefed them on China's current economic  situation. While fully affirming the progress China has made,  he pointed out the difficulties and complexities involved in  carrying out socialist modernization in a big country like  China, stressing the need to keep a consistent grip on the  intensity of reform, the speed of development, and the degree of  stability and to balance the relations between reform,  development, and stability. He told them that China is  contributing to world peace and progress with its endeavors for  stability and development. All the leaders of the five nations  spoke highly of the tremendous achievements China has made in  economic construction, reform, and opening up and expressed  understanding of the measures the Chinese Government has taken  to preserve social stability. Paying serious attention to  China's growing role and influence in international affairs,  they said that they wished to expand exchanges and dialogues and  continue developing economic cooperation and trade with China.  Addressing issues on human rights and Tibet that were raised by  the other parties in one form or another, Chairman Li gave a  systematic account of China's basic stance on human rights and  reaffirmed China's solemn stand on Tibet.    Second, we deepened our understanding of the five nations'  economic and social conditions. During his tour, Chairman Li  specifically observed the political, economic, and social  conditions of the five nations. There is much in their methods  in science and technology, education, economic management, and  other areas that we can make use of in implementing  modernization and establishing a socialist market economic  system.    Third, we expanded the CPPCC's influence. The five nations  knew very little about the CPPCC. On many occasions during the  visits, Chairman Li briefed leaders of the five nations on the  people's congress system and the system of multiparty  cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of  the CPC, which make up the basic forms of China's socialist  democracy. In addition to the ruling CPC, China has eight  democratic parties which participate in state and government  affairs. They cooperate closely with the CPC on one hand and  supervise one another on the other. The CPPCC serves as a major  organization for implementing the system of multiparty  cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of  the CPC. This has enabled the five nations and the  international community at large to have a better understanding  of the political construction of China's socialist democracy,  the characteristics and strong points of the CPPCC -- an  organization unlike either China's people's congress or the  parliament of the West -- and China's political party system.    [Reporter] What are your impressions of Chairman Li's  successful visits?    [Zhu Xun] As cultural traditions, social systems, ideology  differ from country to country, it is inevitable that nations  will have differences on some issues. Frequent exchange of  visits and contacts between senior leaders and dialogue based on  mutual respect will help us seek common ground while putting  aside differences, enhance mutual understanding, dispel  misunderstandings, and reach an understanding.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: The CPPCC should take initiative  and make vigorous efforts in promoting international friendly  exchanges. These visits have demonstrated the importance of  Comrade Xiaoping's theory. The CPPCC, being both an official  and nonofficial organization, has a special role to play in  China's international exchanges. In the past, the CPPCC made  major contributions in developing China's friendship and  cooperation with people of the world and in creating a good  international image for China. In the future, it should take  full advantage of its unequaled superior features in promoting  international cooperation and exchanges and in creating a  favorable international environment for China's economic  development.    Accompanying Chairman Li on his tour were officials of the  democratic parties and local CPPCC committees and other public  figures. This reflects how broadly represented the CPPCC is.  During the visits, these comrades did a great deal of useful  work with good results. Their inclusion in the visits itself  demonstrates the special features of the political construction  of China's socialist democracy. The CPPCC should review  experience in this regard in its dealings with foreign nationals  or organizations in the future.</p>

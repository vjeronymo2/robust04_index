			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (12): Calmer waters of national consensus - The Reconstruction and Development Programme After starting out as a highly contentious political manifesto - the arena for angry ideological and economic debate during the election campaign - the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) has sailed into the calmer waters of national consensus. Ideology is much less of an issue, certainly insofar as social upliftment is concerned. Just about everyone - government ministries, parastatals, private enterprise, non-governmental organisations, and the donor community - is jostling to climb aboard the RDP bandwagon. Such broad-based enthusiasm for a programme which many decried only a few months ago, is itself a triumph for the new administration, but especially for the ANC. Mr Jay Naidoo, the cabinet minister with overall responsibility for the RDP, says: 'The remarkable thing about political transition is that we have a programme that united us, even before we started our first cabinet meeting.' This has meant that the focus of the debate has shifted from sterile argument over what it will cost - R39bn at the low end to R79bn at the top - to much more pragmatic issues such as priorities, linkages between the many different players who will be called to participate, sequencing and, above all, delivery systems, and how they should be funded. The RDP has two broad thrusts - social upliftment and economic development. There are five key, inter-linked programmes: meeting basic needs; developing human resources; building the economy; democratising the state and society; and implementing the programme itself. Meeting basic needs encompasses far-reaching land reform - an unreachable target of redistributing 30 per cent of agricultural land within five years; raising the number of houses constructed annually from 50,000 in 1992 to 300,000 by the end of the five-year programme in 1999; providing clean drinking water for the 12m people without access to it at present, and adequate sanitation for 21m people; supplying electricity to 19,000 black schools (86 per cent of the total) and some 4,000 clinics presently without electricity as well two thirds of the country's homes; redressing the imbalance in access to telephone lines - one line for 100 black people compared with 60 lines for 100 whites; and social safety nets for the vulnerable. According to the RDP, millions of blacks do not have access to such services. The RDP calls for the creation of a national health system focused on primary health care. The plan includes phasing in a 10-year compulsory education system; limiting class sizes to no more than 40 by the end of the decade; the launch of adult education programme and the revamping of tertiary education. The underlying goals are widely accepted but this is not so for the third element of the programme - building the economy. Here the ANC's belief in interventionism comes through along with some unrealistic targets - for example, the creation of 300,000-500,000 non-farm jobs each year. There is a pledge to 'reverse privatisation programmes that are contrary to the public interest'; a promise to introduce 'strict anti-trust legislation' while creating a more competitive business environment; and a commitment to 'de-racialise business ownership'. The section on industrial relations promises free collective bargaining, payment of a living wage and affirmative action. As is invariably the case when a radical administration takes office, the more controversial elements of the programme have been de-emphasised and watered down. Indeed, this happened well before the elections, when some of the more ideological, interventionist elements relating to the mining and financial services sectors were amended in the face of sharp criticism from the private sector. This process has continued as ministers new to government tackle a steep learning curve. For example, ministerial opposition to site-and-service housing schemes is ebbing away as the new incumbents face up to hard reality. The new administration will soon have to start prioritising. One attempt to quantify the amounts needed to 'remove social back-logs' within five years puts the extension of social services at the head of the list with 26 per cent of the total cost of R39bn, followed by education and training with 21.5 per cent and housing with 18 per cent. In the new government's first budget, covering the nine months to March 1995, R2.5bn is earmarked for the RDP. This will be funded from savings from departmental votes - what Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister with overriding responsibility for the RDP, calls 'turning the ship of state around to meet new priorities'. He promises 'a major kick-off of the programme' within the first 100 days - by mid-August. The government is preparing a policy document to convert a political manifesto into a development plan. This will include a macroeconomic framework, or model, that ties the programme to anticipated future economic growth. In the budget, Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, 'pencilled in' total RDP spending of R37.5bn over five years, all of it to be financed from departmental savings. Assuming inflation of 9 per cent a year, this will mean that real recurrent government spending, excluding interest payments, will have to be cut by about 2 per cent a year. This looks to be unattainable, especially given the capital spending bias of the RDP, which in turn will create demands for higher departmental votes. Building more schools and hospitals implies more teachers, doctors and nurses. Government spending on the RDP will be leveraged by aid inflows, by parastatal funding of electrification and telecommunications, by private sector financing of housing, by user-cost systems and by the sell-off of government assets such as the oil stockpile and forest land. On one calculation, R9bn could be raised from such asset sales. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development believes South Africa could receive upwards of Dollars 1bn a year in aid flows, the greater portion of which would be for RDP-type programmes. Co-ordination between central government, provincial administrations and parastatals, not to mention donors, is bound to be a problem - conceivably posing a greater challenge than financing. There is a number of well-run non-government organisations in South Africa with the infrastructure and capacity to deliver the goods at relatively low cost. What is in doubt is the willingness of some in government to make maximum use of such NGOs. Senior officials also question the bureaucracy's capacity to spend efficiently the amounts likely to be available from 1995 onwards.</p>

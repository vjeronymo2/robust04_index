			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Bank charges to companies attacked BANKS are levying much heavier charges on corporate customers than personal customers, Mr Ian Clark of the banking consultancy Hunter Clark Associates said yesterday. He called for a corporate banking ombudsman to protect the interests of companies. Charges to banks' corporate customers varied so widely that companies should take care to ensure that they secured themselves the best deal. Mr Clark said his group's research had identified a large retailer which paid Pounds 2m a year in bank charges, but which ought to be paying at least Pounds 300,000 less. Bank Report 1991/92.

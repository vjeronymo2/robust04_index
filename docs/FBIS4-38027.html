			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, Yemeni </F> Presidential Council member and YSP assistant secretary general,  in Rabat, by 'Ali al-'Amudi; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Amudi] Your stay in  London for medical treatment lasted more than one month. Later,  it became evident that you were on a mission for the political  leadership in Aden. Can you tell us about the nature of this  mission, and did you contact the British Government during that  period?    [Muhammad] We carried out our duty toward our people, who  are  being torn apart by this dirty war. The results of our efforts,  whether with the British, the brothers, or the friends, were  compatible with what we believe to be our duty. We held many  meetings at the British Foreign Office, with the parliamentary  blocs, and with influential political, cultural, and trade  quarters. The world at large has come to realize the danger of  what is taking place in Yemen. I believe that the trend is to  tackle these dangers. We carried out this mission in  coordination with the leadership, and I would like to reassure  you that things are proceeding in a coordinated and well-planned  manner.    [Al-'Amudi] Sukhoi-29 aircraft appeared for the first time  in  the skies of the northern side. What does this mean? Are we to  witness a new escalation where the Democratic Republic of Yemen  will bring into the battle its strategic bombers which, as yet,  have not entered the battle?    [Muhammad] We have information about military aircraft Sanaa  received through Iran. Some of these aircraft were destroyed in  Ta'izz airport in an air strike by the aircraft of steadfast  Aden. With respect to what the southern side has, weapons alone  will not determine the course and outcome of the battle. What  will decide the battle will be the position that defends honor,  dignity, and property against those who decided that the south  with its inhabitants, villages, and cities is up for grabs for  the army of Sanaa and its most important tribes.    The war will be a protracted one. People will resist the  invasion, using all means, including new weapons. In this case,  these weapons will be authorized because they will be used in  self-defense.    [Al-'Amudi] Yahya Mansur Abu-Usba' has said in Cairo that  steps are being taken to form a provisional YSP command under  Salih 'Abbad in Sanaa. What does the YSP assistant secretary  general have to say to this?    [Muhammad] Only the YSP central bodies have such a right.  The war will produce unexpected results on all levels.  Therefore, it is premature to say anything now. Otherwise, the  issue will be similar to the many appointments that the Sanaa  regime announces.    I met brother Yahya Abu-Usba' in Cairo. He told me things  that are very different from what the press reports. [passage  omitted]</p>

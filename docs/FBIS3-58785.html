			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 20 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe on Thursday [20 January] called for a major review  of Bosnian policy and said he planned to quickly broach the  issue with U.S., Russia and European partners, as disgust built  over the latest failure of Bosnian talks.    Juppe said he was "offering in the coming hours and days to  make new contact with our American, Russian and European  partners to proceed with this overhaul."    "We can no longer watch on the one hand the different  parties  negotiate in Geneva, and on the ground watch an escalation of  the conflict," said Juppe in a statement for the French  Assembly's foreign affairs committee.    He spoke as the European parliament in Strasbourg called for  the replacement of David Owen as European Community negotiator  in the Bosnian negotiations in a resolution that criticized the  strategy of EC and United Nations negotiators "who have achieved  no results and who persist in wanting to divide  Bosnia-Herzegovina, though a member of the United Nations, along  ethnic lines."    Hans van den Broek, the European commissioner for external  relations, meanwhile, suggested Thursday in Stasbourg that the  EC should perhaps consider suspending its mediation efforts  "until the three parties (in Bosnia) are ready to accept a  durable solution." But he said it was "unfair" to blame Owen,  since he was acting on a mandate from the EC.    Two days of talks on Bosnia in Geneva collapsed Wednesday  with the Bosnian Moslems, Croats and Serbs still deadlocked, as  international mediators held out scant hope for progress when  talks reconvene in three weeks.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 4.33.2 references Figure 46 which illustrates different clear floor space requirements depending on the direction of approach to the wheelchair accessible space. If a forward or rear approach is provided to the accessible space, the minimum depth of the space is 48 inches. If a side approach is provided to the accessible space, the minimum depth of the space is 60 inches. The extra depth for a side approach is needed to accommodate the turn required to maneuver into and out of the space. These clear floor space requirements apply whether seating is in assembly areas, spectator seating in a courtroom, a witness stand, jury box, or other similar areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that portable lifts be included in the exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Language has been added in the exception to allow the use of portable lifts complying with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts (Wheelchair Lifts)) in alterations where it is technically infeasible to provide a fixed means of vertical access. ADAAG 4.11 references ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, Part XX, 1990 to incorporate its safety requirements for platform lifts (wheelchair lifts). The Board recognizes that ASME A17.1 does not apply to portable equipment other than portable escalators. However, in requiring portable lifts to comply with this standard, a minimum level of safety will be ensured. Furthermore, the applicable exception under 4.1.3(5) (Accessible Buildings: New Construction) has been revised to permit the use of platform lifts or wheelchair lifts to provide access to raised judges' benches, clerks' stations, speakers' rostrums, raised daises, jury boxes and witness stands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Design Guide Subcommittee recommended that the witness box be exempt from the requirements for accessibility as accommodations could be made on an as needed basis through such alternatives as a portable witness box, portable lift or ramp. The commenter further stated that, at the discretion of the presiding judge, any witness may testify from the well of the courtroom as opposed to within the defined area of the witness box. The commenter felt that an alternative location does not inherently carry an implication of non-accommodation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A fixed means of vertical access to the witness stand via ramp or lift can easily be provided in new construction without adversely affecting the spatial or psychological relationship between the participants. In alterations, the provision allows the use of a portable ramp or portable lift where it is technically infeasible to provide a fixed means of vertical access to the witness stand or jury box as long as jurors or witnesses with disabilities are inside the defined area of the jury box or witness stand. The provision does not prohibit the use of portable witness boxes. However, if portable witness boxes are used, they should be used by all witnesses, not just those with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With respect to the exception for alterations to jury boxes and witness stands, one commenter questioned how clear floor space can be provided in alterations for a portable ramp and yet be technically infeasible to provide a permanently installed ramp. Other commenters requested that the technical specifications for portable ramps be clarified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In altering existing courtrooms it may be technically infeasible to provide a fixed means of vertical access to the jury box or witness stand. For example, if providing a permanent ramp to a witness stand would result in reducing seating needed to meet the minimum legal requirements for jurors in a criminal case, only clear floor space to accommodate a portable ramp would be required. In the above example, the clear floor space provided for the portable ramp may result in the ramp projecting into the well of the courtroom. It may be inconvenient and, in some cases, hazardous to have a permanently installed ramp project into the well of the courtroom at all times. In allowing the exemption in alterations, the interim final rule is accommodating structural conditions while ensuring that accessibility is provided. Portable ramps stored under the witness box is one solution for alterations as long as such ramps meet all the technical specifications in ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All ramps, whether portable or permanently installed, are required to meet the technical specifications in ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps). However, in existing buildings or facilities where space limitations prohibit the use of a 1:12 slope, ADAAG 4.1.6(2)(a) (Accessible Buildings: Alterations) does allow a slope between 1:10 and 1:12 for a maximum rise of 6 inches and a slope between 1:8 and 1:10 for a maximum rise of 3 inches. This provision has been clarified by referencing ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that control of the microphone is maintained by the judge or other court employees and that the reference to ADAAG 4.27.3 (Height) and 4.27.4 (Operation) should be eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provision has been clarified to require controls and operating mechanisms to comply with ADAAG 4.27.3 (Height) and 4.27.4 (Operation) where provided for use by the witness or juror.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11.2.1(3)&blank;Spectator, Press and Other Areas with Fixed Seats <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision specifies the number of wheelchair spaces required where spectator, press, or other areas with fixed seats are provided. Where spectator seating capacity exceeds 50 and is located on one level that is not sloped or tiered, the accessible spaces must be provided in more than one seating row. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters from organizations representing individuals with disabilities felt that spectator seating areas should be required to have dispersed seats regardless of the number of seats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(a) (Assembly Areas) requires two wheelchair spaces where the seating capacity is 26&hyph;50 but does not require dispersal. The interim final rule does not require dispersal where only two accessible spaces are provided to allow persons with disabilities to sit next to each other. No changes were made to this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11.2.1(4)&blank;Fixed Judges' Benches, Clerks' Stations, Speakers' Rostrums, and Raised Daises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that fixed judges' benches, and clerks' stations be either accessible or adaptable and clear floor space for a forward position be provided at each space. As discussed in 11.2.1(2), a requirement for maneuvering clearances has been added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

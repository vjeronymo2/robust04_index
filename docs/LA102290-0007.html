			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> EVER-PRESENT DANGER  </P> <P> We do have a fear that anything can go wrong at any given point. When you are  confronting people -- whether it be a car full of five or six gang-bangers or  people fighting -- there is always a fear.  </P> <P> I don't think there are people running around waiting to blow away police  officers, but there is always the present danger. For us to hear of something  like the shooting of Detective Russell Kuster affects us all personally. April,  1984, automatically clicks in my head.  </P> <P> I didn't know (Kuster), but it's still like losing a family member. We've all  run around on that same track, done push-ups on the same field and been taught  pretty much the same things. It's devastating, but we know we have to keep  pushing. If we don't, this city could go to hell. Steps are being taken to help  make sure officers aren't wounded in the line of duty. Hopefully, the new  gun-control law that Chief (Daryl Gates) is pushing will help. We are running  into kids on the street with much more sophisticated weapons than we have.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US growth helps Burmah Castrol advance 17% BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, yesterday announced interim pre-tax profits slightly higher than expected, helped by increased lubricant sales in the US and reduced interest charges. But recession continued to drag down metallurgical chemicals. The company said it was reviewing its manufacturing capacity and could close up to ten of its 50 plants worldwide. In the six months to June 30 profits rose 17 per cent from Pounds 72.2m to Pounds 84.7m. Turnover fell to Pounds 1.15bn (Pounds 1.16bn), mainly due to disposals. The shares gained 28p to 573p. Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman and chief executive, said the result was 'fairly satisfactory given the state of our markets'. But he warned the second half would be difficult as markets remained depressed. Prolonged weakness of the dollar would also reduce profits. Lubricants lifted trading profits 11 per cent to Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 58.7m), buoyed by automotive oils sales in the US and Asia. A new synthetic motor oil is being introduced across the US this month. Launch costs could knock about Pounds 7m off trading profits in the second half. Trading profits from the chemicals division, which was expanded following the 1990 acquisition of Foseco, were almost unchanged at Pounds 17.4m (17.2m). Metallurgical chemicals, however, fell by 7 per cent. Disposals of non-core Foseco businesses are now almost complete. Foseco, which last year diluted earnings by about 6.5p a share, is this year expected to be earnings neutral. In other divisions, fuels trading profits rose 62 per cent to Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 9.4m) helped by a Pounds 1.9m gain on the flotation of a Turkish joint venture. Interest costs fell to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 24.3m) as debt raised to finance the Foseco acquisition was moved offshore to lower interest rate currencies. The tax rate fell 3 percentage points to 44 per cent with higher UK profits offsetting ACT write-offs. Earnings increased 26 per cent to 22.5p (17.8p). The interim dividend is raised to 8.75p (8.5p). Gearing at the end of the period stood at 65 per cent, treating convertible bonds as debt, or 49 per cent if treated as equity. COMMENT News that Burmah is considering closing up to 20 per cent of its metallurgical chemicals capacity shows how it underestimated the likely length of the recession when it bought Foseco. But this should not detract from an otherwise solid performance and it has always argued Foseco should be judged on its long-term impact. The big question for the second half is currency, since translated dollar earnings could fall by 10 per cent at current exchange rates. Burmah's international reach will mitigate some of the downside as it gains from a strong D-Mark and lower input prices, which are dollar based. Forecast full year net income of Pounds 84m puts the p/e on a little less than 13. The US synthetic oil launch will depress profits in the short term, but should add to the shares' longer term attractions.</p>

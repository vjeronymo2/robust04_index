			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Ignominious end for a paradoxical president - George Bush's vitriolic campaign lost him the respect he earned while in office FOR George Bush it was not supposed to end like this. Rather than a graceful exit from the presidency after eight years, contemplating a place in the history books, he leaves after only four, the first elected Republican president since the forgettable Herbert Hoover to be turfed out after a single term. Even more sadly, a gracious concession speech on election night could not expunge the sour taste that his foul campaign had left in the nation's mouth. This further reduced the respect he had earned for having done some things well during what will come to be seen as, at best, a transitional term in office and, at worst, a negligent one. Nor could he have expected that his own nation would so turn against him. Had he not, as he would have it, won the cold war, reunified Germany, stood firm during the attempted Soviet coup thereby encouraging democracy in Russia, and brought Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega to heel? Even though he began to concede this year that perhaps he might have paid more attention to domestic affairs and that, perhaps, the economy had not performed to expectation, he never gave the impression he could be blamed for not solving every problem. Of the economy he would say: 'It's bad, but, hey, not that bad.' Nor did he seem to realise that perhaps his country had really read his lips and did not trust him that much. His public life has, after all, been one in which constancy has not been a virtue - be the issue 'voodoo economics,' abortion, civil rights or dealing with Iran and Iraq. For a confessed unreflective man, Mr Bush is a complex character. He is said to bear private malice towards none (even Mr Clinton concedes this) and is capable of great personal kindness. But he sanctions malice in public, especially in those who work for him, and seems more than capable of turning a blind eye to those who may break the law on his behalf. For a man who made it all the way to the White House it is paradoxical to state that he has never been a great electoral politician. Set against his losses - twice for the Senate from Texas in 1964 and 1970 and for the Republican nomination in 1980 - have been two terms as a congressman from his state in the 1960s and, of course, the presidency itself in 1988. The enduring feature of all those races, except possibly 1980, has been his willingness to conduct ruthlessly negative campaigns, even when they have not appeared to be necessary. But if Mr Bush saw elections as a necessarily dirty rite of passage, to be approached with all the cynicism to be mustered, there was also the assumption that he saw the presidency as something else - a test of his own manhood. His long public career had always been dependent on patrons - in order, Goldwater, Nixon, Rockefeller and Reagan, who encompass the full range of Republican beliefs and experience. He owed more than a little of his winning campaign four years ago to Mr Ronald Reagan, but at least when he inherited the White House it was his to run, with the capable assistance of his old friend James Baker. Mr Bush has admitted that, in 1989, he still felt he had not been fully tested under fire. He resolved that problem, inside a year, with the invasion of Panama, a soft target perhaps. But there was nothing soft about other challenges that came his way, with the liberation of eastern Europe, the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In most of these he was not found wanting as a crisis manager. He encouraged democracy in eastern Europe, while leaving the leading role in economic assistance to the European Community; he stood firmly behind Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the great debate about German unification; his finest moment, if not hour, was a critical comment when it seemed that the anti-Gorbachev putsch was going to work. 'Not all coups succeed,' were his words, which looked awfully good compared with the simultaneous equivocations of the likes of President Francois Mitterrand. His finest campaign was undoubtedly his diplomatic and military triumph in the Gulf war, although Mr Bush is now going to have to face up to question after question about the details of his policy to court President Saddam in the years before the invasion of Kuwait. The conduct of the Gulf war and the subsequent pursuit of the Middle East peace process laid to rest for a while the suspicion that Mr Bush had no broad, strategic vision to deal with a changing world. When last year he spoke of 'a new world order,' involving greater collective international responsibility and burden sharing and a leading role for the United Nations, there was a sense that he was on to something substantive. It could well be said that the first 2 1/2 years of his presidency were indeed a success. He seemed a man of purpose, which makes the failure of the balance of his term all the more difficult to understand. Even his signing of the 1990 budget legislation, containing the very tax increases which two years before he had promised he would never allow, was considered at the time by all except the ideological right wing to be an act of responsible domestic statesmanship. It was hardly surprising that 15 short months ago so few Democrats felt like taking him on. It is impossible to divorce the state of the economy from his demise. It is not so much that policy mistakes were made - indeed his administration and the Federal Reserve pushed most of the buttons available to them - but more that the president seemed blithely indifferent to the real domestic world outside the White House. The word got out that he had 'lost touch' with his own country and the concerns over health care, education, narcotics, crime, unemployment that were so much on the mind of average people. This year has read like a catalogue of disasters: an ill-conceived and ultimately disastrous trip to Japan, a divisive Republican primary campaign, an ineffectual response to the deeply disturbing riots in Los Angeles, perpetual 'gridlock' in relations with Congress, veto after veto of popular legislation, a grudging and mean-spirited excursion to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and, as politically damaging as anything, a vindictive and confrontational Republican convention in Houston. There were also growing and public divisions inside his own government. Mr John Sununu was an abrasive White House chief of staff and his successor, Mr Sam Skinner, ineffective. His economic advisers - Brady, Darman and Boskin - were not of one mind. They often did not seem to know whether to support Mr Alan Greenspan at the Fed or undermine him. Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, made no bones of the fact he felt semi-detached. The conservatively pure, always suspicious of Mr Bush and Mr Baker, began open assaults, suggesting that the weak end of the Republican ticket was Mr Bush and not Vice-President Dan Quayle. Mr Bush's reactions to these events were unpredictable, contradictory and defensive. The last was arguably the worst offence; he began to whine and blame others, a trait that Americans, like others, do not find attractive. By the time he finally brought Mr Baker back to the White Houser to sort it all out, the rot had set in - and the economy was definitely not getting better. Suddenly the old suspicion that Mr Bush (and Mr Baker) lacked strategic vision and a sense of purpose took hold again. The negative campaign against Mr Clinton only served to reinforce this. It began to be written and said repeatedly that the only reason Mr Bush wanted to be president was 'to be president'. One of his less felicitous early election year pronouncements - 'I will say or do anything to remain president' - was increasingly used in evidence against him. The paranoia of Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, may know no bounds, but Mr Bush did sanction dirty tricks against his opponents. There is no other explanation for his political appointees at the State Department nosing round the Clinton family passport records. But, to the president, 'you gotta dish it out and if they can't take it, too bad'. In the end he was reduced to the most demeaning of insults against Mr Clinton and, finally, the public concluded that this demeaned Mr Bush more than the recipient. Yet it is also typical of George Herbert Walker Bush, a Yankee patrician, that he was publicly gracious in defeat. That is the ultimate dichotomy.</p>

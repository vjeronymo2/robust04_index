			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / China seeks foreign financing for Pounds 81bn transport development China plans to spend 700bn yuan (Pounds 81bn) by the year 2000 to overcome chronic transport infrastructure problems restraining economic growth. The official Xinhua news agency says China will pour funds into building railways, highways, waterways, pipelines and civil aviation facilities. Foreigners will be encouraged to invest in Chinese infrastructure as partners in joint ventures or as sole operators. Hong Kong entrepreneurs are already deeply engaged in infrastructure projects, including toll roads, ports and power stations. Reports by the World Bank and other institutions cite inadequate transportation as one of the main barriers to faster and more orderly economic development. The new infrastructure blueprint includes: A plan to boost the total length of railways from 53,000km to 70,000km. Rolling-stock capacity would be increased by 20 per cent to help meet demand in an economy expected to grow by 8-9 per cent annually. A road-building programme to add about 200,000km to the country's inadequate network. Only 6,000km of the present 1.02m km are classified as highway, properly paved and consisting of more than one lane each way. Doubling the number of ports to 600. An estimated 50 per cent of ships calling at China's cargo-clogged ports have to wait days before unloading. Xinhua said 'bolder steps' would be taken to encourage foreigners to invest in China's infrastructure. The agency did not specify what that meant, but the Chinese authorities have been aggressively seeking outside help by offering a range of incentives for build-operate-transfer projects. 'While continuing to use loans provided by the World Bank and foreign governments, China will welcome foreign investors to run joint ventures or solely owned ventures in the construction of railways, highways and civil aviation facilities other than air control systems.' China and South Korea agreed yesterday to build a 570km undersea telecommunications fibre-optic cable to carry 15,000 telephone lines. The agreement reflects growing trade links between the two countries.</p>

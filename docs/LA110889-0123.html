			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> EVENING TRAIN SERVICE TO BE INTERRUPTED  </P> <P> A $15-million upgrade to the railroad tracks between San Juan Capistrano and  Del Mar will interrupt evening train service from Santa Ana to San Diego for  three weeks, officials said.  </P> <P> From Sundays to Thursdays, Nov. 26 to Dec. 21, the last two southbound evening  trains will operate only between Los Angeles and Santa Ana. Both trains --  numbered 586 and 587 -- leave Los Angeles at 8:45 p.m. Amtrak will provide  buses to shuttle passengers between Santa Ana, San Juan Capistrano, Oceanside,  Del Mar and San Diego, officials said.  </P> <P> Sixteen daily trains on the Los Angeles-to-San Diego route may also be delayed  up to 20 minutes because they will be traveling at slower speeds, said Joanna  Capelle, spokesperson for the Los Angeles-San Diego Rail Corridor Agency. The  slowdown is a safety measure in case passers-by create a hazard by placing  construction materials on the tracks, Capelle said.  </P> <P> "The last time we did repair work we had quite a lot of vandalism," Capelle  said. "It potentially could cause a serious problem."  </P> <P> Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway company crews will work from 8 p.m. to  4:30 a.m., Sundays through Thursdays, laying new, smoother rails on a 51-mile  stretch between the San Juan Capistrano depot and an area in north San Diego  County known as the Sorrento Valley, about five miles south of Del Mar.

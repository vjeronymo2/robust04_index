			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia seeks bids for copper development RUSSIA HAS launched an international tender for bidders to develop its largest copper mine, at Udokan in Siberia. The project has long been planned but the government is now finally inviting foreign and Russian companies to submit proposals for a feasibility study on developing the mine. Goldman Sachs, which is already advising the government on attracting foreign investment, will act as consultant to the Russian tender committee. The Izvestiya newspaper yesterday quoted Mr Yuri Proschin, the secretary for the tender committee, as saying that it would take at least Dollars 1bn and eight years to develop the mine, which was in an extremely difficult geographical location. A similar feasibility study to develop oil off Sakhalin island ran into fierce political wrangling among various Russian authorities. Anxious to attract widespread foreign investment, the government is hoping to avoid a similar drama this time round.</p>

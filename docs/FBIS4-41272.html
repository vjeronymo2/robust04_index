			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Inna Petrova under the "Arms Trade" rubric: </F> "Russian Arms Manufacturers Are Afraid To Approach the World  Market with an Assault Rifle"]    [Text] Vladimir -- The international exhibition "Russia's  Armament and Military Hardware," organized for the fourth time  by the "Zolotyye Vorota Rusi" Joint-Stock Company in conjunction  with the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, has ended its work in  Vladimir.    According to specialists, it was a success and to some  extent  will enable Russian enterprises engaged in producing small arms  and hand-held artillery to improve their economic position. Not  at once, it is true. It will take quite some time for the new  models of weapons, military gear, and optics which were  exhibited -- and most of which are unparalleled in the world --  to find rich buyers. Although representatives of over 30  foreign firms, governments, ministries of defense, and other  departments visited the exhibition, experience of similar events  in the past shows that business offers should be expected later,  when foreign businessmen and experts have analyzed all the  information obtained.    Our arms manufacturers are preparing to work in new  conditions: The government's May decree gives manufacturing  enterprises the right to engage in autonomous foreign economic  activity. But will this accelerate sales of output which has  accumulated in plants? Will the autonomy that has been granted  not remain imaginary? Are the producers themselves ready for  such free floating?    Here are the views of professionals, which I have heard.    Nikolay Kovalchuk, general director of the "Zavod imeni V.  Degtyareva" Joint-Stock Company, city of Kovrov:    "Since we will be permitted to obtain a license and to trade  in weapons, then, technologically, we must have our own pricing  specialists, market analysts, and traveling salesmen.    "Quite a long time will pass while they are making the  acquaintance of potential buyers and finding out who is behind  whom and with which grouping or which shaykh it makes sense to  talk and with which it does not. But what will be the good of a  sale several years later? Maybe, while earning dollars today,  tomorrow we will start losing them -- in hundreds and thousands?  I believe that the process might drag on. Therefore we must  use structures which have experience of the arms trade and with  which we have long-standing ties."    Vladimir Pankov, leading engineer of a machine-building  design bureau, city of Kolomna:    "While you are agreeing all the parameters of contracts with  many official organs, the client simply loses patience. The  time it takes to register jobs is approximately doubled.  Frequently there is also unjustified interference in prices.    "There is a fear that, just as we `ate our way' through  petrodollars in the past, so now we might lose dollars from  sales of at least that section of weapons in which we are  permitted to trade. They will be 'eaten' precisely by the  intermediate structures."    Yuriy Sergeyev, chief of a department of Tula Instrument  Making Design Bureau:    "There was, is, and will be a monopoly of the arms trade. If  the `Rosvooruzheniye' State Company conducts talks with our  participation, we will not be selling too cheaply, as the saying  goes. But if it does so without us, then the features of our  output are not always correctly highlighted. It happens that a  single model of a weapon is sold, and not at a high price  either. It turns out that it has been sold for  cognitive-intelligence purposes. We lose our potential and give  up our product for nothing.    "We are not adversaries or rivals of the `Rosvooruzheniye'  State Company. We must work alongside it in studying world  experience of the arms trade and engage in marketing research so  as to get a result."    Mikhail Zakharov, vice president of the "Spetsialnoye  Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya" Joint-Stock Company and in the  recent past deputy minister of the defense industry, who now  tackles questions of the arms trade:    "In the past the people of Tula were granted autonomy, and  nothing came of that. The decree elicited in me a dual feeling.  What was the point of it, if it ran counter to previously issued  documents, particularly the president's edict on setting up the  `Rosvooruzheniye' State Company as a monopoly organization? It  essentially does not give enterprises sufficient rights for  autonomous trade in weapons. In addition, very many competing  organizations from Russia will appear on the market -- which  will not produce positive results. It is said that they do not  let us onto the market. But we ourselves have not yet learned  how to trade."    The position of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company itself  was presented by Aleksandr Semenov, deputy chief of the regional  policy administration. In his opinion, the decree's publication  certainly does not mean that tomorrow all enterprises will run  to conquer the foreign market with their output. The right to  participate in military-technical cooperation with foreign  countries is granted them only if certain conditions are  observed. It is necessary, among other things, to undergo  two-level certification and registration. The commission on  foreign economic cooperation, which will be headed by First Vice  Premier O. Soskovets, will have the final say.    Thus, the question of whether there is a monopoly of the  arms  trade in Russia remains open.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Management: 'Flexecs' show their muscle Being made redundant is not such a big deal, according to John Rauwerda, fiscal manager at the Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage. For him it was a blessing in disguise. As in the UK, executives in the US have recently discovered that redundancy is not a malaise restricted solely to the ranks of the blue-collar worker. But Americans are finding increasingly that being a temporary executive has its perks. Rauwerda is one of thousands of executives who fell foul of recessionary layoffs and then found another position after a period as a 'flexecutive'. With more than 30m Americans employed as either temporary workers, part-timers or independent contractors, the contingent workforce has become one of the fastest-growing sectors of employment in America and accounts for more than 25 per cent of civilian jobs. 'I had been working on a temporary assignment at the Foundation for four months when they offered me a permanent position,' says Rauwerda, 'I took it because it gave me security.' For those who sit in wait for their next permanent role, becoming a flexecutive has advantages. According to Tom Johnston of New York-based Interim Executive Services, approximately 52 per cent of temporary executives receive permanent job offers. In addition, interim employment eliminates gaping voids on a CV and broadens one's skill base. Not everyone regards temporary employment as a stop-gap. Amy Ross presently heads up the benefits unit at Lifescan, a nationwide medical monitoring manufacturer. Ross left the permanent job market because she sought greater freedom and flexibility. 'I was burned out and my former role was too demanding. This way I'm more in control,' she says. Ross, who spent two months travelling with her family recently, says that she would not accept a permanent job if it was offered to her. But Ross is fortunate in that temporary employment suits her lifestyle. Others are resigned to a career in temporary executive roles because they do not see the employment market supplying sufficient opportunity for them to return to the permanent positions they would prefer. In the present economic climate there are advantages for companies in favouring temporary recruitment, especially at the higher echelons of management where perks are expensive. Temporary employees do not receive holiday pay, maternity leave, health care insurance, pension plans or sick leave. It is largely for this reason that the incidence of temporary employment rises towards the end of a recession when companies find they have been too eager with the paring knife and need certain skills on board, but cannot afford a permanent executive. Small companies as well as large have been attracted towards the ever increasing pool of executive expertise on the marketplace. Many have used temporary skills to cover for under-staffing caused by maternity leave, sabbaticals or overly enthusiastic redundancy programmes. Says Don Muller, the director of client services for lawyers Thelen, Marrin, Johnson and Bridges: 'I bring in the level of expertise I need, when I need it.' Muller now finds that while his permanent staff is on the decrease, his use of flexecutives is on the increase and there is rarely a time when he does not have at least two temporary top managers on the payroll. Muller stresses the financial advantages for companies are enormous. Recently, he employed a specialist to set up a new communications system within the company, at a rate of Dollars 100 (Pounds 65) an hour. The project took seven weeks, and the individual worked a 20-hour week, costing Dollars 14,000. 'Had I employed her full-time, her level of expertise would have warranted a Dollars 120,000 annual salary,' explains Muller. Recent reports by the Bureau of Labour Statistics suggest that the growing army of 'discouraged workers' in the US (resigned to never securing another permanent job) has reached 1m, while the temporary professional sector is the fastest growing segment of the temporary-worker industry, generating Dollars 70m per annum.</p>

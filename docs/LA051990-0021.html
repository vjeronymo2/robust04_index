			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : ACTRESS OF CHINESE DESCENT RELISHES ROLES THAT BREAK THE COLOR  BARRIER  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, actress Lauren Tom -- the feisty, abusive dim sum waitress in  Orion Pictures' black comedy, "Cadillac Man" -- was doing Jacobean tragedy in  Chicago and New York.  </P> <P> Now she lives in a guest house in Beverly Hills and is preparing for her first  appearance on "The Tonight Show."  </P> <P> "I spent the last eight years doing a lot of theater, and I started moving into  really heavy theater, Jacobean and Greek tragedies," says the  20-to-30-something Chicago native. "It's so heavy and gut-wrenching. And you  have to project so far out into the theater. Now I'm more interested in doing  things that are a little more naturalistic."  </P> <P> In "Cadillac Man," she plays a Chinese immigrant who appears in three scenes.  She based the role, including the accent, on her restaurant-owning grandmother.  </P> <P> "My character is so aggressive and pushy and rude to her customers," Tom says.  "But you have to understand what's behind it. She gets so involved with her  customers' lives -- it's like family to her. And you know how you are to your  family."  </P> <P> In the theater, Tom, who is of Chinese descent, managed to break the color  barrier that usually keeps nonwhites from "colorblind" or traditional roles.  She won an Obie award for her portrayal of a hotel clerk from Ohio in the New  York Shakespeare Festival's production of "American Notes," for example, and  played for a year in "A Chorus Line" on Broadway.  </P> <P> "I am American, third generation, and I like to play parts that could be  anything, not just characters where I do (a Chinese) accent," Tom says. "In  theater, it's much better. I think it's coming along a little slower in film  and TV."  </P> <P> After "Cadillac Man," Tom will appear at the Mark Taper, Too, in a performance  art piece set to music composed by Jan Kaczmarek.

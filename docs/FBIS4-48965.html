			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, April 30 (XINHUA)--Years of effort have  brought about the flourishing of the first high-tech development  zone in China's northwest frontier.    Located in Urumqi, capital city of the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region, the 9.8-sq-km development zone now has 198  enterprises, including 27 joint ventures.    It created profits worth 110 million yuan (12.5 million U.S.  dollars according to the current exchange rate) and handed over  7.5 million yuan (about 850,000 U.S. dollars) to the state in  taxes last year.    Local government has invested 80 million yuan (nine million  U.S. dollars) in infrastructure construction in the zone.    Construction of infrastructural facilities in a diamond city  funded by overseas capital has already been completed.    High-tech sectors of the zone focus on biological  engineering, electronic information techniques, electric  machinery and chemicals.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Underwriting losses hold back Allianz ALLIANZ, Germany's largest insurance company, yesterday reported a dip in pre-tax profits to DM1.62bn (Dollars 953m) in 1992 after suffering its first underwriting losses in its domestic market since 1971. The result, which compares with pre-tax profits of DM1.78bn in 1991, was better than most analysts had expected, mainly because of an improved performance by overseas subsidiaries. After-tax profits fell to DM857.9m compared with DM1.048bn in the previous year, due to a higher tax charge. Earnings per share (calculated on the same basis as UK and US companies) were DM26 compared with DM25.05, a rise of 29.7 per cent. Underwriting losses in the German non-life market, where Allianz has a 17 per cent share, reflected heavy motor theft and weather-related claims. They were offset by an improvement in the results of foreign subsidiaries, which were helped by effect of cost-cutting and higher premium rates. Allianz subsidiaries in the UK (Cornhill), Italy (RAS), France (Allianz Via) and the USA (Fireman's Fund) improved their underwriting results by DM350m. Overall underwriting losses were DM1.68bn compared with DM1.78bn in 1991. Investment income amounted to DM3.305bn, DM250m less than in 1991 when extraordinary earnings from an asset swap, involving the group's Austrian subsidiary, amounted to DM484m. 'Allianz is in good shape for the single market. The company is leaner, more streamlined and even more customer-oriented,' said Dr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive. Overall premium income rose by 12.3 per cent to DM54.7bn, of which DM29bn is generated from Germany. The figures reflected the consolidation for the first time of figures for the second half-year from Deutsche Krankenversicherung, Allianz's health insurance subsidiary. At an underlying rate, income grew at a rate of 10 per cent. Deutsche Versicherungs (DVAG), the former east German state-owned insurer acquired by Allianz in 1990, saw its premium income increase by 20 per cent, partially because of increases in premium rates. The group is expecting further growth in premium income in 1993 to DM60bn but says its main focus is on improving underwriting results, through premium increases, restrictions in cover and cost cutting. The group lost 4,000 employees in 1992, mainly because of a shake-out at DVAG, and plans further reductions in 1993, cutting staffing levels from 63,000 to 60,000 people.</p>

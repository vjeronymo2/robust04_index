			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MASTER OF SWEET SCIENCE WORKS AT FAME'S FRINGE  </P> <P> Police officer Jim Davidson never had boxed when he went to trainer Jimmy  Bivins with a plea.  </P> <P> Davidson, 38, wanted to enter an Olympic-style competition for law enforcement  officers from across the nation and asked Bivins to train him.  </P> <P> "He watched me for a little while. After about six weeks of strictly putting me  into condition, he put me in the ring. Jimmy's contention is that boxing is  almost 90 percent conditioning. He proved it by me. He put me in the best shape  of my life," Davidson said.  </P> <P> Last August in Las Vegas, Davidson decisioned a 23-year-old deputy sheriff from  California to win a gold medal. Bivins was in his corner.  </P> <P> "I was elated," said Davidson, who competed as a 175-pound light heavyweight.  "It culminated everything. He told me all along I could do it, even though I  was concerned about my age."  </P> <P> Bivins, 69, runs a small boxing gym in a former elementary school classroom at  St. Malachi Center. The atmosphere recalls days when poor, street-wise kids  thrived in big-city boxing clubs.  </P> <P> Teen-agers and young adults train with Bivins. He says he goes to the gym each  day out of love of the sport. Bivins, a retired delivery truck driver, spends  most of his money on equipment and weekly Saturday "feasts" for his boxers.  </P> <P> "To me, you get in there and show your self esteem," Bivins said. "Nothing's  impossible. You just try. You get to a place where you can do it. It brings out  the man in you. It lets folks know if you work toward a goal, it can shine for  you."  </P> <P> Bivins became a professional fighter in 1940 as a 180-pound light heavyweight  in bouts that paid $5 a round.  </P> <P> By 1942 he was widely considered among the best heavyweights and  light-heavyweights in the country. He went into the Army in 1944, but otherwise  dominated Cleveland boxing in that decade.  </P> <P> During his career, he fought many of the biggest names in boxing, including  heavyweight champ Joe Louis in a 10-rounder in Baltimore at a time when Louis  was making a comeback.  </P> <P> "I still think I beat him, but he was Joe Louis. He had the name," Bivins said.  </P> <P> Bivins had a professional record of 86 victories, 25 losses and one draw but  never had a title fight.  </P> <P> "Some folks said the promoters didn't want to take a chance of putting their  guy in there with me," Bivins said.  </P> <P> Bivins runs his gym outside of today's pro boxing circles. He works with no  big-name fighters, as does promoter Don King of Orwell, east of Cleveland.  </P> <P> "People in Cleveland act like I'm not even here. When there are fight shows in  Cleveland, no one asks Jimmy Bivins to take a bow. But any other city I go to,  if they know I'm there they let me take a bow. I don't know what the problem  is. I never bother anybody. I just mind my own business. I don't shoot off at  the lip."  </P></p>

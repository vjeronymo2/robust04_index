			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia Volodymyr </F> Kryzhanivskyy by Viktor Tkachuk; place and date not given:  "Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy: `If You Do Not Start Controversy  Around Our Russians, Nobody Will Harass Them'"]    [Text] [Tkachuk] Perhaps it is easier for you, living  there, to tell whether Moscow is ready to annex the Crimea if  the poll there gives a positive result?    [Kryzhanivskyy] I will frankly say that Moscow is absolutely  not ready to annex our territories, since this would be a  violation of the tripartite statement [on nuclear disarmament].  You must understand that this would lead to an unpredictable  confrontation between us and Russia.    [Tkachuk] Have Ukrainian-Russian relations warmed up since  the tripartite statement was signed?    [Kryzhanivskyy] I would not term this warming. The  situation is simply forcing us to meet each other half-way.  Moscow is aware of the creeping tensions in our relations.  Verbally, everyone supports improvement in our relations.  Although our side has taken a great deal of open steps aimed at  warming the climate in relations between our states, everything  is hampered by certain things. You understand, all those  statements about protecting the Russian-speaking population...  I am simply appealing to Russian diplomats and politicians:  Exclude 12 million Russian-speaking people living in Ukraine  from the total number of 25 million who live outside Russia!  Nobody will harass them in Ukraine. I have already told them  that they can negotiate this issue with other CIS countries, but  not with us, because there is nothing anti-Russian in Ukraine.  Mr. Filatov, one of the closest advisers to Yeltsin, for  example, has recently admitted in a private conversation with me  that the Russian-speaking population is not oppressed in  Ukraine. As you see, there are reasonable politicians in Russia  who understand us.    [Tkachuk] Mr. Ambassador, do you believe that our foreign  policy toward CIS countries, and primarily toward Russia, is  active enough?    [Kryzhanivskyy] However the president and the prime  ministers are always willing to improve relations between our  countries, the parliament must also be taken into account. I  believe that the new Supreme Council, even if it is headed by  [current Supreme Council Chairman] Plyushch, will change its  policy toward Russia. I think that the new legislators will  understand the importance of establishing good relations between  our countries.    [Tkachuk] Currently, Ukrainian and foreign analysts are  pointing to the increasing influence of pro imperial factors in  Russia's foreign policy. Can Ukraine become a factor of  deterrence for its neighbor?    [Kryzhanivskyy] Gaydar [former Russian deputy prime  minister] recently told me that if the Ukrainian, Belarusian,  and Russian economies are united, there will be only one result  -- a complete collapse of the Russian economy. I would like to  emphasize that no reasonable politician who is today in power in  Russia, counts on a union between Ukraine and Russia.    [Tkachuk] What is Russia's attitude toward President  Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative?    [Kryzhanivskyy] The attitude is rather interesting. Russia  wants to join this program, however, not in the same manner as  other countries such as Ukraine or Moldova. Russia wants to  obtain a special status. It is impossible to wink at the fact  that Russia is a huge state. Moreover, it is not only huge but  also nuclear.    [Tkachuk] To what extent is Yeltsin's situation stable  today, taking into account the new Duma and the recent amnesty?    [Kryzhanivskyy] I do not expect any political changes in  Russia in the next five months. The current alignment of forces  seems to satisfy everybody, even communists and nationalists.</p>

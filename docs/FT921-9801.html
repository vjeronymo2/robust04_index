			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Venezuela leader stays firm under fire VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has vowed to press on with unpopular economic reforms despite last week's frustrated uprising by rebel army units. However, in his first press conference since the coup attempt, Mr Perez said he was bringing forward a Dollars 4bn social welfare 'mega-project'. Mr Perez admitted that economic benefits from the reforms had 'not trickled down, way down'. His government had, nevertheless, done more to protect the lower classes through social programmes than any other Latin American nation undergoing similar reforms. The shock, however, had been hardest for Venezuelans accustomed to the easy wealth of the 1970s oil boom. Mr Perez sought to justify heavy press censorship imposed since last week, saying the country was still in a 'difficult period' in terms of public order. The media should not 'make a star out of a felon', he said, referring to Lt Col Hugo Chavez Frias, the leader of the revolt.</p>

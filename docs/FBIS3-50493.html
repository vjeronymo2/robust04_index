Endara's statement came after the article was approved in  the  Legislative Assembly's third and final debate on the  constitutional article that calls for the creation of the Panama  Canal Authority, which will administer the waterway at the end  of the century.    Endara said: "I am very proud of the Panamanian Government  --  I regard the legislative branch as part of the government -- for  approving the new constitutional article. One of the most  important missions of this transition government was to prepare  Panama for noon, 30 December 1999, when the United States will  turn over the canal."    Endara pointed out that since 1977, the dictatorship  governments never made any serious effort to prepare Panamanians  for the serious responsibility of administering the canal. He  added, "All they did was give speeches and disseminate  self-serving propaganda, but there was nothing concrete."    To become part of the Constitution, the new constitutional  article has to be ratified by the next Legislative Assembly that  will be created in the 8 May elections.    Endara said: "I believe Panama has two basic tools for the  immense responsibility it faces. Of course, now the work has to  be done, and, therefore, these two institutions' efforts in the  future will have to be intense, dedicated, and very patriotic."    The president said he felt satisfied and pleased that these  two "tools" had been created during his administration.</p>

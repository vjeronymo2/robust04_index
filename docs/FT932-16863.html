			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Spain is accused in ferry row BRITAIN yesterday accused Spain of breaching European Community obligations by seeking to prevent Cenargo International, a British shipping company, from introducing a ferry service between southern Spain and Morocco, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Steven Norris, the junior transport minister, told the Commons the company was entitled to operate a service between a member state and a third country under the single European market. He said the government was seeking to protect the legitimate interests of Cenargo, which would incur substantial losses if the service could not start later this month. 'It is the whole principle of the single market which is at issue,' said Mr Norris. He welcomed the decision of the European Commission to institute infraction proceedings against Spain, but noted that the process would take 'a great deal of time to complete'.</p>

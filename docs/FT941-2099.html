			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Denmark leads off telecoms sales with likely Dollars 2.7bn float Tele Danmark, the Danish state monopoly telecommunications operator, launched the sale of 48.3 per cent of its shares yesterday, expected to be worth about Dollars 2.7bn. The flotation is the first of a string of telecoms privatisations expected in the EU's continental states over the next two years and the world's largest since the sale of the final tranche of British Telecommunications in June. More than 80 per cent of the 63m shares on offer are expected to be sold outside Denmark, making the privatisation one of the biggest international equity issues. The offer will be marketed in five tranches: the Nordic countries - which will be guaranteed about 20 per cent of the shares - the US, the UK, continental Europe, and the rest of the world. It will be priced at the end of April and close in early May. The shares are expected to be listed on the Copenhagen and New York stock exchanges, and will be quoted through Seaq International. Unusually for a telecoms privatisation, all the net proceeds will go to the company, not to the government. Analysts believe the Danish government's decision to forgo a slice of the proceeds is likely to increase the attraction of the offer, particularly to institutions seeking a medium or long-term return. The Danish government will retain a controlling 51 per cent stake in Tele Danmark, but the company will have operational independence. Mr Hans Wurzen, chief executive, said privatisation would enable it 'to move away from political control in the face of competition in an open market in Europe'. The initial offering is expected to be in the price range DKr275-DKr315 per DKr10 share (or Dollars 20.83-Dollars 23.86 per American depositary share), according to the prospectus. By capitalised value Tele Danmark is expected to become the second largest group listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange after the AP Moller shipping group's companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg. Tele Danmark operates one of the cheapest and most advanced telecoms networks in Europe. Denmark has about 59 telephone subscribers per 100 people, compared with about 45 in the UK, and it has the highest proportion of cellular subscribers of any EU state. Telecoms privatisations are also likely or possible this year in the Netherlands, Greece and Italy, with several others expected beyond the EU. The Greek privatisation is expected to raise about Dollars 1bn, the Dutch about Dollars 3bn. The sale of the first tranche of shares in the German operator Deutsche Telekom, the largest privatisation on the horizon, is not expected until the end of next year at the earliest.

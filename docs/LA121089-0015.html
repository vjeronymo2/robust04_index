			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> NO DICE: Gearing up for a couple of local concert dates, heavy-metal comic  extraordinaire Sam Kinison has been making the rounds, stopping in at the China  Club Monday night (where he roared through a particularly venomous rendition of  "Wild Thing") and -- amazingly -- showing up at 7:45 a.m. for a chat with  KLOS-FM morning brats Mark &amp; Brian. The highlights: Kinison denied a report  that he had his bodyguards beat up a loudmouth at a recent Don Henley concert  ("It was one of my fans -- when they threw him out, he yelled 'We got him  S-A-A-A-M!!!"). He also did not deny having an affair with Jessica Hahn, took a  call from a 4-year-old fan (who sang his version of "Wild Thing") and helped  out a young listener in trouble with his folks by phoning his mom and wooing  her, Kinison-style, by suggesting that he drop by with a bottle of vodka and "a  thousand milligrams of Valium." But Kinison really got revved up at the mention  of vile-comedy rival Andrew Dice Clay, whom he gleefully mimicked ("Hickory  dickory dock, I'm the new comic trying to take over rock, I stole my image from  Sam, I'm all a big scam"), ridiculed ("I remember Andy when he was doing John  Travolta tributes") and scorned ("It's a bitter war. I hope he experiences  death by cancer from the inside. I hope his stomach explodes! AWWWWGGHHHH!!").  </P> <P> We figure the ball is in Dice's court now. When Mark &amp; Brian offered  Kinison a pair of tickets to Clay's Forum show this week, he bellowed: "I  WOULDN'T WIPE MY WINDSHIELD WITH THEM!!!"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Discussion" rubric: </F> "Draft Russian Federation Labor Code Unveiled to Public. No  One Likes It"]    [Text] A "roundtable" to discuss a draft Russian Federation  Labor Code took place at the Trade and Industry Chamber  yesterday. Taking part in the meeting were Federal Assembly  deputies, officials of the president's and government's staffs,  representatives of business circles and trade unions, as well as  law scientists.    The draft code was presented by Sergey Panin, chief of the  Ministry of Labor legal administration. According to Mr. Panin,  the drafters tried to take into account all suggestions and  critical amendments that had come in after the fundamentals of  the Labor Code had been discussed. At the present stage the  draft law consists of three parts: the Principles of the  Russian Federation Labor Legislation; Minimum State Guarantees  of Russian Federation Citizens' Labor Rights; and Protection of  Workers' Labor Rights.    In accordance with the text of the draft, "the main  objective  of state policy in the sphere of socio-labor relations is the  provision for every able-bodied person of conditions making it  possible for him to maintain the necessary living standard by  his work." The code incorporates the principle of delimitation  of powers between the central bodies and the power structures of  Federation components in the field of regulation of socio-labor  relations, outlines the fundamental rights and duties of the  employee and the employer, and envisions mechanisms for the  resolution of labor conflicts. Mr. Panin deemed it necessary to  point to the fact that an "appreciable lowering" of the level of  social guarantees compared to the previous legislation indicated  in the text of the draft does not signify their real lowering,  while this only makes the social protection mechanism more  specific and streamlined.    At the same time, participants in the discussion subjected  the draft to sharp and largely scathing criticism, pointing out  its inconsistency and unconstructiveness. A degree of summing  up was done by Valeriy Rastorguyev, spokesman for the Federation  Council social policy committee, who pointed to the fact that in  its present shape the Russian Federation Labor Code had small  chances of passing through both chambers of the Federation  Assembly.</p>

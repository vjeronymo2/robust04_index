			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ana Ansiani article: "Where Are the Sigurimi Collaborators </F> Today?"]    [Text] People, especially public figures, are suffering  from an anxiety complex. "...surveillance by the State  Intelligence Service [ShIK]"... Courageous denunciations in the  press, complaints of telephone bugging, the Probati and Ngjela  cases with the grim interpellations with Mr. Sigurimi, banished  three years ago, at least in one of its functions: the  harassment of party opponents, or of critics of reality in  general and of the president in particular. Of course, data on  what citizens think in private cannot be compiled without an  information network. No intelligence service so far has ever  worked solely with its permanent staff and without  collaborators. During the reform of the ShIK, 90 percent of the  former Sigurimi staff were removed from their posts and replaced  with new people. However, what has happened to the former  secret information network, which had its own invisible threads,  its hangers-on, its internal organization, and its autonomous  operation? Have these structures been dismantled and their  members laid off, or have they simply been left to decay? Where  today are the Sigurimi collaborators, the underwater portion of  the intelligence iceberg? And -- who are the ShIK's informers?  Has a new network been created from scratch, or have old  connections been partially maintained? We have reason to  believe that the latter is true, when we see today, as in days  of yore, certain "curious" individuals at whom people point  their fingers as "provocateurs." This intertwining of two  networks, this interference of old connections with new, could  be very dangerous for Albanian politics, and even for the  country's security. The indecisive attitude of parliamentary  deputies to the question of the files of former Sigurimi  collaborators further muddies the issue. They all say they  favor opening the files, especially when they relate to people  involved in politics and holding important state offices.  However, when the time comes for a decision, such a decision is  always postponed for no convincing reasons. There has not even  been the kind of broad discussion and debate as took place in  the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, and elsewhere.  It seems that the files will be a blackmail weapon for a long  time, and that politicians will unhesitatingly use them against  each other. Opening the files would eliminate suspicious, yet  there are certain persons who have decided to keep suspicions  alive. They need these suspicions in order to attack each  other, to denigrate whoever is next in line, to eliminate those  who are no longer useful, etc. The latest example has been the  fragment of some kind of file that RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE winkled  out from who knows where, concerning the deputy Petrit Kalakula,  the most recent rebel within the ranks of the Democratic Party.  How quietly the Pobrati affair blew over. The ShIK chairman  was called to an interpellation in parliament, was asked  questions, and that was the end of it. Information on  well-known intellectuals had been sought, but the intellectuals  made no murmur. Information had been sought on deputies, but  they, even ministers, forgot everything after a verbal protest  in parliament.... It seems that everything is just a simple  show, an ordinary game in which everybody has his own role and  is conscious of the roles of the others. Students of political  history consider the involvement of secret services in political  power games to make the most interesting and mysterious chapters  in history books. Such a thing is credible, because there is a  moral to it. How moral is the role of the ShIK in Albanian  politics?</p>

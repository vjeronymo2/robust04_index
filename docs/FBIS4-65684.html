			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- As compared to the year before,  Germany's imports from Latin America decreased by 15.1 percent  to 12.4 billion German marks [DM] in 1993. All big Latin  American countries were affected by it, which is shown by  statistics published by the FRG Economics Ministry in Bonn on  Thursday [19 May]. Smaller countries like Bolivia and Paraguay  registered gains.    However, German exports to Latin America increased by 7.2  percent to DM14.8 billion. For the first time after 1991, this  resulted in a trade surplus for Germany again.</p>

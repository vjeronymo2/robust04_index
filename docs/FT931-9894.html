			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Observer: Heavy loss Before Britain loses Storehouse's David Dworkin to a new life in California, Observer thinks readers should know the secrets of the BhS and Mothercare group chief executive's diet. After all, even though by no means porky on reaching BhS from America in late 1989, he has since personally shed as much further excess fat as he took out of the business. His intake is apparently based on regular helpings of carbohydrate. Favourite lunch is a jacket potato followed by yoghurt, but he denies wandering around the head office eating a bowl of Rice Krispies. Whenever his blood sugar is a little low he unzips a banana. Another ingredient, which may account for the breath of fresh air he has brought to Storehouse, is plenty of exercise. But since he sometimes takes it to the extent of working in cycling shorts, he may well be better suited to life on the west coast.</p>

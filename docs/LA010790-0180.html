			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREE PET TATTOOING OFFERED BY COUNTY  </P> <P> Pet owners brought their dogs, cats and even a snake to animal clinics Saturday  to launch a county program designed to increase the chances of reuniting lost  pets with their masters by tattooing identification numbers onto the animals.  </P> <P> Although the snake was not eligible, about 300 other pets were tattooed free of  charge and their numbers recorded in a computer database, said Frank Andrews,  director of the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control.  </P> <P> "We've been trying to think of some way to improve the dismal number of animals  who are returned to their owners," Andrews said. "This seems to be a good way  to improve the bad image of our dogcatchers."  </P> <P> Andrews said animals tattooed with license information can be traced to their  owners immediately through computer records.  </P> <P> Because of this, he said, tattooing should also help ease overcrowding at  animal shelters and prevent lost pets from ending up in research labs.  </P> <P> Animal control officers have been trained to look for a dime-sized green dot  tattooed inside the ears of stray animals, Andrews said.  </P> <P> If a dot is there, then the officer knows an identification number can be found  "inconspicuously" tattooed in the animal's groin area.  </P> <P> The program has been so successful, Andrews said, that in its first three weeks  of testing last month, seven tattooed animals who ran away from home were  recovered.  </P> <P> Andrews said all county animal shelters soon will be equipped with tattoo  equipment, and the procedure will be performed at no cost indefinitely.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 pets countywide have been tattooed so far.  </P> <P> "The procedure is relatively painless," Andrews said. "Most bigger animals, fat  animals and large animals just lay there and let it happen, but some kitties  object to the buzzing noise."  </P> <P> Andrews said officials expect to have about 10,000 animals tattooed and filed  on computer by the end of the year.  </P></p>

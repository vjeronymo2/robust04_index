			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China's recent  foreign exchange reforms are expected to have a favorable impact  on Hongkong's external trade, according to economic monthly  released by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation here  today.    China's reforms, begun on December 29, will help the country  in its bid to rejoin GATT and remove some of the obstacles to  the opening up of the country's banking system. In the longer  term significant benefits are likely to derive from the improved  efficiency of the Chinese economy, the monthly stated.    On the other hand, the monthly added, a number of  uncertainties and problems may be created by the reforms.  Inflationary pressure may be generated by the higher prices of  some imports, some domestic enterprises will incur higher costs  and domestic exporters will be exposed to greater foreign  exchange risks.    On the impact of the foreign exchange reforms for Hongkong's  economic growth, the monthly said, the reforms are primarily  expected to affect cross-border trade and investment flows  between Hong Kong and the mainland as well as the territory's  monetary sector, provided the new measures are introduced  smoothly.    Hong Kong manufacturers engaged in outward processing and  joint venture activities in China will generally benefit from  the unification of the exchange rates, since some of their  renminbi outlays that were previously purchased at the official  rate can now be obtained at swap rates, the monthly said    This will reduce operating costs and mean that prices can be  more competitive in international markets. The change will help  to support Hongkong-mainland trade related to outward  processing, which currently accounts for over 70 percent of  Hongkong's imports from China and around half the territory's  exports to the mainland.    Hong Kong is also expected to benefit from an increase in  re-exports of Chinese origin. The effective devaluation of the  renminbi due to the exchange rate unification and the fact that  state enterprises are no longer obliged to sell part of their  foreign exchange earnings to the government at the official rate  will help boost the exports of Chinese state enterprises.    In general, the monthly said, the reforms are likely to  stimulate trade flows between the mainland and Hong Kong,  although the impact may not be significant in the short term.  The main benefit is expected to come from the long-term  efficiency improvements in the Chinese economic system.    Hong Kong, as the largest foreign investor in China,  contributed 76 billion U.S. dollars, or two-thirds of total  contractual foreign investment in China between 1979 and 1992.</p>

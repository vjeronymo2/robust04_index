			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing is set to announce tough measures this week  to fight inflation by restoring price control on at least 24  commodities and services.    And in what amounts to a setback to price reform, the State  Planning Commission will be given more authority to ensure that  prices will not rise beyond the ability of urban citizens to  absorb the shock.    Informed sources said the commission would soon announce a  system of inspection and supervision to stem urban inflation,  which has reached more than 20 percent according to figures.    Under the new regulations, enterprises and commercial  outlets  that want to increase the prices of their products by up to  eight percent will have to register the increase with their  local Price Administration Bureau.    However, businesses which intend increasing prices beyond  the  eight percent ceiling -- or which plan to raise their prices  more than once within a designated period -- will have to apply  beforehand to the bureaus.    It is understood the commission has asked the bureaus to  turn  down most such applications through "outright denials of  approval, persuasion, interference, and providing guidance" to  the enterprises concerned.    Bureaus in all cities must report local price levels to a  price coordinating centre at the commission twice a month.    The commission will be empowered to impose strict price  ceilings on particular commodities and services should an  emergency such as panic buying occur.    At least 24 commodities and services will be subjected to  price control. They include foodstuffs like grain, oil, and  vegetables, popular clothing items; consumer products such as  colour television sets and bicycles; and services such as rent,  water consumer electricity, and various types of transport.    The sources said it was the first time the Government had  imposed controls on the services. Most cities will be asked to  stockpile essential commodities, particularly grain and staple  foodstuffs.    The sources added that before the National People's Congress  (NPC) opened on March 10, the Government would announce two  largescale, nation-wide price inspections. Analysts said  Beijing was anxious to convince the populace inflation could be  brought under ten per cent the goal for the mid-199Os.    They said the central Government had timed the announcement  of the measures ahead of the NPC, where inflation, which was  inching towards 30 percent in many cities, would likely become a  contentious issue. Economic analysts in Beijing, however,  indicated they were not optimistic that the price spiral could  be controlled soon. A cut in credit would hurt state  enterprises, and the analysts said Beijing could not deal with  the political problems that would follow in the wake of the  massive layoff of workers. Bank loans are scheduled to grow by  at least 470 billion yuan (HK$471 billion [Hong Kong dollars])  this year, while the currency in circulation would expand by 180  billion yuan. "Beijing has sacrificed price reform to fight  inflation," said a Western diplomat. "Enterprise reform will  also be dealt a blow as the powers earlier granted them to fix  the prices of their products will be largely suspended."</p>

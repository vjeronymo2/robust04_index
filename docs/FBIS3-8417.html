Lexa is state secretary for privatisation and head of the  Government Office.    The radio quoted Lexa as saying he was informed about the  decision in a letter from the Police Investigations Office.    Following Slovak President Michal Kovac's refusal last  November to appoint Lexa, who is a close associate of Premier  Vladimir Meciar's, as the privatisation minister, Lexa publicly  questioned Kovac's expertise and morale, which led to the  prosecution.    After a lengthy investigation, Lexa was found to be innocent  under criminal law and was referred to a district court for  consideration on a breach of regulations punishable by a fine.    His prosecution was sanctioned by the alleged violation of  the articles 102 and 103 on defamation of the republic and the  president of the republic. Bearing in mind the Helsinki  Citizens' Committee efforts aimed at the removal of the two  articles from the Slovak Criminal Code, the Slovak Government  meanwhile raised the matter in parliament but the passage of a  respective amendment was blocked by opposition deputies who  thought the government proposal was a ploy intended to free  Lexa, a man of the government, of the accusations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gian Franco Svidercoschi: "A Promise to the </F> Pope"]    [Text] Operation Image was a complete success. Bill  Clinton can return home to boast of the complete success of his  mission to the Vatican. The pope, standing up to welcome him  without once leaning on his cane, was the first to impart some  solemnity and at the same time cordiality to the meeting.  Ambassador Flynn went rather too far by talking in terms of a  "family meeting." But perhaps partly because of the symbolic  scenario, because of the festive atmosphere that prevailed  within the Vatican -- yesterday was the feast of Corpus Domini  and offices were closed -- the U.S. President's visit ultimately  acquired the status of a major event.    But it was nevertheless an image operation. Clinton will not  be able to do the same as his predecessor, Bush. Bush came to  the Vatican in November 1991, in the wake of the dispute with  the Vatican over the Gulf War. But then, just 24 hours after  his audience, during his visit to Spain, he announced the U.S.  involvement in the Balkans, thus responding positively to the  pope's pressing request to him the previous day.    Clinton, however, cannot do this. Their stances remained far  apart on the main issue of their conversation -- the document on  population and development being drafted for the Cairo  conference. John Paul II reaffirmed the Vatican's criticisms of  the plan, considering it lacking a clear ethical vision and  judging it the prelude to an indiscriminate international  legalization of abortion. Hence the appeal, as in Denver, to the  "responsibility" of a great nation, which "originally and  through the course of its history has always advocated the  ethical values that lie at the root of any civilization."  Clinton argued his own case. He cited the pledges made during  his presidential campaign (when, however, he rejected the  primitive pro-life stance) to correct the orientations of the  1984 Mexico City conference. He spoke about "safe, legal, and  rare" abortion -- but only as a solution to the tragedy of the  millions of women who die every year as a result of abortions  performed with no guarantees of safety. He spoke about "access"  to contraception, but only in order to curb population growth  within the context of impoverished areas suffering environmental  decline.    Their stances remain distant. "And I do not think that the  pope will change his mind," a White House spokesman said. But  -- and this is the novelty -- Clinton apparently promised some  changes to the Cairo document, at least in its language, an  attenuation of some excessively peremptory statements. And as  early as yesterday he provided some useful explanations: For  instance, that, unlike China, he definitely does not regard  abortion as a method of birth control. So the final result was  an unprecedented joint commitment to a policy to promote a  "responsible growth" of the population (demanded by the United  States) and at the same time to reaffirm the "central role" of  the family (a Vatican demand).    This is certainly a very significant result. It joins the  many points of agreement on the international situation, and  especially the anxiety over the serious restrictions of  religious freedom in Asia (China and Vietnam), the Islamic  states' role in the future of the world, and the definition of  the status of Jerusalem. So though in Mexico City in 1984  Reagan's United States was the Vatican's number-one ally over  the population issue, Clinton's United States could now be so on  the front of peace and international justice.</p>

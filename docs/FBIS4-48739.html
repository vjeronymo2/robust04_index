			<p>BFN     [Text] The guest of Afrique Soir is Alexis Kanyarengwe, the  president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Our special envoy,  Monique Mas, has met him and asked him to explain the position  of his movement toward the UN decision to deploy 5,500 blue  helmets for a humanitarian mission in Rwanda:    [Begin recording] [Kanyarengwe] We in fact agree that a  humanitarian force should come and help and facilitate the  activities of the humanitarian organizations operating in our  country, and also to help people in dangerous situations,  especially those confronted by a crazy militia and its  massacres. But what we don't understand is why their number is  quite high in proportion to the task assigned to them. We find  the figure of 5,000 is [word indistinct]. We thought a force of  about 2,000 men would be enough.    [Mas] You seem to be worried in case this humanitarian force  becomes a buffer force?    [Kanyarengwe] It has often been noticed that for one reason  or another, there is always an authority which tries to deflect  such a force from its task [words indistinct]. We are not  afraid of this and we are not excessively worried about it. If  this ever happens, we will take appropriate measures. Once  again, we insist that this force should not exceed 2,000.    [Mas] Tell us what will specifically happen -- are you ready  to hand over the airport which is under your control to the  United Nations?    [Kanyarengwe] Yes, we discussed with the United Nations this  issue of turning the airport into a neutral zone. We replied  that since we fought many battles to conquer this airport, we  intend to keep it under our control and in security and put it  at the disposal of the United Nations for any activity it wishes  to undertake.    [Mas] The international community is urging you to end the  war and agree to a cease-fire. What would make you end the war  and what are your conditions?    [Kanyarengwe] We would have hoped that the international  community would help us to end the war from day one when the  massacres started, when people were being mutilated, maltreated,  and tortured, to put an end to the work of the assassins in the  authorities. There was an urgent need to put an end to  massacres, but instead, the international community came quickly  to the help of their nationals and turned its back on us.  Finally, it was only after thousands of people had been killed  that the international community expressed its indignation. We  are shocked and we were shocked by this attitude. The  international community has abandoned us. [end recording]</p>

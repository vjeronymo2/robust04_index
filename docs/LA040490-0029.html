			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY TO DOUBLE PERMIT FEES FOR FILMMAKERS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to more  than double permit fees charged to Hollywood filmmakers, despite concern from  industry officials that the increase might drive them elsewhere.  </P> <P> County Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon recommended that the fees  production companies pay to film in unincorporated areas and three independent  cities be raised from $110 per day to $200, effective July 1.  </P> <P> The fees will increase to $220, plus an adjustment based on the consumer price  index, in January, 1991, and will rise an additional $20 plus an index  adjustment in January, 1992.  </P> <P> Dixon had initially proposed increasing the fees to $310 per day to offset the  cost of running the county's film permit office. But after film industry  officials protested, the supervisors ordered county officials to negotiate with  the industry.  </P> <P> Although Dixon said the fee increase approved by the supervisors was a  compromise, several industry officials testified against the increase and  expressed concern that it would drive filmmakers to cheaper jurisdictions.  </P> <P> Along with the increase, the board voted to transfer management of the film  permit office from the county to the Economic Development Corp., a private  nonprofit group.  </P></p>

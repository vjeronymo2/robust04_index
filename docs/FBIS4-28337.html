			<p>BFN     [Text] At a 5 June news conference in Fukuoka city,  Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono commented on the  trilateral talks among Japan, the United States, and the ROK on  the DPRK's suspected nuclear development program. He said: "I  hope the three countries will fully discuss measures to have a  UN resolution adopted."    His remark indicates that he is opposed to the government's  positive stance on a plan for Japan, the United States, and  South Korea to independently impose sanctions on North Korea if  the UN Security Council fails to adopt a resolution calling for  sanctions.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Should I keep my annuity? I HAVE built up a substantial fund of money with an insurer under an old-style Section 226 self-employed retirement annuity scheme. This is now fully paid-up and no further contributions will be made. I am 63, but did not plan to cash it in until I am at least 65 and possibly (since I am not under immediate pressure) later, on the reasoning that a normal annuity purchase is best left as long as possible. In due course, however, this fund will form the greater part of my retirement pension. I have already noted and am attracted to the concept of the with-profits annuity. My fund with the insurer has accrued over past years on a with-profits basis and appears to have done well. My company suggests (without making a recommendation) that I consider purchasing such an annuity now rather than holding on as outlined above. What are the pros and cons of this course? We can see little reason for purchasing an annuity now if you do not need the income. The terms of the policy should enable you to go on rolling up investment income free of tax until you need it and if this is to age 66 or 67 the cost of each pound of annuity will be less because you are older and have a shorter life expectancy. Thus you gain on two fronts: one, you will have a bigger money pot when you eventually retire as a result of further investment, and two, each pound of that bigger fund will buy you more pension. You can add to this pot by paying one-off single premiums each year from now until the date you eventually retire. We cannot think why anyone should be recommending you to take your annuity now when the annuity payments will merely be added to your present income and therefore taxed at your top rate. The only plausible reason we can imagine is that the person hopes to earn a sales bonus by getting you to buy such an annuity with his company. When you eventually retire it might pay you to shop around a few of the bigger insurance companies to see which is offering the best annuity rates at that time, but take care that you are comparing like with like. It may be wise to seek independent advice; if you do, make sure that the adviser is genuinely independent and discloses his or her terms of business and informs you of the commission rates on the policies on offer before you sign anything.

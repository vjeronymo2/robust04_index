			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY'S STOCK MARKET HAS SAME WOES AS CAPITALIST COUNTERPARTS  </P> <P> Each Tuesday at 10 a.m., a group of well-heeled MBA types stroll into a posh  downtown bank building, take their seats around a wooden table and engage in  genteel discussion for 40 minutes as they buy greengrocery firms and sell  chemical companies.  </P> <P> This is Hungary's stock exchange, a fledgling market that poses little threat  to Wall Street. But the only stock and bond market in the Soviet Bloc suffers  many of the same ailments -- and then some -- of its big brother exchanges in  New York, Tokyo and London.  </P> <P> Since its founding in December, 1987, Hungary's stock market has been buffeted  by several insider trading scandals, a dangerous drop in prices and sluggish  trading caused by economic and political instability.  </P> <P> Today, "the main problem is liquidity and lack of buyers," said Tibor Papp, a  spokesman for the exchange's Securities Trading Committee who admits that  "things are not moving as quickly as I'd like."  </P> <P> In many ways, Hungary's stock exchange -- the nominal market for the country's  $600 million worth of corporate stocks and bonds -- is merely a showcase. Only  about 5% of all stock trades are conducted at the Tuesday meetings (from a low  of $161,300 to the high so far of $483,000); the real buying and selling takes  place throughout the week over the counter in bank offices where up to $9  million worth of shares are traded weekly.  </P> <P> A typical Tuesday's business is three share transactions and 10 bond deals,  Papp said. About 60 public limited companies with negotiable shares are listed  on the stock exchange, and there is also a small but growing bond market with  about 400 issues.  </P> <P> At some meetings, foreign television crews and observers seem to outnumber the  traders, who call out bids in a desultory fashion and appear discomfited by the  scrutiny. And for those used to Western market frenzies, these traders seem  almost medically sedated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Needs Good Companies  </P> <P> But this is still Communist Hungary, after all, and full-fledged capital  markets exist only in the hopeful future.  </P> <P> "The first task is to create companies that are profitable and are good  investments. It will take time," said George Soros, a Hungarian-born money  manager in New York who runs the $1.8-billion Quantum Fund there.  </P> <P> Soros recently helped launch the First Hungary Fund, the East Bloc's first  mutual fund, which aims to raise $50 million to invest in Hungarian firms, a  much-needed idea in a country where small business loans and credit are  virtually non-existent.  </P> <P> No one expects Hungary's Wall Street experiment to takeoff like Sputnik.  Financial experts both inside and outside the country say it will take several  years for the exchange to mature and will depend on how successfully Hungary  can privatize its state-owned firms and create the infrastructure for a market  economy.  </P> <P> The past year has seen sweeping change: New laws encourage Western-style  commercial banks and allow private Hungarian firms to hire up to 500 employees.  Foreigners may buy Hungarian firms, and anyone may raise capital by issuing  shares. In addition, Hungary has introduced bankruptcy laws and has started  taxing its citizens, in part by employing the East Bloc's only value-added tax.  </P> <P> But Hungary's financial leaders also realize that passing laws is only half the  battle -- implementing them is much more difficult.  </P> <P> And the stock market's growth is hampered by the fact that Hungary is an odd  mingling of capitalist and socialist economies. For instance, the forint, which  has been devalued by 11% in the past year, remains a non-convertible currency.  </P> <P> For investors who want to repatriate their earnings, "that is certainly a major  problem," said Andrew Sarlos, a Hungarian-born money manager based in Toronto  who co-founded the First Hungary Fund.  </P> <P> So is the typical Hungarian prospectus, which runs six pages but does not  include any of the hard facts that Westerners demand. Another problem is  converting arcane Hungarian accounting practices to generally accepted Western  methods.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought Before News  </P> <P> Then there is insider trading, which Hungary's stock market mavens view with  less concern than their Western counterparts. "We have a small market and with  insider trading, at least it's trading. If we put too many rules, it will kill  the market," Papp said.  </P> <P> He won't get specific but says that in several cases employees with inside  information bought company stock the day before directors announced news that  drove up the price.  </P> <P> No action was taken because Hungary has no law to prohibit such actions.  Parliament, however, is expected to pass a comprehensive Stock Exchange and  Securities Act this November that would squelch insider trading.  </P> <P> "We'll feel much more secure when we have securities laws," Papp said. "If  companies go bankrupt and investors lose money, it could halt the market.  </P> <P> Another goal is selling state factories to foreign investors who would then  issue and trade stock on the Hungarian Stock Exchange. But sometimes, the  government cannot determine who owns the firms and is authorized to sell them.  </P> <P> Other times, there are no buyers.  </P> <P> "Maybe if they didn't put so many dogs on the market they'd have better luck,"  said one Western diplomat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expect Faster Growth  </P> <P> Hungary had a lively stock exchange from 1861 until 1948, when the country's  new Communist rulers closed it down.  </P> <P> But Hungary, which led the East Bloc in economic reform under longtime leader  Janos Kadar's "goulash Communism," opened a small bond market in 1983. It has  grown steadily, and the new laws will only accelerate that growth.  </P> <P> The First Hungry Fund is the brainchild of Soros and Sarlos, who have retained  Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the New York-based brokerage, to market the fund.  Other key players are the private sector arm of the World Bank and Hungary's  central bank.  </P> <P> Small investors need not apply. Investors are asked to contribute $500,000 for  five years and are guaranteed that they can recover their initial investment  after five years -- in hard currency. Most will probably come from outside  Hungary. Inside, many residents harbor a distrust of the economy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bonds Almost Crashed  </P> <P> And with good reason. The 1987 Wall Street debacle caused dangerous waves on  the Budapest exchange and prompted many Hungarian investors to sell their  stock, Papp said.  </P> <P> In addition, the bond market almost crashed in late 1987. Hungary's money  managers had sold tens of millions of dollars in bonds to citizens at fixed  rates of 11%, a good buy when Hungary's inflation rate was 6%. But when  inflation soared unexpectedly to 17%, the state was forced to step in and  repurchase many of its bonds to keep the market from collapsing. Today, the  bonds are still 20% off of their face value.  </P> <P> But lured by new business, a number of Western companies have jumped into the  financial fray. The Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. accounting firm is advising  Hungarian firms on investment prospectuses and Western auditing practices.  Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., which expects to open a Budapest office this fall,  has entered into a joint venture with five commercial banks to provide  accounting and financial consulting.  </P> <P> Soros, the savvy, high-profile money manager who has poured millions of his own  money into promoting Hungarian political reform, cautions that reforms should  move slowly or the entire house of Magyar cards may collapse.  </P> <P> While an ardent champion of his homeland, Soros hesitates when asked whether he  would sink his own money into shares traded on the Hungarian Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> "I'd have to look very closely before I did."  </P></p>

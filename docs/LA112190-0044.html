			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERNARD DIAMOND; EXPERT ON PSYCHIATRY AND THE LAW  </P> <P> Bernard L. Diamond, a psychiatrist and legal scholar who introduced the concept  of "diminished capacity" to courtrooms, arguing that murder defendants  suffering from serious mental impairment should not be punished under the  standard criteria of law, has died.  </P> <P> UC Berkeley spokesman Jesus Mena said Tuesday that the university's  distinguished emeritus professor of law and psychiatry had died Sunday at Marin  General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif., of emphysema and heart failure.  </P> <P> He was 77 and had suffered a heart attack two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Perhaps Diamond's best-known testimony came during the trial of Sen. Robert F.  Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Sirhan.  </P> <P> Diamond argued that the trauma Sirhan had suffered during the bombing and  shelling of his homeland during the Arab-Israeli war had seriously impaired his  mental faculties.  </P> <P> He said Sirhan had placed himself in a trance during Kennedy's 1968 slaying and  should be judged outside the parameters used for "normal" murderers. Sirhan was  convicted of Kennedy's killing and is serving a life sentence.  </P> <P> Diamond's arguments for diminished capacity were put to use in many U.S.  courtrooms but were struck down by the California Supreme Court in 1982.  </P> <P> "In order to be guilty of a crime, there must be a guilty mind," Diamond would  say.  </P> <P> Diamond, a native of San Francisco, also was an expert regarding the effects of  hypnotic suggestion on courtroom testimony.  </P> <P> The author of more than 40 articles in major professional journals, Diamond was  opposed to the use of testimony from witnesses whose recollections of events  had been "freshened" under hypnosis.  </P> <P> An example came during Sirhan's 1969 trial, when Diamond testified that he had  hypnotized Kennedy's killer and had him relive the murder in the kitchen at the  Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He found that Sirhan could not recall the  shooting of the 1968 presidential candidate unless he was under hypnosis and  theorized that Sirhan's hypnotic remembrance of the assassination -- in which  Sirhan had convinced himself that he merely wanted to shake Kennedy's hand and  not shoot him -- could have been a lie.  </P> <P> He retired in 1980 but continued teaching until last year.  </P> <P> Just before his death, he had begun planning a children's program of  interactive exhibits at UC's Lawrence Hall of Science to explain the effects of  drugs and alcohol on the mind -- a project the institution expects to complete.  </P> <P> Diamond is survived by his wife, Ann Landy Diamond, a son and five daughters.  </P></p>

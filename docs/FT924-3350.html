			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (5): New law lifts uncertainty - The exchanges' response to the OTC challenge THE WORLD's futures and options exchanges are, to some degree, the victims of their own success. Their pioneering work in developing futures contracts on foreign currencies, debt, and equities converted a whole population of staid bankers and corporate money managers into hi-technology financial strategists. They created a financial industry called risk management, and in the process awakened Wall Street giants who have learned their game and are taking it beyond the bounds of exchange trading floors. Before the advent of derivatives, the financial world was simple. A fraternity of investment bankers catered to the vast financial needs of the world's governments, municipalities and corporations. They made their bets and took their lumps or rewards in private. Off to one side were the stock and commodity exchanges, where small investors, protected by financial guarantees and government-supervised rules, met the world's monetary giants. Those lines blurred in 1973, when Chicago's commodity exchanges adapted their futures contracts to the world of finance. Backed by financial physicists from the University of Chicago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), then best known for its pork-belly pit, invented currency futures. That same year, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) took a look at the stock market, listened the pricing theories of a couple of bright academics named Fisher Black and Myron Scholes, and created stock options. The creations transformed finance. Exchange volumes rocketed as futures and options appeared for every imaginable debt and equity instrument, and for new commodities like oil. The traders and the trades became increasingly sophisticated, as did the technology that aided them. Exchanges grew rich and dependent on spectacular annual growth rates. The exchange bonanza slowed in the US after 1987, about the same time a few of Wall Street's biggest investment banks started to apply exchange-style risk-management strategies to private transactions with their customers. The change in tide was predictable, given the constraints of the exchange instruments. Exchange-traded futures and options have standardised contract sizes, delivery dates, and specifications for the underlying securities. Corporate clients wanted tailor-made hedges for their portfolios. The resulting over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market exploded with even more force than financial futures, and now dwarfs exchange volume. Wall Street bankers say both markets benefited from the global expansion of financial markets in the 1980s, and that on-exchange and off-exchange products are compatible and not competitive. That sanguine view was not shared by the futures industry. Executives at the CBOT and the CME, stung by the challenge to their franchise, led a charge to have swaps, the over-the-counter instruments most often used to hedge currency and interest rate risk, classified as futures. US commodities law requires all futures to be exchange-traded. The exchanges were furious that their own regulatory constraints limited their flexibility to compete with the new OTC instruments. The battle was a delicate one. The exchanges were attacking top-tier investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Solomon Brothers, that were their biggest customers and often exchange members. If they won, the exchanges would retain their monopoly, but would have caused the collapse of a multi-trillion-dollar industry. In the end, Wall Street persuaded the exchanges that they shared important interests. After years of wrangling, the two groups teamed up this year to support legislation that exempted swaps from futures regulation, while accomplishing the long-delayed reauthorisation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The law, which was passed in October, relieves the swaps markets of regulatory uncertainty, and, in a twist, may let futures exchanges offer swap-like products without CFTC oversight. In the meantime, US futures and options exchanges have had time to measure the effect that OTC derivatives have had on their business. Some, like the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and the CME, have found that counterparties in energy and interest-rate swaps eventually come to the exchanges to lay off their risk. To the extent that swaps dealers educate potential customers and place a share of their trades in the futures pits, they are welcome business partners. 'We view the swaps markets as the commuter train that brings customers to CME's station,' says Jack Sandner, Chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In a bow to that business, most exchanges have modified their products to accommodate OTC traders. The Nymex in 1990 extended the delivery months for its crude oil futures out to 36 months, from its initial 18 months. Almost all the action in those new contracts are from swap traders. Like nearly every other US futures and options exchange, Nymex has also modified its rules so that institutional traders who demonstrate that they have swap market risk can take big positions with reduced margins. To accommodate a Dollars 3,000bn interest-rate swap market, the CME has long-dated the delivery months in its highly successful Eurodollar futures market out to five years. The Euro contract and interest-rate swaps have grown in tandem, with Eurodollar futures and options positions valued at about Dollars 2,750bn at the end of 1991. The CME's foreign currency futures haven't fared as well. Volume and market share is dropping as the OTC market expands. The CME failed in an attempt to launch a future to mimic the highly successful OTC currency swaps market. While they don't yet tailor-make derivatives, exchanges can do a few things OTC markets cannot. Exchange clearing-houses guarantee all trades, and take the opposite side to every futures and options transaction. This eliminates the credit risk and counterparty risk present in OTC trades. Price discovery is easier than in the OTC markets, because futures and options trades are reported immediately, and the prices are widely distributed. Since there are many traders in each futures pit, exchange-traded derivatives are also more liquid that bilateral OTC trades. Mr William Floersch, vice chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, believes that exchanges can compete with OTC derivatives. Noting that only the biggest investment houses have the capital assume the risk of OTC trades, Mr. Floersch says: 'There are enormous amounts of people with lots of capital who don't have access to the OTC market. We are interested in getting small and medium sized dealers into the (derivatives) business.' The CBOE may be the first exchange to construct a product that its customers can adjust to own their needs. It plans to begin trading 'flex options' during the first quarter of 1993. The product is aimed at institutional OTC customers, and will allow them to select any strike price and expiration out to five years. The flex options will initially apply to the CBOE's Standard and Poor's 100 and 500 stock index baskets. The trades will have Dollars 10m underlying value, much larger that its standard index options contracts. The CBOE has selected the most commoditised area of equity swaps, 'plain vanilla' in industry parlance, to attempt flex. Wall Street investment bankers grudgingly concede that flex options may fly. Corporate treasurers who have become accustomed to using swaps may be weaned from the OTC market with the credit guarantees of the CBOE's clearing-house and by its more competitive method of pricing. The CBOE and its New York rival, the American Stock Exchange, are also planning stock index options with quarterly expirations to accomodate fund managers whose performance, already linked to a stock index, is judged on a quarterly or year-end basis. The CBOE's index options typically expire at mid-month. If the CBOE is preparing a run on the OTC equity market, the tiny Philadelphia Stock Exchange is not ready to surrender the currency derivatives business to off-exchange trading. Like the CME, the Philex's attempt at currency cross rate options trading failed. However, the exchange, which has the largest exchange-traded currency options business in the US, is also planning month-end expirations, and some very short-dated products, with lifetimes of a week or two. 'We found we got the most activity in our products during the last weeks of their life,' said Joseph Rizzello, Philex's senior vice-president for marketing. Mr Rizzello believes that the Philex can tweak its standardised products enough to make them appeal to corporate customers. He also thinks foreign exchange trading can only expand globally, and he wants the Philex to have a piece of the action. Exchange-traded currency options are now a Dollars 6bn a day business, while their OTC counterparts are valued at Dollars 30bn. Of the nation's biggest exchanges, only the CBOT is uncomfortable about compromising with the OTC market. OTC derivatives bring some business into the exchange's 5- and 10-year Treasury note futures pits, but not enough to satisfy exchange officials. They believe the new Commodity Futures Trading Practices law gives exchanges equal rights to trade swaps free of regulation, and they plan a fiesty demonstration of their new freedoms. CBOT Chairman William O'Connor said the exchange was prepared to trade swaps on its electronic bulletin board as soon as practicable. A tiff between the CFTC and the CBOT over the interpretation of the law may delay that venture.</p>

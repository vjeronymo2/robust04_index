			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, May 3, IRNA -- The German Interior Ministry  has threatend to expel the official spokesman of Algeria's  Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in Europe, Rabeh Kabir, from the  country if he issues any press statements or even gives  telephone interviews, a source close to Kabir told IRNA Tuesday.    Kabir was given political asylum in Germany in February by  the asylum authorities but the Interior Ministry has challenged  the decision and the matter is in court now.    "Rabeh Kabir has to renew his stay permit every week or two.  We fear that he may be expelled from Germany," said the source  speaking to IRNA by phone from Germany.    "We are the representavites of the Algerian people but we  are  not allowed to speak. Where is the freedom of press and  freeedom of opinion which they proclaim in Europe?" he asked.  The source requested anonymity.    German authorities had held Kabir in custody for three  months  last year, but he was set free after a court rejected an  extradition request by the Algerian regime.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Europe reaches for its cereal The French are abandoning their croissants, Belgians their rolls and Italians their habit of nothing but espresso. Across Europe, people are swapping their traditional breakfasts for a bowl of processed grain and cold milk. The European market for breakfast cereals has grown in recent years to be worth some Pounds 1bn annually. Even during recession, most countries have increased consumption. For example, sales in France, the second largest European market for cereal after the UK, increased by 21 per cent in the year to May 1993. Europe has become an increasingly competitive market for cereal manufacturers. The recent acquisition of two cereal companies by the Dutch food and drinks company BolsWessanen, giving it almost 10 per cent of the European cereal market overnight, has brought into the open what industry insiders have known for some time. To compete seriously, companies must have the market share and financial muscle to back new products with heavy advertising. This year, Kellogg is estimated to be spending Pounds 6m in the UK alone to support its Corn Pops brand. Harrison &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate which sold, the companies to BolsWessanen, admitted it would not compete in this league by shedding what had been for it a successful, but peripheral, business. The European breakfast cereals market is controlled by a few large companies. According to the Food Industry Bulletin, Kellogg dominates with more than 50 per cent, followed by Weetabix at 9.5 per cent and Cereal Partners Worldwide, a joint venture between Nestle and General Mills, with 6 per cent. The arrival of CP in 1989 is widely credited with setting off the real explosion in the market. Within three years, through aggressive marketing and new product launches, it had won sales of some Dollars 348m (Pounds 225m). Naturally, Kellogg fought back. When CP launched its Golden Grahams, Kellogg came back a few weeks later with its own Golden Crackers. When CP introduced Clusters, Kellogg responded with Nutfeast. The battle even threatened a veteran campaigner, Tony the Tiger, of Frosties fame. CP lit upon Huey, Dewey and Louie, Donald Duck's nephews, as the cartoon warriors, for its Trio cereal in France. But the biggest beneficiaries of the battle between the cereal giants appear to have been the manufacturers of own label products. Own labels claim 11.5 per cent of total European cereal sales, second only to Kellogg. The European market for private label products is widely acknowledged to be growing at a faster rate than the branded sector. It is partly due to the increasing number of adults who are turning to cereal as a healthier breakfast option. In the UK, for example, the own label market is largely an adult market, focusing on mueslis and bran products. 'Staples deliver more steady virtues,' says Mr Mike Batten, marketing manager of the UK private label manufacturer, Telford Foods. 'They may have shown a dip in market share at times, but have stable volumes.' And with the prospect of an ageing population, 'staples and bran are good bets for the future'. In the UK, own label sales are estimated to be outperforming the overall breakfast cereal market's growth of 2 per cent a year. 'Private labels need size to compete,' says Ms Nomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman Sachs in the US. 'Who wants to fight for a share of a market which only has sales of about Dollars 40m?' But BolsWessanen, now with 50 per cent of the European private label market and the financial muscle to back this up, could force Tony the Tiger, and his rivals, Huey, Dewey and Louie, to sing even louder for their breakfasts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CEREAL MARKET SHARES OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         April/May 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All other brands                 23.9% Cereal Partners                   7.0% Weetabix                          6.5% Private label                    11.5% Kellogg                          51.1%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Goldman Sachs  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

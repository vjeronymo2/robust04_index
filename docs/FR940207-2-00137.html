(Comm. Print No. 96&hyph;IFC3, December 22, 1978). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new securities product upon a finding that the introduction of such new product is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the PSE to list and trade options on ADRs given that these options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, PSE rules require that the ADRs underlying these options meet the PSE's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible to manipulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the PSE make a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the PSE standard. The Commission believes however, that requiring the PSE to review the foreign securities underlying the ADR options to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along with other market safeguards, will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can be potentially manipulated. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, we would expect the Exchange to consider delisting an option on an ADR if the price and public float of the underlying security did not meet trading or size maintenance standards, or if the security underlying the ADR failed to meet other standards that raised manipulative concerns. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

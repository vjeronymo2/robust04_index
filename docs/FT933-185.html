			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / People: Non-executive directors David Puttnam's success as a film producer is well documented; less well known is his career as a non-executive director. For more than 10 years he has been a director of Anglia Television and is enthusiastic about his seat on the board of another media company - Village Roadshow of Australia. Now he is to join the board of Chrysalis - the record and television company where Chris Wright is chairman. The film producer says he has joined up because he was interested in learning about another part of the media world - records - and also perhaps helping Chrysalis on strategic alliances; Puttnam (left) and Wright already have a backer in common - the Japanese company Fujisankei. But Chrysalis shareholders will no doubt be reassured to note that Puttnam says he has absolutely no intention of taking the company into the film business.</p>

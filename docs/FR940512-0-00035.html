			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The sanctuary on the north and east sides of Buzzard Island contains 18.0 acres of shallow grassbeds along the northwestern edge and down the length of the east side of Buzzard Island. This area is primarily used by manatees as a feeding area. It has limited value as a warm-water sanctuary but contains abundant vegetation within a short distance from the warm waters in the southern part of Kings Bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sanctuary at Tarpon Springs contains 4.6 acres along the northwestern side of Banana Island. This sanctuary contains a small spring and is used by manatees as a thermal refuge, feeding, and resting area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 4.0-acre sanctuary on the north side of Warden Key provides a protected feeding area close to the warm-water sanctuaries in the south bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A standard survey of the sanctuary areas has been performed. The new areas will be delineated with buoys, as are existing sanctuaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public workshop, advertised in the Citrus County Chronicle, was held on March 21, 1991 to allow local citizens and other interested parties the opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of different sanctuary locations. A number of the alternatives discussed at the workshop were described in the Service's draft Environmental Assessment supporting the Finding of No Significant Impact that was approved by the Regional Director on August 23, 1991. The sanctuaries as they appear in this rule were selected on the basis of known use by manatees, availability of resources, and minimal impact on recreational use patterns and homeowners. These sanctuaries were implemented for two successive winters, 1991&hyph;2 and 1992&hyph;3, by two separate emergency rules (57 FR 5988 and 58 FR 5643) when completion of the rulemaking process was delayed. Legal notices were published in the ``Citrus County Chronicle'' prior to the implementation of the emergency rules, and each emergency rule offered the Environmental Assessment for review by members of the public. The proposed rule, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 13, 1993 (58 FR 28381), offered a public hearing, if requested, and announced a public comment period to end July 12, 1993. Following several requests for a public hearing, a notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34556) to announce a hearing and extension of the comment period. The hearing was held July 15, 1993, at the Coastal Region Library in Crystal River and the comment period was extended until July 30, 1993, to allow time for written comments to be received following the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the July 15, 1993, hearing, a clear majority of the verbal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and small minority of the written comments consisted of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements opposing either Federal regulations on recreational use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kings Bay and the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge in general,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or the procedures used to implement the sanctuaries. Few people  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the hearing addressed the sanctuary issue directly and there were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several misconceptions as to what the rule would include. Many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed a fear that future regulations would either eliminate or so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discourage recreational boating that the local economy would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negatively impacted. Many speakers believed the preferences of local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citizens and local political representatives should have been given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more weight. Others feared that future regulations would include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closing of the refuge, including the main spring. Although nearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every speaker expressed affection for, or at least acceptance of,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manatees in Kings Bay, many believed manatee protection areas should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be implemented in Kings Bay if they interfered with their ``right''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use public waterways. A few people questioned the soundness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the decision to increase manatee protection, although most also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated they were not aware of or had not read the research study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports. Many were not aware that a public workshop had been held  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early in the process and believed the final rule was already in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect. Although one person suggested redrawing one corner of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Buzzard Island Sanctuary to avoid funnelling boats into a narrow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> channel, none of the negative commenters offered any alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods to protect manatees from harassment and a few questioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether there was any need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the proposed rule were provided at the hearing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear up some commonly held misconceptions. For example, a petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 230 legible signatures protested against ``the closing down of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kings Bay for the Manatees for a period of 8 months per year.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the rule would prohibit boats from only a small percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bay (the total sanctuary area comprises less than 10 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bay and leaves all the boating channels and the main spring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> open), and because the period they would be in effect is only 41/2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months each year, it is likely these people had confused the dates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the seasonal county speed zone regulations with the shorter sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> season. Others may have had the same misconception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supportive comments were in the minority at the hearing but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituted a large majority of written comments received. Unlike  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hearing, which mostly represented only Citrus County residents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-thirds of the written comments came from Florida residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside Citrus County. Five letters were received from people who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spoke at the hearing and wished to reiterate or clarify their point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of view. One comment came from out-of-state. Of all the comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received, 74 individuals and 12 state and national organizations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including national and local chapters of the Audubon Society, Sierra  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Club, and the Humane Society, specifically stated they support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctuaries. Many supporters suggested additional manatee protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was needed. One-third recommended a ban on night diving. Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended allowing only passive observation of manatees. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people favored expanding the sanctuaries system further either by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adding a sanctuary south of Warden Key, extending the season to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier date, or creating corridors between sanctuaries. Emphasis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centered on the southern and eastern parts of the bay where manatee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregations are largest and most consistent. Save the Manatee Club  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Citrus County-based Friends of the Manatee proposed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time-sharing plan that prohibited public use of the refuge (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the main spring) during extended cold periods based on air and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water temperatures. Friends of the Manatee also recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enlarging the Banana Island Sanctuary, implementing a boat-free,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> swimming and diving area, and a diver-free manatee corridor between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctuaries. Both organizations also recommended a ban on night  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diving and allowing only passive observation of manatees. There were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two recommendations for a permit system similar to that used in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refuges to limit the number of divers using the refuge's main spring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many people on both sides of the sanctuary issue, expressed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for additional law enforcement effort to monitor not only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctuaries, but the speed zones, and to prevent manatee harassment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by divers and snorklers. There was also a clear consensus that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensive public education campaign would play a key role in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventing intentional and unintentional harassment of manatees. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crystal River Chamber of Commerce appealed to the audience that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of the outcome of the sanctuary issue, government,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation groups, and citizens should work together to educate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform the tens of thousands of visitors who visit the area each year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of how to interact with manatees in a safe and appropriate manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

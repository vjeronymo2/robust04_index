			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive" interview with Deputy Foreign </F> Minister Yosi Beilin by Qol Yisra'el correspondent Nawwaf  al-Nabbari in Jerusalem on 28 March; from the "With the Midday  Events" program -- report is interspersed with recorded portions  of Beilin speaking in Hebrew]    [Text] Our first question to Deputy Foreign Minister Dr.  Yosi Beilin was, naturally, about tomorrow's negotiations with  the Palestinians in Cairo and whether some of the sticking  points will obstruct or delay the negotiations. Dr. Beilin  hoped these points would not delay or obstruct the negotiations  and said substantive issues have been resolved. What remains,  he said, are quantitative and numerical issues such as the size  of the police force, including the Palestinian police force and  international observers. He expressed his conviction that when  the matter is related to quantitative and numerical issues, it  will be easier to reach an agreement. He hoped that  negotiations on the Gaza and Jericho agreement will also begin  tomorrow and that this issue will be dealt with quickly.    Regarding the phased settlement in Gaza and Jericho, Dr.  Beilin said the issue of the number of Palestinian police and  that of coordination and understanding between them on the one  hand, and the Israeli police and Army on the other, are still  unresolved. This is one of the issues to be discussed in  connection with the phased settlement just like the economic  issues. As for security arrangements in Hebron, talk is  revolving around small and limited numbers of Palestinian  policemen, and this continues to be the main topic of  disagreement. Naturally, the deputy foreign minister said,  there are no difficult substantive issue in connection with the  issue of Hebron or even the Gaza and Jericho agreement.    Asked whether the deployment of a Palestinian force is the  necessary step now to maintain security in Hebron or if it is  related to a step toward the Palestinian side aimed at  supporting the position of the Palestinian leadership and  consequently restoring the previous momentum of the  negotiations, Dr. Beilin said: I think this step is symbolic.  Moreover, I do not belittle such symbols. I do not think that  those policemen are the perfect solution for the present  security problem. I am aware of the problem between the  settlers and Palestinians in the territories. But, it is  important to demonstrate here that we are alert to what happened  in the aftermath of the massacre in Hebron. We, too, do not  overlook the dimensions of this action and we are ready to  undertake an unusual action. Talk is about a Palestinian force  in Hebron and an international presence. We have not planned  for this happening before a comprehensive agreement is reached.    Replying to another question, Dr. Beilin did not want to  discuss proposals about rounding up Jewish settlers in one or  two locations in Hebron to prevent friction and maintain the  security of both sides. He said the security authorities will  find the right answer to these issues.    Asked about the way the decisionmakers in Jerusalem view the  situation of the present Palestinian leadership as a leadership  to which one can talk in the future when a final solution is  reached, and the extent of the Palestinian leadership's ability  to make crucial decisions under critical circumstances like the  present ones, the deputy foreign minister said: I do not want  to discuss details of the final solution or the nature of the  political solution to the Palestine question although you know  how firmly I support a solution based on a confederation between  the Palestinians and Jordan. I am following what is taking  place in the Palestinian camp and I must in this regard say that  I was not taken by surprise. Everyone knew that at a decisive  moment there would be a difficult confrontation within this  camp. We have never thought that once a settlement is reached  or a solution between us and the Palestinians gets closer, all  the Palestinians will clap in support of the realistic current  within the PLO. Undoubtedly, I am aware of the difficulties  facing this current or trend in implementing its policy. But, I  also believe that this current will emerge from this process  stronger and firmer. When a change occurs on the ground and  when the Palestinian police force is deployed in Gaza and  Jericho, and in case autonomy is established--which will enjoy  economic and practical ability and authority--this current or  main party within the Palestinian camp will get stronger.    During his conversation with us, Dr. Beilin expressed  concern over the phenomenon of extremism and the violation of  law by certain factions living at the margin of the Israeli  society. He said he never thought such a phenomena exist,  particularly in this magnitude. He indicated that the decisions  made by the government proved that the Israeli Government has  realized the characteristics and dangers of the new situation  after the Hebron massacre and acted accordingly.    In light of the good chances that economic talks between  Israel and the Palestinians, which started in Paris on the  Palestinian customs system, will resume in Cairo tomorrow, we  asked Dr. Beilin about the economic future of Israel and the  Palestinians and whether the two economies should be disengaged.  He said: Had it been up to me and were it possible to start  right from the beginning, I would have certainly been inclined  to disengagement on the economic level between us and the  territories. Today, we cannot seriously talk about this because  the territories connection with Israel and vice versa is  extremely big and because the Palestinians depend mainly on us.  If we close the borders between the territories, or the  autonomous areas and Israel, it would mean thousands of  Palestinians would not be able to work in Israel and would face  unemployment problems. This would undoubtedly be immediately  reflected in the living standards in the autonomous Palestinian  areas. Therefore, although I wish to see economic and political  disengagement between the two sides, I know this is not  realistic and we have to continue the present situation, but  perhaps on a narrower scale.    Finally, we asked Dr. Beilin about talks with Syria and the  U.S. role in healing the rift between the two sides, as well as  bringing solutions closer to reality, he said: The Americans  returned from Syria, encouraged by Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad's readiness to push forward the peace process. I also  hope that negotiations with Syria will resume in the second half  of April. I hope the Americans will intensify their efforts  because I do not envisage any progress with Syria without  intensive U.S. intervention. Moreover, the prospects of  reaching an agreement with Syria in 1994 are still realistic and  possible.</p>

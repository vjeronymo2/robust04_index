			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> 6 BUILDINGS DESIGNATED AS CULTURAL LANDMARKS  </P> <P> The City Council has named six buildings as Long Beach cultural heritage  landmarks: the Fire Engine Company No. 8 building, the Golden House, the  Masonic Temple, the Pacific Tower, St. Anthony's Church and St. Luke's  Episcopal Church.  </P> <P> The firehouse, built in 1929 in Renaissance Revival style, is a prominent  neighborhood landmark in Belmont Shore.  </P> <P> The Golden House, constructed about 1886, is a single-story wooden house on  West 10th Street that is thought to be the oldest building in the city. The  York Rite Masonic Temple on Locust Street was built in 1927 and contains a  number of individual halls decorated in a different exotic revival style, such  as Egyptian and Roman.  </P> <P> The downtown Pacific Tower, a 12-story office building dating from 1923, was  the first "own-your-own" office building in the nation. St. Anthony's Church on  Olive Avenue is the leading Catholic Church in Long Beach and replaced an  earlier church destroyed in the 1933 earthquake. St. Luke's Episcopal Church on  Atlantic Avenue was rebuilt in the Gothic Revival style after the earthquake.  </P></p>

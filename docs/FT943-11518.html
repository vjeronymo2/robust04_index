			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Growth slows at Commerzbank Commerzbank's full operating profits rose just 11 per cent to DM438m (Dollars 278.9m) in the six months to the end of June, after being more than 30 per cent ahead in the first five months. According to an interim report published yesterday, partial operating profits - which exclude earnings from own-account trading - were up 17 per cent at DM968m. Earnings at this level, which were about 13 per cent higher after five months according to recent statements from chairman Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, were bolstered by a 7.6 per cent rise in interest income, to DM2.4bn. Commission earnings, up 5.6 per cent after five months, rose 11 per cent to DM966m. The main influence on the full operating profit was a 68 per cent fall, from DM273m to DM87m, in earnings from trading activities on the bank's own account. This was partly cushioned by a 14.6 per cent fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts, to DM710m. Own-account securities trading recorded losses in June. The bank blamed 'very difficult' market conditions for much of the first half, saying higher write-downs were necessary on the trading portfolio, the bank said. Although no details of the June losses were given, they appear to have been substantial, considering Mr Kohlhaussen's informal review of the first five months, when he said own-account business was showing a 'good three-digit-million result'. Commerzbank, the second of Germany's biggest banks to report this week, said it was satisfied with developments. Deutsche Bank group, which earlier this week reported a 1 per cent rise in full operating profits, also suffered a sharp fall in own-account trading. It ascribed this to adverse market conditions and a sharp increase in long-term interest rates. However, Deutsche's earnings performance was computed on the basis of a comparison with six-twelfths of profits for the full year. On this basis, Commerzbank's full operating income fell 2.4 per cent, while partial earnings tumbled 23 per cent. In a direct comparison with the first six months of last year, Commerzbank's pre-tax profits rose 72 per cent to DM728m, thanks in part to exceptional profits from the merger with Commerz-Credit-Bank Europartner, and the sale of a 15 per cent stake in the Karstadt retailing group.</p>

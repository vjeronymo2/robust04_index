			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. What UVA radiation doses are appropriate for use in the IPD test?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. When should the IPD response be read_immediately, or 1 or 2 hours after UVA exposure?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Is the IPD reaction relevant to protection of the skin from UVA damage?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Do the available data demonstrate that the IPD test is stable, nonvariable, and reproducible? Identify the data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Do the available data demonstrate that the IPD testing response obeys dose reciprocity over the anticipated irradiance range?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Are results of the PFA testing procedure relevant to protection of the skin from UVA damage? Identify the results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Do the data show that the PFA test obeys dose reciprocity? Identify the data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Can the interval after exposure at which PFA responses are read affect the results?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Does the heat or infrared energy delivered to the skin during PFA testing exposure affect the results?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Describe the specifications for an appropriate light source for the PFA testing method, e.g., spectral distribution, intensity, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has concluded, under 21 CFR 10.65, that it would be in the public interest to hold a public meeting to discuss the many questions and topics associated with UVA testing for OTC sunscreen drug products. The proposed rulemaking involves 21 CFR parts 352, 700, and 740; however, the discussion at the public meeting will be limited to part 352.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency requests information regarding UVA protection claims and UVA testing procedures from any interested person. However, the agency requests that only new or additional information not previously included in the rulemaking be submitted. Data should be specifically limited and relevant to the questions asked. Any individual or group may, on or before April 29, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above), comments and data relevant to the questions and topics on UVA protection and testing procedures contained in this document. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. All comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. It is not necessary to resubmit data and information submitted previously to this docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any individual or group interested in making a presentation at the meeting should contact Jeanne Rippere (address above). Presentations should only address the questions and topics listed previously. Persons interested in participating in the meeting must also send a notice of participation on or before April 29, 1994, to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). All notices of participation submitted should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and should contain the following information: Name, address, telephone number, business affiliation, if any, of the person desiring to make a presentation, summary of the presentation, and the approximate amount of time requested for the presentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Groups having similar interests are requested to consolidate their comments and present them through a single representative. Depending on the time available and the number of participants, FDA may require joint presentations by persons with common interests. After reviewing the notices of participation, FDA will notify each participant of the schedule and time allotted to each person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative record for the OTC sunscreen drug products rulemaking is being reopened to specifically include only the proceedings of this public meeting. The administrative record will remain open until July 31, 1994, to allow comments on matters raised at the meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Letters from W.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The extraordinary meeting of the central council  of the Slovak National Party [SNS] is taking place in Bratislava  today. Our collaborator, Renata Havranova, an editor of the  daily PRACE has telephoned us the following report.    [Begin Havranova recording] [passage omitted] Immediately  after the meeting opened, Igor Uhrik resigned his post as SNS  deputy chairman. In a written statement on his resignation, he  said that he was driven to taking that step by the group's dirty  methods, which centered around Deputy Prime Ministers Prokes and  Andel.    According to Uhrik, apart from lies and punching below the  belt, a certain group was not shrinking away from drawing a  picture of bloody conflicts in southern Slovakia only in order  to depose the party's leader, Ludovit Cernak. In his statement  he has rejected the destructive policy of Vladimir Meciar. I do  not mean to put a mark of legitimacy on this meeting by my  presence when it is apparent that corruption is one of the main  factors, Uhrik told Czech radio.    The fact is that SLOVENSKY DENNIK today published under the  heading: The price of Cernak's head, names of SNS members who  have received letters of appointment to lucrative posts in the  state administration and other posts. The first name on the  list is Vitazoslav Moric, who, in his own words, has the post of  head of Armex holding company, which exports arms abroad, in his  pocket. As a reward for removing Cernak, the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia has offered Jozef Prokes the post of  minister for foreign affairs and to Marian Andel the post of  deputy speaker of the Slovak Parliament, currently held by  Ludovit Cernak. In play are state secretaries [deputy  ministers] posts, the head of the Office for Labor Safety, and  chairman of a parliamentary committee, as well as promises made  by the ruling movement to where and to whom the post of head of  the State Inspection Office will not go.    Those whose names have been listed in the daily ignore with  a  smile questions about the truthfulness of the published article.  No one has, however, denied the report. Cernak said in an  informal conversation that the SNS congress will certainly be  convened, apparently in February. [end recording]</p>

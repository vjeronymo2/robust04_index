			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe introduces FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) will introduce an FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on February 25, three weeks after the launch of rival instruments on OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange. Last November, the London Stock Exchange awarded licencesto trade derivatives on the index of medium-sized UK companies to Liffe and OMLX. Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe chief executive, said that there were no plansto introduce options at this stage. 'If the contract is successful, we would look to introduce options at an early date, but the principal interest is in the futures,' he said. 'We think that will give us enough time to get a considerable slice of the business,' said Mr Lynton Jones, chief executive of OMLX. 'There is a lot of business that is being done by fund managers over the counter, on the understanding that it will be transferred on to the exchange (when the contracts are launched).'</p>

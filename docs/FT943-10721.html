			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Spider Systems jumps 25% to Pounds 719,000 Spider Systems, the Edinburgh-based company which makes products and software for communication between computers, increased pre-tax profits by 25 per cent, from Pounds 575,000 to Pounds 719,000, in the year to March 31. Turnover rose from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 21m, an increase of 22 per cent. Mr Martin Ritchie, managing director, said the improvement had been achieved in a year when much of the company's resources had been concentrated on its Spiderintegrator, which it said was the first device of its kind able to choose the cheapest route for communications between computers. It was launched in April. Orders taken for the Spiderintegrator in the first quarter of 1994-95 had exceeded forecasts and sales of its internetworking and communications server business had risen 50 per cent. Thanks partly to the Spiderintegrator, the company expects a 30 per cent rise in turnover this year. Spider's communications software and networking solutions businesses account for 40 per cent of sales. Mr Ritchie said that a Stock Exchange flotation was a 'possibility' as Spider developed.</p>

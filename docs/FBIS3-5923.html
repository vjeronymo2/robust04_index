			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 12 March, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa gave a speech to the Shinseito  Kochi Prefecture Chapter's meeting held in Kochi City. Ozawa  has been staying away from formal scenes -- such as coalition  leaders' meetings and the lower house plenary sessions -- from  the time that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa gave up on a plan  to reshuffle his cabinet. During this period, he has reportedly  been contacting younger Diet members of the Japan New Party  [JNP], and seeking measures for breaking the deadlock over  Japan-U.S. economic relations. He is scheduled to come back to  a meeting with coalition leaders early next week.    Ozawa has been "hiding himself" after the 2 March meeting  with Prime Minister Hosokawa. However, he met with three JNP  lawmakers on the evening of 7 March. According to Ozawa's close  associates, he has "already make contacts with the JNP several  times."    Political turmoil caused by discord involving Hosokawa's  cabinet reshuffle plan triggered moves toward the regrouping of  coalition parties. Under such circumstances, Ozawa probably  believes that a tie-up with the JNP is the key to power in the  merger of coalition parties.    In the 12 March speech, Ozawa stated "Japan-U.S. relations  are in very critical condition." His close associate said, to  settle pending issues between the two nations, Ozawa had met  with Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, after the  Hosokawa-Clinton summit in February. A government official  close to the prime minister said "Mr. Ozawa positively dealt  with" coordinating work on liberalization of the mobile phone  market. In connection with this, he is expected to visit the  United States shortly after 20 March.</p>

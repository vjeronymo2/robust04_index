			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRISONS GIVEN NEW POWER ON BOOKS, VISITS;  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT UPSETS LOWER COURT'S RULING ON INMATES' RIGHTS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today gave prison officials sweeping power to limit what  inmates may read and who may visit them.  </P> <P> Voting 6 to 3 in a case from Kentucky, the justices said officials are not  required to explain why they bar an inmate from having visitors.  </P> <P> The court rejected arguments that the state, by establishing a system  permitting visits, endowed inmates with a new right to see outsiders. Prisoners  do not have a right in such cases to "due process" -- for example, a hearing or  an explanation -- when they are denied a visit by someone, the court said.  </P> <P> By the same 6-3 split, the justices overturned a ruling by a federal appeals  court here that limited the authority of officials to censor reading material  behind bars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Broad Discretion'  </P> <P> "Where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials into the prison  . . . a regulation which gives prison authorities broad discretion is  appropriate," Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court.  </P> <P> Blackmun said regulations must be upheld as long as they are "reasonably  related to legitimate penological interests."  </P> <P> The court upheld the power of wardens to ban any publication at federal prisons  that they believe is "detrimental to the security, good order or discipline of  the institution or . . . might facilitate criminal activity."  </P> <P> Among the prisoners who challenged the publications rule is Jack Henry Abbott,  a convicted murderer and bank robber who achieved notoriety after he was  befriended by Norman Mailer and other prominent writers and editors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stabbing After Release  </P> <P> Six weeks after Abbott was freed in a work-release program in 1981 he stabbed  to death an aspiring actor outside a New York City restaurant where the victim  was working as a waiter.  </P> <P> Abbott's book on prison life, "In the Belly of the Beast," was critically  acclaimed.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today ordered further hearings to determine whether prisoners  should be allowed to read any of 46 publications officials want to ban.  </P> <P> But the justices said the officials do not have the burden of proving that any  of the publications threaten security, order or rehabilitation at the prison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leftist Paper Cited  </P> <P> Among the publications on the list, for example, was an issue of the Call, a  left-wing newspaper that included an article charging "inhumane treatment . . .  by racist guards" in federal prisons.  </P> <P> Today's ruling is a victory for the Justice Department, which urged the high  court to overturn a ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here.  </P> <P> Department officials cited uprisings in 1987 by inmates from Cuba in two U.S.  prisons as evidence that information from the outside can have "grave  consequences" in a prison.  </P> <P> The government said that between Sept. 1, 1986, and Aug. 31, 1987, about 1,700  publications were withheld out of 1.8 million sent to federal inmates.  </P></p>

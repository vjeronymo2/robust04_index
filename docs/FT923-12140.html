			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Schering divisions acquired by Witco SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is selling its industrial and organic chemicals operations to Witco, a US chemicals company, for DM660m (Dollars 410m). The Berlin-based group said the disposal, which is to take effect in the autumn, marked the first important step towards concentrating on its core businesses of drugs and agricultural chemicals. The sale was a blow to the VIAG group of Germany, which had bid to acquire the two units. William R. Toller, Witco chairman, said the acquisition would double the group's international business. Witco had sales last year of DM2.6bn. The group, which has European subsidiaries in the UK, France and the Netherlands, is an important producer of plastic additives and oleo-chemicals, in addition to oil products and construction materials. Schering was also considering bids from a number of companies for its electro-plating activities, which last year had sales of DM329m. It expects to announce a deal shortly. Schering's industrial chemicals turnover last year was DM454m, with total group sales at DM6.3bn. However, industrial chemicals sales fell 1 per cent compared with advances of 15 per cent for pharmaceuticals and 8 per cent for agricultural chemicals. Turnover in organic chemicals was DM440m, up 8 per cent. Apart from smaller organic chemicals subsidiaries in the UK, Spain and the US, most of Schering's industrial and organic chemicals output is concentrated in Germany. The Treuhand privatisation agency said Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate, had not yet acquired Werk fur Fernsehelektronik (WF) in east Berlin for Dollars 20m. It said no contract had been signed, although negotiations had reached a final stage.</p>

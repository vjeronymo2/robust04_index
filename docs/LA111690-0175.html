			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INFLATION SLOWS BUT ECONOMISTS SEE IT AS SIGN OF RECESSION  </P> <P> Consumer inflation slowed slightly in October, and the country's trade deficit  narrowed, but economists attributed today's seemingly upbeat developments to  the near-certainty that the nation has slid into a recession.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose 0.6% in  October, better than the 0.8% spurts that hit in August and September as oil  prices surged after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area, prices climbed 0.7% in October after rising 1% the  previous month. For the 12 months ending in October, prices jumped 6.7% -- the  highest yearlong increase since June, 1982, the government reported.  </P> <P> Nationwide, prices rose a modest 0.3% last month for products not related to  energy. Economists said this "core" rate, often seen as a better barometer of  inflation, probably stayed relatively low because the economic slump is holding  down prices.  </P> <P> "The sliding economy is preventing the oil and energy shock from causing a  runaway on inflation," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co.  </P> <P> Added analyst David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill:  </P> <P> "There's some good news on the inflation side, but bad news on the real side,  which is that the real economy is a mess."  </P> <P> Also today, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. merchandise trade  deficit narrowed 3.3% in September, the first improvement since June. But the  value of petroleum imports was at its highest level in nine years because of  escalating costs due to the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Imports dropped 2.4% to $41.3 billion despite a huge 28.5% jump in petroleum  imports. But exports also fell, down 2.2% to $31.8 billion. The deficit is the  difference between the two.  </P> <P> In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans' average weekly  earnings, after adjusting for inflation, plunged 2.1% in October. It was the  largest decline since a 2.3% drop in April, 1979. The average weekly wage,  before adjusting for inflation, was $349.85.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONSUMER PRICE INDEX  </P> <P> Oct. '89: +0.5%  </P> <P> Sept. '90: +0.8%  </P> <P> Oct. '90: +0.6%  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finland cuts interest rates Finland's central bank is to cut its base rate to 5.25 per cent from February 1 - the lowest level since 1954, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. It said the cut from 5.5 per cent had been made possible by the signs of economic recovery, an improvement in Finland's current account deficit and a slowdown in the country's inflation rate.</p>

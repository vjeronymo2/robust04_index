			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / People: Adding up for BT British Telecommunications has played safe in its choice of a new finance director, plumping for an accountant from inside the company. Robert Brace, 43, moves to the top finance spot, with a seat on the BT board, from the post of group controller - roughly equivalent to chief accountant. Brace joined BT four years ago as finance director of its UK division. He was recruited from Black &amp; Decker, where he was vice president, business and finance. Before that, he was Unipart's finance director, having moved into industry from the then accountancy firm Peat Marwick Mitchell. Brace's appointment follows the surprise departure of Barry Romeril, who this summer moved to the US to become finance director of Xerox Corporation.</p>

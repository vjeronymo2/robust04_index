			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Critics of jury plan 'surprise' Runciman LORD RUNCIMAN admitted yesterday that he had been 'very surprised' by the degree of critical reaction to proposals from the Royal Commission which he chaired for restricting the rights of accused people to opt for jury trial in cases which could be heard by magistrates, Alan Pike writes. He said after addressing the Association of Chief Police Officers conference in Birmingham that in Scotland the right of defendants to select which court should hear their case did not exist. He had not intended the committee's proposal for parliament to set guidelines in England and Wales to prove controversial. 'I do not at all see the case for giving the defendant the choice,' he said.</p>

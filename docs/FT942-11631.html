			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / ADB loans policy angers Asians Asian developing countries yesterday made public their bitterness at the linkage of a capital increase for the Asian Development Bank to new lending policies. A doubling of the bank's capital to Dollars 46bn (Pounds 30.6bn) is almost certain to be formally approved by May 22 by countries holding at least 75 per cent of shares. But China has abstained from the vote and other countries are approving it only, while recording their concern. Industrialised countries, led by the US, have insisted that the capital increase be linked to a switch in focus of ADB lending to issues such as poverty and the environment. They have also linked lending to the concept of 'good governance', which, to developing countries, smacks of political interference. Mr Zhou Zhengqing, senior Chinese official attending the ADB's annual meeting in Nice, said: 'China does not agree with the linkage between policy and capital; they are totally different issues.' China viewed the change with the 'greatest regret' and linking projects to the solution of social problems was 'not helpful'. China and other countries believe that ADB lending to infrastructural projects fosters development and economic growth which, in turn, leads to the solution of social problems. Mr Roger Altman, deputy US Treasury Secretary, insisted the changes were in line with those made at other multilateral development banks and reflected the maturing of the region. 'Private capital flows have risen to the point where financing of projects can now be absorbed by the private sector,' he said in an interview. 'It is not as if social-sector lending doesn't have an economic pay-off,' he added, arguing that lending to support education and health care had longer-term economic benefits. The ADB should not, however, compete with private-sector lending or substitute for it. US officials said that they expected the guidelines to be applied 'flexibly and pragmatically' and that the ADB would still have the scope to respond to the disparate needs of borrowing members. Mr Altman declined to define 'good governance', saying it was 'one of those things you know when you see. There's no short answer to that question.' Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, Indonesia's finance minister, said it was 'impractical and unrealistic to try to devise an all-embracing set of policies for all member countries.' Thailand and India also expressed concern about the linkage of capital to lending policy. Mr Mohammad Saifur Rahman, finance minister of Bangladesh, said a majority of the ADB's developing members had been against it. 'We wish the exercise could have been conducted in a more subtle manner, avoiding this division,' he added. Mr Ian de Jong, representing the Netherlands, defended the change as common practice in international financial institutions.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> AT&amp;T May Broaden Early Retirement Plan: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,  continuing its campaign to cut costs, said that it is talking to its two major  unions about an early-retirement program that for the first time would be  offered to non-management employees. Interest in a new early-retirement plan  aimed at non-management levels surfaced last year, a spokesman said, after  about 12,500 managers -- 37% of those eligible accepted the incentive package.  Stinson did not disclose how many of the company's 165,000 non-management  employees might be affected nor when an early-retirement plan might be offered.  </P></p>

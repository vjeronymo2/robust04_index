			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sees profit taking Sao Paulo shares retreated 2.7 per cent in moderate trade as investors cashed profits after exit polls and a first vote count showed Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso close to officially becoming Brazil's president-elect. Analysts said foreign investors were still out of the market. 'It seems they are waiting for the final official election results before making the decision to invest in Brazil,' one commented. Market watchers said foreigners were probably also waiting for clear indications that an ongoing anti-inflation plan will remain firmly on track after Mr Cardoso's virtual victory. The Bovespa index finished 1,489 off at 53,351. It has risen 53.2 per cent since July 1 largely reflecting the assumption that Mr Cardoso would win Monday's vote.</p>

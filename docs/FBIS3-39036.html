			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League leader Umberto Bossi </F> by Daniele Vimercati on 6 February in Bologna: "We Can Reach  Agreement With Berlusconi in Two Hours"]    [Text] Bologna -- Umberto Bossi, the night after. He  talked about the League, the imminent elections, Sisde, and  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi -- "someone who seems unreal on  television, who in person is different, practical, and who  speaks clearly. You can make yourself understood with him in a  couple of minutes." Calm and rested, as though the congress  marathon were already a distant memory, the League leader  relaxed in front of a rare steak in the restaurant of the  Holiday Inn very near the conference hall. The magic moment,  League supporters believe, occurred when the secretary  proclaimed, and put to the vote, the Pole for Freedom -- with  Silvio Berlusconi and Forza Italia, with the "wreckage of the  old parties," and with the quick-change artists who really are  willing to change, but without [National Alliance leader]  Gianfranco Fini's right. A center force based on economic  liberalism and federalism, opposed "to the three linchpins of  state control -- Christian Democrats, communists, and fascists."    [Vimercati] But how can you explain this to Berlusconi?    [Bossi] As I have already said, anticommunism is not enough.  Berlusconi must choose -- either with us to promote economic  liberalism, or with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] to halt  change. The North belongs to the League, and if he wants to  attempt exchanges of electoral favors with anyone in the South,  I do not care. But I am sure that we will overcome these  stumbling blocks and that everything will go well in the end.    [Vimercati] But you are so different -- you, sanguine,  impetuous, and careless in your dress; he, so fastidious,  careful about matters of tone, in his suit...the proletarian and  the plutocrat. Will you get along?    [Bossi] I think that Berlusconi is different from the way he  appears, or from the way his people, with some political  naivety, make him appear. I saw him on television, and he did  not look real.    [Vimercati] So you did see him. It is not true that you were  asleep while Berlusconi was talking in Rome, as the newspapers  said.    [Bossi] I got up late because I spent the night drafting the  congress document. I do not have people who write for me. I  saw Berlusconi later, on the television news. As I said, he  looked unreal, but that impression from the television does not  do him justice. Basically he is not an elitist; in fact he is  an easy- going Milanese, to whom I can tell it like it is. I  say to him: "As far as I am concerned, it is simple. Can we  agree?" And he answers me in the same vein; we understand one  another.    [Vimercati] Even when you are talking about candidates?    [Bossi] Of course. It is simpler than people think. We sit  in front of a map and decide: my man here, yours there, mine  here, yours there; here we have something of a problem -- it is  yours! We can settle the whole thing in a couple of hours.    [Vimercati] Is there not even a small place for the  Christian  Democratic centrists?    [Bossi] The old faces could make a generous gesture and sit  this one out. But if they really insist, we will find a seat  for Mastella and D'Onofrio in the South. There is room. But do  not print that, otherwise we will have people lining up outside  our house tomorrow.    [Vimercati] Will your people still like a Bossi who goes  around with Berlusconi in his blue double-breasted suit?    [Bossi] There will be no major difficulties, because  Berlusconi is a different kind of rich man. True, he made his  money under the old regime, but he has always had the communists  against him and he had to negotiate with the rest because he had  no alternative. He does not look like the manager of an  ironworks, like Gianni Agnelli, who could never contest the  elections.    [Vimercati] Are you not afraid that Berlusconi will steal a  large number of your votes and ultimately deprive you of the  leadership of this Pole for Freedom?    [Bossi] I am being careful, but I am not afraid. I realize  that Berlusconi has some power of attraction. He may win over  people who are still afraid of the League, but he is stealing  those votes not from us but from [Italian Popular Party (PPI)  Secretary] Martinazzoli, and is thus killing the final vestiges  of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. In the bar the other  day I was pestered by some hulking fellow with callused hands  who kept saying: "We need Berlusconi!" Eventually I told him to  get lost, but in its generic way, Forza Italia's message could  win much support.... I would call it pre-political support,  more in the South than in the North.    [Vimercati] Why do you think Berlusconi entered politics?    [Bossi] Well, at first perhaps he was forced to do so by  Mediobanca, by Agnelli and the DC, and by their respective  banks, who tried to destroy the League by unleashing the  judiciary against me. They tried to make him the good League  leader, who would win over our votes and bring them back into  the system. But that plan went wrong; I halted the sword of  justice; but by then the mechanism had been set in motion....    [Vimercati] If he had wanted to, Berlusconi could have  withdrawn.    [Bossi] I do not know what he thought. Maybe by then he  realized that Forza Italia could perform a major role, or  perhaps he was afraid for the future.... Some time ago  [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto was pursuing  me. Perhaps Berlusconi feared an accord with the communists.    [Vimercati] The election is drawing nearer. Your adversaries  are becoming increasingly dangerous. The left-wing forces have  already presented their symbol. What do you think of that?    [Bossi] That red-green wave is ridiculous; it is a petty  thing planned in the abstract, with no feeling, by people who  have no imagination. How can it be compared with the vast tide  of the League? Our symbol, the warrior of Legnano, is much  stronger and more powerful. We will never relinquish it, partly  for the sake of clarity with respect to the voters.    [Vimercati] Is it true that, by using different symbols in  the single-candidate and proportional stages, the left-wing  forces hope to avert dismemberment in the elections and thus to  gain a few additional seats?    [Bossi] It is true, they are trying to rob us of a dozen  deputies by such petty means. But they will not succeed. I  have already told [League lower house floor leader] Maroni to  appeal to Interior Minister Mancini to seek guarantees. I am  worried; this election is a war, and I do not want to concern  myself with skirmishes, too. I do not trust Mancino and his  tricks.</p>

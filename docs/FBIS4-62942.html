			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "Russia is in no hurry to join  the Council of Europe, but should not be late either", Russian  State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said at a meeting with Miguel  Martinez, chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the  Council of Europe, on Thursday.    Martinez, in his turn, said he would like to see Russia as a  fully-fledged member of the Council and added that only a few  countries still doubt the necessity. He drew Rybkin's attention  in this connection to the position of Poland and the Baltic  states.    Rybkin assured his guest that Russia would withdraw its  troops from Germany and the Baltic states "on time".</p>

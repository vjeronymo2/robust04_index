			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Greyhound -- An Aug. 26 article on the Greyhound bus strike said the National  Labor Relations Board had charged the company with bargaining in bad faith in  negotiations with the union representing Greyhound's drivers and maintenance  and clerical workers. The NLRB did file an unfair-labor-practices complaint  against the company, but the complaint did not include a bad-faith-bargaining  allegation. The complaint is awaiting a hearing before an administrative law  judge.  </P></p>

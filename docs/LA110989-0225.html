			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BOND DENIES PATERNITY CHARGE  </P> <P> Julian Bond, a leading figure during the civil rights movement and a former  Georgia state legislator, denies that he is the father of a flight attendant's  year-old daughter. Deborah Kaye Moore filed a paternity claim against Bond over  her daughter, Mia, in September on the day after Bond, 49, and his wife of 28  years, Alice, settled their divorce dispute. Bond says Moore never told him she  was pregnant or that she had given birth. The matter comes up for a hearing  Nov. 17 in Atlanta.  </P></p>

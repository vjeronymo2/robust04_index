			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Czechs deny crime claim A Czech police chief yesterday denied his country had become 'a breeding ground for organised crime', writes Patrick Blum in Prague. Mr Josef Doucha, deputy director of the Czech central criminal police, angrily rejected press reports suggesting Prague had become a centre for international criminal groups after the collapse of communism. There had been no 'sudden eruption of crime', but he admitted drug smuggling had grown because the Balkan drug route from Afghanistan and Pakistan through Turkey and the Balkans and into western Europe had been disrupted by war in the former Yugoslavia. As a result the Czech Republic had become a transit route.</p>

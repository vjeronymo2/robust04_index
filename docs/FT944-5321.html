			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Memoirs of the silver screen - Ghosted or navel-gazing, Nigel Andrews finds cinema's stars and champions taking up the pen The pre-Christmas season - nay, the whole year in film book publishing  - has been dominated by the ghostly autobiography. We do not mean just 'ghosted' though these too have abounded: led by Marlon Brando's exhausting navel-gazing feat Songs My Mother Taught Me (Century, Pounds 17.99). As transcribed by ghoster/co-author Robert Lindsey, the songs seem to have been sex, ethno-politics and Tahiti, distantly followed by Marlon's thoughts about acting. A shyer performer commercially but a far better book is Milos Forman's Turnaround (Faber, Pounds 17.50), written with Jan Novak. The Czech director who emigrated to Hollywood to make One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus is honest about his flops (Ragtime, Valmont) and affably surprised by his successes. He is also a priceless witness to his native country's disillusionment as the Prague spring that cradled Forman's best films - A Blonde In Love, A Fireman's Ball - yielded to Soviet winter. Also prominent on the ghostly movie-memoir shelves is that doppelganger oddity, the 'X On X' book: in which a famous director confronts himself and his work in a full-length career reflection. Woody Allen On Woody Allen (Faber, Pounds 14.99) is the best recent addition to this sub-genre. The book has a probing, nay prolix, inquisitor in Swedish film buff Stig Bjorkman - the questions are often longer than the answers - but Bjorkman does prise open a film-maker usually prone to hermit-crab responses. Allen does not discuss l'affaire Mia. But he is game for everything else: including fascinating scrutinies of recent masterworks like Crimes And Misdemeanors and Husbands And Wives. Last in the 'all about me' category of film book, there is autobiography by letter. Actors and directors are not natural beaux lettristes: much of their scribbling is taken up with transactional nitty-gritty. It can be like having an AGM report for your bedside book. The year's best epistolary memoir, Jean Renoir's Letters (Faber, Pounds 25), relieves torpor with eye-opening gobbits about individual films. Although more letters survive about the inferior American period than about La Regle Du Jeu or La Grande Illusion, Renoir is mischievously enlightening about the horrors he had to go through to make Swamp Water or This Land Is Mine. And since the film-maker struck up pen friendships with Henry Miller, Francois Truffaut and Ingrid Bergman - both sides of the correspondences are included  -there are sidelights on social-cultural history. After the swell of self-portraiture, it is a relief to take the 'auto' out of autobiography. Peter Manso's Brando (Weidenfeld, Pounds 20) is so much better than Brando's own Brando that you wonder why you read the latter at all. Nine hundred pages long, Manso's book subpoena'd some 700 witnesses and tells us everything we could imagine, and several things we could not have, about the Method superstar. Manso gives us glimpses of Brando the schoolboy, Brando the womaniser, Brando the practical joker (terrifying) and Brando the real-life courtroom tragedian, weeping as he testifies for his murder-charged son. Less compelling is the eagerly awaited Grace (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 16.99) by Robert 'Majesty' Lacey. Poor Miss Kelly. First she vanished into royal gentility in Monaco, after being a beautiful screen meteor for ten years. Then she vanishes after death into the embalming insipidity of Lacey's prose. 'How little Grace loved her Daddy' . . . 'She exuded a strange sense of calm and strength. She was a woman on the cusp . . .' And so on: all in the perfumed preservative of the hagiography. From earlier months in the film-book year five tomes stand out. Robert Evans's autobiography, The Kid Stays In The Picture (Aurum, Pounds 16.95), is written with rude wit and seeming total recall by the one-time wonder boy of Paramount. Special subjects: The Godfather, Ali McGraw, drugs, scandal, recovery. David Caute's Joseph Losey: A Revenge On Life (Faber, Pounds 20) is a stunningly thorough biography of the director of The Servant and The Go-Between; even though we sense that Caute has argued himself out of liking Losey by the close. In The Faber Book Of Movie Verse (Pounds 20), Philip French and Ken Wlaschin scour the verse vaults for material ranging across eighty years and a dozen styles: from Ezra Pound to Ogden Nash. And in 7 Minutes: The Life And Death Of The American Cartoon (Verso, Pounds 19.95) Norman M. Klein does an even more dramatic gathering act, chronicling and adventurously analysing an entire century of cartoon-making. As for Ephraim Katz's International Encyclopaedia Of Film (Macmillan, Pounds 30), the best of all doorstopping reference works on cinema is now improved and enhanced in a new edition. Throw away Halliwell; get the real thing. Finally, the oddest book of the year. It is World Cinema: Diary Of A Day (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 25). Over 400 film people, some celebrated, some scarce-heard-of, tell us what they were doing all day on June 10 1993. (Why that date? Why not, asks editor Peter Cowie.) So the Scorseses, Taverniers, Puttnams, Sean Penns, Roger Moores and Sir Anthony Hopkinses fill in the blanks in this vast anniversary volume dedicated to cinema's 100th birthday, due next year. Somewhere today in every part of the globe, the book proves, film people are at large eternalising fugitive reality. Cinema has been this century's art form. Now its champions are making quite clear that it will be the next century's as well.</p>

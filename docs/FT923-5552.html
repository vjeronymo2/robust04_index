			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Fishing: Bring on the rain EARLIER this year the Prince of Wales went to a drought-stricken region of Britain to make some forthright remarks about water and the inept way in which it is managed. The elements responded with a downpour of such violence that his words were almost drowned. Since then, I am delighted to say, we have had a decent English summer. We have had enough rain to keep the countryside green and pleasant rather than brown and blistered, as in the past two years, and to make us appreciative of hot days, instead of blase and irritable. One result is that drought has ceased to be an issue. But I like to think that fishermen see a little deeper. For us, the water question remains one of burning import. It does one no harm to be reminded, as well, that it is highly complex. The temptation to leap to conclusions and shout one's mouth off is immense. This has been brought home to me by a bulky publication from the National Rivers Authority (NRA), a report commissioned by the NRA and produced by the water consultants W S Atkins on the condition of the upper reaches of one of our most famed trout streams, the Kennet. The document is dry and dusty and packed with incomprehensible statistics, inscrutable graphs and baffling charts. But where I can understand it, it makes sombre reading. It charts in unemotional sciencespeak the desperate fate that has overtaken what was once a glorious chalkstream. The broad conclusions are simply summarised. Lack of water has resulted in complete degradation. The trout have gone, the fly life and invertebrates have gone, the healthy weed has gone. Where there is any water at all, it is a dark, silty, lifeless trickle. This decline has been replicated - to a lesser but still appalling extent - along other rivers. One assumption which the report challenges - one to which I have tended to subscribe - is that the deterioration is a contemporary phenomenon. In fact, the problem of lack of flow - which is at the heart of the story - has been observed and bemoaned for at least 60 years. The report refers to an article written just after the Second World War by a Colonel Maurice, whose family had held fishing rights above Marlborough since Victorian times. It is entitled 'Passing Of A River - An Obituary,' and records the decline of flows since the days in the 1890s when the river at Manton flowed brimfull in the longest droughts of summer. As it happens, I have a little book called Sometimes An Angler, by Henry Maurice. He was, I am sure, the brother of Col. Maurice, and he describes the persistent drying out of the stream in the mid and late 1930s. Maurice lays the blame on abstraction from the chalk acquifers - ruthless and increasing pillaging, he calls it. I, too, have done my bit in belabouring the abstractors. I am sure I shall do so again, for pillaging is often the right word for it. Nevertheless, this report also compels reassessment in this controversial area. It states that, although abstraction is a factor in causing low flow, it is largely insignificant beside the chief villain, lack of rainfall. It calculates the impact of drought as being four times that of abstraction. This conclusion has not been greeted joyously by conservation bodies dedicated to protecting the Kennet. Abstraction by man is an evil that can be fought, even reversed. But all one can do with drought is to shake one's fist and pray. I suspect that the scientists may have underestimated the degree to which abstraction is to blame. And I am convinced that unless the supply of water becomes an important factor in planning policy, and the conservation of water a warmer political issue, we are guaranteeing environmental disaster. But the key is more rain. We must have it, and soon, or these rivers will be dead. As I write, the clouds are piling up and another storm threatens. Splendid] The sound of water beating on the cobbles in my courtyard, the sweep of window-wipers on my car and the splash of wheels through deep puddles - all these, more than ever, are music to my ears.</p>

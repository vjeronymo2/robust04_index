			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Sport: What the professionals do in winter - Golf Fifteen years ago Ian Woosnam used to wonder how he would make ends meet during the winter. His seasonal earnings exhausted, Woosnam would ring around his friends in his native Oswestry to see if there was any part-time work available as a barman, a waiter, a greenkeeper or a milkman. This was the lot of a tournament professional who had finished outside the top 20 in the money list. The year was clearly defined and there were long months to try and fill with something other than the only life they cared about. Times have changed, at least for the male touring professionals: the women still have to do bar work or help out in their local friendly professional's shop. Woosnam, now a tax exile and a millionaire many times over, spends November and December in the southern hemisphere before returning to his new home on Jersey for Christmas. There is hardly any reason for professionals to take a break at all. Just 23 days have elapsed since the Johnny Walker World Championship in Jamaica, but already the restless have clubs in their hands and tickets in their pockets. The European tour season begins again on Thursday in Madeira. In the US, the winter break was even shorter. Their tour is already under way in California. Sometimes it is difficult for the fan to sustain interest in golf in mid-winter. Did we really want to read about an another already-rich golfer earning another Pounds 1m in Sun City? Did we feel sympathy for Sam Torrance when he complained, about the heat in Jamaica, while at golf clubs all over Britain the 'course closed' signs went up because of the incessant rain. Even though they can play through the winter, many professionals take a break. Severiano Ballesteros has not been seen since October but he has not been pulling pints or delivering milk. Usually, no-one works harder out of season on his golf than Ballesteros. This year he has changed his plans because of his chronic lower back condition. Ballesteros has spent an hour each morning doing calisthenics and working out on special machines. With two young children to occupy his time, he has had plenty to think about other than his golf. Given his poor form and lack of desire last year, this may be no bad thing. He will not play in public until February. Ballesteros has been outspoken about the demands upon the top players by the year-round golfing calendar. His answer is to stay at home. Nick Faldo's solution is to spread his 26-tournament workload throughout the year. He is just as likely to have three weeks off in July or August, as he did in 1993, as in December or January. For most players, there remains a period, sometimes quite short, when their winter thoughts tend to other things, other sports. Many, like Peter Baker (Wolverhampton Wanderers) and Trish Johnson (Arsenal), finally get to use their football season tickets. Paul Broadhurst follows Atherston FC of the Beazer Homes League around the country with his friends. Jamie Spence and Roger Chapman can be spotted around the paddock at Kempton race track. Two Swedes, Joakim Haeggman and Robert Karlsson, go skiing, another, Anders Forsbrands, plays ice hockey. Patrick Hall contemplates life and the universe with his exotic fish. Mark James watches Star Trek videos. The point of all this is to give the mind a break from golf. Baker's play in the World Championship, when he finished 31 strokes behind the winner, Larry Mize, indicates what happens when you do not. Nick Price, does not let anything come between him and his native Harare in December. He says: 'I regard that as my golden time of the year. It's the time that I've worked really hard all year to enjoy.' The promising young professional, Jim Payne, agrees: 'The season is so long that if you don't find other things to do in the winter you find you're mentally exhausted come the big events in September. You have to pace yourself. Obviously there are some players who like to play more golf than others but they'd be carting you off to the nuthouse if you didn't stop thinking about golf at some point.' Payne, likes to go and watch Grimsby play football. Such is his talent, and therefore earnings potential, that he should have enough to buy them in a couple of years. That would certainly give him something else to think about.</p>

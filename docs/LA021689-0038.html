			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BUILDING MORATORIUM EXTENDED  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has again extended a moratorium on  commercial construction in the city's two commercial zones -- Malaga Cove and  Lunada Bay -- to give city staff more time to strengthen codes governing land  use and parking problems.  </P> <P> A 45-day moratorium, initially imposed last March, was extended for 10 months  and 15 days in April. The most recent extension, the last the law will allow,  expires March 7, 1990, but city officials hope to have adopted a specific plan  before June for developing the commercial areas.  </P> <P> In related action, the council also extended for 10 months and 15 days a  moratorium on any changes in use in commercial zones. On Jan. 9, the council  declared a moratorium on changes in the use to which commercial buildings and  offices can be put, fearing that any changes would frustrate the implementation  of the specific plans being prepared for commercial areas.  </P> <P> That moratorium, which can be extended once more, will expire Jan. 8, 1990.  </P></p>

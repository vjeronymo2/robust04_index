			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F> Ian Mather; place and date not given: "Ties That Bind the Hands  of the United Nations"]    [Text] [Mather] Are you going to order air strikes in  Bosnia?    [Butrus-Ghali] We have received a request from NATO in  Brussels to study what could be done in Srebrenica and Tuzla.  But the situation is more complicated than it appears. We have  already had two preparatory meetings and we hope to have a  blueprint very soon, in the next few days.    [Mather] Why is all this taking so long? You have been  considering military action for months.    [Butrus-Ghali] It is a completely new situation. Until now  we have been involved with protection. NATO also wants the  rotation of troops in Srebrenica -- the replacement of the  Canadian battalion by Dutch troops -- to be carried out. This  is an operation of a different nature. There is also the  question of the chain of command. Today, for instance, I had a  long telephone call from Cairo saying the impression there is  that NATO is ready to use air strikes, but that I want to  prevent it from doing so.    What can we do when we are dealing with disinformation? The  chain of command is for the military command on the ground to  ask for air support. But I cannot take a decision by myself. I  am not on the ground in Bosnia. And during the past two months  I have not received any demand for air strikes.    [Mather] What about the position of the individual  governments that would carry out the attacks?    [Butrus-Ghali] That is another aspect. Today I received a  note from the Russian federation saying: "We want to remind you  that you cannot take any decision before consulting the Security  Council." So even after I have received a request for air  strikes and supposing that I am in favour, I have to consult the  Security Council, according to one of its permanent members.  This has added a new echelon to the chain of command.    [Mather] At the recent NATO summit in Brussels President  Mitterrand made it clear that he wants force to be used.    [Butrus-Ghali] Let us be perfectly clear. Supposing that I  have overcome all the obstacles and I send a message to NATO  saying "Use force," I have no way to compel NATO governments to  use force. They are free to do so or not. Who will decide  within NATO? The member states.    [Mather] You have proposed that UN member governments should  allocate troops permanently to the UN.    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. We have received a positive response  from many countries, from France and from the Scandinavian  countries. We are proceeding and working very hard on it. But  then you have the financial element. If you want to send 50,000  troops to somewhere in Asia or Africa it will cost you a few  billion dollars. Who will pay? We have a financial crisis in  the United Nations.    [Mather] Is the crisis anywhere near an end?    [Butrus-Ghali] No.    [Mather] Have governments offered any financial help?    [Butrus-Ghali] No. As a result of economic crises and  "donor fatigue" member states are less ready to contribute  financially to the peacekeeping operations.    The chief problem from my point of view is one of education.  The same member states that were prepared to spend $100 billion  every day to sustain the Cold War are not willing to spend $100  billion or $200 billion to sustain the UN system. That is a  contradiction.    [Mather] Are the UN's peacekeeping efforts actually being  impeded by the financial crisis?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, because the member states do not pay  their contributions on time. The result is that the UN is not  able to pay on time the member states who contribute with  contingents of troops. Some states can afford to wait one or two  years before being paid. But others cannot. So they may  withdraw their troops. I have received complaints from Tunisia,  Uruguay, Jordan, Egypt and Bangladesh, to name only some of the  countries which are not able to continue to provide troops  because they are not being paid. This is a problem. If  countries that belong to the developing world cannot participate  in peacekeeping operations for financial reasons it will  diminish the multinational dimension of UN forces.    [Mather] Are some countries guiltier than others?    [Butrus-Ghali] The United States and Russia. But out of 184  countries only ten per cent pay their contributions in January.  They are supposed to pay all their contributions in the first  month of the year. But they pay at the end of the year so we  have to find cash for 12 months and we are not allowed to borrow  from banks.    [Mather] Can you not do more within the UN organisation  itself to save money?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, we are trying to. But the cost of  peacekeeping forces has risen from $600 million to $3.6 billion.  The UN used to have only a few peacekeeping operations. Today  we have 23.    We have also just agreed to send 1,600 observers to the  South African elections. We have been asked to participate in  monitoring 46 elections. All this is new. In the post-Cold War  era the UN has a new credibility. Everybody is asking for  assistance in the diplomatic field, in the field of security, in  the field of the environment and of health and of technical  assistance. All these different kinds of assistance cost money.    [Mather] Do you see any possibility of changing the rules  of engagement so that UN troops can play a more active military  role?    [Butrus-Ghali] It is not a question of changing the rules of  engagement but of asking whether the member states are ready.  Do they accept the need for confrontation with its military  consequences? Do they accept the likely cost in human lives?  There is confusion because public opinion regards the UN as an  independent body. But the UN is an instrument which depends on  the political will of the member states. If they have the  political will to pay the military and financial price for an  operation then it can be done.    [Mather] Returning to Bosnia: in addition to the financial  problems, there are other difficulties. The writ of the UN is  not respected by the warring parties. Supplies are not getting  through, UN troops are being shot at and killed. Does all this  make you feel frustrated?    [Butrus-Ghali] This has been the case in all UN peacekeeping  operations. The UN operations in the Congo had the same  problems. I don't want to underestimate the problems we have in  the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. But we have to accept  that this happens when the UN is conducting its operations.</p>

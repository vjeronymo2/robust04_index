			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BP to spend Dollars 200m appraising potential of Colombian field BRITISH PETROLEUM has stepped up efforts to evaluate its Cusiana oil find in Colombia, potentially one of the world's largest oil discoveries containing as much as 2bn barrels of oil. The company is to spend Dollars 200m (Pounds 112m) on drilling new wells in the region to appraise the Cusiana field - which it discovered last year - and to look for oil in the surrounding area. BP has highlighted the importance of its Colombia find by assigning Mr David Harding - currently head of exploration in Europe  - to head the programme in Colombia and lead the company's South American operations. The company also plans to expand its workforce in the region from 120 to 500 people by the end of the year. Mr John Browne, BP Exploration chief executive, called the planned appraisal programme a 'very considerable undertaking,' which over the course of the year would establish a reliable estimate of recoverable reserves. The company plans to have 10 drilling rigs operating in Colombia this year. BP has a 40 per cent stake in the Cusiana field, with French group Total holding another 40 per cent and Triton, a US independent oil and gas company, 20 per cent. Under Colombian licencing terms, the state oil group Ecopetrol has the right to take a 50 per cent interest if a discovery is developed. BP needs a substantial discovery to boost its portfolio of reserves, most of which are concentrated in the mature oil-producing areas of the North Sea and Alaska.</p>

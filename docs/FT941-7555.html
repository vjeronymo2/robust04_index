			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Brand new Birmingham  -A city selling itself as a product The unveiling this week by the City of Birmingham of a new 'corporate' identity raises the question: how much is a city like a company? Birmingham City Council, which represents more citizens in one body than any other city in Britain, is the latest to adopt a brand symbol as a focus for its promotional activities. 'Birmingham is a product. It is capable of being 'branded', just as Cadbury brands its chocolate products,' according to the Birmingham Marketing Partnership, the organisation behind the new logo. But cities are not chocolates; they have real and complex cultural identities. Nevertheless, according to Adrian Day of Siegel and Gale, the consultants responsible for the new symbol. 'The marketing of cities as brands is coming to the fore.' In the past, a city council marketing director would earn far less than a counterpart in industry, an indication of the traditional amateurism of civic promotion. Now, commercial methods and salaries to match are emerging. The phenomenon is especially noticeable in regional centres. Behind the new promotional drive is Birmingham Marketing Partnership, a coalition of public- and private-sector resources set up by the Labour-controlled council last summer. 'Past efforts to market Birmingham were very fragmented,' says Philip Calcutt, the partnership's marketing director. 'We are trying to bring some coherence.' Most big businesses in the Birmingham area support the new city brand, says Calcutt. The challenge now is to persuade smaller companies to use it - and use it correctly. The implementation of a new corporate identity for a company can be tightly controlled in a way that is not possible with a city brand, and opinions created by graphic designer Milton Glaser for the City of New York in 1976 was deliberately not protected. Anybody could use it - or misuse it. An alternative is for imprimaturs of a country, region or city to be awarded by accreditation to comparatively few traders who can be relied upon to use it properly and thus enhance the brand. Birmingham has chosen a middle course. It hoped to persuade many of the small businesses at the unveiling at the International Convention Centre on Tuesday to adopt the symbol in their advertising and literature. 'The broader its application, the better,' says Calcutt. The symbol is to be registered as a trade mark, however, and users will have to apply the usage guidelines prepared by Siegel and Gale to ensure that it is displayed to best effect. Birmingham Marketing Partnership's future role will be to co-ordinate projects originated by partners such as the National Exhibition Centre or the West Midlands Development Agency. For example, travellers to Birmingham for sports championships or exhibitions receive 'VIP passports' entitling them to offers in restaurants and facilities. Such a scheme appears simple, but requires co-ordination. The architecture of the National Exhibition Centre, the International Conference Centre and Symphony Hall may not compare with the splendours of, say, Barcelona or Lyon - two other 'second' cities which have a brand symbol. But Birmingham Marketing Partnership and Siegel and Gale agree that without the cultural and commercial qualities of Birmingham, the creation of the brand would have been a waste of time. 'They realised they had the product; now they've got the expression of it,' says Day.</p>

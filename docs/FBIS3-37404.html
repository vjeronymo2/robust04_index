			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Seven Feet Under the Keel!"] </F>   [Text] On 12 February, in the Sevastopol port arrival and  departure building, a ceremony was held of hoisting the  Ukrainian naval flag on the small ASW ship "Lutsk". The ship  was built at the Kiev "Leninska Kuznya" plant. After the  completion of all the running and state tests, it was added to  the Ukrainian Fleet. The ship is more that 70 meters long and  more than 10 meters wide; its speed is more than 50 knots.  Captain Third Rank Viktor Zaremba was appointed as the ship's  captain.    The ceremony was attended by Ukraine's Minister of Defense,  Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy; commander of Ukraine's Naval  Forces Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, and leaders of Sevastopol,  Lutsk, and Volyn Oblast state administrations. Metropolitan of  Lutsk and of Volyn Oblast Ioann (the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,  Kiev Patriarchate) consecrated the ship and blessed the sailors.    Near the ladder of the ship, Vitaliy Radetskyy gave a news  conference. He confirmed that Sevastopol will be the main base  and the headquarters of Ukraine's Naval Forces. Having given a  high assessment to Ukraine's signing of the NATO Partnership for  Peace program in Brussels, V. Radetskyy said that "Even now,  Ukraine's armed forces have everything necessary to be an equal  partner of NATO." According to him, the Ukrainian Army may  conduct joint exercises with armies of other states and "the  future presence of Ukraine's Naval Forces in the Mediterranean  Sea is not ruled out," as is stipulated in the documents signed  in Brussels.    In connection with Crimean president Yu. Meshkov's  statements  on the demilitarization of the Crimea at the expense of the  Black Sea Fleet, Ukraine's army general pointed out that, in his  opinion, this problem must be resolved in two stages. An  inventory of the Black Sea Fleet, as of 1991, must be carried  out, and its units and formations must be reduced to an  optimally needed quantity. In general, "these questions may  only be resolved by Ukraine's president and the Supreme Council."</p>

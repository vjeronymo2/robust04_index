In a very short  statement on national television following the visit of Togolese  President Gnassingbe Eyadema, President Biya expressed his  "desire to seek a final, lasting, and peaceful solution," the  television quoted him as saying. "My brother and friend Eyadema  and I had similar views on the development and promotion of  peace on the continent," Mr. Biya added.    President Biya, who was publicly mentioning this conflict  for  the first time, did not comment on the latest declarations by  Nigerian External Relations Minister Babagana Kingibe. The  Nigerian minister said yesterday that the situation at the  border "could explode if nothing is done quickly to return to  dialogue."    President Eyadema, who has been asked to mediate in the  dispute between the two countries, called on African leaders "to  do everything to find an African solution to the conflict,"  according to national television. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry  said today that Cameroon has requested intervention by the OAU  in the dispute. Egypt is the current chairman of the OAU. This  request will be examined at an emergency meeting of the OAU,  which was created in June 1993 for the prevention and settlement  of inter-African conflicts.    At the end of his discussions with his Cameroonian  counterpart, President Eyadema went to Nigeria where he met the  head of state, General Sani Abacha, sources close to the  Nigerian presidency in Abuja pointed out.</p>

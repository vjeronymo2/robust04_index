			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Army suppliers find silver lining in east Europe THE END of the cold war and cuts in the armed forces have been bad news for most defence companies but some have found ways of cashing in on the changes. Toye, Kenning &amp; Spencer, a long-established Coventry-based manufacturer of uniforms and insignia, is busy making uniform items for the merged regiments of the re-organised British army. And, to prove that every cloud has an embroidered silver lining, it is seeking to exploit markets in eastern Europe, until recently a no-go area for British military suppliers. Mr Philip Frost, managing director, said new business included supplying badges and buttons to the army's new Royal Logistic Corps, which groups everyone from drivers to cooks. Unlike other defence manufacturers, the company had managed to avoid a decrease in its UK military business, he said. It was also seeking sales to former Warsaw Pact nations and allies, he said. It had already sold a uniform package deal to Mozambique, which has changed its military ranking system from the Soviet to the British style. The company hoped to increase the 25 per cent of its business devoted to export. 'We feel we've got an interesting future with the changes that have occurred,' Mr Frost said. Also exhibiting at this week's Royal Navy and British Army Equipment Exhibition in Aldershot is Allmakes Projects, which has a niche business refitting Russian military trucks. The company, based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, has found it can buy trucks for about Pounds 1,000, and, after fitting Perkins diesel engines, re-sell them for about Pounds 15,000. Mr Peter Hands, a director, said it had already sold several hundred, principally to Angola. It was now looking at opportunities in eastern Europe. 'There's nobody else doing it that we're aware of,' he said.</p>

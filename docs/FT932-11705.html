			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ptarmigan takes a further step up the road to engineering PTARMIGAN HOLDINGS made further moves towards becoming an engineering company by announcing an Pounds 8m acquisition funded by a rights issue, a change of name and capital restructuring. Ptarmigan, which is to be renamed Graystone, has agreed to buy a company called Cableform, plus its US subsidiary, from FKI, the electrical engineering group. The deal will be funded by a 14-for-3 rights issue of up to 68.48m new shares at 8p each, which is being underwritten by Chemical Investment Bank. Shares in Ptarmigan were suspended on Wednesday at 10p, and dealing is expected to resume on May 25. Ptarmigan is in the process of disposing of its original businesses - making sausage casings, artificial flowers and ribbons, publishing cookery and crafts books and running three small country hotels. Mr Dick Richardson, who became chairman and chief executive in June, said the acquisition of Cableform marked a significant step forward in implementing his strategy of identifying and acquiring specialist engineering companies operating in niche markets. In November Ptarmigan bought three engineering companies from Prospect Industries. Ptarmigan said that as a result of these acquisitions, it viewed the prospects for the group with increased optimism. FKI Cableform, based in West Yorkshire, makes numbering machines, lighting products and electrical controls. It employs 257 people in the UK, 21 in the US and three in Germany. In the year to March 31 it made operating profits of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 9.8m. FKI said the disposal was part of its policy of focusing on core businesses. FKI will receive Pounds 5m in cash, Pounds 2m nominal of loan stock and 12.5m new Graystone shares. The proceeds of the rights issue will pay the cash element. Joint stockbrokers to the issue are Henry Cooke Lumsden and Peel, Hunt &amp; Co. Ptarmigan yesterday also reported that it has reduced pre-tax losses in the six months to December 31 from Pounds 127,00 to Pounds 104,000 on sales of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.1m). Operating profit rose from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 170,000, but this was offset by an increase in interest payment to Pounds 226,000 (Pounds 110,000). Mr Richardson said: 'The group is now trading profitably and the trading conditions for all our companies are showing signs of improvement. This, together with recent reductions in interest rates, should result in improved performance.'</p>

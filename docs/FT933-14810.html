			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / PLO chief backtracks on claim of 'secret talks' PLO CHAIRMAN Yassir Arafat last night backtracked on an earlier claim that Israeli and PLO officials held secret and direct discussions on two occasions during last month's Middle East peace talks in Washington. The conflicting signals from the PLO leader, however, are unlikely to end speculation that direct contacts have been taking place between the PLO and Israeli officials or politicians. Mr Arafat set off a flurry of speculation and denials when he told Reuters news agency in Tunis: 'There were two meetings last month in Washington' aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Middle East peace talks, but they were 'unsuccessful'. But hours later, Mr Arafat told the news agency that what he meant was that 'there were Palestinian attempts to meet the Israelis in Washington but that these attempts failed and the meetings did not took place'. His backtracking came after the offices of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and of Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, denied there had been government-backed contacts. Mr Arafat's earlier claim prompted an apparent confirmation from Mr Nabil Shaath, a political adviser to the PLO leader. He asserted in Cairo that such contacts had taken place, but refused to say who had participated or when. 'These contacts exist, existed and should become the norm of negotiations,' he said. The later backtracking suggested that the PLO may have had second thoughts about the wisdom of pursuing this line publicly. Direct dialogue with the PLO was expressly proscribed by Israel in its conditions for entering the peace process, on the grounds that it is a terrorist organisation dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state. But the Israeli parliament in January repealed the law banning contacts between individual Israelis and PLO members. It is clear a growing number of top Israeli politicians favour abandoning the taboo. Last week a Labour MP named 11 members of Mr Rabin's 18-strong cabinet who he said were in favour of opening direct talks with the PLO to break the deadlock in the peace talks. It is widely believed that Mr Haim Ramon, the health minister and a moderate, telephoned Mr Arafat last week. Israel Radio also said yesterday that Egyptian foreign ministry officials had said Israel had agreed in principle to change the terms of the Madrid conference which specifically excludes the PLO from peace talks. Mr Dan Cohen, a Labour MP, said the PLO had told him that the contacts with the Israeli government were being undertaken through members of the Labour party. The MPs, he said, were acting in the grey area between official and unofficial contacts. He said the talks focused on the 'Gaza first' option - a proposal to hand over the occupied Gaza strip to an autonomous Palestinian authority as soon as possible and before any transfer of authority in the occupied West Bank. The discussions also included human rights in the occupied territories and how to reach an agreement on a joint statement of principles setting out the modalities for Palestinian interim self-rule. He added that Israeli denials that such meetings had taken place showed that Israeli was 'not yet willing to come up with the reality that there is no way round negotiations directly with the PLO'. Present negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinian delegation to the talks remain stalled after their tenth and latest round in Washington.</p>

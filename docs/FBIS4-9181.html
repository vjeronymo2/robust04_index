			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jana Dorotkova: "Meciar's Corrupt Legacy"] </F>   [Text] In the end, it was President Michal Kovac's damning  revelations of Vladimir Meciar's blatant abuse of state  ownership for political gain that pushed Parliament to toss the  perpetually staggering ex-boxer out on his ear.    After the president's March 9 speech, a seemingly shocked  Parliament agreed--for the first time in more than 12 months of  loose talk--to hold a no-confidence vote. Two days later, Meciar  was dethroned from his three-headed job as premier,  privatization minister and chair of the National Property Fund,  leaving in his wake an internationally discredited  decentralization process that has been more of an exercise in  power than an instrument of reform.    Through Valentine's Day of this year, Meciar's government  had  managed to privatize just 108 companies (91 through public  tender, 17 through direct sale) since the June 1992 elections  swept his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) into power.    The ex-factory lawyer's oft-repeated claims to be making the  privatization process more "transparent" were widely interpreted  by reform advocates as a more palatable way of saying  "nonexistent."    Then Feb. 15, on the eve of what was expected to be a  no-confidence vote in the next day's Parliament session,  Meciar's government suddenly approved a whopping 27 direct sales.    As Parliament deputies were tossing in their sleep, deciding  whether or not they should chuck Meciar's minority government,  the Privatization Ministry was working around the clock, selling  off chunks of the state-owned sector.    "I always stay here this late," insisted deputy  Privatization  Minister Ivan Lexa at 11:30 p.m. Feb. 15. Lexa's secretary and  the secretary for the ministry's economic director both said  they never worked that late, but didn't want to be quoted.    When the dust cleared Feb. 17, with the opposition once  again  failing to unify and set a date for new elections (which would  have paved the way for a no-confidence vote), the disheartened  deputies began to question just what had happened on the night  of Feb. 15-16. But HZDS deputies and the handful of Meciar  loyalists from the splintered Slovak National Party (SNS) saw  nothing abnormal in the sudden massive activity.    "You blame us because we speeded up privatization at the  last  Cabinet session? You've been asking for it, you've been  criticizing us for slow privatization," said then Environment  Minister Jozef Zlocha.    The opposition was sufficiently alarmed to launch an  investigation Feb. 18 and ask the Prosecutor General to rule on  the legality of two of the 27 sales.    Ivan Miklos, the pre-HZDS privatization minister, said the  privatization projects approved during the Feb. 15 fire sale  fell far short of meeting the basic requirements mandated by  law, such as approval by the Anti-Monopoly Office.    While the ministries that owned the properties (which makes  them responsible for initiating privatization) in many instances  recommended public tenders, the government ignored their  requests and sold off the businesses to pre-selected people,  Miklos said.    Former Economics Minister and ex-SNS Chair L'udovit Cernak,  who resigned from Meciar's government a year ago, summed up the  prevailing view on the Parliament floor Feb. 17: "What else but  a plunder can we call the process going on here these days?"    "The fact that the Privatization Ministry worked all night  from Feb. 15 to Feb. 16 suggests a lot about the way Vladimir  Meciar's government approves direct sales," said Miklos, once a  member of the now-defunct Public Against Violence, the broad  movement that spearheaded the 1989 revolution in Slovakia.    During Miklos's last six months in office, the Slovak  government approved a total of 676 projects (181 direct sales,  eight public tenders and 407 in coupon privatization). After  HZDS took over, Meciar vowed to improve on Miklos's record.    "The government will push through legislative changes to  speed the process and dampen the negative side effects...and  will give preference to competitive principles in order for  privatization to be more transparent," he promised.    But in three times as long, Meciar's government privatized  less than one-sixth as many companies as its predecessors.  Coupon privatization, a runaway success in the Czech Republic,  was dropped because the Slovak government said, it couldn't  provide the cash infusion necessary to revive Slovakia's  suffering economy.    HZDS Vice Chair L'ubomir Dolgos resigned as privatization  minister in June 1993, accusing the government of deliberately  stalling the decentralization process because it was unwilling  to give up power. In place of Dolgos, Meciar nominated his close  ally Lexa, but President Kovac refused (he had previously  rejected Lexa to head the Slovak Information Service, the  country's intelligence agency). So Meciar himself took the helm  of both the Privatization Ministry and the National Property  Fund.    "Privatization, warped beyond recognition by Meciar's  ambition to shape the new market economy, has ground to a halt,"  wrote Chandler Rosenberger, an American journalist who lived in  post-revolution Bratislava for three years, in the fall 1993  issue of WORLD POLICY REVIEW.    Meciar's "scheme," Rosenberger and a chorus of observers  say,  had much more to do with leverage and power than concern for the  economy. "Deputies from the [SNS] and Meciar's own [HZDS] drove  an efficient privatization program through a meat grinder of  special interests," wrote Rosenberger. "Meciar's coalition is a  clumsy alliance of special interests and privilege. Meciar's  success depends not on enforcing open competition between  companies, but rather on managing a vast array of alliances,  information and threats."    Kovac's dramatic allegations March 9 on the Parliament  floor--all of them hotly denied by Meciar--stated the equation  in simple terms: Meciar saw privatization as a way to stuff  HZDS's campaign war chest, and that's why he wanted his good  buddy Lexa running the Ministry of Privatization.    "His reasons were that HZDS had no money even for salaries,  that early elections would probably happen soon, and that HZDS  just needed money," Kovac said. "He further said that no one but  Lexa could provide him with that service."    International financial institutions have taken notice. Both  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  and the European Union have recently come out with reports  slamming Meciar's mishandling of the economy.    The premier's penchant for flexing the state's muscle to  keep  the media in line has attracted even more international  headlines. Several critical individuals have been removed from  state-owned television, radio and print media; privatization of  the newspaper printing and distribution monopolies were put off  indefinitely; state subsidies to publications have been openly  based on editors' political stances.    "Over the past year, the government has shown a strong  propensity to hold on to whatever control it has over the  media," wrote Jeremy Druker in a July 1993 report for Freedom  Forum.    The Feb. 15-16 deal that raised the most eyebrows was the  cheap sale of the successful Skloobal Nemsova, a glass bottle  producer where Meciar worked as company lawyer from 1974 to  1989, to its current managers.    Last year, Skloobal had profits of 22.2 million Sk ($700,000  US), according to the Slovak economic weekly TREND. Its assets  were estimated at 726 million Sk ($23 million US), including 66  million Sk ($2 million US) in the bank, according to government  documents.    Since there was no public tender, a competing privatization  project that had lined up foreign investors from Italy, France  and Germany, was left out in the cold. Skloobal management,  under the name Obalsklo Ltd., purchased 67 percent of the  company for 120 million Sk ($3.7 million US).    Under the purchase agreement, the company management must  pay  the government 27 million Sk ($850,000 US) the first year, with  the rest spread out in installments over the next 10 years.  Obalsklo was asked to invest 500 million Sk ($15 million US) by  January 1995, but the agreement was written without any  provisions for penalizing the company if it doesn't live up to  its end of the bargain, TREND reported. And the conditions for  further payments have not yet been set.    So, essentially, a bunch of Meciar's old comrades privatized  a profitable company for less money than the company itself has  in its bank account.    "That is not just a handout of state property, it is the  liquidation of all the competitors," wrote TREND deputy editor  in chief Oliver Brunovsky in a commentary. "The privatization  projects of last week revealed the true privatization policy of  the HZDS."    Privatization has been at or near the center of the manifold  political dramas that have rocked Slovakia into its current  status: a 15-month-old country with a troubled reputation, a  grim economic outlook and a populace that has faith in neither  its elected officials nor the concept of market reform.    Meciar's demand that Lexa be appointed as part of a November  1993 HZDS-SNS coalition and Kovac's angry refusal launched the  power struggle between the country's top two officials which the  president eventually won.    The opposition complained for months that the minority  government spelled instability for the country, but actual  gridlock did not occur until Feb. 2, when Meciar loyalists  stormed out of Parliament to protest an opposition bill that  would have given the legislature oversight of the privatization  process. (The law passed, but Meciar refused to sign it.) From  then on, the only real debates Parliament held dealt with the  questions of early elections, referendums and no-confidence  votes.    Through it all, Meciar has convinced many people that he is  the only man with enough moral purity to ensure that the  privatization process--and government as a whole--will be run  cleanly. The premier has waged public campaigns against  corruption (accusing, for instance, at least three political  parties of trying to bribe him), while privately saying that  political support is best won through state gifts. (In December,  for instance, Meciar bragged of giving the 600-million-crown  Neografia publishing house to the nationalist organization  Matica Slovenska for just one crown. "They won't support anyone  else but HZDS anywhere," he said. "They gave us this promise.")    When campaigning against the "federalists" of Jan  Carnogursky's pre-HZDS government, Meciar pounded home the  lasting image of a corrupt government selling off the state  interests of the Czech Republic.    "Those who own companies will decide the fate of Slovakia.  Will it be the unbribable and honest Meciarist entrepreneurs or  the corrupt Czechoslovakist Mafia?" asked Jan Smolec, editor in  chief of the government-owned nationalist daily REPUBLIKA in a  Feb. 15 open letter to Carnogursky, who chairs the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH).    "The only party with anything resembling a sensible economic  program is [KDH]," Rosenberger argued in his WORLD POLICY REVIEW  article. "But it labors under the weight of false but effective  rumors that Carnogursky's family, prominent on the Slovak  political scene for most of the 20th century, is corrupt."    Meciar remains convinced that his ear for what Slovaks want  to hear will deliver him once again to the promised land. "Those  of you who are even slightly realistic," he told Parliament  shortly before getting the ax, "you know we will win those  elections."</p>

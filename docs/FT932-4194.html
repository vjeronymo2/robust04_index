			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ASB ruling on subsidiaries' results COMPANIES WILL be required to adjust their accounts to eliminate any distortions created by subsidiaries operating in hyper-inflationary economies, under a ruling issued yesterday. The ruling eliminates the practice used in the past by companies such as Polly Peck International, the conglomerate founded by Mr Asil Nadir, which showed interest in soft currency deposits as profits but the falling value of those deposits in reserves. The ninth abstract from the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board will be compulsory from accounting periods after August 23, although the board is encouraging early adoption. In line with international practice, the new approach will apply where the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching or exceeds 100 per cent, and the operations in the hyper-inflationary economies are material. The task force said there were two methods to adjust for distortions: Adjust local currency financial statements to reflect current price levels before translation, taking any gain or loss on the net monetary position through the profit and loss account. Using a relatively stable currency as the currency of measurement for the relevant foreign operations. If neither is adopted, companies must state the reasons and alternative methods to eliminate the distortions. The abstract amends the existing rules under SSAP 20, the accounting standard dealing with foreign currency translation introduced in April.</p>

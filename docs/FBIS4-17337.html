			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 23 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- In order to ensure the  implementation of the Russian president's edict of 11 June 1993  No. 918, Russian Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin has  signed a resolution of the Russian Government: On measures to  restore the state monopoly on the production, storage, and  wholesale and retail sales of alcohol products. This was  announced by the press service of the Russian Government.    The resolution envisages, inter alia, a number of measures  aiming to protect the economic interests of state and consumer  rights. These measures will be applicable to all enterprises,  irrespective of their form of ownership or of which government  department they come under, including joint ventures.    The state monopoly on the production and sale of alcohol  products applies to ethyl alcohol derived from any foodstuffs or  non-food products, on alcohol produce, and on wine and wine  products.    State inspection bodies must adopt, within one month, a  procedure for issuing licences to produce, bottle, store, and  sell wholesale alcohol products.    In accordance with the resolution, federal state bodies  should draw up annual predictions of alcohol products'  production and sale volumes with the export-import share taken  into account. Instructions have also been given that a draft  resolution on the procedure of establishing quotas, and  proposals on payments for the issuing of licences for the  production, bottling, storage, and wholesale of alcohol products  be presented to the Russian Government within two months.    According to the resolution, it is prohibited to use ethyl  spirit made from non-food raw material for the production of  alcohol products, and the procurement and processing of raw  material for the production of spirit by bartering it for spirit  and other alcohol products. Besides this, it is prohibited to  lease enterprises engaged in the sphere of the production,  bottling, and storage of alcohol products without the issuing of  the appropriate licences.    The federal executive bodies have been instructed to present  within three months proposals for a single procedure of the  retail sale of alcohol drinks in the territory of the Russian  Federation.    Law and order bodies have been instructed to present within  two months proposals on administrative and criminal liability  for the violation of the state monopoly on alcohol products.</p>

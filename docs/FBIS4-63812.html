			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- Talks between the heads of  government of Russia and Ukraine on settling the problems of the  Black Sea Fleet have been adjourned until tomorrow. A decision  to do so was taken late this evening by members of the  delegations of the two countries.    The sides were unable to reach agreement on a number of  points while working out an intergovernmental document dividing  the Black Sea Fleet.    The talks will be continued tomorrow with the same people  taking part.    Valeriy Shmarov, deputy prime minister of Ukraine, told  journalists that the positions of the sides undoubtedly came  closer together during today's talks, but there are still a  great many unresolved problems. At the same time he confirmed  the desire of the Ukrainian side to reach an agreement.</p>

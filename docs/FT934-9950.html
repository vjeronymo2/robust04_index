			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Risk and Reward: Futures funds say art of people-picking crucial to success ASSET allocation can have just as much to do with selecting the right money manager as with picking the right assets. This is especially true of managed futures funds, where the right mix of commodity trading advisers (CTAs) and their trading strategies is considered crucial. Indeed, many see the CTA as a fund manager's most important asset. 'The way a derivatives fund manager buys the skill level of a trading adviser is analogous to a mutual fund manager buying the earnings growth potential of a stock,' explained Mr Jeffrey Brown, a portfolio manager with RefcoFund Holdings Corporation in New York. But people-picking, like stock-picking, can be complex, involving in-depth quantitative and qualitative research. The search for the optimal mix of CTAs has spawned a variety of systems, detailing the advisers' trading methodology, historic returns and losses, as well as their programmes' volatility, to be used as an indication of their likely future performance. Among the most widely used adviser selection tools are software packages, such as LaPorte Asset Allocation from Burlington Hall Asset Management, Refco's Derivative Adviser Database and Tass Management's TASS 2. CTAs are professional managers who make trading or investment decisions for managed futures funds. Their approach tends to be either systematic  - using programmes and models that generate buy and sell signals - or discretionary, relying mainly on CTAs' experience and judgment. CTAs' strategies are based broadly on two types of analysis: fundamental analysis - which takes account of external factors that may affect the supply and demand for a particular security and its price - or technical analysis, which studies market prices themselves. There are diversified CTAs who trade a number of markets ranging from livestock to interest-rate futures,and specialised CTAs who invest only in specific sectors, say currencies or energy products. (Advisers are typically paid a fixed management fee - usually between 2 and 4 per cent of the assets managed - and a so-called incentive fee, usually some 20 per cent of the trading profits.) Finding a good CTA is one thing; getting the mix right is another. To minimise the volatility - and risk - of their portfolios, most futures fund managers like to match CTAs whose past performances have a low or negative correlation to each other. The idea is that traders who are making money will offset those who are not, making for an overall steady, low-risk performance. 'If there is a high correlation between traders, they'll all lose or win at the same time,' said Mr Richard Wilkie, director of asset allocation at Heinold Asset Management in Chicago, which uses some 35 CTAs to manage 28 futures funds. He employs LaPorte to select CTAs, but applies his own software to find the 'final perfect mix'. Some fund managers feel that analysing historical performance is not enough. 'Quantitative analysis only looks at what's happened in the past,' but does not necessarily say much about the future, said Mr William Taki, co-chief executive at the Chicago-based fund management firm MC Baldwin. One of MC Baldwin's derivatives portfolios - a private offshore fund totalling more than Dollars 100m - overweights the discretionary approach, which is hard to quantify but allows a more dynamic strategy where traders take views on changing markets. In addition, the fund is heavily diversified, which helps spread the risk. The fund was boosted this summer by its involvement in European and US interest rate markets. Early in the year, it also increased its allocations to diversified traders in the hope of gains in areas such as metals and agriculture. 'We remained concerned about the possible impact that unexpected events could have on the fund and we placed more emphasis on hands-on managers and broadened the number of advisers in a further effort to reduce risk,' Taki said. The portfolio has produced an annual return of 22.65 per cent and a maximum monthly draw-down - the decline in performance from peak to trough - of roughly 2.5 per cent in the past 12 months.</p>

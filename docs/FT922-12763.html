			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: MGM survival called into question by auditor THE survival of MGM, the once legendary Hollywood studio that has been financially crippled by heavy debts and a lengthy legal dispute over its ownership, was questioned yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the company's auditor. In a report on MGM's 1991 results, which showed a total loss of Dollars 347.4m on revenues of Dollars 921.7m, the auditor questioned whether MGM would be able to continue as 'a going concern'. MGM's loss in the last quarter of 1991 was Dollars 114.2m on revenues of Dollars 218.7m. Peat Marwick's unusual qualification of the MGM accounts is based on the fact that the studio is in default on Dollars 600m of loans from Credit Lyonnais of France, and is dependent on the French state bank for additional capital to fund its ongoing operation. Although the company is trying to work out a new business plan with the bank, which is also its majority shareholder, the auditor noted that there was presently no commitment from Credit Lyonnais for the advance of additional cash to MGM. Mr Alan Ladd, the co-chairman of MGM, yesterday blamed the studio's woes on 'the disastrous actions and decisions of prior management.' Mr Ladd was referring to the management of Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who in late 1990 paid Dollars 1.3bn to buy MGM from Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the casino and hotel mogul. Mr Parretti, who is appealing a four-year prison sentence and fraud conviction in Naples, borrowed close to Dollars 1bn from Credit Lyonnais's Netherlands office and secured the debt with MGM stock. The making of these loans, in turn, has placed the chairman and top management of Credit Lyonnais under intense scrutiny in Paris. MGM was paralysed for much of last year as Mr Parretti and Credit Lyonnais engaged in a vicious series of lawsuits against each other. Three months ago a Delaware court finally ruled in favour of the French bank and gave control of management and the board of directors back to Credit Lyonnais. Mr Dennis Stanfill, the newly appointed co-chairman of MGM in charge of finance, yesterday tried to put a brave face on the state of affairs at MGM. 'The key here is that we have the co-operation of the bank and we are working with them to develop a long-term business plan. We hope to have one in the near future,' Mr Stanfill said. MGM's auditors also expressed concern about the 'risk of certain litigation resulting in ultimate liabilities to MGM possibly in excess of current provisions'.</p>

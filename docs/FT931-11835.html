			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Observer: Royal row Even though the Habsburgs long since lost their empire and throne, the imperial family can still get itself into a right twitter when one of its own marries a commoner. Take yesterday's wedding of Austrian crown prince Karl Habsburg-Lothringen to German steel heiress Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza. The Thyssens own the world's second-largest private art collection and are worth upwards of Dollars 1.5bn. But they're still commoners, and a prince is supposed to marry a fellow royal. When attempts to block the match failed, most Habsburgs snubbed the reception and now threaten to deny Karl recognition as head of the family when his father Otto, the 80-year-old MEP, passes on. Courtiers are especially upset about the Swiss-born Francesca's wild past which has caught the fancy of gossip columnists. Meanwhile Karl, the 32-year old grandson of the last emperor, has started work as a game show host on Austrian TV, and seems more interested in his ratings than his imaginary throne. 'We used to have subjects, now we have an audience,' said one Habsburg, snootily spurning the wedding in a small Styrian pilgrims' town.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Greenpeace fails to halt Thorp tests GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, yesterday failed in its High Court attempt to stop British Nuclear Fuels completing uranium testing at its Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield. But in a second decision, greeted with relief by many environmental campaigners, the judge ruled that Greenpeace was legally entitled to bring its challenge, and was not just 'a meddlesome busybody'. The local pressure group Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment, based near Sellafield, described the ruling as 'good news and bad news'. The group was 'disappointed' that testing had been ruled legal, but it welcomed the decision that Greenpeace's challenge was legitimate. Mr Andrew Lees, director of Friends of the Earth, a pressure group which has recently won leave to bring court actions about drinking water quality against water companies, said that yesterday's decision on Greenpeace's right to bring the action, was 'very important' for environmental campaigners. 'BNF had the cheek to argue that organisations such as Greenpeace had no right to go to court to try and protect the environment,' he said. 'But if we did not, who represents the butterflies and frogs?' Greenpeace, which argued that the testing prejudged the government's decision whether to give the plant a licence to start full operation, is considering an appeal against the decision to allow preliminary testing to continue. Mr Justice Otton ruled that nuclear industry regulatory authorities - the Ministry of Agriculture and the pollution inspectorate - had acted rationally and lawfully when they gave the go-ahead in August for testing. Mr David Bonser, BNF's divisional director for Thorp, yesterday said: 'I am very pleased that jobs have been safeguarded and that we can carry on with the commissioning of Thorp.' Thorp's future is now the subject of a public consultation, which ends on October 4. A decision on whether the plant will get the go-ahead to start full operation is expected later in the year. Environmental groups' right to bring court actions has been challenged before. In 1990, a court ruled that the Worldwide Fund for Nature did not have 'sufficient interest' to apply for a judicial review against a decision by Poole Borough Council in Dorset to build a housing estate on a heath, home to several rare species.</p>

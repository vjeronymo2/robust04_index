			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MESTER LEADS PASADENA SYMPHONY AT CIVIC AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> Geography and a flair for orchestration were the ties that bound Saturday  evening at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Jorge Mester's second program for the  Pasadena Symphony was a hyper-familiar French affair.  </P> <P> The centerpiece was a dry, sparkling account of the Ravel Piano Concerto in G  by Jean-Efflam Bavouzet in his local debut. The 26-year-old Frenchman played  with poise, grace and clarity and projected a keen sense of architecture and  understated drama.  </P> <P> Mester and his Pasadenans accompanied tidily enough. Their sound was light but  not fluffy, supporting Bavouzet's cool approach with balanced, accommodating  ensemble.  </P> <P> Surrounding the concerto were two program-music classics. Mester began with a  raucous, occasionally effortful, vigorously chuffing reading of Honegger's  "Pacific 231." He respected the inventiveness and brashness of the score,  downplaying the pictorial elements.  </P> <P> Mester and Co. delivered all the sentimental, fevered visions of Berlioz's  "Symphonie fantastique," however, in a performance torn between fastidious,  chamber-music detail and sheer sonic bravura and athleticism. The orchestra  produced abundant, sometimes edgy and ill-tuned, sound, and solo playing of  great character and skill, on behalf of Mester's indulgent, vivid,  schizophrenic interpretation.JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Beijing hardliner backs reforms ONE OF China's most hardline communist ideologues, Li Ximing, has made a public statement strongly in favour of reform, Reuter reports from Beijing. Li, who is party chief for Beijing, was quoted in an article which carried his name in yesterday's Beijing Daily that economic change should be speeded up along capitalist lines and that left-wing thinking should be resisted. His statement echoes instructions issued recently by Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader. Western diplomats and Chinese observers have long viewed Li as an unashamed Maoist and there had been suggestions in the capital that he would soon be removed. He is a member of the Politburo and is seen as a close associate of Li Peng, the prime minister. His article, a lengthy report summarising a meeting of Beijing's Communist party standing committee, is a signal that left-wingers fear Deng's campaign is unstoppable. Deng has said that those who do not support reform must step aside. One by one, ideologues within the party have given support to Deng's policies. Li is by far the most strident hardliner so far to step into line. Diplomats say Deng's opponents have been weakened by the deaths over the past few months of several leading communist traditionalists. They say the opponents fear for their positions during a period of intense back-room dealing at Communist party headquarters in the run-up to the crucial 14th party congress later this year. Separately, China's labour minister, Ruan Chongwu, warned that unemployment will rise as the nation carries out economic reforms. According to the New China News Agency, Ruan said China's employment policy, which ensures cradle-to-grave job security, should be overhauled. Ruan gave no figure for the number of unemployed, but he said China's urban industries had a surplus labour force of over 10m, while the number of surplus rural workers stood at more than 100m. 'The central government must encourage the development of the labour market and competitive mechanisms to control labour and employment for all Chinese citizens,' Ruan was quoted as saying. The China Daily newspaper quoted him as saying that urban unemployment should be limited to 3.5 per cent, or about 5m people.</p>

Discounters, which sell at low prices and rely on large volumes, account for Pounds 8bn sales, or about 8 per cent of non-food spending - compared with 22 per cent in the US. Verdict says a new generation of cut-price operators is set to make the UK market resemble the US more closely. Verdict on Discounters. Verdict, 112 High Holborn, London WC1. 071 404 5042.

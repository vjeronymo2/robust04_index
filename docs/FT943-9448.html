			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / People: Sheard's mystery departure from F&amp;C The fund management community is now pondering exactly what internal rules were broken by 26-year-old Daniel Sheard, the rising star at Foreign and Colonial who ran its high-profile Higher Income Plan. Last Friday, F&amp;C sent a letter to independent financial advisers, who have been selling the product particularly to elderly clients, advising them that Sheard had 'committed a breach of well-established procedures' and, as a result, had resigned. Moreover, Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, has been notified of the breach and may have to decide whether Sheard ought to be drummed out of the industry as 'not fit and proper'. The fund, which aims to give investors roughly 9 per cent return on their investments, invests in equities, cash and debentures with equity kickers. F&amp;C informed the advisers because it feared that word of the sacking of a high-profile fund manager would leak out and the salesmen would be inundated with calls from concerned investors, according to Simon James, F&amp;C's managing director. But Sheard's offence still remains a mystery. James says 'it wasn't a fingers-in-the-till kind of thing,' and that no investors have lost money as a result. The 'action' was a single event which was spotted by a colleague who noticed something was not quite right. When confronted, Sheard owned up immediately. 'He has behaved impeccably,' James says, adding: 'We feel Daniel is a very talented guy.' Management of the fund is to be taken over by Sheard's boss John Monckton, and by a colleague who ran a parallel fund for offshore investors.</p>

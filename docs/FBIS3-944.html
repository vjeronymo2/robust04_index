			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Call for Disbanding of Homeland Armies -- Greg Mills,  director of studies at the South African Institute of  International Affairs, writes in an article on page 16 of  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 16 March that in the new  South Africa homeland bureaucracies "have to remain in place, as  there is already a shortage of trained civil servants."  However, the homeland military forces "should no longer remain  intact." "Since independence, the record of these armed  formations has been blighted by the incidence of intervention  and instability." Mills says the homeland armies should be  disbanded as "distinct ethnic units," and instead, the emphasis  "should be placed on regimental and not political or ethnic  allegiances."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   De Klerk `Shied' Away From AWB -- "It is time to halt the  AWB's [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] paramilitary posturing and to end its delusions of  martial grandeur," declares a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 March. "The Bophuthatswana  excursion should have convinced government or the Transitional  Executive Council that the AWB's activities must be stopped.  That does not mean banning it. Like any other organisation, it  is entitled to meet and propagate unpopular views -- but as  civilians." "Despite the challenge at the World Trade Centre,  despite confrontations which have cost lives in Ventersdorp and  now Mmabatho, President F.W. de Klerk has shied away from  dealing with this fascist force. The next government will not  be so timid, but the time to pull the AWB's claws is now."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   `Expedience' in AWB, CP Link With Black Groups --  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 16 March in a page-10  editorial believes "there is enough evidence to show that many  Afrikaners do not support the hysteria evinced by the factions  under Eugene Terreblanche [AWB leader] and Ferdi Hartzenberg  [leader of the Conservative Party]. What makes their so-called  link with black conservative groups odious, is that it is based  more on expedience and opportunism in the fight against the ANC  and its allies than coalescence of conviction."</p>

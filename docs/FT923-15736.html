			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / Six cleared in stamps fraud case SIX MEN accused of swindling stamp collectors by dealing in Commonwealth stamps with deliberate printing mistakes were acquitted yesterday at Southwark Crown Court. One defendant, Mr Clive Feigenbaum, a former chairman of Stanley Gibbons stamp dealers, remains on trial charged with fraudulent trading. The judge directed that there was insufficent evidence against the six: Mr Aart Lagerwaard and Mr Ronald Wallen, stamp dealers, of Southampton; Mr Frederick Hughes, a printer, of Thornton Heath, south London; Mr Ronald Grover, another former Stanley Gibbons chairman, of Beaulieu, Hants; Mr Brian Pillinger, managing director of Bristol stamp dealers Urch Harris; and Mr John Charles Smith, a director of the Crown Agents stamp company. Mr William Peeling of Woldingham, Surrey, a former managing director of a printer's, changed his plea to not guilty of fraudulent trading and had been discharged, Judge Cotran said. Giving evidence, Mr Feigenbaum said he had seen nothing wrong in the manufacture of stamps with deliberate misprints provided the contract with the national government did not prevent that. The trial continues.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: No dramatic change - Radio RADIO 4 was wise to bring forward Maxwell: the Last Days as they did, for it took less a personal than a financial view, and such concerns are now only too familiar to those involved. Perhaps a more personal approach might have been better. Alfred Marks sounded right in his few lines as Maxwell (I never heard the original), and BBC drama company players took little parts as chauffeur, barber, secretaries and so on. But the programme, written by Mike Walker with financial information from Caroline Bayler, and narrated by Valerie Singleton, was not as dramatic as the events themselves. There were no new disclosures in the account of Maxwell's financial duplicities in the last years of his life, the directorial chess-playing - none, at any rate, to anyone who has read the series in these pages leading up to the account of Maxwell's last days given on Friday of last week. The account followed posthumous events as far as the will and the later arrests, and Radio 4 did well to produce the programme as soon as they did. In older days, the script could have been broadcast live only a few days after it was written. Can that not be done now, for such commentaries on current affairs? Surprisingly, I found The Thirty-nine Steps (Radio 4, Monday), less entertaining than Witchwood last week. The snag is that Buchan's story clings so closely to Richard Hannay that Peter Buckman's adaptation suggested too often a reading from the novel. There was a lot of action, but reported rather than represented. Hannay, in flight from an expected charge of murder, twice takes an express train, once a small local; he steals a forty horse-power, thousand-guinea motor-car and crashes it; but we only know because he tells us. Impersonated by David Rintoul, he certainly tells us many exciting things, though he never actually describes how you hood your eyes like a hawk, as the top German spy used to do. The smaller parts are picturesquely played, with some Scottish speech that sounded right enough for me, though I've not been to Galloway for ages. The eponymous steps led up to a seaside villa in Kent, but perhaps I shouldn't have told you. Most of the impending changes on Radio 3 announced by Controller Nicholas Kenyon this week naturally involve music, and they largely deal with schedules. They will be very unpopular with many listeners - not because they are wrong, but because changes of any kind are always disliked. It is too bad that Chris Dunkley's Feedback goes out too late this week to get into today's notes. One change already evident is that music announcements are more often amplified with relative fact or opinion, as if we were using a magazine. Soon enough we shall have a magazine, the BBC Music Magazine. The reduction of drama to one play a week has already provoked a bunch of contemporary playwrights to voice their indignation in The Times. I wonder if they have noticed how often at least one of the current weekly two is a repeat of an old production. With the addition of the Season 3 for short experimental drama it may be that writers are less affected than they think. The weekly science magazine is to be continued, at any rate. However much one may disagree, one must reserve one's judgments until after the changes have begun, and this will chiefly be in September. It is hardly likely that any flood of public indignation is likely to have any effect between now and then.</p>

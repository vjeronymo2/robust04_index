			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Krokhmalyuk report: "False Alarm"] </F>   [Text] At 0220 hours on 29 May, the generator of unit No.  1 -- the only one at the Khmelnytskyy Atomic Plant -- was  disconnected from the network as a result of a false triggering  of the system of protection of the block transformer due to a  short circuit in the strands of the control cable. The  automatic system unloaded the reactor installation to the level  of 10 percent of its nominal load. After the fault was repaired  power unit No. 1 was reconnected to the network at 0230 hours on  30 May. There were no violations of the limits or conditions of  safe operation or changes in radioactivity.</p>

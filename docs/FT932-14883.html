			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Technology: Chasing the current - A new engine that outperforms standard induction motors across the board There can be no tougher challenge for inventors than to break into an industrial market with established players worldwide and a mature product that has been refined and improved over many years of development. It is hard enough persuading manufacturers that your invention both works, and works better than the existing product, says Peter Lawrenson. But getting them to change their product line is even harder. Lawrenson is founder, chairman and chief executive of Switched Reluctance Drives, a small Leeds-based company which is trying to penetrate one of the oldest and most mature product sectors in engineering - electric motors. Over the past 25 years, Lawrenson and his team have had an uphill battle convincing the electric motor industry that the so-called switched reluctance (SR) motor can outperform standard induction motors across the board - in efficiency, speed, torque, reliability and robustness. Now, after spending Pounds 35m, an academic idea has been turned into a business whose managers can begin to foresee - through licensing, joint ventures and other deals - the taking of substantial shares in several parts of the world electric motor market, worth Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn (Pounds 20bn-Pounds 26bn) a year in total. 'There are several areas where SR drives could get a 20 per cent market share,' says Lawrenson. 'Ultimately, when SR drives are totally established, the share could be as high as 50 per cent.' Standard electric motors work through the inter-relationship of two magnetic fields generated by electric current passing through coils in the rotor (rotating part) and stator (static part) of the motor. An SR drive, too, has a rotor and a stator, but the rotor is, effectively, a solid piece of iron - it is made of a large number of laminations of iron - and does not carry a current. The idea, says Lawrenson, is to exploit the fact that the forces from a magnetic field on the iron in the rotor can be many times greater than those on currents. Unfortunately, though, they can normally be used only for a short movement, and then stop. The SR drive makes these forces continuous by switching the current in the stator on and off - ensuring the poles on the rotor are continually 'chasing' the current. Controlling this process requires semiconductors, which means that for the first time electronic control is inherent in an electric motor rather than auxiliary to it. The result is a motor that, size for size, produces up to three times as much power as a standard AC or DC motor. Duty for duty, the SR motor costs half as much to manufacture as its standard rivals, due mainly to the much simpler rotor, yet uses conventional materials and the same manufacturing processes - just fewer of them. It is the falling price of semiconductors - coupled with rising prices for copper, iron and labour - that is increasingly making SR drives a commercial proposition, says Lawrenson. 'Until the last year or two,' he says, 'the semiconductors would cost three times as much as the motors, and that didn't add up. 'So we had to get the semiconductor companies to realise that we were offering them potentially the largest market they ever had - through automotive auxiliaries (generators, windscreen wipers etc) and household appliances.' Now, in a typical application such as a washing machine, an SR motor would cost Pounds 16 in total - Pounds 8 each for the motor and the electronics - against Pounds 16 for a conventional motor and Pounds 2 for its associated electronics. SR Drives has spent the past 25 years building up its knowledge of the new type of motor and has become the acknowledged world leader in all aspects of the technology, manufacturing and commercial exploitation of SR drives. Having initially believed that the motor would work best at smaller power outputs, the company has discovered that there is no theoretical upper size limit. It has successfully developed motors at sizes approaching 1MW, and has paper designs for motors of 5-10MW, big enough to power a locomotive. The company decided some years ago that licensing was the best approach to exploiting the technology, but has found that the electric motor industry's customers in a wide range of businesses from washing machines and mining equipment to aerospace pumps and compressors have been more receptive than the motor producers themselves. Some of the latter, says Lawrenson, have considered the SR drive to be 'ivory tower rhubarb' and seem also to have found the prospect of switching to SR drives too disturbing psychologically. In Europe, four companies are producing SR drives for general industrial uses, under licence from the Leeds company, and Sole, a subsidiary of Zanussi, is expected to be producing an SR motor for white goods within two years. In Sweden, Besam, one of the world's leading automatic door producers, is using SR motors - their high torque eliminates the need for a gearbox and thus saves space. Now Lawrenson is considering taking SR Drives into manufacturing. It already sources key electronic components for its licensees and may within a year or so begin producing one or two motors on a modest scale. Two leading US companies, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard, are using SR drives independently of the Leeds company in some of their products. Lawrenson takes their involvement as a compliment: 'We don't mind, it authenticates all that we've been saying for the past 20 years.'</p>

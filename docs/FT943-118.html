			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Paribas beats trend with rise Paribas, one of the leading French banking groups, yesterday reported group profits up 13 per cent to FFr1.27bn (Dollars 241m) in the first half of 1994. The rise stood in sharp contrast to the difficulties experienced by some of its competitors. Paribas was also able to announce provisions down 9 per cent to FFr4.32bn, compared with the first half of last year. However, there was a 64 per cent growth in provisions for Credit du Nord, the group's wholly-owned subsidiary, which reported first-half losses of FFr191m. That compared with losses of FFr460m in the first half of 1993. Paribas said the results reflected a notable reduction in market-related activities, offset by growth in commercial banking activities and a reduction in provisions. Mr Michel Francois Poncet, chairman of the supervisory board, said: 'We will continue to navigate in a changing and difficult market.' Global revenues rose 1.4 per cent to FFr17.49bn, with operating profits down 3.9 per cent to FFr7.49bn in the first half of the year. Depreciation charges rose 5.8 per cent to FFr10bn. Mr Andre Levy Lang, director of the group's management board, said: 'Our aim is to be an international group with a French base. These results are a step in the right direction.' Loans to clients dropped 4.8 per cent to FFr395bn and deposits rose 1.9 per cent to FFr210bn, with the balance sheet total jumping 1.1 per cent to FFr1,371bn.</p>

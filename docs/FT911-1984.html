			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei climbs on hopes of rate cut Tokyo RENEWED speculation of an imminent cut in domestic interest rates contributed to a broadly based rally yesterday, but the low volume led dealers to wonder whether the uptrend could be sustained, writes Seth Sulkin in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 377.75 ahead at 26,489.00 after a high for the day of 26,529.84 and a low of 26,193.61. Gains outpaced losses by 862 to 143, with 103 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 35.03 to 1,998.45, up 1.8 per cent compared with a gain of 1.4 per cent for the Nikkei. Volume picked up to 350m shares from 230m. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.19 to 1,508.53. The US Federal Reserve's overnight decision to lower the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point to 5.5 per cent raised hopes that the Bank of Japan would follow suit. The US discount rate is below Japan's for the first time in 14 years, and there was talk that the Bank of Japan would cut its discount rate, currently at 6 per cent, by  3/4 percentage point to bring it back below the US level. Although interest rate-sensitive and large-capital issues were among yesterday's favourites, dealers said the rally extended to virtually every part of the market. All of the 36 sectoral indices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced. Mr George Nimmo, manager of equity sales at SBCI, questioned whether the increased turnover signalled the start of a new rally. While modest investor buying interest might be enough to push the Nikkei over 27,000, the uptrend would not endure without a cut in Japan's discount rate, he said. With many market participants away for the Golden Week holiday until next Tuesday, there was little selling pressure, Mr Nimmo noted. Among big-capital issues, NTT strengthened Y42,000 to Y989,000. Railroad and infrastructure-related companies were also popular. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries forged ahead Y39, more than 5 per cent, to Y765. Earnings revisions featured for the second day in succession. Akai Electric again set a record high, finishing Y100 ahead at Y970 following the company's upward revised profits estimate for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1991. Olympic Optical, boosted by its improved earnings projection, registered an advance of Y50 or 5 per cent at Y1,100. Sanrio, a leading maker of gift merchandise, contrasted with a fall of almost 6 per cent following a sharp downward revision in pre-tax profits. The share price finished Y220 off at Y4,000. Video game makers and related component manufacturers advanced. Nintendo, which holds a dominant market share, is expected to raise shipments of its popular Super Family Computer after Golden Week. Its shares gained Y200 to Y16,000, while those of Sega, another game maker, moved ahead Y200 to Y11,700. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 363.10 to 29,145.40 on volume of almost 31m shares. Roundup RISES IN Tokyo and on Wall Street, following the US interest rate cut, lent some support to the Pacific Rim yesterday. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Manila and Bombay were closed. NEW ZEALAND was encouraged by Tuesday's news of progress in the Carter Holt Harvey (CHH) debt reduction programme. The Barclays index showed a modest gain of 8.20 at 1,476.08 after fairly active turnover of NZDollars 24.7m, up from NZDollars 20.4m. CHH ended 7 cents up at NZDollars 1.80, after reaching a session's high of NZDollars 1.84, following the news that it had sold its stake in a Japanese pulp mill venture for NZDollars 260m. The group also said that a subsidiary, NZ Forest Products, would soon sell Simsmetal, an Australian scrap metal company, and its stake in Bridge Oil, an Australian diamond and resources concern. The sales could raise up to another NZDollars 400m. CHH shares have been under pressure in recent months because of delays in the sale of assets. AUSTRALIA recovered from its day's lows on domestic buying. The All Ordinaries index was finally only 1.7 down at 1,532.5, after falling 12.5 earlier. Turnover came to ADollars 208m, down from ADollars 295m. Among companies reporting results, Palmer Tube Mills receded 4 cents to ADollars 1.20 and MIM, the mining group, lost 7 cents to ADollars 1.70. HONG KONG rose on expectations of a cut in domestic interest rates. The Hang Seng index added 42.87 at 3,631.23. Reports that Sino-British talks on the future of Hong Kong's new airport might start again soon also encouraged local speculators. Turnover was boosted to HKDollars 1.79bn from HKDollars 1.07bn, mostly by a large cross in Wing On shares accounting for HKDollars 692.61m. TAIWAN fell in volatile trading in spite of a firm start. The weighted index weakened 71.11 or 1.2 per cent to 5,850.18 as turnover expanded to a heavy TDollars 91.8bn from TDollars 64.5bn. SEOUL closed easier in light trading, although the financial and chemical sectors rose after Yukong announced that it had struck oil in Egypt. The composite stock index shed 1.22 to 644.39. Turnover was thin at Won123bn, against Won170bn. News that consumer prices had risen 5.4 per cent from January to April, more than half of the government's target of 9 per cent for the year, weighed on the market.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: EU inflation holds steady The EU's rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was an annualised 3 per cent for the third consecutive month in November, according to Eurostat, the EC statistical office. The level, the lowest for more than seven years, was 3.1 per cent in August and July after remaining at 3.2 per cent from March to June. The rate was last at this level in March 1987 and peaked at 6.3 per cent in October 1990. It touched 3.4 per cent last December/January. The figures show France still has the lowest inflation rate in the EU, with a provisional 1.6 per cent. Only Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece are above the EU average. France had a seasonally adjusted trade surplus in October of FFr11.28bn (Pounds 1.33bn), against a revised surplus in September of FFr9.07bn, provisional customs office data show. The office had originally reported a surplus in September of FFr9.19bn. Economists had forecast a surplus for October of about FFr7.2bn. Spain's accumulated budget deficit on a cash basis shrunk 3.8 per cent to Pta2,850bn (Pounds 13.8bn) in the first 11 months of 1994, from Pta2,740bn in the same period in 1993, the Finance Ministry said yesterday.</p>

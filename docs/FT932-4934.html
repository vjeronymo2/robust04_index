			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / People: Innovation brings advance at Scottish Enterprise Scottish Enterprise, the development body for Scotland outside the Highlands, has appointed John Lord to the post of director of strategy. Lord has, until now, been chief executive of Enterprise Ayrshire, one of 13 local enterprise companies (LECs) for which SE is the parent. LECs are the Scottish equivalent of the English training and enterprise councils (TECs). Enterprise Ayrshire is regarded as one of the most imaginative LECs. Its training programmes have been innovative, despite the straitjacket imposed by the Training Agency. Lord, an Englishman aged 41, is the only LEC chief executive to have come from the Training Agency; most of his counterparts were with SE's predecessor, the Scottish Development Agency. Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of SE, says that Lord's 'perception of what needs to be done and how to go about it struck a chord with the chairman (Professor Donald MacKay) and me'. SE has also appointed Russel Griggs to a new post, director of business development. Griggs, 44, had headed company development at SE. His new division will stimulate the creation of new companies, after an SE inquiry showed slow new company formation in Scotland.</p>

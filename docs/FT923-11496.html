			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: BCE shows 20% downturn BCE, the biggest Canadian telecommunications group, said the recession and lower profits at its Northern Telecom subsidiary caused a 20 per cent decline in second-quarter profits. For the first half, earnings were down 9 per cent. However, despite slow economic recovery, BCE expects improved performance in all sectors in the second half. The second-quarter performance was also affected by write-downs at its Montreal Trustco financial services arm. Final earnings were CDollars 246m (USDollars 205m) or 72 cents a common share, against CDollars 307m, or 92 cents, a year earlier. Operating revenues were CDollars 4.97bn against CDollars 5.05bn. First-half earnings were CDollars 544m, or CDollars 1.60 a common share, against CDollars 600m, or CDollars 1.80 a share, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 9.84bn against CDollars 9.78bn. BCE said first-half telecommunications earnings were flat because of the recession. Bell Canada, the telecommunications utility providing most of BCE's earnings, saw slower growth. Its first-half profit gained a modest 1.2 per cent and operating revenues rose 2.4 per cent. Bell Canada contributed CDollars 453m, or CDollars 1.47 a share, to BCE's first-half earnings, unchanged from a year earlier. Northern Telecom contributed 34 cents per BCE share against 38 cents.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Software to make orders easier Much of the software designed for manufacturing requires the staff taking orders from customers and those doing the inventory to know the part numbers of thousands of components or products. KnowledgeBase Manufacturing, developed by the ASK Group, in Santa Rosa, California, solves the problem by accepting information by generic description - wooden legs for a table, say, or colours for a fabric. As the order-taker fills in the customer's requirements the software allocates the part numbers. The software, which is sold in the UK and Benelux countries by Hoskyns, runs on IBM's ASA/400 machines, and handles details of the manufacturing process from first orders to final production. ASK: US, 707 528 6560. Hoskyns: UK, 071 434 2171.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: R.S.V.P.;  </P> <P> DIAMOND COUPLES ARE DINOSAUR'S BEST FRIEND  </P> <P> You'll be seeing quite a few people around town wearing dinosaurs with diamond  eyes. Little chips, but diamonds. They're going to Diamond Couples -- among  early contributors to the National History Museum's Dinosaur Ball March 10  headed by Ray and Nancy McCullough. For the first time, the museum has named  honorary chairs: loyal museum supporters Otis and Dody Booth.  </P> <P> VICTORY PARTY: Like a good USC chairman of the trustees, George and Marion  Scharffenberger rushed back from New Year's partying in Rancho Mirage at 3 a.m.  to do some white-tent celebrating on the Rose Bowl concourse in Pasadena. After  five years, George is about to retire as chairman.  </P> <P> It was a joyous lunch bunch, including newest trustee Malcolm R. Currie  (chairman of Hughes Aircraft Co. and a UC Berkeley Ph.D) and his wife, Barbara;  state Atty. Gen. John and Andrea Van de Kamp; USC president James and Marilyn  Zumberge; USC Law School's chairman Scott and Barbara Bice, and George and Mary  Lou Boone (he's president of the General Alumni Assn.).  </P> <P> CUTE: Brown bags printed with miniature shopping carts put us in line for the  Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce's 102nd Inaugural Ball Friday at the  Century Plaza. The ball is a salute to the incoming slate of officers: James P.  Miscoll, chairman of the board; Byron Allumbaugh, first vice-chairman, and  Betsy Sanders, second vice-chairman.  </P> <P> The brown bags indicate that the event will honor the food retailers and  wholesalers industry.

Joan Irvine Smith's The Oaks ranch is going Southwestern for the American  Horse Shows Assn. "Fiesta" winter fund-raiser Jan. 19 in San Juan Capistrano.  Joan and chairman Judy Fluor Runels are talking ribs and barbecue with some hot  dancing. The country's top equestrians will be partying to raise funds to  maintain safe and fair practices in the show ring.  </P> <P> PLAUDITS: To Linda Cantwell and Patty Pillsbury, who will chair the Los Angeles  Music Center Opera League's raffle committee. Last year's event, says Joan  Thompson, president, turned over $144,000 to L.A. Opera General Director Peter  Hemmings . . .  </P> <P> To the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee and its president Susi McConaghy,  adding $134,000 to bring donations from the 1989 Pasadena Showcase House of  Design to $400,000.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To Dorothy Collins Brown, new trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum  of Art . . .  </P> <P> Lee Graff, honorary vice chairman for life of the City of Hope board of  directors . . .  </P> <P> Roy Disney, chairman of the alumni fund at Buckley School . . .

One highlight will be the dinner Friday at  the Radisson Hotel in Palm Springs.  </P> <P> APOLOGIES: Blame it on gremlins. We know and knew all along that the Orange  Bowl was Monday, not last Sunday, as in On View Dec. 31.  </P></p>

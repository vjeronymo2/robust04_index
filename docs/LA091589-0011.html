			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 911 GUIDELINES  </P> <P> I was horrified by the events which led to the shooting deaths of Maria Navarro  and three house guests in East Los Angeles (Metro, Aug. 30).  </P> <P> My heart aches for the families and children involved in the aftermath of such  senseless murders, and also for the emergency dispatcher who followed  established but inadequate procedures.  </P> <P> Surely, 911 operators must be given new guidelines with which to instruct  threatened callers:  </P> <P> 1. Have intended victim leave location.  </P> <P> 2. Notify neighbors and friends to be on the lookout.  </P> <P> 3. Lock doors (although I believe no locks will keep a determined assailant  out!)  </P> <P> 4. Ask a friend or relative (the mother, if possible) of the assailant to try  to deter him/her.  </P> <P> 5. Post a prominent note on door to warn assailant of intent to self-defend,  imminent arrival of the police, a plea to desist, etc.  </P> <P> With our expertise at space exploration, we need more knowledge and commitment  to exploring the most fascinating space of all -- the human mind: Solutions can  be found there.  </P> <P> DIANE E. WATSON  </P> <P> State Senator  </P> <P> D-Los Angeles  </P></p>

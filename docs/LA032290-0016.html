			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: THE LOVE AFFAIR IS OVER  </P> <P> This is not a subtle town. Its people drink Corona beer from the bottle and eat  chili dogs. They celebrate important events by dining at Chinese restaurants in  which food is ordered by the number. Sometimes they order No. 4 with the  chicken chow mein, sometimes No. 11 with egg foo young. But they never order  bird's nest soup and they never use chopsticks.  </P> <P> I mention that by way of explaining the current bewilderment at the turn of  events that may bring the Raiders back to Oakland. The people love the Raiders.  That is, they loved the Raiders. Past tense. They want the Raiders back. That  is, they want the Raiders back but they do not want to buy them back for $660  million, which is what the city leaders are willing to spend.  </P> <P> And they do not want Al Davis back, no matter what. If there were a way they  could get the Raiders without Davis and without having to mortgage their souls,  they'd think about it. Carefully.  </P> <P> I am an Oakland boy, born and raised here. I flew up the other day to ask how  the people felt about the team returning to the town it left in tears eight  years ago to come to Glitz City. One of them replied by asking, "Who wants a  second visit from a rapist?"  </P> <P> Another held up a drawing by Lou Grant, a former editorial cartoonist for the  Oakland Tribune. It shows a monster emerging from the slime and muck of the  bay, heading toward Oakland. The caption says, "Creature from the silver and  black lagoon." The monster is Al Davis.  </P> <P> Guys like the Electric Shoeshine Man feel betrayed. When the Raiders left in  1982, he said Oakland would cease to exist. He meant it. "Adios, Oakland," was  the way he put it. He would have given his manhood to keep them. But now?  </P> <P> "How can we spend that kind of money for a football team when we can't even  feed the people?" he said, putting a gloss on a pair of brown loafers in his  shop on Webster Street. His real name is Clarence Blair. They call him the  Electric Shoeshine Man because he sometimes uses a plug-in buffer.  </P> <P> "They wanna charge $30 a ticket for the worst seats in the house so they can  pay Davis all that money. Who can afford that? Hardly anybody. This is a poor  town. The stadium's gonna be empty, and that's a sad thing."  </P> <P> Not far away, in a saloon called Mr. B's, Don Bankston, the Mr. B in the name,  was skeptical.  </P> <P> "They left us once," he was saying, "and they could leave us again. How can you  trust Al Davis?"  </P> <P> He was seated under strings of blinking red and green lights that trailed  across the ceiling. On the wall behind the bar was a T-shirt you could buy for  $12. It said, "The Silver and Black are Back."  </P> <P> This used to be the Cactus Room. It was Oakland's No. 1 Raiders bar, decorated  with team memorabilia. The players themselves drank here in the old days. When  they left for L.A., owner Al Puncsak almost cried. "They're taking our  children," he said. Two years later, he sold the bar. No one knows where he is.  </P> <P> "Al Davis may be one hell of a businessman," Mr. B said under the blinking  lights, "but he's got a lesson coming. You can't buy loyalty." He shrugged. "It  was a love affair and now it's over."  </P> <P> Ex-wrestler Sammy Stein was chairman of the Moose Club committee that welcomed  the Raiders into existence in 1960. He was a Raiders fan san pareil. He loved  Big Ben Davidson like a son. Kenny Stabler too and the old man, George Blanda.  </P> <P> Now he feels that pouring out taxpayer's money to bring the Raiders back is  like trying to raise the Titanic.  </P> <P> "It isn't even the same team," he said, looking out a window of his home in the  Dimond District. "Only the guys who smoke dollar cigars want them back. I won't  go see them anymore. You can't fool the sports fans of Oakland."  </P> <P> I heard it downtown and I heard it in the neighborhoods. I heard it at a sports  bar called the King's X and I heard it at the airport. The Raiders aren't worth  $660 million. Not these Raiders. The people will get stuck with the bill. The  people ought to be able to vote on it. The people are getting screwed.  </P> <P> Even my sister Emily is p.o.'d. She is a calm and gentle woman, almost serene.  She doesn't curse, drink gin or smoke cigars. There's one in every family.  </P> <P> The only time I ever heard her swear was when Lamonica hit Biletnikoff with a  40-yard touchdown pass in the last six seconds of a game. Later, she said her  rosary beads and asked forgiveness for the unseemly display.  </P> <P> But now she's saying, "To hell with the Raiders. The schools need the money.  Oakland kids are growing up stupid. Last year we got stuck with a $90 city tax.  What will it be to pay for a damned football team?"  </P> <P> Sister Emily sure has changed.  </P></p>

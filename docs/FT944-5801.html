			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (7): Inland Revenue asks for a discount - On-line information / Claire Gooding looks at the way the tax authorities are using their accounting system to negotiate discounts with suppliers and keep tight budget control A radical change of culture is taking place at the Inland Revenue, not least because it is expected to spend money as efficiently as it collects it. Like any other government department, the Revenue is taking responsibility for its own procurement. According to assistant director of procurement, John Cavell, it is leading the way with its PCS - Purchasing Cycle System. Walker's software had already been chosen as the basis of PCS when Mr Cavell, whose responsibilities include contracts and purchasing, took over his post three years ago. A believer in the principle that 'information is power', his brief was to maximise the purchasing power of the Revenue, and that included keeping track of how much had been committed to a particular supplier. 'Experience has proved that you can make 80 per cent of savings without a computer system just by using professional practices, but you can get the extra 20 per cent by using a computer,' he says. 'The information it supplies gives you the purchasing power to negotiate discounts.' The Revenue wanted to record projects involving ongoing commitments as well as upfront payments. Although a certain amount of tailoring was needed for the Accounts Payable, Stock Control and Purchasing modules, Mr Cavell says: 'Where possible we've tried to stick to the standard package because we recognise that the more we modify it, the more costly it becomes.' The Revenue used outside consultants, including Ernst and Young, on the contract. Currently 700 sites are served by PCS, which is adopting the system as part of project Iron, the Inland Revenue Office for the Nineties. For end users the system runs on PCs, although the big advantage is the mainframe centralisation of data. The commitment accounting (Encumbrance) module, which the Revenue encouraged Walker to complete, is a particular attraction for end users because they can make forward planning commitments as well as tracking cash payments for goods and services that have already been delivered. 'We trap expenditure at source so that we know up front how much is committed in the long term,' explains Mr Cavell. 'It helps with delegated budgets and what we term empowerment, where people are responsible for their own budgets. Previously bills were paid centrally at Worthing, but now users can have a halfway house, accessing the system from their own screen.' The project, worth a total of Pounds 500,000 in current terms, is planned to save more than Pounds 20m, achieved from early payment discounts, a reduction in printed forms and stockholding.

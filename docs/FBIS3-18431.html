It is the first step toward  safeguarding security and stability in Europe after the Cold  War, the Foreign Ministry said. This urgently required  safeguarding is the focus of EU expansion.    During the long nights in Brussels, Bonn had to play a  central role in order to avoid a failure, high-ranking diplomats  participating in the talks said. A first analysis said that,  after five days and three nights of dramatic struggles, the EU  has now regained its balance. The entry of the Nordic countries  and Austria will end the tilt toward the south. The north will  support German foreign policy in terms of integrating Central  and East Europe. The north of Europe has a different  sensitivity for the new problems arising at the end of the Cold  War. Many members of the current Union are still caught in a  reactive frame of mind. Some of these countries seem to be  sitting in a television chair watching whether Central and East  Europe get to their feet or break down. An analysis of the  situation to the east of the Union is far from reassuring. This  is why strategic changes will have to be made in the Union's way  of thinking and acting. The entry of the new members --  provided that an agreement is achieved with Norway and  membership is approved in the referendums -- will be helpful in  this respect.    Diplomats taking part in the negotiations said it was no  exaggeration to say the agreement was reached only because the  Germans made the others feel the full weight of their new role  in the center of Europe. In fact, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  had not accepted postponing the decisions, thus requiring all  participants to come together. Several times, when the  negotiations threatened to fail, he simply refused to get up and  leave. Germany faced a challenge and made its point, the  Foreign Ministry said. If the negotiations had failed this  would have indicated to the reform states that the West  Europeans do not even want to accept the rich countries in the  north, not to speak of the others in the East.    If Norway wants, things will work out fairly quickly in  Brussels, the Foreign Ministry said. As in Finland's case,  securing the transatlantic connection is vital for Norway. Yet,  the referendums that are still to be held will not be a  walkover. The Germans have internally been accused of selling  off the EU cheaply. But Bonn was guided by the idea of helping  the governments of the applicant countries alleviate the short  pain of adjustment so that everything can get back to normal  quickly, the Foreign Ministry said.</p>

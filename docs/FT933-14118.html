			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stet up 7% on telecoms restructuring plan A SLIGHT easing of pressure on the French franc and a modest cut in the German repo rate steadied nerves as attention turned to the Buba meeting today. Paris was closed for a public holiday. MILAN, encouraged by the long awaited statement on the restructuring of the telecommunications sector, moved ahead, while technical trading ahead of today's end of the monthly account also lifted prices. The Comit index closed up 7.93 or 1.45 per cent to 553.66. While the broad details of the restructuring of the telecoms sector has been in the market for some time, the lack of other positive news recently has focused investors' attention on this area, said Mr John Stewart of Milan brokers, Pastorino. Stet also gained on news of its five year convertible bond, convertible into Sip savings shares. The stock rose L264 or 7.2 per cent to L3,910. Italcable and Sip, which are to be merged by the end of the year to allow the formation of Telecomm Italia on January 1, 1994, showed respective gains of L316 and L86 to L7,890 and L2,811. Reports that Fiat might be seeking to reduce its shareholding in Gemina, the merchant bank, lifted the latter's price L38 to L1,380, while Fiat gained L103 to L6,495. FRANKFURT closed mixed, the DAX index rising 4.39 to 1,811.55 against a day's high of 1,821.31. Interest rate cut hopes abated, but tomorrow's expiry of equity options traded on the Deutsche Terminborse boosted interest in some blue chips. Turnover was DM9.6bn. Daimler rose DM9 to DM673 after two news items: first, that an S-class revamp would produce a lighter, more fuel efficient car; and, secondly, on the state of Bavaria's plan to sell its 8 per cent stake in the group's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary. Metallgesellschaft added DM9.50 to recent gains which have taken it up by nearly a quarter in less than a month. It was boosted by an announcement from MG's Metall Mining Corp confirming rumours that it was considering forming a new unit to hold its gold assets, dealers said. Mr David Morgan at Lehman Brothers in London observed that MG is a reflection of base metal prices, not a bull point, and a guide to the health of German manufacturing industry, which is debatable. In steels, Krupp Hoesch climbed DM7.10 to DM132.60 and Thyssen by DM5.20 to DM212. Mr Morgan said that Thyssen has indicated that the worst is over in its steel division and that Krupp Hoesch, highly-geared and in the midst of very deep restructuring, is another bet on German economic recovery. The energy, chemicals and metals group, Viag, rose DM6.80 to DM393.00 on the confirmation that it would maintain its 1993 dividend; and Henkel, which makes Persil, fell DM9.50 to DM550.20 although it said that it saw no reasons for a global price war in detergents, following drastic price cuts by Procter &amp; Gamble in the US. AMSTERDAM returned to a positive stance in spite of a further sharp fall in Unilever, down Fl 5.40 or 2.7 per cent to Fl 192.10. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.2 to 117.1. Hoare Govett called the market's reaction to news that Procter &amp; Gamble of the US was to cut the list price of liquid detergents 'unjustified'. It said that,in the short term,the impact of P &amp; G's strategy on Unilever's earnings would be 'negligible', given the latter's aggressive promotion and discounting of new products in the US. Ahold, which has a strong US supermarket presence, lost Fl 1.10 to Fl 94.90 on the same story. BRUSSELS noted a 12 per cent rise in Arbed, the Luxembourg-based steel maker, up BFr380 to BFr3,500, while the Bel-20 index eased 0.41 lower to 1,328.13. STOCKHOLM gathered ground for the seventh straight session, assisted by a SKr13 rise in Ericsson B to SKr366. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 5.20 to 1,139.80. DUBLIN extended its rally as retail investors bought into Bank of Ireland before it goes ex rights today, and shares in the major Irish food processors surged to new all-time highs on the back of positive sentiment towards the sector. The ISEQ overall index rose 15.78, or 1 per cent to 1,635.59, its financial component putting in a 1.2 per cent per cent gain. In foods, said Mr Aidan McGuire of Davy Stockbrokers, Avonmore's 3.5p rise to 167p left it up 10p on the week on a combination of earnings and rating upgrades, while Greencore, 6.5p higher at 332.5p put itself 32.5p ahead of the placing price for the Bank of Ireland stake of 9.6m shares earlier this week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices July 14 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1236.77  1237.76   1237.63  1238.37 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1282.25  1284.33   1283.61  1285.05                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1236.56  1235.86   1236.91  1237.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1282.82  1285.07   1282.67  1283.38  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 13    Jul 12     Jul 9     Jul 8     Jul 7 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1235.91   1232.90   1230.56   1225.73   1211.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1279.32   1274.63   1274.12   1270.80   1260.04  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1238.81; 200 - 1285.20 Low/day: 100 - 1235.29 200 - 1281.19.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

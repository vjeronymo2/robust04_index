			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJERUS SAYS REMARK WAS IN JEST  </P> <P> Rick Majerus, former Marquette University basketball coach, says he meant no  offense with his remark on a Milwaukee radio talk-show about the prevalence of  irregular sexual behavior in women's athletics.  </P> <P> Majerus, now the coach at the University of Utah, had been asked about the  pressures of winning because of the money it can produce for a school.  </P> <P> Said Majerus: "I'm for these new rules of moving the season back, publishing  graduation rates and dropping it from 28 to 25 games, but the 28-to-25 drop  will never occur because of the economics of the situation, just like we'll  never have a return to freshman eligibility. And people don't realize that what  will compound that problem is women's athletics.  </P> <P> "Men's athletics are so visible it's amazing. You know, with women's athletics,  my experience has been that there's a great deal of, um, and I'll be frank with  you here, there's a great deal of, uh, irregular sexual behavior, let me say.  </P> <P> "And, you know, that's never brought to the forefront. If that were that  prevalent in men's athletics, there'd be Sports Illustrated, Time magazine,  would have exposes from now ad infinity."  </P> <P> Majerus, who spent two seasons at Ball State University between his stints at  Marquette and Utah, later refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> "I don't care to get into it any further," Majerus said. "I meant nothing by  it. Everybody knows I'm a flippant guy. I said a hundred things, kidding  around. . . . I made a joke about sheep in Wyoming. I said something about  passing the microphone and catching a communicable disease. The other night at  the roast for Del Harris (coach of the Milwaukee Bucks), I'm talking about  Del's underwear. What does that mean?"  </P></p>

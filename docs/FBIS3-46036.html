The news reports said Fedorov, also deputy prime minister in  charge of financial affairs, had rejected the post of finance  minister in the new government which did not carry with it a  deputy prime minister's role.    Fedorov made the decision after Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and his first deputy Oleg Soskovets refused to meet  his demands to sack chief banker Viktor Gerashchenko and Deputy  Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha.    According to the radio, Chernomyrdin asked Fedorov to remain  in the cabinet, but the latter refused after his demands had  been rejected.    In a related development, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor  Gaydar resigned on Sunday. Gaydar, Yeltsin's architect of the  country's market-oriented economic reform, is the leader of the  "Russia's Choice" bloc.    Well-informed sources told reporters earlier today that  Chernomyrdin would discuss the list of the new government with  President Boris Yeltsin this afternoon.</p>

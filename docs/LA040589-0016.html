			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENERGY SECURITY MUCH IMPROVED, BUT NEVER CHALLENGE-PROOF  </P> <P> Over the past nine months, a series of accidents and mishaps have disrupted oil  production and transportation in the North Sea and now in Alaska.  </P> <P> The irony is that these areas are two of the most important pillars on which  the industrial world rebuilt its energy security after the oil shocks of the  1970s. Alaskan oil development, which only received its go-ahead in the midst  of the 1973 embargo, has proved to be central to America's position, accounting  today for a quarter of total U.S. oil production. The Alaskan spill has  occurred at a time when energy security itself has been coming to the fore  again. The volatility of oil prices has added to the uneasiness; in a matter of  six months, the price of oil has gone up almost 40%.  </P> <P> Yet, by many measures, we have seen a considerable improvement in U.S. energy  security. America is considerably more energy efficient than it was in 1973,  when the first oil shock hit. Oil is now produced and exported from many more  countries than was the case in the early 1970s, and energy users have greater  flexibility to switch among fuels. The automobile fuel efficiency standards and  Alaskan oil production have each proved to be worth about two million barrels  per day to the United States -- one in terms of reduced demand and the other in  terms of increased output.  </P> <P> Moreover, various important measures for energy security are now in place --  including the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, which contains the equivalent of 86 days of oil imports. When the  sensible idea of such a reserve was first raised by President Dwight D.  Eisenhower in the aftermath of the 1956 Suez Crisis (which also saw an oil  disruption), his Cabinet dismissed the idea as ridiculous. Now, it is seen as a  wise insurance policy -- and one that might have saved everyone a lot of  hardship at the end of the 1970s.  </P> <P> Today, there is a sizable security margin. Oil and energy are not the  constraints on economic growth that they were in the 1970s and early '80s. In  fact, the oil price collapses of 1986 and 1988 have been like giant "tax cuts"  for consumers, contributing to the unexpectedly strong economic growth of the  past few years while helping to keep down inflation. While people still grope  for the new meaning of "power" in international relations, it is no longer in  terms of confrontation between consuming and producing countries, between North  and South, but now in terms of the relationship between the United States,  Japan and the other industrial countries.  </P> <P> Yet recent trends are spurring renewed concerns. America is a high-cost oil  producer; in the new market that has come with the oil-price collapse, the  United States does not easily compete. U.S. oil production has fallen by more  than 10% since 1985. Meanwhile, demand has risen by 14%. The effect can be seen  in oil imports. They had risen to 46% of total consumption in 1979, when the  Shah of Iran's fall from power triggered the second shock. Imports declined to  just 27% of consumption in 1985, but now are around 40% and are generally  expected to exceed 50% sometime in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Some believe that the severity of the price collapse, the sharp decline in  energy investment and the tighter balance between supply and demand will set  the stage for a new crisis. Whether that actually happens depends on a variety  of factors. Will conservation lose its momentum in the advanced countries? Will  economic growth recover in the developing world, setting off explosive growth  in demand for oil? Will non-OPEC production continue at present levels, or  decline? In answering that last question, future exploration in Alaska will be  one of the most important factors, since it is widely considered to be one of  the last best hopes for finding major new oil resources in the United States.  </P> <P> But one further question will also affect the outlook -- the new environmental  agenda. The environment is becoming as important as security in evaluating  energy choices. While eyes are currently fastened on the Alaskan oil spill, the  real focus is on clean air and the atmosphere. The result could be a major  shift toward natural gas as a clean fuel, a new emphasis on research and  investment in new technologies, and a new rationale in the 1990s for  conservation. Whether that will work with or against security remains to be  seen. The environment is, like defense or medical care or education, a "good,"  which means that someone has to pay for it. We can certainly look forward to  major political battles as to how the bill will be divided up.  </P> <P> The dramatic shifts in oil prices over the past few months underscore the  volatility in the energy scene and how rapidly circumstances can change. Both  current realities and four decades of experience (though surprisingly  little-recognized) tell us that it would be remarkable if we get to the end of  the 1990s without our energy security being challenged in one way or another --  whether by politics, pressures in the balance between supply and demand or by  various combinations of "accidents" and surprises. Such challenges do not,  however, necessarily mean a new crisis. That will depend on conditions in the  marketplace, economic and political institutions, the values and priorities and  objectives of consumers and producers -- and on the memory of hard-learned  lessons.  </P></p>

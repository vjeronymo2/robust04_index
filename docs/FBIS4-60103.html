			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The unifying Friday prayers were held throughout  the country simultaneously today. In Tehran, the prayers were  led by Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani. [passage  omitted]    In his second sermon, the president of the Islamic Republic  of Iran pointed to the restrictions placed by the Saudi  government on the holding of the disavowal of infidels ceremony.  He said: The Saudis could have acted more sensibly and not  caused differences between the two important countries of the  region. Today, Islamic unity is a principle as important for us  as the disavowal of infidels principle. He added: Considering  the crisis points in various parts of the world, and with the  wise leadership of the honorable leader of the Islamic  revolution [Khamene'i], another crisis was averted over this  matter.    The president advised the Saudis to think harder and to take  on more correct methods in future years. He said: We hope that  in the future, a program on the hajj acceptable to both  countries will be formulated which will take into account the  views of both sides. [passage omitted]</p>

(IDO) is close to reaching an agreement with Motorola Inc. of  the United States to construct 159 more Motorola-formula car  phone relay stations possibly early next week, industry sources  said Saturday [5 March].    IDO, Japan's major mobile phone operator, and the U.S.  telecom equipment maker are currently ironing details of the  deal, including the timing of construction, according to the  sources. The accord would help avoid U.S. trade retaliation  against Japan, they said.    The sources said IDO still opposes a U.S. call for  allocation  of part of the frequencies presently used for Nippon Telegraph  and Telephone Corp.-formula phones to Motorola.    If both companies reach a final agreement, Japanese telecom  trade negotiators are ready to start talks with their U.S.  counterparts to avoid U.S. retaliation, an official at the Posts  and Telecommunications Ministry said.</p>

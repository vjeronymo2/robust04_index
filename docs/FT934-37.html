			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: MCI to compete head-on with Baby Bells MCI Communications, the US long-distance telephone company, is expected to announce a bold initiative next week to enter the local telecommunications market and compete head-on with America's Baby Bell regional telephone companies. MCI declined to comment yesterday, but it is thought to be planning to spend more than Dollars 1bn to construct local communications networks in leading US cities to cream off business from the Baby Bells. The company may fund the investment out of the Dollars 4.3bn it is set to receive from British Telecom in return for a 20 per cent stake in MCI. That deal, agreed last summer, is due for completion in 1994. The local network initiative is thought to form a large part of a strategic announcement by MCI next week, which may also contain other strands. MCI played the central role in forcing competition in the US long-distance telephone market in the 1970s and 1980s, and its entry to the local arena could mean tough new competition for the Baby Bells. The Bells, spun off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's long-distance business in 1984, have enjoyed virtual monopolies until recently. Now, however, a growing number of rivals are nibbling away at the fringes of their businesses. These include so-called Competitive Access Providers (CAPs), which operate highly efficient fibre optic networks in major cities, creaming off particularly profitable business customers by offering them cheaper rates for bulk traffic. Cable television service companies are also planning to offer telecommunications services as part of new fibre-based inter-active multi-media networks they are building to homes and offices. One of the largest CAPs, Teleport Communications, is owned by four leading cable companies - Tele-Communications Inc, Cox Enterprises, Time Warner and Comcast. MCI has acknowledged in the past holding talks with cable companies about by-passing the Baby Bells by using cable wires to deliver its long distance services to end-users. MCI and other long-distance carriers, notably AT&amp;T, have long complained about the huge fees they must pay to the Baby Bells to carry their long-distance traffic the last few miles to customers. These 'access charges' bear little relation to the cost of providing the service yet account for around 30 per cent of the Baby Bells' revenues and are the largest single expense for the long-distance groups. Setting up its own local network would allow MCI to by-pass these charges.</p>

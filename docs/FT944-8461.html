			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Ice-cream that binds the family - Clive Fewins visits a Cornish dairy farm where the children strayed but have come home It is a bitter November evening and the westerlies are howling across the Lizard Peninsula from the Atlantic. In the warmth of their old stone farmhouse the Roskilly family's thoughts are turned to summer. Halva - the Greek sesame seed-based confection - is the subject of the conversation. Would it make a good ice-cream flavour? Rachel Roskilly thinks it would. Together with sons Jacob, 31, Toby, 25, and daughter Bryn, 29, she had been experimenting with halva, honey, nuts and their own milk and cream for much of the day. 'It's a bit way out but its worth a shot next summer,' pronounces Roskilly, 59. No-one disagrees. Next summer halva ice-cream will be added to the 33 flavours that the family produces. Father Joe Roskilly, 63, sits at the end of the table in his farmer's overalls. He is silent, but under his shock of grizzled grey hair he is attentive. The cows that are the base of the family business are his main activity. There are 90 prime milkers. A further 60 calves, yearlings and heifers complete the herd. He has been producing milk on the farm, 10 miles from Britain's most southerly point, since he came there to work for his god-mother Esme Bulkeley at 17. When she retired in 1959 she gave Joe the 40-acre farm. Joe married Rachel in 1960. He has added 90 acres to the farm but not strayed far from the Lizard. 'This year I have not been out of Cornwall. There has just been too much to do,' he said. 'Rachel and I last had a holiday when Toby was four.' Hard work and money have not always gone hand in hand at Tregellast Barton farm. Ten years ago Rachel and Joe were turning over barely Pounds 50,000 - less than a fifth of what they turn over now. 'Although we had been making clotted cream since we married and doing holiday lets in the outbuildings for 32 years, we realised that if the farm was ever to support three grown-up children plus their possible families we had to make it a lot more profitable,' Joe said. They looked at ways of making more money from their milk, and also from their Jersey cream, which had a good local reputation. Ice cream seemed the best prospect. 'We ruled out ice cream in 1984 because small-scale equipment was not available at the right price,' Joe said. 'But three years later, when we were looking for a small pasteuriser with which to make whipping cream, we realised that things had changed. 'Rachel and I invested Pounds 5,000 in a pasteuriser and a deep freeze, convinced that making ice cream would help retain the childrens' interest in the farm.' At that time Jacob was back on the farm, having been to agricultural college, Toby was doing his A-levels, and Bryn was an art student in London. Jacob, whom the others regard as their 'business brain', was seized by the opportunity to sell what he saw as a profitable by-product of the milk. Rachel, who provides huge breakfasts and lunches for the family, three full-time and many part-time helpers, relished the prospect of developing a variety of unusual natural flavours. Producing and naming such delights as Crabbers Nip, Hokey Pokey, Lovers Delight, and the Bees Knees appealed to the whole family. Two years ago Bryn, who had gained an MA at the Royal College of Art, was tempted back to the farm by the prospect of her own stained glass studio. Toby returned this year from a furniture-making course in High Wycombe to set up a workshop. Jacob's responsibilities include the family's ice cream shop in Falmouth, plus all the production and distribution to shops, hotels and other outlets all over Cornwall. Last summer (1994) the family opened The Croust House, a 50-seater restaurant serving coffee, cream teas, salads and other light lunches, as well as all the ice creams and Rachel's home-made bread, scones, cakes and jams. It also sells clotted cream, the Roskilly's fudges, mustards, chutneys and furniture polish based on the wax provided by Rachel's bees as does the farm shop at the other end of the yard. 'The Croust House is very labour-intensive and it is too early to say how it is doing financially,' Joe said. 'But the conversion cost us very little as we did most of the work of converting the former calf pens ourselves.' Toby, who plans to run the Croust House as part of his furniture making business, made all the tables and chairs, while Bryn made the startling stained glass windows. 'Developing the Croust House has been possible only because two years ago we invested Pounds 80,000 in a completely new computerised dairy unit, which freed a lot of our traditional buildings for other uses,' Joe said. 'To do the work we needed no additional loan to supplement our Pounds 24,000 working overdraft. We realised the new unit would free buildings so that the family could return here to pursue their own interests if they wished. That in turn was only possible because of our decision seven years ago to go into ice cream in a relatively big way.' The next project is a showroom for Toby's furniture in the former bullpen. Again members of the family are doing most of the work. 'By the time that project is complete we shall have completed the picture as I see it,' Joe said. 'But we could not have done it and be making the profits we achieve without that crucial decision seven years ago to go into ice cream. Together with the associated food lines it accounts for more than 50 per cent of our total current turnover of nearly Pounds 300,000. 'Although the dairy herd is the key to everything we do, I have always felt that diversification makes farming more interesting and more fun than it used to be. The younger generation can get bored by the routine of farming. Diversification can help retain their interest when otherwise they might have been tempted away from the countryside.'

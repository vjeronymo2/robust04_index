			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Borrie urges end to CPS restriction THE Bar's attempts to defend its 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts suffered a setback yesterday when Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, said that a restriction on barristers employed by the Crown Prosecution Service appearing as advocates in the Crown Court was anti-competitive and should be removed. In his advice to the lord chancellor on wider rights of audience for barristers in the employed sector, Sir Gordon says a rule in the Bar's Code of Conduct 'has the effect of significantly restricting competition for supplying the Crown with prosecution advocacy services in the higher courts.' There was no case on competition grounds for retaining the restriction on CPS barristers, 'even on the extreme assumption of all prosecution work being undertaken in the employed sector,' he said. The rule also had an anti-competitive effect on advocacy in the civil courts by preventing barristers who work in central and local government and in commerce, finance and industry from representing their employers in the higher courts, but the effect was not significant, he said. Sir Gordon's view is only one of those which must be considered by the lord chancellor before he makes his mind up about who should be able to present cases in the higher courts, but his advice is bound to carry some weight with a government committed to competition and to stamping out restrictive practices. The Bar played down the significance of Sir Gordon's advice. Mr Gareth Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, said Sir Gordon had been 'judging the restriction strictly against competition criteria which is a very small part of the argument and by no means the most important'. The CPS said yesterday it was delighted by Sir Gordon's recommendation. 'This adds further weight to our argument that the continued denial of rights of audience in the higher courts for Crown Prosecutors is unacceptable,' it said. The Law Society also welcomed the advice. 'The same arguments must clearly apply to employed solicitors,' Mr Philip Ely, society president, said.</p>

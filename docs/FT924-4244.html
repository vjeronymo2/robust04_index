			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / U-turn on the road to ruin: How Renault has transformed itself after lengthy decline As Renault executives head for Lanzarote to launch the Twingo, their pioneering new minicar, they travel safe in the knowledge that the once-ailing French car maker appears well on the way to a recovery. Two of the group's most recently launched products, the Clio small car and the R19 small family car, are both riding high in the closely guarded, confidential quality data compiled by European car makers. At the recent Paris motor show Renault was the star turn, as it unveiled the stylish Twingo, designed to give the French car maker a more dashing, youthful image in the increasingly crowded European market place. Renault's share of the European new car market is rising after nearly a decade of decline, and it is finally making headway outside southern Europe in markets such as the UK. In Germany it is ahead of PSA Peugeot Citroen and Fiat as the leading importer. Its cost-base is one of the lowest in Europe, although the currency chaos of recent weeks has somewhat reduced the advantage; its productivity has jumped by 50 per cent between 1985 and 1991; and most improbably it emerged in the first half of 1992 as Europe's second-most-profitable volume car maker. Five years ago Renault was dismissed as the sick man of the west European car industry. The odds on it surviving to the end of the century were not good. Until 1987 it had been chronically loss-making for six years, with the deficit growing to FFr12.6bn (Pounds 1.53bn) in 1984 or 10.6 per cent of turnover. It was heavily unionised, run as a state agency, and was buckling under a huge debt burden. Its net indebtedness reached FFr61.9bn, equivalent to 55.6 per cent of turnover in 1985. Its recovery from the 1984 loss to a record net profit of FFr9.3bn in 1989 was extraordinary in scale, but its rivals also made good financial progress. The west European car industry enjoyed successive years of record new car sales throughout the second half of the 1980s. What is special about Renault, however, is its financial performance in the past two years, after it stumbled heavily in 1990 when sales in many of its European markets started to weaken. As some of its rivals have faltered - Ford of Europe has plunged into loss and profits at Fiat's car operations have collapsed - Renault has increased its pre-tax profits in the first nine months of this year to FFr7.5bn from FFr2.07bn in the same period a year ago. Its share of the west European car market has grown to 10.5 per cent in the first nine months of this year from 9.8 per cent a year ago. Registrations of Renault cars and light commercial vehicles rose by 4.5 per cent to 1.28m in a west European market where demand fell by 1.5 per cent. This performance has been achieved despite both the losses of Renault Vehicules Industriels, its truck and bus subsidiary, and the burden exerted by Volvo, its Swedish partner, with which it entered a far-reaching alliance in 1990. Volvo is making losses in both its car and commercial vehicle operations, which cost Renault's results FFr478m in the first nine months of this year. With substantial cross-shareholdings, Renault now holds a stake of 25 per cent in Volvo Car, 45 per cent in Volvo Truck and 8.2 per cent in the Volvo parent company. Since the alliance was formed perceptions of the partners' relative strengths have changed. 'We are more much more credible to Volvo shareholders now,' says Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman and chief executive and a former high-flying mandarin in the French Finance Ministry. 'We were seen as a state-owned monster that could not be run as a company, and that could not be run profitably. That prejudice has largely disappeared.' Mr Schweitzer took over at Renault in May following the retirement of Mr Raymond Levy, the former oil and steel industry executive who played the central role in shaping Renault after the mid-1980s. The hand-over to Mr Schweitzer, formerly chief of staff to Mr Laurent Fabius when the latter was successively budget minister, industry and research minister and finally prime minister, was conducted in an orderly way, in contrast to the traumatic circumstances of Mr Levy's arrival at Renault. He arrived soon after the assassination of Mr Georges Besse, then head of the company, by terrorists in 1986. Renault has come a long way since those dark days, but the tasks facing Mr Schweitzer are no less onerous as he seeks to ensure the company's survival beyond the end of a decade. Europe has become the battle-ground of the world auto industry, and the European car market is being exposed to the full force of Japanese competition. His priorities are: to hasten the passage of Renault into the private sector, and to complete the merger with Volvo, to consolidate the quality revolution wrought by Mr Levy, to encourage the flow of new products epitomised by the Clio and Twingo ranges, to fulfil Mr Levy's mission to 'Europeanise' Renault by easing its dependence on southern Europe and reaching a share of at least 5 per cent in all European markets and, to ensure that Renault can compete by the end of the 1990s at world levels of efficiency and productivity in both its manufacturing and its new product design and development operations. Renault has already been changed into a joint stock company from its earlier status as a regie, a state agency. Volvo has a 20 per cent stake, but 80 per cent is still in the hands of the French state. Complicated political manoeuvres lie ahead, but Mr Schweitzer makes no secret of the fact that he is eager for the alliance with Volvo to be developed into a complete merger. At the same time the group has been stepping up its efforts to prepare international financial markets for its eventual emergence from state control, even though the final form of its privatisation is not clear. The negotiations surrounding Renault's future appear to have been put on hold until after the French elections in March next year, but Mr Schweitzer is keen to keep up the speed of collaboration with Volvo, whatever pace is set by his shareholders. 'If you stop moving, it is bad; you must keep up the momentum. The advantage of a merger is simplicity and speed. Agreement between two companies does not go as fast as managing a single group. I have a strong priority to strengthen the links as fast as I can.' As long as Renault and Volvo have different shareholders, there will remain the problem of how savings and profits - or losses - are to be apportioned between the two. Mr Schweitzer says, however, that 'it is clear there is no way back. A single command structure would help make things go faster.' He admits that collaboration is proving difficult in the two group's truck operations, where they compete more directly, than in cars where Renault and Volvo are more complementary. Approaches to quality are being harmonised and single directors have been appointed to head the two companies' purchasing and quality operations. Most significant, Renault and Volvo have also appointed a single project director to develop a car platform for a joint top-of-the-range car to emerge at the end of the decade. This would replace the quite distinct Volvo 850 and Renault Safrane executive cars launched over the past year. Overall a common product plan has been finalised for the next 10 to 12 years based on the principle of maintaining two distinct product lines and separate identities for both brand names, but with common platforms and components wherever possible. While the development of the Franco-Swedish alliance is one key to Renault's future, its progress will depend on maintaining the pace of the quality and product revolution evident in its new car ranges. The Twingo will be launched in continental Europe early next year and is seen by Mr Schweitzer as evidence of Renault's determination to 'offer a product range that is youthful, strong and innovative'. Designed like a mini Renault Espace - the vehicle that has pioneered the market for 'people carriers' in Europe - the Twingo is evidence of the growing impact on Renault of Mr Patrick Le Quement, the group's director of industrial design. Mr Le Quement, who enjoys probably more freedom and influence than any other designer at a European car maker, is the man brought in by Mr Levy in 1987, from a career with Ford and briefly Volkswagen, to build for Renault a clear and distinctive market image. While Renault is sharpening its styling, the improvement in quality still owes as much to rectification work (the correction of mistakes made during assembly) as to improvements in the manufacturing process, says Professor Daniel Jones, a proponent of 'lean production' and co-author of The Machine That Changed The World, the land-mark examination of efficiency levels in the motor industry, published in 1990 by the Massachusetts Insititute of Technology. 'What Renault has done in changing its culture is still impressive,' says Prof Jones. 'They were determined to improve the quality of the product as perceived by the customer.' According to Prof Jones, Renault has staged a 'product-led revival based on quality', but this is still at the cost of too much rectification work. 'They are making significant progress in their factories, but they are not there yet.' Renault is currently on the crest of a wave, but it faces a severe test in the next two years with the European new car market set to decline sharply in 1993. Mr Schweitzer insists that he will maintain the current 'quality priority with an absolute determination, because in the Europe of tomorrow the manufacturers, which do not offer products on the highest quality level will be eliminated . . . Any relaxation of our efforts, any complacency, would condemn us over the long-term to oblivion.'</p>

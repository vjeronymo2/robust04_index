			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / People: Goodall takes on another chair Manweb, the Cheshire-based regional electricity company, has become the latest power group to appoint a relative outsider to one of its two senior posts. Bill Goodall, on the company's board for less than a year, is to take over as non-executive chairman at the end of August. He will succeed Bryan Weston who is retiring after 45 years in the industry. Before privatisation four years ago, the way to the top in electricity was a lifetime in the industry. Weston's appointment yesterday means that half of the 12 regional electricity companies have chairmen who have spent the bulk of their careers in other industries. The Manweb appointment means Goodall, 62, now chairs four companies; the others are Volex, electrical controls group, Hopkinsons, engineer, and Inveresk, paper manufacturer. Goodall began his career as a management trainee with Scapa Dryers in 1956 after graduating from Pembroke College, Cambridge, and Leeds University. From there he rose to be chairman of Scapa Group, a post he relinquished last October.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (1): Prospering at the fringe - There is plenty of competition among Europe's smaller states to act as a magnet for tax and regulatory-shy clients SMALL can be beautiful in the world of finance. Wherever there are differential rates of tax, and different approaches to regulation, businesses will flock to those areas with the lowest tax and the most flexible regulatory regimes. And there is plenty of competition among Europe's smaller states to act as the magnet for tax and regulatory-shy businessmen. The term 'offshore financial centre' in fact covers a multitude of sins and a wide variety of areas and regulatory regimes. Many places which have the characteristics of offshore centres, such as Switzerland and Liechtenstein, are in the heart of the continent. Most, if they are offshore of anything, are merely outside the regulatory confines of the European Community. The existence of these centres creates a knotty problem for the EC. It wants to integrate financial services in the single market, without driving business into areas outside the community. The internationalisation of business, which the EC has helped to foster, has created the conditions for the offshore centres to flourish. Expatriate workers have good tax reasons for seeking havens which are outside their countries of origin and the states where they work. Yet the Community is hardly going to benefit from a single market, if the main result is for tax revenues to drain offshore. The position of Luxembourg is another difficulty for the Brussels bureaucrats. Euromarket folklore speaks of the typical retail investor - the 'Belgian dentist' - depositing his bearer Eurobonds in Luxembourg to avoid tax. Whether or not the folklore has much basis in reality, Luxembourg has built up a vigorous financial services sector by becoming the EC's 'on-site' offshore centre. In principle, the creation of a true single market in financial services should eliminate Luxembourg's advantages, as tax and regulations would be the same across the Community. In practice, however, the reforms made so far have reinforced Luxembourg's position. The removal of restrictions on capital flows simply makes it easier for wealthy citizens to transfer their funds to an offshore centre. And differential rates of reform have also helped the smaller states. A prime example is the directive on Ucits (Undertakings for Collective investment in Transferable Securities). Designed as a means of encouraging a Europe-wide market in open-ended investment, it has sent fund mangement companies flocking to establish in Luxembourg which was one of the quickest countries to implement the directive. Fidelity, for example, chose to use Luxembourg as the administrative base for its range of Ucits funds, which it sees as the base of its worldwide marketing efforts for the 1990s. Perhaps the EC is subconsciously happy to see Luxembourg challenge Switzerland as the haven for the world's wealthy. The main effect of the mooted uniform EC withholding tax might simply be to drive business from Luxembourg to Switzerland or even further afield. The Swiss have been faced with a series of challenges over the past few years as the US, in particular, has laid siege to the much-heralded tradition of Swiss banking secrecy. The ramifications of the single European market may yet affect Swiss financial services business (although the impact could be positive) and the Swiss are facing competition from a host of other areas such as Gibraltar, Malta and Madeira. The impact of each individual centre might be small but the collective challenge is great. For those aiming to flourish as offshore financial centres, the attractions are obvious. Financial services business brings revenues to the area, without the environmental side effects caused by other industries. Even a nominal tax charge on a large financial services sector can bring in substantial revenues to a small state. Ireland which has a high domestic tax regime has attempted to attract international business by creating a low tax financial centre in Dublin. The centre has attracted 150 businesses and created 700 much-needed jobs. For those centres trying to attract international capital, there are three main dangers. Those attracted to offshore centres are often trying to avoid or evade taxes and the clientele could easily include drug and other criminal barons. Some centres have tried to respond to international fears; Luxembourg has agreed that it will not apply its banking secrecy laws where there is evidence of criminal activity; the Channel Islands have imposed drug-trafficking laws on the lines of those in force in the UK. There is also the risk that a centre grabs so much business that it attracts the wrath of a more powerful neighbour. The Channel Islands have urged their financial companies not to market too heavily in the UK, for example, for fear of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. Another danger is that the wrong type of financial services group is attracted to the centre, and the inevitable scandal can then ruin the area's reputation. The Isle of Man and Gibraltar are both trying to live down the effects of 1980s financial group collapses. Offshore centres are unlikely ever to be able to shed their slightly unsavoury air. After all, avoiding tax is always going to be one of the primary reasons for heading for an offshore centre; and confidentiality, another main attraction of such centres, is usually valued because the taxman is excluded from the confidences. According to the UK tax lawyer, Mr Philip Newhouse of Taylor Joynson Garrett, cheapness is not an advantage of an offshore centre since 'if you want to set up a company cheaply, the UK's the place'. visionary to imagine that regulators can make offshore centres disappear. If European authorities find a way of cracking down on their offshore centres, money will simply flow to havens off other continents. European offshore centres will continue to flourish for the foreseeable future.</p>

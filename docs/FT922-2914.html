			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (4): Jaundiced view of world could be transformed - Foreign Affairs EVERY nation's foreign policy is rooted in its history. But in the case of Greece this influence is so profound that it often seems as if the country's international posture and popular attitudes are caught in a time-warp and have little relevance to the evolution of other nations' internal political situations and foreign policies. In many respects, the ending of the Cold war and the break-up of the Soviet empire have merely exacerbated historical Greek fears and suspicions of the territorial ambitions of its Balkan neighbours, old and new, previously constrained from embarking on international adventures by strict communist regimes or membership of the defunct Yugoslav federation. At the same time, Greece's traditional adversary, Turkey, is seen in Athens as having won greater room for manoeuvre on the international stage by the momentous events in the former Soviet Union and the collapse of the communist system. Now that it no longer has its hands tied to anything like the same extent by its previous role of guard of Nato's south-eastern flank, Turkey is able to devote more of its energies to enhancing its regional influence. In addition to long-existing areas of bilateral conflict - such as the Aegean continental shelf and airspace, Cyprus, Turkey's relationship with the European Community and the rights of the Turkish-speaking minority of Western Thrace - Athens perceives new threats to the regional balance of power in Ankara's efforts to forge close links with the former Soviet central Asian republics, its rapprochement with Bulgaria and its support for the Moslems of Bosnia. With one foot in western Europe and the other in the Balkans, Athens often does not know which one to dance on. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Greek foreign policy trips over itself so frequently. No better example can be found than the current furore over the EC's intention to recognise as an independent state the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Greece is not opposed in principle to recognition, but it objects to the name Macedonia being employed to describe the new state and wants it to be called the Republic of Skopje, the name of its capital, to avoid any possible political or cultural confusion with the real Macedonia in northern Greece. The root of the problem goes much deeper than the appropriation of a name describing a territory which Greeks have always considered to be part of their cultural identity since Alexander the Great. It reflects deep-seated fears of irredentism in a region whose multi-ethnic composition is a recipe for instability and conflict. Since the Balkan wars of 1912-13, after which Greece received 51 per cent of the former Ottoman region of Macedonia, including the port of Salonika, compared with Serbia's 39 per cent and Bulgaria's 10 per cent, Greece has constantly feared that nationalists in the Yugoslav state of Macedonia would some day make territorial claims against Greece. Attempts by communist guerrillas supported by Marshal Tito to lop off northern Greek territory during the Greek civil war of the 1940s seemed to offer some support for these fears. More recently, officials in Skopje have spoken of the rights of a 230,000-strong Slavonic-speaking minority in northern Greece, while irredentist leaders have sketched out plans for a greater Macedonia which would embrace both the Greek slavophones and those of Bulgaria. Athens has strongly denied the existence of such a large homogeneous slavophone group within its borders and has insisted that northern Greek Macedonia is no more than a geographical region inhabited by Greeks. So far, no compromise is in the offing, but it seems highly unlikely that Greece's EC partners will be willing to tolerate Athens's veto of the recognition of the republic of Macedonia, under the name that its people have chosen, for much longer. It is not that other governments do not understand the historical background to Greece's attitude. Rather do they consider it as based on 19th or early 20th century premises no longer relevant to the new European order. Greece is no longer acting alone or with one or two allies against other powerful alliances, but is a member of the EC, Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), Nato and other international organisations which would not permit attempts to change its borders or the incorporation by others of large areas of its territory. Indeed, the EC is insisting that new republics seeking recognition should provide constitutional and political guarantees that they do not harbour any territorial claims on a neighbouring territory. The irritation with Greece over the Macedonian affair, now being openly expressed by its European partners, is matched by their mounting annoyance at Athens's refusal to adopt a more constructive policy towards Turkey - in spite of clear signs that the new Turkish government led by Mr Suleyman Demirel is prepared to be more conciliatory in its dealings with Greece. The other members of the Community, conscious of Turkey's important role as a bridge-builder with the former Moslem republics of Central Asia and appreciative of the recent progress made by Turkey in the field of democratic government and human rights, are anxious to bind Turkey more closely to the western camp. Greece's partners find it surprising that Athens does not appear to understand that such a rapprochement is ultimately in Greece's own interests and that it requires concrete goodwill gestures from both sides of the Aegean. The meeting earlier this year between Mr Constantine Mitzotakis, the Greek prime minister, and Mr Demirel, was a step in the right direction. But it was supposed to have led to the signing of a Greek-Turkish Friendship Treaty, of which little has been heard since. Certainly, Greece has been unfairly blamed for being solely responsible for Turkey's continued exclusion from the EC. The European Commission, in a recent report, has made it abundantly clear that substantial economic obstacles to Turkish membership continue to exist and that there is no realistic prospect of Turkey joining the Community before the beginning of the next century. But, in the meantime, there seems to be no good reason for Greece to continue blocking EC loans to Turkey under its association agreement with the Community or Turkey's participation in new arrangements for the Mediterranean countries. Ostensibly, Greece's hardline policy is intended to make the Turks adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Cyprus problem, an issue which, more than any other, has bedevilled Greek-Turkish relations since the occupation of the north of Cyprus by Turkish troops in 1974. That has proved to be a misguided tactic, since the Turks long ago made it clear that they are not prepared to trade benefits in other areas for concessions on Cyprus which are not in line with what they consider to be an equitable settlement. A slim hope exists that a Cyprus settlement can be reached this summer on the basis of new ideas put forward by Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general. But that will require a much greater spirit of compromise and more profound understanding of the wider regional and international issues at stake than either the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, or Athens and Ankara, have shown so far. But it is above all in its policy towards the European Community that Greece would be well advised to adopt a more accommodating stance, for it is in the process of losing influential friends who provide it with much of the funds needed to modernise its economy. More attention to Greece's real interests in western Europe and less direct involvement in the Balkan cauldron could do much to transform Greece's current jaundiced view of the world and prevent its threatened marginalisation.</p>

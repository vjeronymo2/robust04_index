The government is likely to set an official economic growth  estimate around February 9 as a basis for its budget for the  year. But the officials said the Finance Ministry, the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Economic  Planning Agency (EPA) disagree on growth predictions.    The Finance Ministry and MITI say the annual growth rate for  gross domestic product (GDP) should be set at somewhere between  2.5 and 3.0 percent, while the EPA says it should be slightly  above 2 percent, the officials said. The estimate for fiscal  1993 was 3.3 percent.    The three departments are scheduled to start ironing out  their differences as soon as the government announces its new  pump-priming package on Thursday, which is expected to feature  major income tax cuts and additional public works spending.    EPA officials predicted the real economic growth rate for  fiscal 1993, which ends March 31, will be slightly above zero,  managing to stay in the plus column. They forecast the growth  rate for fiscal 1994 will barely record 2 percent, even taking  into account the effects of the new pump-priming package.    The Finance Ministry, however, says the growth estimate  should be set at close to 3 percent so that the government will  avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds other than those for  offsetting tax cuts. The MITI hopes to set a similar growth  target.</p>

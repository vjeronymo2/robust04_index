			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: A TEACHER TURNS A SCIENCE CENTER INTO A PLACE TO LEARN  ABOUT NATURE.  </P> <P> What do you do if you teach in the second largest urban school district in the  United States and prefer the outdoors to the classroom?  </P> <P> If you're lucky, you wind up in Carol Eyster's job.  </P> <P> For the last decade, Eyster has headed the San Pedro Science Center, one of  seven centers operated by the Los Angeles Unified School District for teachers  and elementary and junior high students. Eyster is credited with turning the  five-acre center into a manicured compound with various gardens, an orchard and  menagerie.  </P> <P> "When she first started working here, this place was a jungle," said Bill  Fitzpatrick, a longtime aide at the center. "It was totally metamorphosed under  her."  </P> <P> Now Eyster has set out to do the same thing at the about two-acre 186th Street  Science Center in Gardena, where she was recently transferred with orders to  recapture its overgrown areas from the wily ways of Mother Nature and return it  to children.  </P> <P> "We have to get the kids here," Eyster said the other day as she walked the  center's grounds and pointed out the trees badly in need of pruning, an unruly  patch of hops and wheat, and abandoned potting buildings.  </P> <P> "We've got to show them there is something different from the asphalt and the  buildings."  </P> <P> The work is a labor of love for Eyster, who grew up on a large dairy farm in  Ohio. By the age of 5, Eyster said, she was driving tractors; by 9 or 10, she  was supervising hay-harvesting crews. She was a member of 4-H until she was 21  -- an age when many have long since left the student agricultural club.  </P> <P> Eyster said she became a teacher because she was "not into money, and I knew I  really liked kids." In 1969, she became a teacher at Dana Junior High School in  San Pedro, where she ran a program that focused on outdoor studies.  </P> <P> "I would always be on the campus, and we would be hugging a tree," Eyster said.  "I would never allow my students to be encased in a classroom."  </P> <P> Eyster's official title at the Gardena center is resource teacher. As such, her  job is to demystify science and "lower the anxiety level for teachers, as well  as the students," according to Carol Takemoto, who coordinates the science  center programs for the school district.  </P> <P> Sometimes, Eyster conceded, that isn't easy. With some teachers, she has to  start at a very elementary level. "Some of my teachers don't even know the  difference between a sheep and a goat," she said.  </P> <P> For both teachers and students, Eyster said, she relies on a teaching  philosophy that preaches "hands-on experience. You can only know those things  that you experience, and that is it. You can't tell me what an elephant feels  like if you haven't felt an elephant.  </P> <P> "I have another philosophy," she added. "You cannot force anyone to do  anything. I put the responsibility on the child. . . . It is not my job to  force someone to learn. They must come wanting to learn."  </P> <P> By next fall, Eyster said, she hopes the grounds at the Gardena center will be  in tiptop shape. Already, she has made giant strides. With assistance from the  California Conservation Corps, numerous trees have been pruned. One coral and  six sweet gum trees have been taken out. Some of the trees were infested with  termites; the roots of others were cracking nearby sidewalks.  </P> <P> Corps workers will return in the fall to plant an orchard where the barley and  wheat now grow. Eyster has already planted cotton, and work has started on a  pond. A Japanese garden and drought-resistant plants will be put in as well as  a desert landscape.  </P> <P> Eyster said she also hopes to establish areas around the center's grounds where  children can learn about small machines. She also wants to build a weather  station. To supplement her $1,500-a-year budget, she plans to establish a small  recycling program at the center where visiting children will drop off  newspapers and aluminum cans. She started the same kind of program at the San  Pedro center.  </P> <P> "When she got this transfer, I told her, 'I know where the best science center  will be,' " Fitzpatrick said, adding that it won't be long before the Gardena  center is on a par with San Pedro.  </P> <P> "By September, it will be cranking," he predicted.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bettina Roither] </F>   [Text] For five days, Muslims and Croats have held  negotiations at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna. These two ethnic  groups have agreed on the form and the structure of a future  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiators were Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian-Croat top politician Kresimir  Zubak, and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic. Minister  President Silajdzic reported on the agreement 20 minutes ago:    [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed  German translation] We have reached an agreement on the external  borders of the federation and on the internal borders of the  individual cantons. We believe that a great step in the  direction of a comprehensive peace solution in the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been taken -- a great step to preserve  unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. We believe that  not only Bosniaks and Croats, but all who regard  Bosnia-Herzegovina as their home will work toward the  implementation of this agreement. [end recording]    On 14 May, the agreement between the Bosnian Muslims and  Croats is to be signed in Geneva. It provides for a federation  that comprises 58 percent of the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina. By  the way, 70 percent of the territory is currently being held by  the Serbs, with whom no negotiations were held here -- thus, one  reckoned, so to speak, without one's host, although he had  conquered the territory.    In the new Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina there are to be  eight cantons, two under Croatian leadership, four under Muslim  leadership, according to the respective majorities, and two with  equal structures, that is, central Bosnia and the canton along  the Neretva where the capital of Herzegovina, Mostar, is  situated. The first president is to be a Croat and the first  prime minister a Muslim. In return, the Croats will get six of  17 ministries.    As already mentioned, the Croats and Muslims have achieved  this agreement, but they need to get back about 20 percent of  the territory that is currently held by the Serbs. And, so far,  the latter have not shown any inclination to give back conquered  territory.</p>

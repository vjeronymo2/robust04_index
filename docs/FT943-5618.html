			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Earnings fears hit technology stocks hard Wall Street US share prices retreated yesterday as the outlook for computer stocks became clouded, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.98 lower at 3,901.44, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.33 at 473.17. The setback was broadly-based, with Big Board declines leading advances by a three-to-two margin. NYSE volume was moderate, with 282m shares traded by the close. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 0.32 at 454.02. The Nasdaq composite, with its heavy concentration of technology stocks, suffered more, dropping 6.67 to 758.95. The day's economic news had a marginal impact on share prices. The National Association of Purchasing Management revealed that the prices-paid component of its August survey had risen to its highest level in six years. With investors on edge ahead of today's employment data, the NAPM data was more than enough to encourage some profit-taking in cyclical stocks which led the market's recent rally. Alcoa gave back Dollars 1 to Dollars 83, Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 114 3/8 and Union Carbide Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 3/8 . But the most important cause of yesterday's weakness was a sudden loss of confidence in the health of the computer industry. The broad sell-off appeared to have been triggered by AST Research which, a day earlier, had warned that it would post a loss this quarter. The Nasdaq-listed stock plunged Dollars 4 15/16 to Dollars 13 as the news prompted at least two Wall Street securities houses to downgrade the issue. But the impact of the announcement was felt by a wide range of technology stocks. Among software developers, Microsoft lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 1/8 and Intel Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 64 1/4 . Among the chip suppliers, Motorola dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 5/8 and National Semiconductor Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 17 1/4 and Advanced Micro Devices Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/2 . The big computer manufacturers were not spared, either. Compaq was marked down Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 34 7/8 with reports that it was trimming orders from suppliers adding fuel to the fire. Apple dropped Dollars  15/16 to Dollars 35 1/4 and IBM slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67 7/8 . Some retailing stocks also came under pressure. The Gap plunged Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 after revealing that revenues from stores opened at least a year had fallen by 5 per cent last month. Dayton Hudson lost Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 81 1/8 . Elsewhere, Fingerhut made a rare appearance on the NYSE's most active list in volume of 3.9m shares. The stock plunged 18 per cent, or Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 23 1/4 on a profits warning. Canada Toronto prices closed mixed in busy trading, as a modest afternoon rally helped offset earlier losses. The TSE-300 composite index fell 5.16 points, or 0.12 per cent, to close at 4,344.34, but advancing issues outnumbered declines 379 to 323. Volume was 76.40m compared with 66.30m on Wednesday, but trading value fell to CDollars 862.3m from CDollars 895.5m. Volume was inflated by some large blocks of PWA Corp. shares and warrants.</p>

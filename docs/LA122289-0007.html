			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURTAX  </P> <P> Rep. Henry Waxman's article "A Catastrophic Attempt to Do Better" (Op-Ed Page,  Dec. 10) is probably the best statement to come out of Congress on this entire  sorry subject. The only thing that it lacked was a recognition of the fact that  the opposition to the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Law was based on a feeling by  the entire senior community that the improvements the act contained had such a  high price tag that any further changes to include more needed coverage would  be unthinkable.  </P> <P> Repeal left many seniors with the frustrated feeling that the main hopes they  championed for a comprehensive national health care system for all had been set  back, that those in Congress who were willing to support legislation moving in  that direction were now discouraged and slow to embrace any new initiatives.  </P> <P> Waxman's forward looking article was most important in pointing to the need for  resuming the drive to solve the problem of providing health care for everyone.  To do nothing means that the system will disintegrate further with higher  charges, more uninsured, and the closing of health facilities. This country now  spends enough on health care to do the job; what is needed is the  reorganization of the system so that the money is properly spent.  </P> <P> People should let their representatives in Washington know that we want them to  try again.  </P> <P> DANIEL COHEN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

B. Gorev, Ye. F. Prokhorov, A. T. Ukolov, </F> Institute of Technical Mechanics, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences;  UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] The threshold voltage of the onset of negative  differential conductivity is studied in a thin film n-GaAs  structure with a Schottky barrier and with a semi-insulated  compensated substrate. When the Schottky barrier depletion  region is adjacent to the film-substrate junction depletion  region, as cut-off voltage increases at the barrier there is not  the usual decrease in the threshold voltage of the onset of  negative differential conductivity, but an increase. This is  because the voltage at the gate increases with the ratio of the  longitudinal field at the drain end of the gate to the  longitudinal field at the source end (the distribution of the  longitudinal field becomes more homogeneous).

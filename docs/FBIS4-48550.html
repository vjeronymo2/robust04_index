			<p>BFN     [Text] A peace deal for Angola is a hair's breadth away.  We have been informed by a diplomatic source that the Lusaka  agreement will be signed on 6 June. One thing is certain: When  Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos arrives in Portugal on  27 June, there will already be peace on paper. At the moment,  the only remaining point at the talks is that of national  reconciliation and at stake are the provinces of Huambo and  Benguela. These are two provinces which the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] does not want to  relinquish. For the moment, the government does not want to  give in to this UNITA demand. Both the government and UNITA are  now trying to gain ground in the military field.</p>

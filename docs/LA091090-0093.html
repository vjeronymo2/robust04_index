			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE SUMMIT, IRAQIS PREPARING TO HOLD OUT;  </P> <P> STANDOFF: IN AN EFFORT TO FORTIFY ITSELF AGAINST THE U.N. TRADE EMBARGO, THE  GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO MOBILIZE FARMERS TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION.  </P> <P> While superpower leaders met Sunday in cool Finland to press for Iraq's  withdrawal from Kuwait, preparations were being made under Iraq's roasting  desert sun to hold out against the tight international blockade and to defend  the nation in case of war.  </P> <P> The government made no official response to the joint statement of President  Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their Helsinki summit. Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein had appealed urgently to Moscow on the eve of the  summit to break ranks with the United States and a series of sanctions imposed  by the United Nations and to take sides with Iraq in the Persian Gulf conflict.  </P> <P> In any event, Iraq seemed to be expecting no quick breakthrough in its favor.  In one large-scale effort to fortify itself against the U.N. trade embargo, the  government has begun to mobilize farmers to increase food production. Iraq had  imported about 70% of the food it consumes.  </P> <P> State land customarily rented to farmers will be leased without charge to  anyone willing to work it, the government announced Sunday. Regional  authorities in grain-growing areas have ordered farms to increase planting of  winter wheat, and farmers have been exempted from military conscription.  </P> <P> Diplomatic observers are skeptical about Iraq's ability to make a dent in its  food needs, especially because of lack of fertilizer.  </P> <P> Conservation is another tactic. Government officials have gone out of their way  to explain that the lengthening bread lines in Baghdad do not signify that  wheat is running out. Rather, they say, rationing is a means of stretching out  supplies.  </P> <P> "We are just trying to rationalize consumption," official spokesman Naji  Hadithi said in understated bureaucratese.  </P> <P> State-run television warned against hoarding or price gouging and assured  Iraqis that food would be distributed evenly throughout the country. This may  reflect snafus in bread rationing efforts that have led to shortages in some  neighborhoods, diplomats said.  </P> <P> The government is also trying to tighten vigilance over its own citizens by  telling them to register at local residency offices. There was speculation that  the move was designed to head off draft dodging.  </P> <P> Besides keeping tabs on its own citizens, the government repeated warnings to  foreign hostages not to try to escape on penalty of life imprisonment. If  foreigners move from house to house, they must also notify residency officials.  In August, Iraq warned its own citizens that harboring foreigners was  tantamount to the crime of espionage and punishable by death.  </P> <P> The Draconian measures seemed mainly aimed at Kuwait, which Iraq claimed as  annexed territory after its lightning Aug. 2 invasion. Foreigners, including  scores of Americans, have been hiding out for fear of being rounded up and sent  to military and industrial sites to be used as "human shields" against attack  from abroad.  </P> <P> In Baghdad, mobilization into the Popular Army of reserve recruits continued,  and anti-aircraft batteries popped up along the Tigris River, which bisects the  city.  </P> <P> The Hussein regime is sending out strong psychological signals that war is  likely. Television is full of patriotic appearances by soldiers in training for  the Popular Army. Prompted by reporters, the weekend warriors chant  nationalistic slogans, sing regional songs and wave rifles.  </P> <P> On Sunday, a broadcast order prohibited the firing of weapons at weddings and  other celebrations. In Iraq, it is common to greet the bride and groom with a  volley of rifle fire; these nighttime events have sometimes sent foreign  reporters here scurrying into the streets in search of a coup.  </P> <P> There was no sign that Iraq was giving up on its claim to Kuwait. It is viewed  as part and parcel of the country.  </P></p>

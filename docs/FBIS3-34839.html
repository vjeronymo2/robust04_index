Mr. Dinesh Singh told  the U.S. senator, Mr. Moynihan, who called on him in New Delhi  today, that it is also necessary for Pakistan to desist from  supporting terrorism if it is serious about normalizing  relations. Both also discussed Indo-U.S. relations and felt  that the economic relationship is picking up day by day. Mr.  Moynihan said substantial increase in the U.S. economic  engagement in India augurs well for the future.    The Janata Dal has strongly criticized the U.S. interference  in India's internal affairs. The national executive of the  party, in a resolution adopted at its meeting in New Delhi  today, said that the U.S. attempt to use the Kashmir issue to  violate Indian sovereignty and Washington's comments on Punjab  amount to rank interference.</p>

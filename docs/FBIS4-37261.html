			<p>BFN     [Text] In a telephone call with MBC, oil minister of the  self-declared government in Aden, Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun,  announced that the southern forces today repulsed an attack by  the northerners from the area of (Raml al-Sab'atayn) toward Wadi  Hadhramaut in an attempt to capture the city of Saywun. He  added that the southern forces repulsed the northerners at a  location 130 km west of Saywun, taking 28 northern soldiers  prisoner. We have the following report from [MBC correspondent]  in Shabwah Tawfiq Jazulit:    [Begin recording] [Jazulit] The Governorate of Shabwah in  south Yemen is characterized by its harsh desert topography. It  consists of valleys, plains, and barren areas. It is about 100  km wide and from the coast to the Saudi borders it is over 300  km long. Shabwah is considered one of the most difficult and  dangerous fronts, especially since travelling from one area to  another is very difficult, if not virtually impossible in some  places. Shabwah's strategic importance is that it is oil-rich.  Because of its large size, the southern forces are very spread  out.    [Unidentified soldier] This force is merely the rear guard;  the rest of our forces have advanced close to the capital of the  governorate. Our closest positions to the capital are 10-15 km  away.    [Jazulit] The governor of Shabwah and commander of its  front, Ahmad al-Fayiz Sarimah, says his forces control some  parts of the vast area of Shabwah.    [Sarimah] In Shabwah, we now control 95 percent of the  region. We welcome you now, if you have the time, to travel with  us to (Qirdan), Wadi Armah, al-Sa'id, al-Musayni'ah, Nisab,  'Azzan, and Mayfa'ah, except for the city of 'Ataq, which is no  more than 5 square kilometers.    [Jazulit] With the respect to Shabwah's oil, the region's  governor does not have any objections to allowing all Yemeni  sides to use it so long as this is arranged through dialogue.    [Sarimah] If this is done through consent, negotiations, and  Arab generosity, we do not mind sharing it with our brothers.  This is a characteristic of the Arabs.    [Jazulit] The city of 'Ataq, which is about 50 km away from  where we are now, is not considered by the military command to  be a position of vital strategic importance like the oil wells  that could play a decisive role in terminating the fighting  between Aden and Sanaa. And the war goes on. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP LENDS HIS NAME TO NEW TV GAME SHOW  </P> <P> Donald Trump, who has star billing on Manhattan real estate, New Jersey  casinos, an airline and a board game, will lend his name to a new TV game show,  "Trump Card."  </P> <P> The daily syndicated show, the first TV venture for the wealthy developer, was  unveiled on Tuesday at a press conference here. The show will be produced at  the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.  </P> <P> The game show -- which will combine elements of bingo, with viewers playing on  cards at home -- was created by Lorimar Television and will be distributed by  Warner Bros. Domestic Television. It is based on a British game show called  "Full House."  </P> <P> Although Trump might make an appearance on the program, he said that he does  not expect to play a major creative role in it.  </P> <P> "I'm involved in the ownership of the show. I'm not creatively involved, except  somewhat modestly," Trump said. "What attracted me to the show were the  statistics on its success in England and my confidence in Steve Ross," the  Time-Warner executive who is a longtime friend of Trump.  </P> <P> Although Trump would not specify the financial arrangements on the show, he  said any profits from his portion, which he described as a "good, substantial  stake," would be donated to charity.  </P> <P> The pilot for "Trump Card" will be produced over the next four to six weeks,  with the series to be sold to local stations for the fall season next year.  Intended for the 7-8 p.m. time slot, the series will have among its likely  competition "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," two long-running game shows  from Merv Griffin, who has been a rival to Trump in the Atlantic City hotel  business. (Trump said at the press conference that Griffin was not a factor in  his own entry into the game-show business.)  </P> <P> It is difficult to build a new game show in syndication, without prior exposure  on a commercial network. But David Salzman, president of Lorimar Television,  said that the producers are looking to the play-along possibilities of the  game, plus the recognizability of Trump's name, to win initial stations and  viewers.  </P></p>

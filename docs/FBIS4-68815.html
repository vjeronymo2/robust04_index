			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Koval under the rubric "Scandals": </F> "Will A. Sobchak Become Russia's Ambassador in the United  States?"]    [Text] Last year the St. Petersburg branch of the  State Tax Inspectorate become one of the top ones in the Russian  Federation, and unquestionably the top in terms of hard currency  revenue for the treasury. From the moment the tax inspectorate  was set up three years ago until October 1993, the St.  Petersburg branch was headed by Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov.  Why, despite such obvious successes, was he dismissed from the  job?    How could St. Petersburg Mayor A. Sobchak allow this to  happen? One would think that the city's first person would have  the greatest stake of all in replenishing the treasury, because  this is what pays for social programs, on which in turn the city  head's reputation among the population rests. He did, though.  And now St. Petersburg is unlikely to be as deficit-free as it  was last year. The most disfranchised among city residents  already feel it.    As long as the tax inspectorate was busy collecting  underpayments from Russian enterprises, nothing marred the  relationship between its leadership and the mayoralty. Their  interests clashed when the audit extended to activities of joint  and foreign structures.    One must say that the conditions for their existence in St.  Petersburg are more favorable than anywhere in Russia. Foreign  banks' branches here have absolutely no obligation to perform  operations currently needed for the development of the Russian  economy. At the same time, the rent charged their  representations is frequently much lower than what domestic  organizations have to pay to the city. Such are the laws of  hospitality of the Neva banks.    The Russo-Swedish enterprise Europa-Hotel, for instance,  found itself in an extremely privileged position. Most of the  money--60 percent to be precise--for the hotel's reconstruction  was provided by Intourist. And only 40 percent was comprised of  foreign credit--also borrowed against the collateral of domestic  property. Europa-Hotel is flourishing. And no wonder: The  enterprise owes the treasury $7 million in taxes, while to this  day it keeps the money earned in its operations in foreign  banks. For the sake of improving the world economy, one has to  assume. Alas, this charitable gesture did not impress St.  Petersburg tax inspectors, who slapped the SP [joint enterprise]  with $24 million in fines.    Simple arithmetics shows that if converted into rubles, this  amount could cover all the needs of Russia's nuclear industry  and keep nuclear scientists and their production side colleagues  from picketing the White House. Moscow, however, at St.  Petersburg's prompting, found it expedient to exempt the SP from  paying the fines.    Another object of the inspectors' audit was the joint  Russo-Finnish enterprise Lenrautamebel. It uses our cheap  timber; the labor also is, as they say, aborigine, undemanding.  This labor force produces a nice output, however, since up to 94  percent of it is exported abroad. The earnings also are kept out  there, away from domestic needs. This enterprise, too, was fined  $10 million.    The Russo-Finnish SP Pizza-Express did not even bother to  deposit foreign currency revenue. Sanctions in the amount of 10  million Finnish markka were applied to it.    Attempts to call foreign businessmen to elementary order  greatly surprised the Finnish consul in St. Petersburg. He tried  to convince D. Filippov that the State Tax Inspectorate's  activities undermine the Russian Federation president's efforts  to attract foreign business to Russia. When Filippov cited as an  example Finland, where such violations bring not only fines but  also prison sentences, the consul was sincerely bewildered: "Why  compare Russia with our civilized country?"    The main difficulties for the tax inspectorate headed by  Dmitriy Nikolayevich began, however, after the decision was made  to audit the activities of the St. Petersburg Property Fund.  Some time in the past this fund was headed personally by Mr.  Chubays who, upon his departure for Moscow, recommended a  certain Bure as his replacement.    The audit revealed gross violations in the fund's  operations.  For instance, in the protocol dated 22 September 1993 the tax  inspectors put on record that 44,981 vouchers were unaccounted  for. The fund had not even opened a special account to keep the  money received from privatization: it was kept--at 2 percent  (?!) annual interest, like in a Soviet savings bank--in the  privately owned Vitabank, which used this money at its  discretion. I think there is no need to explain what this all  means.    Let us take note of the date of the protocol: 22 September  1993. We remember what a nervous, chaotic time this was.  Nevertheless, only five days later the mayor of St. Petersburg  personally visited the State Tax Inspectorate and went out of  his way to highly praise its personnel and leadership  professionalism. It turned out later, however, that on the eve  of this visit Sobchak sent a letter to Moscow in which, quoting  L. Filippov's nomenklatura past, he demanded that the latter be  relieved of his duties as chief of the State Tax Inspectorate  for St. Petersburg. That is, the democrat Sobchak proposed to  start a witch hunt on political grounds.    Soon thereafter Filippov was informed from Moscow that he  had  been dismissed from the job. Then he received an insulting  offer--to take charge of the Taymyr Autonomous Okrug tax  inspectorate. And while the capital brandished the stick,  Sobchak tempted Filippov with a carrot, offering a different  prospect--to go to one of the American countries as a trade  representative. Dmitriy Nikolayevich refused both offers. The  logic of his action is clear: By removing him, attempts were  being made to scare the rest, everyone who defends the interests  of the state, those who serve the cause rather than persons.  Filippov decided to hold firm to the end.    I remember how at the dawn of perestroyka chatty democrats,  searching for cozy jobs for themselves in the power structures,  delivered quite a few speeches on the need to appraise people  solely by their business qualities, their professional  competency. Well, in his time as second secretary of the  Leningrad Oblast Party Committee D. Filippov was not in charge  of ideology (as many current administrators were)--his  responsibility was industry and economics. Apparently it is as a  specialist in this area that he suddenly fell into disfavor  among militant "reformers..."    We will learn the outcome of this conflict very soon: The  matter is under consideration in the State Duma.    Sobchak's letter demanding the removal of Filippov, however,  turned out to be just one of a series. For instance, a demand  was sent to the minister of internal affairs to replace Anatoliy  Kramarev, chief of the city internal affairs administration. He  lost Sobchak's confidence after he initiated investigative  action with respect to some individuals in the mayor's inner  circle.    The recent visit to St. Petersburg of Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] chief Stepashin gave rise to  rumors of the possible removal of another professional--Viktor  Cherkesov, chief of the FCS's regional administration.    A. Sobchak's reluctance to have next to him authoritative  officials, especially in the "enforcement" area, is quite  indicative: It is not accidental that the St. Petersburg mayor  is asking emergency powers for himself from the Russian  Federation president. Any emergency situation is profitable for  whoever imposes it, because anything at all may be written off  under this pretext.    Looking at what is happening in the city on the Neva, I  unwittingly wonder that it is probably not accidental that  Sobchak's old book had an evasive title "Pilgrimage to Power." A  'pilgrimage' relieves one of the burden of responsibility  imposed by power: Well, so I made this trip, it happens to  anyone. You sort it out later, dear voters...    Was this not the yardstick the mayor applied to Filippov,  offering him a foreign assignment? And does the mayor have  enough tempting carrots for everyone he may be unhappy with?  Hardly. Such "generosity" betrays the "benefactor's" own  inclinations. Favorites just love to keep reshuffling personnel:  In the confusion it is easier to mask one's own lack of ability  and easier to make arrangements for one's own future by shifting  from the "front line" to comfortable rear positions.    Information we have received from a trusted source is proof  of this. As is known, a new Russian ambassador to the United  States still has not been appointed. The information is that  Anatoliy Sobchak is under consideration for this post--the idea  that suits him just fine but does not elicit the needed support  among professional diplomats.    If the appointment does indeed go through, I assume we will  get to read about A.A. Sobchak's next creation--another  "pilgrimage." This time across the seven seas.</p>

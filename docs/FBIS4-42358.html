			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said a  short while ago that the description of events included in the  UN secretary general's report is being judged as very objective.  He stressed that for the first time the UN secretary general is  clearly blaming the Turkish Cypriot side. Kasoulidhis also  stressed that indirectly the report blames Turkey as it notes  that the lack of political will is also found outside Cyprus.  The main conclusion of the report, the spokesman said, is that  for the first time it blames the Turkish side for its lack of  political will and suggests the study of alternative ways to  promote a solution to the Cyprus issue.    Kasoulidhis added that when the report was released,  President Glavkos Kliridhis repeated that he would be committed  to accepting the 21 March document if the other side would do  the same. Kasoulidhis stressed, however, that it is now time  for alternative ways to be tried to promote the substance of the  Cyprus issue.    The government spokesman announced that the National Council  will be convened at 0900 on Friday [3 June] morning to discuss  our position.</p>

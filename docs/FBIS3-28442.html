Nearly 20 robbery cases were registered in South Korea in  January, which were shuddering robberies involving the use of  weapons and looting.    The Kim Yong-sam group is staging what it calls "180-day  operation for wiping off crimes" while advertizing "public peace  for the people". But the spearhead of the repressive forces is  always directed against the patriotic forces which call for  independence, democracy and reunification, the analyst notes,  and goes on:    It is not without reason that South Korean public criticizes  Kim Yong-sam, asking why the traitor who has been merciless in  suppressing the patriotic forces, is so incompetent in nabbing  robbers.    The gang robberies in South Korea are immediate consequences  of the misdeeds of the traitor Kim Yong-sam and other elements  of the ruling quarters who stand in the foreground in fraud,  swindle and corruption, fostering crimes and vices in society.    The social evils spreading in South Korea these days are  signs of the end of the "civilian" regime.    It is not long before the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his  "civilian" regime meet their disgraceful doom.</p>

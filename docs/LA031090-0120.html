			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SPENDS $890 MILLION ON S&amp;L SOLD TO PERELMAN FIRM  </P> <P> Federal regulators spent an estimated $890 million in taxpayer money to bail  out a Texas savings institution in a sale to a thrift holding company  controlled by financier Ronald O. Perelman.  </P> <P> Perelman's holding company, on the other hand, is putting up only $10 million.  </P> <P> The Resolution Trust Corp., created in August to dispose of failed thrifts,  sold San Antonio Savings Assn. to First Gibraltar Holdings Inc.  </P> <P> The holding company already owns First Gibraltar Bank, a Dallas-based thrift  with assets of more than $9 billion. It was formed in 1988 from five smaller  insolvent S&amp;Ls in a much criticized bailout deal that required $5.1 billion  in federal assistance and favorable tax breaks.  </P> <P> The name of the San Antonio S&amp;L will be changed to First Gibraltar Bank,  but it will be maintained as a separate financial institution. Earlier this  week, the RTC board voted to allow thrifts created in earlier bailouts to bid  on newly failed S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> However, because Congress has ordered the RTC to review the old bailouts, the  agency is requiring First Gibraltar Holdings to maintain the San Antonio  institution as a separately capitalized entity.  </P> <P> The RTC said First Gibraltar's proposal was the cheapest of seven received. The  holding company is taking $1.1 billion of San Antonio's $2.3 billion in assets.  And it agreed to assume responsibility for deposits of $2 billion in 220,000  accounts and other liabilities of $750 million.  </P> <P> In return, the RTC agreed to advance $1.6 billion to First Gibraltar. The  agency is keeping about $1.1 billion in sour loans. After those are sold, the  RTC expects its expenses will total $890 million.  </P> <P> An investor group -- MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc. -- controls First  Gibraltar Holdings. Its investors include Perelman and Revlon Inc.  </P> <P> Dallas newspapers reported earlier this week that Perelman's group had emerged  as the winner of a bidding war. Others reportedly interested in the San Antonio  S&amp;L were NCNB Texas, Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, and Security Pacific  Corp. of Los Angeles, although Security Pacific denied having submitted a bid.  </P></p>

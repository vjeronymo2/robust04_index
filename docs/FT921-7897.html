			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: NBD slips to Dh412.8m NATIONAL Bank of Dubai (NBD), the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), yesterday said 1991 net profits fell 11.5 per cent due to the drop in interest rates, AP-DJ reports from Manama. Net profits slipped to Dh412.8m (Dollars 114.6m) from Dh466.3m in 1990. The bank said lower dollar interest rates last year pushed down dirham rates because the UAE dirham is pegged to the US currency. Pre-tax profit fell 12 per cent to Dh411.4m from Dh468.9m. Customer deposits rose 3.7 per cent to Dh19.84bn at the end of 1991 from Dh19.13bn. Total assets rose almost 2 per cent to Dh24.63bn from Dh24.14bn. The bank proposed cash dividends of 40 dirhams per share, unchanged from 1990.</p>

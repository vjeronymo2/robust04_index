			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT DEFENSE ASKS JURY NOT TO CONFUSE SUSPICION AND PROOF  </P> <P> Attorneys for Randy Steven Kraft told the jury Wednesday that they had a right  to be suspicious of Kraft's involvement in several of the 16 murders he is  charged with committing. But they urged jurors not to confuse suspicion with  proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  </P> <P> "If you put up enough different charges, you could come up with a scenario that  could convict a Pope," Kraft attorney James G. Merwin warned them.  </P> <P> The defense has so far spent 1 1/2 days on closing arguments at Kraft's trial  in Santa Ana, which is now in its ninth month. Some legal experts predict that  it will be the most expensive criminal proceeding in the state's history.  </P> <P> The defense is scheduled to complete closing arguments this morning, and will  be followed by rebuttal arguments from the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan  F. Brown. Lengthy jury instructions must be given, however, before jurors can  begin deliberations.  </P> <P> Besides the 16 murders he is being tried for, Kraft, 44, a computer consultant  from Long Beach, is accused by prosecutors of 29 other murders in three states.  All the victims were young men, mostly between the ages of 18 and 25, whose  sexually abused bodies often were found dumped by a freeway.  </P> <P> The trial had been delayed for nearly 5 years while the Kraft lawyers pleaded  with the courts for more time to put together a defense against so many murder  charges.  </P> <P> Kraft was arrested on May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers  who stopped him for a traffic violation in Mission Viejo found Terry Lee  Gambrel, a 25-year-old Marine, dead in the front passenger seat of his car.  </P> <P> The defense recognizes the compelling evidence against Kraft in the Gambrel  death. But Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald pleaded with jurors not to convict  him on all 16 deaths just because of Gambrel.  </P> <P> "It would be easy to look at Gambrel and say, well he must have killed all 16,"  McDonald said Wednesday. He urged the jurors to judge each of the murders in  the charges individually.  </P> <P> Kraft alternated between watching his attorneys intently and taking notes in  his lavender-colored note pad. Two of his sisters and other Kraft family  members sat in a group directly behind him. Some of them nodded approval when  McDonald told jurors that the evidence showed Kraft to be a hard worker who was  admired by co-workers and who had never been known to commit a violent act.  </P> <P> McDonald cited the weekend of Feb. 12 and 13, 1983, when Geoffrey Alan Nelson,  18, and Rodger James DeVaul, 20, were killed. They had last been seen walking  together near Cypress College. When their bodies were found, Nelson had been  emasculated and DeVaul had been sodomized.  </P> <P> Those two deaths are among the prosecution's stronger cases, because  photographs of DeVaul, with a ligature mark on his neck and one of his wrists  bound, were found in Kraft's house.  </P></p>

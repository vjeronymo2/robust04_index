			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GRAY BEATS CRIMSON, 188-177 IN LOYOLA SCRIMMAGE  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount's basketball scrimmage at Gersten Pavilion may have been as  notable for who was missing as who was on hand Saturday.  </P> <P> With two probable starters injured, the Lions managed to score 365 points as  the Gray team beat the Crimson, 188-177.  </P> <P> That was accomplished with point guard Tony Walker and 6-foot-10 center Richard  Petruska -- both expected to start -- as well as forward Christian Scott  sitting out with injuries.  </P> <P> Junior Terrell Lowery and redshirt sophomore Brian McCloskey scored 54 and 41  points, respectively.  </P> <P> However, with several veterans sitting out, the talented freshman class got to  show off, with Kareem Washington matching Lowery's 54 points and Rahim Harris  getting 45. Junior transfer Craig Holt, expected to add three-point punch, got  34 points and led both teams with eight three-point baskets. Another freshman,  Ross Richardson, scored 15 points and hit four of six three-point shots.  Freshman point guard Greg Evans had 17 assists.  </P> <P> "We played some guys we probably won't play (a lot)," Lion Coach Jay Hillock  said. "I like the freshmen. . . . we've got four solid freshmen."  </P> <P> The Gray team, which never trailed, led 97-94 at halftime. Senior Marcus Slater  had 30 points and 24 rebounds for the winners.  </P> <P> Walker, who had off-season wrist surgery, aggravated the wrist in practice and  is sitting out seven to 10 days. He will then be re-examined.  </P> <P> Walker reported some improvement Saturday. Petruska, who has a groin injury,  will return to practice Monday on a limited basis. Scott, who suffered a broken  nose in practice, will return with a mask Tuesday.  </P> <P> Hillock, who got on his team for committing fouls when they were tired, said:  "Were playing hard. We've got a lot of work to do. A lot of things will smooth  out starting this week. We've got to get in better shape, and we've got to  install an interior game. Obviously, with Petruska out, we didn't have much of  an inside game. That will be our emphasis the next few weeks."  </P> <P> The Lions will get a better idea of where they stand when they play their first  exhibition game Saturday against a touring Australian team.  </P> <P> In the women's scrimmage, Coach Todd Corman's starting team defeated the  reserves, 77-29, led by center Tricia Gibson's 19 points and 12 rebounds. Guard  Lynn Flanagan and forward Jamie Jesko scored 17 apiece. Lisa Humphreys led the  reserves with 12 points.  </P></p>

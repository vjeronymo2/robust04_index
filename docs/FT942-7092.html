			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / A fox among the Socialist pussycats: Gyula Horn, a one-time hardline communist heading for power in Hungary and espousing orthodox economics So smiling, youthful and unthreatening are Hungary's Socialist party leaders that a liberal weekly catchlined its cover picture of them with the phrase 'Pink pussycats'. That was after the former communists took a commanding lead with 33 per cent of the vote in the first round of this month's parliamentary elections. Now the Hungarian Socialist party is poised for a landslide in the run-off vote this Sunday. The Socialists are sure to be the largest party. The only question is whether they will have an absolute majority. Socialist politicians, although emboldened by their success, are still purring soothingly. They reject a return to the past, revenge against the conservatives who have governed Hungary since 1990, and reversal of conservative policies such as compensation for property expropriated by the former regime. There is little socialism in the party programme, let alone red-toothed communism. Socialists largely share the broad political consensus favouring membership of the European Union and Nato. A westerner commented to Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the left's economic expert, that the Socialist orthodox economic programme could have been that of a right-wing party in western Europe. 'Thank you,' Mr Bekesi replied. The revamp of the Socialist party encompasses more than policy pronouncements. Mr Attila Agh, a political scientist and founder of the party in 1989, says the average age of Socialist party members is 40 and only about half of them were formerly communists. It gives the Socialists some right to be irritated by the label of 'former communists' that sticks to them so persistently. But one, rather distinguished, Socialist cannot escape the description so easily: Mr Gyula Horn, 61-year-old party leader and most likely the next prime minister or at very least the power behind the premiership. Mr Horn was not in the photo of the 'pink pussycats' because he was in bed in hospital at the time, his neck in a brace, recovering from a car accident on the eve of the first round of voting. But the caption does not suit him anyhow. The chain-smoking Socialist leader's age and demeanour are in sharp contrast not only to those of the younger vice-presidents of the party. His Polish counterpart, Mr Aleksander Kwasnieski, 40-year-old leader of Poland's SLD, wields a mobile phone and is more of a yuppie than a reconstructed communist. Mr Horn went to college in Rostov in the former Soviet Union and speaks Russian rather than English at international conferences. More embarrassingly, he wore the trademark 'padded jacket' of the volunteer militia which helped put down the 1956 uprising against communist rule. 'You've got blood on your padded jacket,' charges the graffiti on his election posters and a conservative newspaper editor called Mr Horn a 'potential killer'. Government-run state television was more specific, accusing the Socialist leader, without firm evidence, of kicking in the teeth of a counter-revolutionary prisoner. Those who knew Mr Horn later, in the early 1980s, when he was number two at the foreign department of the central committee remember a 'typical product of the party system'. 'I wouldn't say he has changed very much,' says one. Mr Horn certainly still has the toughness of a hardened veteran of Communist party infighting. He is notorious for cutting interviews short if he does not like the line of questioning. He doffs his hat to no one. At a recent speech to foreign investors in Budapest, the Socialist leader seemed close to boredom, looking out of the window as he was speaking. Socialists prefer to skip quickly over Mr Horn's early career to linger on his achievements as foreign minister in the last communist government in 1989. He was the man who went to the western frontier with Austria and took the wire-cutters to the Iron Curtain; Mr Horn, in biblical fashion, set the east Germans free, allowing them to escape to the west through Hungary; and he began negotiations with Moscow on the withdrawal of Soviet troops. So which is the real Gyula Horn? He himself offers few clues. The Socialist leader says he has traversed the political spectrum from communist to reform communist to socialist but avoids any more precise expression of his political beliefs. 'I view ideology as a private matter for people and it should not play a part in politics,' he says. It is statements like these which lead the Socialists' opponents to describe them, not as communists, but as nihilists, believers in nothing. A western diplomat gives another slant to Mr Horn's pragmatism. 'He is not philosophical at all. Obtaining and exercising power is what he likes. He's very bright, he's quick and he sees all the angles on things. The question is whether he loves democracy or not.' It may not be a question of love. Mr Horn adapted successfully to Stalinist oppression, reform communism and the upheavals of 1989 and 1990. He is just as skilful an operator in democracy: opinion polls consistently judge him Hungary's most popular party leader. Mr Laszlo Lengyel, a leading political commentator describes him, not as a pussycat, but as a fox.</p>

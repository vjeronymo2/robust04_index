			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Cordy: "A Good Neighbor, Van Den Brande </F> Pays Homage to France"]    [Excerpts] Forty-eight hours in France: The visit by  Minister- President Van Den Brande began on Tuesday [29 March]  with extensive contacts with the French business world, at a  lunch organized by the Belgo-Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce in  Paris.    On Wednesday, he is to meet with President Mitterrand at the  Elysee [office of the president] and Prime Minister Balladur at  Matignon [prime minister's office], and also with European  Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure and Foreign Trade Minister  Gerard Longuet. The Paris agenda also includes meetings with,  among others, OECD Secretary General Paye; the Belgian  ambassador to France, the Belgian ambassador to the OECD, and  the Belgian ambassador to UNESCO.    Mr. Van Den Brande is to meet many business managers and  representatives of major companies. [passage omitted]    The minister-president of Flanders, accompanied by his  colleagues and about 20 Flemish journalists, outlined the aims  of this visit. It comes after visits already made to the  Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Great Britain, and will probably be  followed by a visit to Germany. He evidently intends to acquire  international status. In addition to the economic and cultural  contacts established by these meetings, he also expects to win  political recognition for himself at the European level. It is  in a spirit of "good neighborliness" that he has headed south  as, as he puts it: "Flanders is France's newest and youngest  neighbor." He also wants to indicate that France is Flander's  second most important trading partner after Germany (202000060100f  Flemish exports).    Concerning recent takeovers of Flemish companies by major  French groups, he intends to remind his interlocutors that  Flanders believes that "certain sectors must remain in Flemish  hands," and that cooperation with foreign companies must be done  "on an equal footing." He will also add that : "The Belgian  facade presented by a number of these companies does not  constitute a certificate of safe conduct allowing them to  operate in Flanders." [passage omitted]</p>

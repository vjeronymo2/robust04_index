			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recoups fall after beige book price news Wall Street US share prices ended little changed yesterday after reassuring news from the Federal Reserve on inflation and a rally in bond prices helped the stock market recover from early losses, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.69 at 3,853.41, well above its low for the day of 3,829.77. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a net 1.18 ahead at 467.06. The American Stock Exchange composite was just 0.89 off on balance at 466.79 and the Nasdaq composite 0.93 firmer at 793.05. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 310m shares. Declines retained a narrow lead over rises by 1,112 to 997. As on Tuesday, the stock market took its cue from bond prices, with equities falling from the start in the wake of early selling on the Treasury market. By mid-morning the Dow was more than 20 points down. Bond prices, however, bounced back into positive territory during the afternoon following the release of the Fed's 'beige book' report on the economy. The report contained mixed news on the economy, but the element that the bond and stock markets focused on was inflation, and here the beige book found 'only limited price pressures' in the economy. The recovery in bond prices helped stocks to pick up from their lows. Although the rally was not particularly convincing at first, the steady rebound in bonds eventually provided enough of a lift to equities that most were able to end the day at, or slightly above, their opening levels. Among individual sectors, semiconductor stocks firmed notably following a positive report on sales from the semiconductor industry association. Texas Instruments climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 84 1/4 , Motorola added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 108 and Micron Technology put on Dollars 3 at Dollars 80 3/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Intel rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 71 5/8 . International Paper fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/2 in busy trading after the company warned analysts to lower their first-quarter earnings estimates. General Instruments dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 45 3/8 on newspaper reports that the Justice Department has requested information about the company's dominance in its domestic market. Boyd Gaming rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 after the company was chosen as the sole operator of a Missouri riverboat casino. Heinz slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31, a 12-month low, after the food group announced a 21 per cent fall in third-quarter profits to Dollars 128.6m in the wake of troubles at its Weight Watchers business. Motor stocks continued to outperform the market as investors favoured the sector. Chrysler added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 60 3/4 , Ford climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 and General Motors firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , all in busy trading. Canada Toronto stocks shook off earlier weakness and closed higher, driven by a rebound in gold shares and continued merger-fuelled media strength. Conglomerates, one of several sectors to reverse direction late in the day, also finished firmer. The TSE 300 index was finally a net 13.2 up at 4,444.4. Market volume was heavy at 86.3m shares valued at CDollars 969m and rises led falls by 405 to 383. An analyst said rate-related jitters are easing in spite of an across-the-board rise in mortgage rates by Canada's major banks. The precious metals index regained 1.91 per cent at 10,046.0. Comex gold bounced off a three-month low on a short-covering rally, with the most-active April issues up USDollars 2.40 at USDollars 380.10 an ounce.</p>

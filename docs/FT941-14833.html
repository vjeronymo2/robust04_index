			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Second line stocks continue to outperform - Market report London's equity market built on last Friday's outstanding performance, but closed well below the day's highs in the wake of a stuttering opening by Wall Street. The US market was hit at the outset of trading by news of an earthquake affecting much of Los Angeles. Nevertheless, the FT-SE 100 Index remained strongly in positive territory after further encouraging news on the UK economy in the form of better than expected producer prices and output numbers for December, plus industrial production figures for November. Significantly, dealers highlighted another strong showing by the stock market's second-line issues as a powerful indicator of the underlying confidence in UK markets. Some determined buying across the board drove second-rank stocks sharply higher and pushed the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up 33.1 to an all-time peak of 3,948.8. Turnover in London markets showed no signs of flagging after the recent long run of exceptionally high volumes. Yesterday saw 808.3m shares change hands, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 556.8m shares, or 68.8 per cent of the total. Figures released yesterday showed that the value of business in the equity market last Friday was worth Pounds 2.03bn, well above recent levels. Share prices rose from the outset of trading, driven by renewed buying of the March future on the Footsie, said to have been executed by some of the big US investment banks. It was pointed out, however, that the US houses often act for leading UK institutions. And dealers also said there were strong indications that at least one of the powerful Scottish institutions had plunged into the market last Friday. The early futures-inspired surge quickly ran out of steam, however, and it was buying, sometimes low key, in the cash market that sustained share prices and kept them in positive territory. The FT-SE 100 Index rose more than seven points during the first hour of trading, before slipping back in mid-morning and then staging another strong upward move which saw it reach a session peak of 3,421.1. Thereafter, prices drifted back, influenced by the US earthquake news, to close a net 7.2 ahead at 3,407.8. Some of the leading marketmakers said they were taken by surprise by last Friday's burst of buying interest, which they said was the result of sector rotation and the recent realignment of fund managers' asset allocations. But most remained confident that the market is underpinned by expected interest rate cuts. 'If sterling continues to rise then rate cuts are definitely on the agenda,' said one. Others adopted a much more cautious line, however. 'The market feels heavy at Footsie 3,400; it is hard work from here onwards,' said another. Insurance issues were among the market's best performers early in the session but came off their best levels after the earthquake disaster news. But other financial stocks continued to attract sizeable support, notably the merchant banks, where those with big stock market operations were well to the fore. SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson were outstanding. Oil shares were mixed in spite of the sharp rise in crude oil prices, which responded to the cold snap in the US and lingering hopes that an emergency Opec meeting could still occur.</p>

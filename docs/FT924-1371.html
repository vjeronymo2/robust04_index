			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Not such a bleak midwinter: Many US retailers feel optimistic about the Christmas season, but the longer-term outlook is still uncertain Tony is selling Christmas trees on New York City's West Side docks in a makeshift stall he built just after Thanksgiving Day. Trade, he claims, has been steady so far. But suddenly a freezing sleet storm descends. 'Just what we don't need,' he mutters grimly, from the depths of a large sou'wester. A Manhattan tree-seller is a minuscule part of the vast US retail sector, but such sentiments could have come as easily from the nation's largest store chains. They are putting a brave face on the holiday season - the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, during which retailers make up to 40 per cent of their annual sales and 50 per cent of profits. But lingering hopes that 1992 would be the year when holiday shoppers returned in force have now largely been abandoned, and everyone is hoping that vagaries, such as the weather, do not work against them. Even if the holiday season meets retailers' expectations, the longer-term outlook is mixed. On the plus side, the wave of bankruptcies and reorganisations in the late 1980s and early 1990s means that some companies are now more efficient, while pressure from the discount-store sector has forced all chains to examine their operating practices and cost structures. On the minus side, the retail industry is oversupplied with space, while consumer confidence, which is closely associated with the shaky jobs market, is at a delicate stage of recovery. Progress for much of the past year has been patchy for the nation's shopkeepers. According to a Salomon Bros index, monthly same-store sales growth - that is, at stores which have been operating for more than a year - ranged from only 1.6 per cent to 9.6 per cent in the first 11 months of 1992. Nevertheless, the figure has topped 5 per cent in seven of these months, a rate of underlying sales improvement not seen last year. Given that the US inflation rate has been less than 4 per cent all year, this suggests that some headway - albeit modest - is being made. By contrast, however, in the early 1980s comparable store sales growth during the Christmas period reached double-digit figures. Individual retailers, releasing their own monthly sales figures, provide more details. After the weak 1991-92 holiday season, most started this year in fairly cheerful fashion - partly because their sales looked good compared with the same period of 1990-91 when the Gulf war was about to begin. Same-store sales growth flagged during the summer, but picked up with 'back-to-school' purchases in September. It remained relatively buoyant in October and November. Sears Roebuck, one of the largest and oldest US retailers, which sells everything from furniture to fashion, exemplifies the trend. In January and February, monthly comparable sales growth ran at 7 to 8 per cent, but by June and July the retailer was posting declines of 2.6 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. In August, matters turned positive again, and over the past three months there has been an average comparable store sales gain of almost 5 per cent - a revival which Mr Arthur Martinez, the new head of merchandise operations, described as an encouraging portent for the holiday season. In the more specialised fashion sector, The Limited also moved from comparable sales gains of 9 and 5 per cent in the first two months of the year to declines in May, June and July. It, too, found autumn more clement, and by November underlying sales growth was 8 per cent. In large part, this pattern can be attributed to trends in the US economy, rather than any retailing initiative. Unemployment rose early in the year, and then declined modestly in the autumn. Consumer confidence, which sagged mid-year, perked up last month. Consumer credit has been falling steadily; by October, instalment debt accounted for 16.5 per cent of personal disposable income, compared with 18.5 per cent three years ago. But retailers are aware that results to date fade in importance compared with those achieved in the holiday season. This began encouragingly - despite the torrential rain which poured down on Macy's Thanksgiving parade. One of the largest US cheque acceptance companies - which verifies and guarantees cheque payments - calculated that day-after-Thanksgiving retail sales were up by about 5.1 per cent nationally. Since then, the retail industry has been waiting expectantly - largely because, with Christmas Day falling on a Friday, the selling period starting at Thanksgiving is two days longer this year than last. And as Minneapolis-based retailer Dayton Hudson points out, this means that some promotional releases, in newspapers and other media, have been delayed. As a result, reliable assessments of trading cannot be made until after this weekend. Even so, some geographical nuances are already apparent. Virtually all the 'national' chains say that the west coast is proving to be worse than expected, while the south-east is beating expectations. Carter Hawley Hale, the Los Angeles-based fashion-store chain, which has just emerged from bankruptcy with an approved reorganisation plan, makes 87 per cent of its sales in California. Conditions, it says bluntly, are 'extremely tough'. Macy's, the large New York-based department store group, sends the same message: Florida and Georgia are buoyant, and New York City and Washington DC are encouraging. But California remains 'very poor', because consumer confidence remains even lower there than in many other parts of the country. But even if, nationally, holiday sales growth turns out to be merely respectable, Wall Street expects many retailers to see more significant progress in profit terms. Most chains have assumed that holiday sales growth will be modest and have therefore ordered stocks conservatively. There are even tales of big catalogue operators scrabbling for merchandise, because there are not enough goods to go round. Retailers also believe that price-cutting, although still prevalent, is slightly less fierce than a year ago. Nevertheless, savings of 40 to 50 per cent on a wide variety of merchandise were being touted by A&amp;S, the east coast department store chain, and Macy's. Earlier in the season, some retailers concentrated on promoting modestly priced items. The classy Neiman Marcus catalogue, for instance, began with several pages of 'gifts under Dollars 25' and 'gifts under Dollars 50' - which bought anything from a cloisonne egg box to a leather compact disc carrier. In addition, three years in a tough trading environment have made most store chains acutely conscious of their cost-base - they recognise the need to employ no more than the minimum of additional staff at Christmas, time promotions better, achieve better stock control and so on. 'Even if they only get 3-4 per cent sales growth, I think it's going to be a good Christmas for most retailers,' predicts Ms Barbara Wedelstaedt, analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei, the high-yield securities specialist. So, assuming there are no unpleasant surprises between now and the new year, does this mean that the US retail sector - which led the nation's economy into recession - is heading for a robust 1993? Not entirely. First, most store sector analysts say that there is still an oversupply of retail space in the US. Although expansion has slowed since the 1970s and early 1980s, consultants at Deloitte &amp; Touche calculate that retail space has increased by 17 per cent since 1985. 'More space will have to go out of the market,' comments Mr Irwin Cohen, a partner at Deloitte and chairman of the accountant's retail and distribution services group. Again, this is partly a regional problem, and in certain areas the battle for space is still fierce. Only last month, two medium-sized discount retailers, Caldor and Bradlees, fought in a bankruptcy court for the leases on half a dozen stores formerly occupied by Alexander's, the now-defunct New York City department store group - a battle won by Caldor. Second, although sizeable retail groups such as Federated Department Stores, Revco and Carter Hawley Hale have emerged from bankruptcy protection during the past 12 months after restructuring their operations and balance sheets, several retailers still have to complete this process. Macy's, which filed for bankruptcy protection at the beginning of 1992, is perhaps the best known. The company recently presented a business plan to its creditors. It called for a leaner operational structure, more focus by specific stores on local customer demands, and sharper retailing techniques. Most retail observers warn that these measures will do little more than bring the group up to date with rivals such as Dillard, which employ more sophisticated retailing methods. Creditors, meanwhile, reckon that it could be another 18 months before the bankruptcy shield is shed. But Macy's situation is better than that of a handful of other store groups. For example, Ames Department Stores, a general merchandise chain which now has 369 outlets, has floundered in bankruptcy for more than two years, closing more than 300 stores in the process. In the face of continuing losses, its board asked for the chief executive's resignation earlier this month as part of a management shake-up. More fundamentally, perhaps, the challenge to the rest of the retail sector from the discount chains shows no sign of easing. Discount chains such as Wal-Mart and Kmart have significantly lower cost-structures and offer cheaper prices. Some observers, however, believe that the department stores have begun to get the measure of their opponents. Last autumn, these more traditional retailers ran limited, discount-chain-style promotions of 'back-to-school' goods, to entice price-conscious shoppers into their stores. Finally, even if the recession has ebbed in the US, retailers are not certain that consumer demand will pick up significantly next year. The optimists argue that households have been postponing spending decisions for several years, so that a large amount of 'pent-up' demand is waiting to be released. Some big retailers are much more cautious. 'I see 2, 3, 4 per cent growth for the next couple of years,' says Mr Joseph Antonini, head of Kmart. 'I don't see a robust economy and the reason for that is the job situation. I think it's improving, but I don't think you're going to see 6, 7 or 8 per cent growth rates. As retailers we have to accept this and make money within that type of environment.'</p>

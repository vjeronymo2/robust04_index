			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F> unidentified interviewer; place and date not given; from the  "Middle East Drama" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Interviewer] Andrey Vladimirovich, what's your  assessment of the tragic event that occurred in Hebron?    [Kozyrev] It is, in general, quite a typical situation. In  many areas of conflict, we encounter provocations -- either the  actions of people who cannot cope with their hatred, or simply  madmen, etc. In other words, the situation is, in general,  familiar enough from other areas. A person fires and kills  dozens of people. That immediately highlights a problem. The  main problem is the safety of the population in the occupied  territories and, of course, potentially, in those territories  that are now, by agreement, to be handed over to the Palestinian  side. Safety has to be ensured there too, and, of course, it is  a very sensitive moment when, on the one hand, peace is already  attainable, but, on the other, forces are at work -- perhaps  it's an individual in the present case, but behind him,  objectively, stand forces, anyway -- that wish to frustrate the  peace. That is the essence of the tragedy.    What conclusion can be drawn from this? Some may conclude  that nothing will come of it. So let us fight, kill, and return  to what is essentially a war in these territories. The second  conclusion, which we draw, is that it is necessary to help the  sides, to help them more actively. That is what, in our view,  this occurrence has highlighted -- apart from the human tragedy.    So, acting on the president's instructions, I immediately  made contact with 'Arafat and with Shim'on Peres this morning.  He and I had a further talk later. The Israelis assured us  that they would be adopting their own measures to ensure  security. In fact, Peres told me today that the government has  adopted a whole package of measures -- five or six of them --  including the disarming of the most dangerous elements who are  there among the Israelis themselves. That is, I think, a strong  and, to be honest, a bold step on the part of the Israeli  Government, and they had voiced their indignation, and so on and  so forth. In other words, something is being done.    We also discussed the possibility of further measures of  that  type. 'Arafat asked me to go back to the idea of international  participation, international assistance. Indeed, our experience  in other areas too also shows that, generally speaking, either  Russian or UN observers provide assistance, if only  psychological. In other words, the sides see that someone is  helping, that they are not cast to the mercy of fate.    There is a very high level of suspicion on both sides, and  the presence of international representatives does somehow give  them a feeling of -- how should I put it? -- neutrality or  greater confidence. I asked the Israeli Government to weigh up  the possibility of such an international presence. At first,  the reaction was not very, let us say, it was without  enthusiasm. Why? Because they don't want a UN presence. We  then suggested that some thought could be given to the idea that  they did not need to be UN observers. Maybe it would, in the  end, be necessary to look for some other uniforms.    Shim'on Peres, Israel's foreign minister, told me on the  telephone today that they are really prepared to discuss  different options. They are still somewhat wary of the United  Nations but he did not rule out other options. So we have  agreed that Igor Sergeyevich Ivanov, the special envoy of the  president and the first deputy foreign minister, who is a very  experienced diplomat -- he has today flown to Tunisia to have a  meeting with 'Arafat and the PLO leaders and to discuss with  them ways out of this situation and how Russia can help -- we  are ready to consider some material, and not merely political  forms of assistance to the Palestinians, so that they might  start feeling more confident, but immediately after this, in  accordance with the understanding I have just reached, he will  fly to Israel where he is to have a meeting with Israeli leaders  in order to discuss different solutions with them as well.    Thus, the important thing is to provide for both sides a  maximum political, and if necessary, material assistance, if you  like, so that they can not only rescue the peace process but  could also move onwards after this shock, this tragedy. This is  because we want peace to prevail in the Middle East, and we  cannot allow a bandit, or even a group of bandits, to disrupt  this process. However, it is one thing to reach an agreement in  principle and to start implementing it -- talks on the  implementation of the agreement are under way -- but then  immediately we are confronted with reality. And here other  forces emerge, which try to disrupt this process, if you see  what I mean. And it turns out that the whole thing requires  much greater efforts that we probably thought at the beginning.  Therefore, we have rushed to fill this breach, in order to save  this peace process once again and even to impart a new impetus  to it.    I think it will take our special envoy several days to  establish various other contacts. I spoke to U.S. Secretary of  State Christopher about this yesterday. Russia and the United  States are the cosponsors of the peace process in the Middle  East, and we are not saying no to cooperation in this sphere,  but it is clear that without an active Russian participation --  both 'Arafat and the Israeli leaders have asked for that -- this  process cannot be saved. But we are not saying that this is  something different from the efforts of everyone else. On the  contrary, we think that everyone should be working to achieve  the same goal.</p>

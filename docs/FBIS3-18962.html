In  January the Israeli Ministry for Foreign Affairs appointed Yusuf  Haji-Yahya as the country's ambassador in Helsinki but he has  refused, citing personal reasons. Haji-Yahya, who has a law  practice in Tel Aviv, says that he had made his decision already  before the recent massacre of Palestinians at a mosque in  Hebron. He would have been Israel's first Arab ambassador.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manuel Cabrera] </F>   [Excerpt] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 25 April--Business  firms established here for some time could be involved in the  "laundering of money" originating in the drug traffic.  Therefore, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) is investigating  the activities of at least three companies. This announcement  was made today by the director of the National Association of  Manufacturers (Canacintra), Miguel Angel Calderon Rodriguez.    He indicated that the department has located money from the  drug traffic in commercial firms, but not in the manufacturing  sector.    He cautioned that companies proven to have connections with  that illicit activity will have their membership in Canacintra  canceled immediately.    The state attorney, Francisco Molina Ruiz, declared that  drug  trafficking rings have infiltrated several areas of society,  including the business-owning sector.    He noted that, two weeks ago, the U.S. agency fighting drugs  (DEA) in El Paso, Texas, seized five tons of cocaine and  arrested eight presumed drug traffickers, including the owner of  the Jomar chain of stationery stores, Joel Omar Chavez Quezada.    Nevertheless, the attorney claimed not to know the names of  the firms presumably implicated in laundering money representing  the proceeds from dealing in that alkaloid. [passage omitted]</p>

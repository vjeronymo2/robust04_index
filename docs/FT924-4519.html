			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Eurotunnel warns it may sue over rail privatisation SIR Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel, yesterday warned that his company would consider suing the government if railway privatisation cut the amount of rail traffic expected to use the Channel tunnel. Sir Alastair said he feared that the privatisation plans in their present form were in danger of driving rail freight on to the roads and cutting the investment needed to build new lines. The result was likely to be less rail freight going through the Channel tunnel and insufficient capacity for increases in the number of Channel tunnel expresses, so cutting Eurotunnel's revenues. Sir Alastair was speaking in advance of today's meeting of the Commons transport committee, where he is due to appear as a witness on railway privatisation. He said Eurotunnel would hold the government liable if its revenues suffered through changes in the conditions under which the Channel tunnel concession agreement was drawn up in 1986. Since privatisation was not on the government's agenda in 1986, that constituted a change in conditions - and Sir Alastair said he was convinced the effects would be adverse. Although British Rail and SNCF, the French national railway, have undertaken to buy 50 per cent of the Channel tunnel's capacity, part of the fees Eurotunnel receives will depend on how many trains pass through and how much they carry. Sir Alastair said BR's plans to create a track-owning body and to introduce track charges for freight and passenger trains would price most freight traffic off the rails. He also feared that privatisation would lead to a fall in railway investment, so worsening the prospects of action to relieve the capacity shortage on railway lines to and from the tunnel.</p>

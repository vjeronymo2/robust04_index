			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRIFICING OUR SOUL FOR 'WE'RE NO. 1';  </P> <P> U.S. LAW: UNRESTRAINED ACTIONS ABROAD ARE AN AGGRESSIVE ASSERTION OF NATIONAL  PRE-EMINENCE, WITH PERNICIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court has just ruled by a 6-3 majority that actions of U.S.  law-enforcement agents outside the United States are not subject to the  restraints imposed inside by the Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> Specifically, the Supreme Court finds that American agents abroad are not bound  by the Fourth Amendment guarantee of the right of the people to be secure  against unreasonable searches and seizures.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court holds that American national interest is superior to a  foreign person's claim to security in his or her person and house, and that an  American agent abroad need seek no warrant for his acts. This being so, no  restriction is to be placed upon the actions of American agents that is not  "imposed by the political branches (of the U.S. government) through diplomatic  understanding, treaty or legislation."  </P> <P> The decision is one more step by American legal officials to assert an  internationally sovereign U.S. authority. By this, U.S. law is not only applied  beyond U.S. borders, to persons not U.S. citizens -- and, as in this ruling,  who may have committed no U.S. crime, or no crime at all -- but this also is  done in disregard of the constitutional limits upon law enforcement inside the  United States.  </P> <P> How have Americans and their courts arrived at such a position? There seem to  me two elements in the explanation. The first is the legalism of American  society, which historically is the product of that concern for constitutional  order at the roots of the American federal union. There is a preoccupation with  legal codification and definition throughout American life and government.  </P> <P> Running in parallel with this has been an American puritanism that rejects the  deliberate hypocrisy practiced by other nations in their secret operations. No  one in Britain or France thinks that their secret services do not sometimes  break the law of other countries or commit acts that would be illegal in the  home country. These things are thought justified by raison d'etat, and  acceptable so long as the services responsible are under the responsible  control of elected officials.  </P> <P> Only America expects legally to define, codify -- and proclaim -- the authority  of its clandestine services to break the law of other countries and to  disregard international law. Only the United States is capable of conducting  "covert" operations abroad (like the Contra program) while openly debating them  in Congress.  </P> <P> This legalism and rejection of hypocrisy is often pronounced as a great  strength of American democracy. In fact, it produces a steady deterioration in  the standard of conduct legally permitted the U.S. government and its agents.  </P> <P> When you codify and formally legalize raison d'etat you end, as the United  States now has done, in legalizing forms of murder (complicity in political  assassination), housebreaking and theft (in the present case), and acts of  international aggression and undeclared war.  </P> <P> The force at work behind this obviously is nationalism: the belief that "We're  No. 1" -- and the rest are zero. It is an aggressive assertion of national  pre-eminence, with pernicious -- anarchic -- implications for the international  community.  </P> <P> It is time indeed for a "political branch" of American government, the  Congress, to restore to the practice of American government that "decent  respect" for the interests and opinions of the rest of mankind that the  nation's founders enjoined upon their fellow citizens.  </P></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BAT sees encouraging signs at Eagle Star EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary which has been a drain on profits at BAT Industries, showed some encouraging signs in the first quarter of this year, when the tobacco and financial services group increased its pre-tax profit from Pounds 230m to Pounds 262m. Although Eagle Star's pre-tax loss for the period increased from Pounds 2m to Pounds 40m, the previous year's figure included no losses on domestic mortgages. These were not provided for until the interim stage, when they amounted to Pounds 121m for six months. Between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, mortgage indemnity provisions were reduced from Pounds 44m to Pounds 25m and the average claim per repossessed home fell from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 11,000. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the encouraging signs included an easing in the number of repossessions and anecdotal evidence of more activity at estate agencies. It was, however, too early to say whether the improvement was a genuine trend rather than a quirk. Eagle Star's total underwriting losses showed little deterioration at Pounds 104m from the previous year's Pounds 102m. In the third quarter of last year  -normally better for seasonal reasons  - they had amounted to Pounds 147m. General insurance, which includes part of Farmers' activities in the US, had staged a recovery from a Pounds 105m loss in the second quarter of last year to a Pounds 40m trading profit in the first quarter of this year. This was down from Pounds 65m in the comparable period when the figures also benefited from a stock market rally, whereas this year the London market had been in pre-election doldrums. Discontinued activities lost Pounds 17m. On premiums, Sir Patrick said that although they had been raised by 30 per cent since last year, revenue was flat because some business had been lost. There was also a lag in the benefits coming through from the increases. In the life business, where Allied Dunbar is the group's largest concern, trading profit improved to Pounds 71m (Pounds 60m) helped by higher premium income and investment returns. At Allied, advances were made in lump sum investment, bonds and personal equity plans, but life assurance and pensions were down. The group benefited from a Pounds 25m reduction in net interest payments thanks to lower rates in the US and the UK, and to higher investment income, particularly in Brazil. The tax charge continued to be high at 44 (43) per cent, aggravated by unrelieved ACT. Sir Patrick said the main route to easing this would be a return to profits at Eagle Star. Growing exports of cigarettes from the Southampton factory were also an alleviating factor.</p>

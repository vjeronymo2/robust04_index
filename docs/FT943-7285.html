			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Tonic for fickle tastebuds: New Age soft drinks and own-label colas are posing a challenge to market leaders Coke and Pepsi For as long as anyone can remember, more people have quenched their thirsts with a Coca-Cola or its closest imitator, Pepsi-Cola, than any other soft drink money can buy. Together, they account for more than 50 per cent of all the carbonated drinks consumed worldwide. And yet . . . is it just possible that some of the fizz is going out of the market for two of the world's best-selling products? In the US, which alone accounts for a third of the world market for soft drinks, consumers are showing signs of getting bored with Coke and Pepsi. These days, they want wider variety. Cola-flavoured drinks are slowly losing market share to new types of beverages such as iced teas, fruit drinks, bottled water and energy-giving sports drinks. In the late 1980s, according to US securities firm Salomon Brothers, colas took 63 per cent of the US soft drinks market. Last year, the figure was down to 58 per cent. But alternative beverages are not the only worry for Coke and Pepsi. Until recently, the biggest threat Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the company that makes Pepsi, faced was each other. Now a bigger one seems to have emerged: the possibility that private-label manufacturers are taking an increasing share of a market that is in any case shrinking because consumers' tastes are changing. At first sight, this proposition seems to be supported by PepsiCo's latest financial results. Its second-quarter profits this year were Dollars 447m - excluding exceptional items, unchanged from the same period the previous year. Coca-Cola, however, increased net profits by 13 per cent to Dollars 758m in the same period. More significantly, Coca-Cola's share price, currently hovering around its all-time high, suggests that investors think the company's glory days are far from over. One reason why the companies' figures tell different stories is that, unlike Coca-Cola, PepsiCo derives only 35 per cent of its operating profits from soft drinks. A higher proportion, 37 per cent, comes from its fast food chains (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC - formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken), which suffered badly from price competition in the second quarter, and another 28 per cent comes from its Frito-Lay snacks business. Another reason for the profits difference is their geographical spread. In the US, Pepsi's market share is almost as big as Coke's, but worldwide, Pepsi trails behind. About 80 per cent of Coca-Cola's total operating profits come from outside the US, while PepsiCo's beverage division earns less than 16 per cent of its operating profits from other countries. The result is that Coca-Cola is cushioned from the effects of competition in the US, while PepsiCo is relatively exposed. Even so, neither Coca-Cola nor PepsiCo can afford to ignore US consumers' changing tastes. In the past few years, an increasingly health-conscious US public has shown signs of turning away from high-sugar soft drinks such as Coke and Pepsi. At first, the trend was towards diet (low-calorie) versions of the same drinks. But now the fastest area of growth is an ever-expanding variety of 'natural' drinks and so-called New Age beverages, such as fruit juice drinks and iced teas. A driving force behind the trend has been Snapple Beverage, an upstart US drinks manufacturer that has rocketed to public prominence through rapidly rising demand for its New Age drinks, which include Raspberry Iced Tea, Amazin' Grape Juice and Mango Madness Cocktail. This phenomenon has prompted a revolution at Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Realising they cannot resist the market trend, the two companies have decided to join it. Both are diversifying away from their core brands and are launching new products that do not even carry the Coke or Pepsi names. Coca-Cola, for example, sells a range of iced teas under the Nestea brand in a joint venture with Nestle, the Swiss food group, while PepsiCo sells iced teas under the Lipton name in a joint venture with the Thomas J. Lipton tea company, the US subsidiary of Unilever. In March this year, Coca-Cola launched a range of New Age fruit drinks in the US under the Fruitopia brand, with names such as Raspberry Psychic Lemonade and Grape Beyond; and earlier this month PepsiCo said it was forming a joint venture with Starbucks Coffee, a fast-growing US specialty coffee company, to launch a range of ready-to-drink iced coffees in bottle or cans under the Starbucks name. These days, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo make no attempt to disguise their willingness to spread into other kinds of soft drinks. PepsiCo acknowledges that some of the fastest-growing product categories are outside its traditional soft drinks business, and talks of its all-out effort to become a 'total beverage company'. Mr Sergio Zyman, chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola, said at the time of the Fruitopia launch in March that the company planned to increase both the speed and frequency of its product launches to meet changing consumer demands, 'aggressively addressing growth opportunities wherever they exist'. But while this approach may give Coca-Cola and PepsiCo a stake in the growth sectors of the soft drinks market, are their cola businesses in danger of withering under an assault from own-label brands? Private-label colas have been around for decades, but in the last few years, manufacturers have improved the flavour and packaging of their products. Consumers are nowadays switching away from branded goods if they can get acceptable quality at a lower price from own-label products. Earlier this summer PepsiCo suffered a fall of 2 per cent in operating profits from its soft drinks business. It turned out that Cott, the fast-growing Canadian maker of low-cost, store-branded foods and drinks, had quietly been signing up US store groups as customers. This came only a few weeks after Coca-Cola, the US maker of Coke, had taken a drubbing from Cott in the UK. When Cott started supplying J. Sainsbury, Britain's biggest food retailer, with cans of own-label cola that looked like Coke but sold at about half the price, Coke's share of Sainsbury's cola sales initially slumped from 63 per cent to 33 per cent. Yet even Royal Crown Cola, the US company that supplies cola syrup to Cott, says the threat to Coke and Pepsi has been exaggerated. Mr John Carson, RC Cola's chief executive, says recent inroads by own-brand colas have been limited to grocery store chains and discount stores, and even there they have come largely at the expense of earlier private-label products. 'Private-label is definitely a thorn in Coke and Pepsi's side. It's real and they can feel it. But it's not a threat,' Mr Carson says. Cott also tends to play down the implications of its recent triumphs - with good reason. Cott is a minnow compared with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and it is painfully aware that it would be unlikely to survive retaliatory action if it came to an outright cola price war. Industry analysts say own-label products will continue to be an irritant to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but not much more. Most of them think any adverse effects on the companies' sales from private-label competition - or, indeed, from an increasing proliferation of alternative beverages - will be more than outweighed by the opportunities for growth in developing countries and recently opened markets such as eastern Europe and China. While some of these markets may be less profitable than those in developed countries, particularly during the costly start-up phase, their sales potential is immense. At present, consumption of soft drinks outside the US averages four gallons per person per year. Inside the US, the figure is 49 gallons. PepsiCo, more heavily exposed to the US market and less focused on soft drinks than Coca-Cola, is regarded by Wall Street as less well placed to benefit. But own-label products and New Age beverages notwithstanding, industry observers say it is much too soon to suggest that the growth is about to end for either company. Jesse Meyers, publisher of US trade magazine Beverage Digest, says their brands are strongly embedded in the global psyche. 'I fully anticipate that when Virgin Atlantic Airways flies to the moon, we will be able to get off the plane and drink a Coke or a Pepsi,' he says.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Thai motorway dispute escalates A ROW between the Thai government and a consortium building an urgently needed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 643m) elevated motorway in Bangkok escalated yesterday with the government's demand that the road be opened tomorrow even though it is unfinished. The government said the motorway had to be opened because the traffic jams in Bangkok had 'become unbearable and (were) considered an immediate national crisis.' But the consortium's engineers say opening two-thirds of an incomplete road is more likely to disrupt than ease traffic flows in the capital. Mr Takao Ninomiya, managing director of Bangkok Expressway, the consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan, said the demand was 'really unexpected and actually unbelievable.' The consortium countered by offering the government 90-days' free use of the road on condition that it commits itself to solving the dispute in that time. However, it is refusing responsibility for accidents on any part of the motorway put into operation before final completion. Because the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority has been slow to deliver land, four of the 18 exit and entry ramps remain 'ski-jumps.' Six others have no traffic lights or road markings. In what is considered a vital test case because of the huge investment needed in Thai infrastructure, consortium members and banks accuse the government of breaking its contract, notably with a decision to cut the previously agreed toll fee because of political opposition within the ruling coalition. Government ministers admit failing to stick to the letter of the contract but say foreign investors are financially protected. Foreign and Thai banks which committed Bt20bn (Pounds 518m) to the project have suspended loan disbursements to the consortium since March because of the row.</p>

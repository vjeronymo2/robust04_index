			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (17): Heart of the software conflict - Operating Systems Operating systems software has been at the centre of epic struggles in the computer industry for over a decade - when attention first started to shift from hardware to software. The choice of operating system continues to be one of the most contentious issues in software and is at the heart of a battle for dominance between three of the world's largest software suppliers: IBM, Microsoft and Novell. These three suppliers are responsible for developing the three most important contenders in the future operating system market: OS/2, Windows NT and Unix. Operating systems provide the link between applications software and hardware. They insulate the user's software from hardware changes and make it possible to move applications to other hardware platforms. This is why it is so important for users to choose the right operating system environment. If they choose wrongly, they could find themselves out of the mainstream and lose the advantages of a mass market. There are parallels with the earlier battle for dominance in the proprietary large systems market, from which IBM emerged as the winner. The current three-cornered conflict is complex and has its origins in the changes which began a decade ago. In the 1980s, a shift in the economies of scale to chip production led manufacturers away from proprietary hardware development to standard 'commodity' products for two different markets. They built personal computers for the small 'stand-alone' use and 'open' multi-user systems for medium-size applications. In both cases, they adopted common operating systems: Microsoft's MS/DOS for the PC and Unix for the larger multi-user systems. Standard operating systems brought advantages both to software suppliers and to customers. The spread of Unix in the technical and engineering computer market in the 1970s helped to create today's 'open' systems. And the spread of MS/DOS during the 1980s created a mass market for software products. This has brought prices down and increased competition. As hardware advanced and the demand for new applications increased, the limitations of both Unix and MS/DOS became apparent, however. The main problem is that MS/DOS could not be used to scale up applications. This gave Unix an opportunity to plug the gap. Unix had become widely available on smaller computers and threatened the dominance of MS/DOS. But although it was more advanced than MS/DOS, Unix, too, had its limitations. First, there were many different versions. The hardware manufacturers found it difficult to break their proprietary technology habits. As a result, they 'enhanced' their versions of Unix, making it difficult to move applications from one version to another. Second, Unix's background meant that it was not suited for business use. There were no access security features, the user interface was complex and its data file system was primitive. It was this, and other limitations, which led IBM and Microsoft back to the drawing board in 1987. They announced the development of OS/2, a new operating system which aimed to overcome many of the problems of MS/DOS and fight off the threat from Unix. Progress was slow, however, and Microsoft continued to develop its Windows graphical user interface (GUI) in parallel to make life easier for MS/DOS users. More important, OS/2 demanded large hardware resources and required that applications be completely re-written. Although it became possible to run MS/DOS applications under later versions of OS/2, the timing was too late. In 1989, Microsoft launched Version 3 of Windows, which quickly became one of the fastest selling software products of all time. The launch coincided with a bitter split between IBM and Microsoft, leading to the latter's withdrawal from the project. Meanwhile, application developers flocked in their thousands to build products for Windows, which was a relatively easy step forward from MS/DOS. Windows 3 brought the added advantage that it could run most existing MS/DOS applications, in addition to those developed specifically for the GUI. Many developers abandoned their OS/2 products or put them on the backburner. Windows 3 became the foundation for subsequent Microsoft operating systems: Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT which competes technically with both OS/2 and Unix, with the added advantage of backwards compatibility with Windows. Meanwhile IBM has continued to develop OS/2 and sell it to its traditional corporate customer base. And the Unix market has drawn together to agree a common specification. Last year, the responsibility for Unix development passed to network software supplier Novell when it took over Unix System Laboratories (USL) from AT&amp;T. CONTENDERS During the late 1980s, Novell plugged a gap left by Microsoft and IBM - networking software for MS/DOS personal computers. It dominates this growing market, but is itself under threat. Windows NT and OS/2 include their own networking control software, making Netware unnecessary. Novell aims to combine Unix with its Netware networking software, which has projected it into the front-line of the operating system battle. All three contenders are seen as viable winners. But a more likely result is that the battle will slowly fizzle out. New techniques for building software, such as object-oriented computing, make it less important where the underlying control software comes from and the three products seem likely to converge in the long term.</p>

Today,  referring to one of Shanghai's experiences in accelerating  reform and opening up, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said: "Great  vistas are one step ahead."    Huang Ju had just arrived in Beijing to report on the work  of  Shanghai and had long talks with Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu  Rongji. He left Beijing for Shanghai by train only yesterday  (15 Jan) morning, and immediately convened a meeting for the  Shanghai Municipal Government's senior officials. The meeting  lasted an entire day and concluded only at dusk. At noon today,  he met with this paper's responsible person and discussed  Shanghai's accomplishments of recent years and future  development with full confidence. "Vast vistas are one step  ahead" was a summation of the province's experiences as well as  the direction for future development.  <H3>  Support From the Central Authorities, Shanghai's Efforts To  Bring Credit to China </H3>   Huang Ju said that Shanghai had found good opportunities  while undergoing great changes over the past two years and  pointed out that that was an impetus to all of China as well as  the consequence of the entire country's support in urging  Shanghai on. Briefly, he generalized the situation into three  phrases: The Central Authorities' concern, support from the  entire country, and Shanghai's efforts to bring credit to China.    Huang Ju revealed that, when Deng Xiaoping came to Shanghai  early last year, he offered encouragement with the following  remarks: It is hoped that Shanghai will brave the wind and  waves in the new year, advance with steady steps, and overcome  difficulties to scale new heights. Huang Ju said that Shanghai  had exerted efforts to bring credit to China by making some  changes every year and effecting great changes within three  years. In 1993, Shanghai actually made some accomplishments.    Huang Ju said that he told the Central leading members that  Shanghai's economic changes were not unitary, but were entirely  directional. The primary change was that the economic growth  rate was sustained, healthy, and rapid [as published] and the  quality of economic operations scaled a new height.    He indicated that Shanghai's growth rate in 1992 and 1993  (with an increase of 14.8 and 14.9 percent respectively) had  doubled the growth rate of the 1980's. Particularly rapid  development was seen in tertiary industry, which accounted for  38 percent of the GNP; it was originally planned that this  industry would account for 40 or 45 percent of GNP by the year  2000, and now it seems that this could be achieved in 1994.  Tertiary industry had already made great strides.    Huang Ju stressed that, in development, Shanghai needed a  market, quality, and economic returns. He said: "A good growth  rate without a market will be ineffective; similarly, a good  rate that is not backed up by certain progress in development  does not reflect Shanghai's due status; and a satisfactory rate  that does not produce economic returns is useless." He cited  industry as an example. Last year, the output-marketing ratio  was 98.8 percent, and the national average output-marketing  ratio was between 92 and 94 percent. An output-marketing ratio  of 97 percent is universally acknowledged as a healthy ratio  throughout the world.    He indicated that Shanghai's GNP growth rate was 2  percentage  points higher than the nation's average, which was beyond one's  imagination in the past; furthermore, the growth in financial  revenues was higher than that of GNP. Last year, financial  revenues increased by 30 percent -- 15 percentage points higher  than GNP growth -- an unprecedented event in the history of  Shanghai's development. Of course, that figure should not be  too high, for it would not be normal.    Recalling the three occasions of marcoeconomic regulation  and  control in the 1980s, Huang Ju said that, during the ups and  downs at that time, the downswing was faster, had a wider scope,  and was slower to turn around. We hoped that, in the 1990's,  the downswing would be slower, would have a narrower scope, and  would be quick in turning around, so that the negative effects  of fluctuation on Shanghai would be minimized. Shanghai  achieved this in 1993 as it benefited from national  macroeconomic regulation and control.    He said that the marked increase in Shanghai's financial  revenues had its own peculiarity, which was related to the fact  that Shanghai had built several large markets over the past  three years, including the monetary, securities, and production  materials markets. If we look at the securities market for  example, we notice that the transaction volume in 1993 was 520  billion yuan. All this showed that the changes in Shanghai were  not easily achieved. It would have been impossible had it not  been for the principle of reform, the results of restructuring  in the previous five years, and the support of the state's large  markets. Such changes fall in line with the market trend.    Regarding the people's living standards, the per capita  income of Shanghai workers and staffers was 5,520 yuan in 1993,  up by 30 percent from the previous year; taking inflation into  account, the net increase was 8.2 percent. Between 1991 and  1990, prices rose 50 percent overall in Shanghai, and the wages  of workers and staffers doubled.  <H5>  Per Capita Income Exceeded 5,000 Yuan Last Year </H5>   Great changes have taken place in Shanghai's urban  construction in recent years. Huang Ju said that the man in the  street could observe this directly; some foreign businessmen  have said that things had changed after being away from the city  for three months, and some people have even exaggerated, saying  that Shanghai is changing everyday. Huang Ju said that, last  year, Shanghai pursued 46 urban construction projects, with an  investment of 14.6 million yuan, accounting for two-thirds of  the total investment in urban construction in the 1980's.  Shanghai had lagged far behind in construction in the past,  because it had not undertaken any building projects for 40  years. Central leaders visited Shanghai and said that the city  had changed. The current Shanghai Government accelerated  construction on the basis of its predecessor; it was making up  for the past and trying to avoid lagging behind once again in  order to meet the needs of the new situation.    According to Huang Ju, one of the characteristics of urban  construction is to pay attention to housing construction; 5  million square meters of floor space was completed in 1992, and  this figure reached 6 million in 1993. Hopefully, 7 million  square meters of floor space will be created this year. Should  the situation develop in this direction, by 1997 or 1998,  Shanghai will have done away with all old houses that are not  equipped with toilets and gas stoves.    Huang Ju believed that Shanghai's urban construction  embodied  many aspects of the spirit of China's socialist construction;  for example, urban construction should fall in line with the  direction of market economic restructuring. Shanghai has  primarily been pursuing installations that are urgently required  for market economic construction; for example, the Yangpu Bridge  was completed within two years, and Yanggao Road (Pudong's trunk  line) was completed in 1992, the very same year that it broke  ground. In capital construction, a strategy of focusing efforts  on completing a project was adopted to embody the advantages of  socialism, while observing international construction standards  to ensure Shanghai's level, quality, rate, and economic returns.    Huang Ju revealed that a U.S. expert had told him after a  visit to Shanghai that it was impossible to do such things in  such a short period.    He called on the building industry to focus on building  houses whenever funds were available to reduce effects on  residents and to complete the project as quickly as possible  once it broke ground. He said that, to reassure the public,  there must be a notice which includes when the project would  break ground, when it would be completed, and whom should be  contacted if problems appear. Ordinary people were to be the  ones who finally checked and accepted the houses, and prominent  individuals involved in the construction would cut the ribbon at  the opening ceremony.  <H3>  Calling on the People To Be Well-Informed and Support  Construction </H3>   Regarding key projects in urban construction, it was  required  that ordinary people "should be well-informed and show  understanding through support and participation." There were  times, however, when some departments might fail to understand  and give their support; under such circumstances, Municipal  Party Committee Secretary Wu Bangguo would speak on behalf of  the municipal party committee in support of the government's  decision.    There was a flood in 1991. It was a year of price reform,  the year that restrictions were first lifted from vegetable  prices, and it involved great difficulties. Some people  believed that the mayor was too bold in conducting price reform.  Through study, the municipal government believed it to be  feasible; however, some people at the grass-roots level were not  convinced. Again, Wu Bangguo expressed where he stood on behalf  of the municipal party committee and supported the government's  move to lift restrictions from vegetable prices. Consequently,  by the end of the year, Shanghai had smoothly tided over the  difficulties, and the market was reinvigorated.    Huang Ju had been to Japan studying modern administration.  He generalized some important experiences regarding the  administration of China advancing toward a modern metropolitan  environment. He said that Shanghai should go by the sequence of  reform, development, and stability; namely, should put reform  above all else and promote development with reform, for only  development under the mechanism of reform was effective reform.  Only stability at a new level achieved through reform and  development was genuine stability. However, regarding specific  reform measures, the sequence should be the other way round;  namely, the growth rate and the scope of reform should be  determined by the bearing capacity of stability. Otherwise, it  would amount to twice the work with half the results.  <H3>  Launching Second Round of Reform by Taking Initiative in  Shanghai's Own Hands </H3>   Huang Ju stressed that, in leading economic work, it was  necessary to seek truth from facts, adapt to local conditions,  give categorized guidance, and comply with Chinese  characteristics as well as the characteristics of the times and  Shanghai. Huang Ju once said that "to be one step ahead, it is  imperative to move one step sideways." When this statement  became known, it changed into "Huang Ju does not want  leadership." Huang Ju explained that this statement meant that,  to be one step ahead in reform, it was imperative to take one  step away from other fraternal provinces and municipalities, to  the effect that Shanghai did not have to follow the nation's  unified pattern in pursuing construction. He cited an example,  saying that the Shanghai municipal government set out the need  to do a good job of internal and external balance in accordance  with Shanghai's actual conditions. Shanghai's practice,  however, should not be presented to the entire nation, just like  Shanghai could not copy Hong Kong's way of doing things. He  said that China was too large a country, and conditions in  various places are different; China opposed rushing headlong  into mass action, breaking up in pandemonium, or requiring  unanimity in everything.    Huang Ju said that Shanghai had told the Central Committee  where it stood; specifically, under the prerequisites of  socialism, central unified leadership, and central unified  macroeconomic regulation and control, Shanghai would not hand  over a penny less than the central government required. Huang  Ju said he might as describe it as "financing reform with  self-raised funds, conducting reform by personally taking the  initiative, and taking the lead in reform."    He added that, during his most recent trip to Beijing, he  expressed the hope that, under the prerequisites of central  unified leadership, unified macroeconomic regulation and  control, and the unified market of the whole country, Shanghai  could be ensured of a market, quality, and economic returns,  while conducting the second round of reform by taking the  initiative in the city's own hand.    Happily, Huang Ju said, the Central Authorities supported  this idea, and he indicated that Shanghai presently enjoys the  best opportunities, most favorable geographical position, and  greatest support of the people since the PRC's founding.  Shanghai citizens saw this point, too. Even though they might  have some complaints about the municipal administration and  aired their grievances, they do not really harbor anger in their  hearts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NEZAVISIMOST special correspondent Yanina </F> Sokolovskaya: "Crimea Dreams of Living on Moscow Time"]    [Text] It is easy to entice a crowd, especially an underfed  one, by promises--even unrealizable and dangerous promises, if  they chart golden horizons. The crowd is responsive to the  simplest of slogans and ready to support leaders who zealously  demonstrate their closeness to the people. Such was the crowd  that voted for Zhirinovskiy. And such was the election of the  leader of the Russia bloc to the post of president of Crimea.    Supporters of N. Bagrov were not justified in their reliance  on residents of the rural localities. Nor were there grounds,  incidentally, for the flimsy hope that not enough people would  turn out for the election in the event of good weather, when  citizens would show preference to their farmstead plots over the  polling stations. Journalists sensationalized the matter: "More  than a million Crimeans have lost their minds." "People did not  vote for the election program of the current president, or even  for Yuriy Meshkov, but against the present difficult  situation"--explained Nikolay Bagrov, former candidate for  president of Crimea, who in all likelihood will also soon become  ex-chairman of the Supreme Council. During the final minutes of  the session of the Presidium of the Supreme Council he  proclaimed: "I consider it impossible to remain in the post of  chairman of the Supreme Council following the results of the  second round of voting." And then he took leave.    "I understand that a difficult life lies ahead of me, but I  am staying in the Crimea. I will leave politics for at least two  to four years. I will not run for election to any parliament.  And I will not head the opposition of the new Crimean  authority"--Nikolay Vasilyevich stated in his farewell. He  promised to dedicate the time he would now have free to working  on an encyclopedia of the Crimea.    On 4 February the session will take up discussion of his  resignation. That same day the Crimean parliament will  administer the oath of the new president of Crimea. It cannot be  ruled out that he will swear the oath on the Bible--"my  handbook." Preparation is already underway for the inauguration  (expected to be rather flamboyant) under the direction of  Meshkov's "right hand"--Viktor Mezhak, leader of the People's  Party of Crimea, belonging to the Russia bloc.    As Yu. Meshkov recently related, incidentally, he conducted  his election campaign based on "funds received from commercial  structures." And the debt will likely be a pretty sum. But the  lives of pensioners and other citizens who fought for Meshkov in  the expectation of ruble payments can hardly be expected to  change by virtue of Yuriy Aleksandrovich's election. However, as  Viktor Bobylev, member of the Presidium of the Crimean  parliament, noted, "As early as Monday they have begun demanding  pensions and wages in rubles" while dancing victory dances  outside the walls of the parliament.    If we are to believe the promises of their elected official,  ruble payments will only begin being made in the summer. But  even this seems hardly likely. Russian specialists attest that  there are not enough rubles for everyone. The entry of Belarus  alone into the ruble zone is already causing 15-30 percent  inflation. Anti-Belarus sentiment is presently building in  Moscow. In all likelihood we do not have long to wait for  anti-Crimean feelings--"No matter how tempting Crimea may be, we  have no need for indigent people." Especially since the  "indigent" will ask for 40 billion in pensions and 130 billion  in wages. Another reason Russia will not decide to annex Crimea,  according to Crimea observers, is the fact that Mr. Clinton  would get the opportunity to review the recent trilateral  agreement, whose basis comprises guarantees of the inviolability  of borders. Therefore, plans of the RDK [Crimea Republican  Movement] to lower taxes, create the Central Bank of  Crimea--"savior of the Crimean economy," open up Crimea's own  currency exchange and branches of Russian banks while shutting  down Ukrainian ones, and place purely Russian state requisitions  at plants--all this reverberates as harebrained scheming.    "The emergence of a republic bank will not rescue Crimea and  will not give it increased independence. Such an institution  will turn into an ordinary commercial bank"--is the belief of  well-known Crimean financial expert Sh. Tsivadze.    With the planned Crimean budget deficit (9.9 trillion  karbovantsy for 1994), the fist method can hardly be expected to  help the situation. Though Yuriy Aleksandrovich will not skip  any opportunity to bang his on the table. It is precisely with  this gesture that he began his first presidential press  conference, proclaiming: "Unification of Crimea is possible only  with the emergence of a certain personage. I am that  personage..."    However, the newly fledged president will not only have to  deliver oratory at demonstrations. He will be faced with quite  real problems as well: It was reported just days ago that due to  the shortage of electric power, Crimea will stop receiving water  from the Dnieper. Fuel supplies for just a few weeks remain...    But Meshkov assured his countrymen that his bloc has an  understanding with the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy, in  accordance with which Crimean electric power plants will be  converted to gas and it is planned to lay a line across the  Kerch Strait which will boost Crimea's energy capacities. This  is all well and good, but construction of the line will take  about three years. While in the opinion of specialists, Ukraine  may cut off energy deliveries to the peninsula of the 10 billion  kilowatt-hours presently being consumed.    It cannot be ruled out that the question "Who will have a  good life in Crimea?" will become a rhetorical one. Perhaps only  the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet, to whom Meshkov promised:  "The Black Sea Fleet must be a solely Russian fleet. This will  constitute one more factor of stability in Crimea." Their share  of votes in the victory of the president was fairly significant.    Also sounding victory is the Communist Party of Crimea.  Although its candidate L. Grach was unsuccessful, an opportunity  emerged on the other hand to once again unite in a great and  powerful USSR. Incidentally, political experts predict that  Communist Grach will not be the lowest ranking figure on  Meshkov's team. And it is possible that in time he will come to  replace him.    With such an array, the next step of the new Crimean  authority seems logical--in the spirit of bygone traditions, it  has drawn up fairly clearly the outlines of its enemies. Named  the first of these is Stepan Khmara, who "came in and riled up  the entire Crimean populace." Second in line are the  "West-Ukrainian nationalists who are hampering the building of  relations with Russia, explaining that 'the Russkies have eaten  up all our lard,' 'although Russia feeds many.'" Entered third  on the black list, it seems, is the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar  people. As Yuriy Meshkov clearly explained, "there will not be  two organs of representational authority in Crimea."    But Majlis leader Mustafa Jemilev stated: "No people can be  denied the right to protect themselves." And the Tatars,  organized into a fairly significant force, "will resort to acts  of civil disobedience--in the event Meshkov continues his  separatism. This will be the beginning of the end of his  presidency." At that time a declaration will be made of the  illegality of the election. For Tatars, the president will be  simply a private individual. But for the time being, in its  search for support the Majlis is specifying points of contact  with all-Ukrainian democratic organizations.    A conflict is looming, no matter how hard the new authority  tries to hide this with its American-style smiles. In the  meantime, the authority's leading figures sometimes blurt things  out. In answering a question concerning the Dniester-like  prospects of the Crimea, Viktor Mezhak noted: "It depends on  what kind of wave [as published] you have in mind--world, civil,  or local." Ivan Yermakov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council  of Crimea, believes: "If Meshkov takes sudden steps, the  situation may become exacerbated." A revision of borders means  war--the Majlis and Nikolay Bagrov have stated. While Western  observers add that half a year from now they will not risk  travelling to the Crimea. They observe that it will be difficult  now for Crimeans to escape the syndrome of civil war.    One would like to believe that alternatives are possible.  Listening to the points made by Yu. Meshkov, which change daily,  political experts are beginning to say that the president of  Crimea is attempting to refrain from radical measures so that  Kiev will not annul the election. He will most likely limit  himself to introducing Moscow time and fiscal economic measures.  In order to somehow prove himself in the role of reformer.  Isolation of the branches of power is expected with time. When  each ministry begins to chart its own policy course, ignoring  the president, the parliament will be unable to act as an  opponent to the government's decisions.    Meanwhile, pro-Ukraine oriented Crimeans are relying on the  prospect that in the event Meshkov takes sudden actions, L.  Kravchuk will just declare these to be unlawful. More than  sufficient pretext will be available for this. Some provisions  of the Crimean law on the presidency contradict articles of the  Constitution. The Majlis attests: "Manipulative irregularities  were noted during the first round of the voting. Heads of  electoral commissions stuffed ballots into the ballot boxes with  the name of the undesirable Bagrov crossed out." The Majlis also  warns: Unless L. Kravchuk changes his wait-and-see position,  sufficient forces will be found in Ukraine capable of properly  sorting things out.    In the meantime, an interesting thought is spreading around  Simferopol, to the effect of--why drift in the direction of an  insecure Russia when a rich historical relative--Turkey--is  much, much closer? Would it not be better to set up family ties  here?    At the same time, Yu. Meshkov, who still has not assumed his  presidential duties because of lack of a residence, awaits the  pleasant moment when he will be awarded a black Lincoln by  Sevastopol billionaire Sergey Shurygoy, who promised to present  this to the first president of Crimea.</p>

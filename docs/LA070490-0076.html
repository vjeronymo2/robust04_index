			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARRISON ENDS SELES' STREAK;  </P> <P> WIMBLEDON: GRAF, NAVRATILOVA, SABATINI ALSO REACH THE SEMIFINALS. PEARCE, THE  BEST PLAYER IN PROVO, UTAH, IS LENDL'S NEXT CHALLENGE.  </P> <P> On a typical British summer day, the sun played touch and go with clouds, the  temperature dipped and the wind blew, taking Monica Seles along with it.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Steffi Graf and second-seeded Martina Navratilova marched in step to  a Wimbledon final that appears more likely each day. Seles, seeded third, was  not as lucky.  </P> <P> Fifth-seeded Zina Garrison fought off one match point and ended Seles' 36-match  winning streak with an uphill, 3-6, 6-3, 9-7, victory Tuesday in the only upset  of the women's quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Seles, who managed her trademark Woody Woodpecker laugh afterward, had won six  consecutive tournaments in the year's biggest stretch of success before running  into Garrison's grass-court game.  </P> <P> Garrison, whose previous best Wimbledon result was in 1985 when she lost to  Navratilova in the semifinals, credits an improved mental outlook.  </P> <P> "I think I have a better chance this year because I'm a lot more relaxed,"  Garrison said. "I'm playing within my older self."  </P> <P> Pardon?  </P> <P> "My older self," she said. "I'm 26, yeah. (The) old person on the tour, now."  </P> <P> Not as long as Navratilova is around. At 33, Navratilova is the oldest player  on the women's tour. In her quarterfinal match against seventh-seeded Katarina  Maleeva, Navratilova won, 6-1, 6-1, in a withering 48-minute display.  </P> <P> It was Navratilova's third victory by the same score, a statistic she  appreciated, even though she isn't getting much playing time.  </P> <P> "I don't get paid by the minute," Navratilova said. "I'm not complaining."  </P> <P> Navratilova's victory was a record 97th at Wimbledon, moving her past Chris  Evert. If Navratilova is to get No. 98 in the semifinals Thursday, it must come  at the expense of fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini.  </P> <P> With Navratilova watching the match from the press seats, Sabatini needed 2  hours 22 minutes to defeat 11th-seeded Natalia Zvereva, 6-2, 2-6, 8-6.  </P> <P> Graf struggled early, then moved swiftly past 13th-seeded Jana Novotna, 7-5,  6-2, and next runs into Garrison, an unexpected foe, in the semifinals. Graf  thought she would be playing Seles.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, I was hoping to play against her really badly, so I am  a little disappointed about it, yes," Graf said.  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl was disappointed he lost the first set against Alex Antonitsch, but  quite happy to win the next three and come away with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4  victory in the fourth round.  </P> <P> The long road continues for Lendl, who plays his third match in three days  today when he meets unseeded Brad Pearce of Provo, Utah, in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Pearce, 24, a former UCLA All-American who has never won a tournament or been  ranked higher than No. 90, won his fourth-round match against Mark Woodforde,  6-4, 6-4, 6-4.  </P> <P> One of the shortest players on the tour at 5 feet 9, Pearce turned pro after  his sophomore year at UCLA when he reached the semifinals of the NCAA  tournament.  </P> <P> Ranked No. 120, he is the lowest-ranked player left. Pearce said that Provo is  not exactly a tennis hotbed, but admitted he might be the best player from the  city.  </P> <P> "It's safe to say that," Pearce said.  </P> <P> Graf's victory extended her Wimbledon record to 32-4, and one more will put her  into her 14th consecutive Grand Slam final. The only other person to do that is  Navratilova.  </P> <P> If Graf expected to be playing Seles, almost everyone who sat at Court 1  Tuesday thought the same thing, especially after Seles closed out the first set  against Garrison in 31 minutes.  </P> <P> But Garrison won the second set, the difference a single service break in the  fourth game. No one held serve until the fourth game of the third set when  Garrison took a 3-1 lead that became 4-1 when she broke Seles at love.  </P> <P> Serving for 5-1, Garrison lost at love and Seles eventually caught up at 4-4.  Then Garrison's serve was broken a third time.  </P> <P> Garrison thought she made a mental mistake when she served for 5-1.  </P> <P> "I probably said the wrong thing to myself," Garrison said. "But I felt that  she was going to come back to 4-4, and I just said to myself that I (should)  just bear down, whatever the circumstances, just give it my best."  </P> <P> The circumstances were soon dire. Seles held serve for 7-6 and was at match  point on Garrison's serve after Garrison hit a forehand into the net for 30-40.  But if Garrison had seemed tentative before, she no longer was.  </P> <P> Garrison cracked a forehand cross-court for deuce, hit the same shot for her  advantage and followed it with a forehand passing shot that dribbled off Seles'  racket.  </P> <P> One point away from winning, Seles was caught off guard.  </P> <P> Seles lost her serve at 15-40 to put Garrison up, 8-7. Then Garrison quickly  went ahead again, 40-0, and ended the match when Seles lofted a lob past the  baseline. Garrison won 11 of the last 12 points of the match.  </P> <P> Seles shook hands with Garrison at the net and walked off, leaving her  36-match, six-tournament winning streak on the court.  </P> <P> Her reaction: "Oh, gee."  </P> <P> But Seles, the 16-year-old French Open champion, could still remember how it  felt to lose a match, even if she hadn't done it since mid-March.  </P> <P> "I mean, it's OK," Seles said. "But for 10 minutes, maybe it's a little  difficult. Tomorrow it's probably better."  </P></p>

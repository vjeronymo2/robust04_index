			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Express not joining national price wars Lord Stevens, chairman of United Newspapers yesterday undertook to keep the Daily Express out of the national newspaper price wars. As he announced a 36 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 69.9m for the six months to June, against Pounds 51.3m, Lord Stevens said: 'Our policy is to maintain cover prices and enhance the value of our titles to readers.' Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, is also extremely reluctant to cut prices. This means that it is likely the national newspapers middle market will continue to avoid the uncertainty now facing both national broadsheets and the popular tabloids. United's profits benefited by about Pounds 6m from acquisitions such as Hong Kong International Trade Fair and Harmon Homes, the US real estate magazines. There was also a saving of almost Pounds 6.5m in reduced interest charges of Pounds 2.95m following last year's rights issue. Operating profit increased by 17 per cent from Pounds 61.7m to Pounds 72.1m with growth in all business areas apart from national newspapers. Overall operating margins rose from 13.8 per cent to 14.2 per cent. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the effect of acquisitions, operating profit increased by 6.5 per cent. Lord Stevens warned yesterday that the recovery was still uneven and that the first quarter's rapid growth in revenues had steadied to a more measured pace. 'Consumer purchasing remains uncertain and we still await a sustained increase in advertising volume.' Turnover rose from Pounds 447.6m to Pounds 508.1m. The pre-tax figure included exceptional profits of Pounds 390,000, against charges of Pounds 1.27m. Earnings per share were 19.1p (16.4p). The interim dividend has been increased by 3.3 per cent from 7.5p to 7.75p. The national newspaper titles - the Daily Express, Daily Star and Sunday Express - had a turnover similar to last year with a 6 per cent increase in advertising revenues counteracting lower circulation revenues. All three titles lost circulation with the Daily Express down 9 per cent, although United said it had now steadied at 1.34m and started to rise in September, and the Daily Star down 3 per cent. United is at the moment looking at possible exhibition and business magazine acquisitions in the US and the east Asia. Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson said the profits were Pounds 4m higher than expectations but he was sticking with his full year forecast of Pounds 139m, compared with Pounds 118m. The shares moved from 498p to 500p on the day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pozdnyakov in the "Embarrassment" </F> column: "Half the St. Petersburg City Assembly Has Been Elected.  `Strange People' Have Beaten Election Blocs Leaders"]    [Text] Although, according to some reports, a mere 18  percent of the electorate turned out, the second round of  elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly has taken place.  The results have shaken the major election blocs. Their  leaders -- Aleksandr Belyayev, former chairman of the St.  Petersburg City Council and Federation Council deputy  (Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg); and Viktor Kharchenko,  former chief of the Baltic Shipping Company (Working St.  Petersburg) -- failed to get into the City Assembly. Mr.  Belyayev was unexpectedly defeated in his own constituency by  Aleksandr Shchelkanov, the former first democratically elected  mayor of Leningrad who ran as an independent candidate, and Mr.  Kharchenko was left far behind by Sergey Andreyev, leader of the  For Justice movement, known for his participation in all  election campaigns in the city.    As of now, Vice Mayor Vyacheslav Shcherbakov and the mayor's  chief adviser Vatanyar Yagya, who are in opposition to City  Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, will sit in the new City Assembly. The  representative power body of Russia's second largest city will  also include the "doctors'" candidate Leonid Petrov, who swore  to introduce stable bread prices; and Valeriy Selivanov, who, in  addition to that, promised regulated prices for major  foodstuffs. None of the blocs obtained not only a majority in  the future City Assembly, but even a sufficient number of seats  to produce any influence on its activity.    It can be concluded that the St. Petersburg electors have in  their majority voted "against moneybags," which manifested  itself especially graphically in the defeat of Mr. Kharchenko  and Ilya Baskin, a well-known entrepreneur from the Democratic  Unity of St. Petersburg bloc. Observers are worried most by the  victory of obviously fringe individuals like Mr. Andreyev (who  won notoriety for forging signatures and stealing seals in all  organizations where he worked initially and then registering the  International Institute for Baltic Studies as a public  organization in which he eventually turned out to be the sole  member -- its "director"). Commentators note that the  democratic forces, after the first round of the elections,  hastened to take comfort in the defeat of the  "Zhirinovskiy-ites", communists and nationalists, and, a result,  victory went to candidates like Mr. Andreyev.    It is not known how the election blocs will behave after  their devastating surprise defeat. Possibly, by joining their  efforts, the blocs will be able to have the election results  annulled, especially given that the Mayor's Office, having ended  up with only half the City Assembly, partially reminiscent of a  chamber of curiosities, may not uphold the legitimacy of its  decisions with its previous fervor. In any event, the City  Assembly cannot start working before fall owing to a lack of a  quorum, and it is not ruled out that the election blocs leaders,  drawing a lesson from the mistakes of the first election round,  will be able to avenge themselves at least partially in the fall  race for mandates.</p>

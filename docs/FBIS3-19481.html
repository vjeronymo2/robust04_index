			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Tyll Necker, president of the  Federation of German Industry (BDI), expects the economic  development in Europe to stabilize. The revival of demand for  exports, which initially started in the United States, Asia, and  parts of Latin America, is obviously spreading to the European  countries, while domestic demand remains weak. Necker fears an  unpredictable avalanche of costs, involving billions of German  marks, associated with the introduction of nursing-care  insurance. The BDI president said at the Economic Press Club in  Munich on Wednesday evening [16 March] that he will not run for  office again: "I will be available only until the end of 1994."    Necker does not expect any short-term improvement concerning  the high unemployment, the "number one political and social  issue." The reduction of jobs in industry, which was 8 percent  in the old laender in 1993 and 45 percent in the new laender,  will continue in 1994, though not so fast. "Part-time work is  not a panacea," the BDI president said. However, it does  alleviate the overall problem. He sees an enormous opportunity  in expanding services.    "Concerning labor costs we must restrain ourselves," Necker  demanded. Otherwise, more shares in the world market will be  lost. Concerning the 1994 wage negotiations he said that "a zero  to 2-percent round is a partial correction -- but that alone  will not be enough." He criticized the current fleshing out of  the social plans as a new form of creating capital, in which  people laid off get severance pay even though they have long  since found another job.    Necker said that the compromise on nursing care insurance is  completely wrong. It is absolutely incomprehensible that there  will be no material examination of the actual need for nursing  care and that, in the future, too, those who are well off get  the same as anybody else. As the example of the Netherlands  shows, an explosion of costs is to be feared. "As soon as it  has made the rounds that one gets money for one's grandmother,  and that even tax-free, grandmother will become a case for  nursing care and it will no longer possible to finance this  insurance."</p>

Mr Sexwale  was addressing thousands of supporters at the ANC's 82nd  anniversary celebrations at Orlando Stadium in Soweto.    He said the ANC was, even at this late stage, prepared to  call on members of the IFP to dissociate themselves from their  leadership and join the ANC. "Away with violence, we say come  back (Chief Mangosuthu) Buthelezi. Don't take us to Angola,  Somalia and Ireland. You were once a member of the ANC Youth  League, so you will be more than welcome to come back. "We say  to Buthelezi that our people's blood will remain in his hands.  Stop the violence because we don't want to bury people anymore,"  Mr Sexwale said.    He went on to describe the freedom alliance as a "fascist  alliance".    Mr Sexwale said the ANC was against poverty, unemployment  and  was going to bury these by winning the April election.    "Away with the (President F W) de Klerk government. When  April 27 comes, we should all be ready to vote. That election  will be an election for victory, democracy and  self-determination. It is an election that will make Africans  take over the country," he said.    Mr Sexwale said people should go out of their way to teach  uneducated people about voting.    Meanwhile AP reports that Irish Foreign Minister Dick  Spring,  on the first official visit by an Irish minister to South  Africa, stood next to ANC Deputy President Walter Sisulu during  the singing of the African anthem, ''God Bless Africa.'' He  arrived in South Africa earlier on Saturday.</p>

The Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 103 and 104, reprinted in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M), prescribe standards for compromising and litigating property damage claims, and provide general guidance for compromising and litigating medical care claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time limitations <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Property damage claims. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Claims asserted under the Federal Claims Collection Act for damage to Government property are founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Medical care claims asserted under the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Claims asserted under the FMCRA or against an automobile liability insurer under 10 U.S.C. 1095 are also founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). Although no court has ruled on this issue, claims asserted under 10 U.S.C. 1095 against a no-fault or PIP insurer are presumably founded in a contract ``implied in law''; if so, they must be brought within six years (28 U.S.C. 2415a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Computing the statute of limitations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Normally, a medical care claim ``first accrues'' on the initial date of treatment, and a property damage claim accrues on the date that the property was damaged. However, in computing the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2416(c) excludes the period of time before a U.S. official charged with the responsibility to act in the circumstances knows or should know that there is a basis for a claim. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hunter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 645 F.Supp 758, 760 (N.D.N.Y. 1986). For example, the three year statute of limitations would not begin to run on most medical care claims paid by CHAMPUS at least until the date on which CHAMPUS received the bill from the provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Medical care claims asserted under state law. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Claims asserted against an insurer on a third party beneficiary theory or against a state workers' compensation fund must be brought within the applicable state statute of limitations which can range from one to six years. Normally, the statute of limitations would begin to run when the injury occurred, rather than the date of initial treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicable law. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Federal law does not define what constitutes a tort. Unless the RJA can properly apply the law of another jurisdiction under conflict of law rules, the RJA will apply the law of the state or country where an incident occurred in determining whether the Government has a cause of action founded in tort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Concurrent claims. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Claims for damage to Army property and claims for medical care arising from the same incident will be processed under the section applicable to each. However, efforts should be made to include all medical care and property damage claims in a single demand against a third party or insurance company. Settlement agreements will be drafted so that settlement and release of one claim shall not prejudice settlement of the remaining claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

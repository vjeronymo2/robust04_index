			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina </F> by Jose Mejia in Lusaka, Zambia -- live]    [Text] It is right now exactly 0213 hours in Lusaka,  Zambia, and I am on line with the Intercontinental Hotel, where  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina is staying. Comrade  Foreign Minister, I know you have had an intense work agenda to  cover in 24 hours since you arrived in Zambia from Zimbabwe. We  would like to know about the different activities carried out by  you and the delegation accompanying you on this visit through  five African countries, and also about the meeting you had today  with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and other prominent  figures. A good evening to you from Havana, Cuba.    [Robaina] Well, yes, Mejia. Indeed, the past 24 hours have  been extremely intense, and we will be leaving for Namibia in a  few hours. In any case, I can assure you that these have been  hours well used, to the extent that relations between the two  countries are strong and historic. However, we have not spent  our time talking and discussing, just to talk about how historic  they have been, but rather to make them even more historic, and  to make history, to the extent that we may be capable of  strengthening [these relations].    We have had extensive discussions with the Foreign Ministry,  essentially in the spheres of education and health. These areas,  in which cooperation already exists, will continue to be  explored. There is a willingness on the part of the Zambian  Government to continue and indeed increase the compensated  cooperation in these spheres. A number of new variants have also  appeared in the spheres of sports and agriculture, in which the  Zambian Government believes Cuba has achieved a good deal of  results that would also be useful to them. They have therefore  asked that these be established as important mechanisms....    [Mejia, interrupting] Yes.    [Robaina, continuing] for cooperation and exchange. From the  moment we arrived, the first hours we were here, they have  expressed their country's absolute gratitude, particularly for  the way in which Cuba, despite its limitations and difficulties,  has been able to contribute to training its physicians,  engineers, and teachers. They are truly grateful for that, and  vastly appreciative of everything Cuba has done for Africa. I  never tire of replying to statements of this sort that although  it is important for gratitude to exist, we also owe our  Cuban-ness of today, and today's Cuba, to among other things,  our African roots. And I think that the special thing today....    [Mejia] Yes.    [Robaina, continuing] has been meeting with President  Frederick Chiluba, who furthermore sends a special greeting to  our people, and has recognized in a very profound and very  serious manner the heroism of the Cuban people and the  characteristics of its principal leaders, especially Comrade  Fidel. He said he wished this continent had a lot of men like  Fidel because it certainly needs them, really needs them. But,  above all, he emphasized the way the people draw enough strength  from where there appears to be no strength, enough to resist. He  sent special greetings....    [Mejia] Yes.    [Robaina, continuing] and made public his decision to visit  Cuba on whatever date is most suitable for both the Cuban and  Zambian sides.    I think these hours have been put to very good use, and, I  repeat, one comes out of it greatly satisfied....    [Mejia] Um-hmm.    [Robaina, continuing] to again be able to greet this land,  this country, these men and women who maintain a special  relationship with Cuba.    [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister, we know that the current  government of Zambia tries to keep an active profile in foreign  policy, basically with its neighbors in the region, as is the  case with Malawi and, more recently, its mediation in contacts  between representatives of Luanda and UNITA. What news do you  have about the evolution of negotiations between the Angolan  Government and UNITA?    [Robaina] Well, this is a topic with which we are familiar  and with which we continue to keep abreast. Many of us people  continue to be, in one way or another, linked to conflicts and  negotiations of this kind.    [Mejia] Yes.    [Robaina] The information is exactly the same as that in our  country. There are some talks going on, and both the Angolan  side and the Zambian [words indistinct], site of the talks that  are being held, agree. We notice confidence and optimism that  they could evolve.    In any case, I would like, in this (?detour), not to lose  hope. We know what has always happened with the negotiations  carried out domestically by the Angolan side. Some of the  parties that are participating in this negotiating process do  not always do what has been agreed upon and committed to, and  this makes the road much more difficult.    As you know, the only thing Cuba can really do is express a  clear desire to see the negotiations progress, a clear desire to  have them progress in the best way possible -- to have everyone  do the impossible to keep Angola from returning to the positions  of a declared war. And I say an openly declared war because  although some may think that the war has ended, the war has not  ended in Angola. There is a tremendously difficult, tremendously  complex internal situation that is the result of the way this  entire process of negotiations has been obstructed. It is  getting much more difficult.    [Mejia] In conclusion, Foreign Minister Robaina, in a few  hours you leave for Windhoek. I understand that during your  visit to Namibia, and prior to concluding your African tour, you  will be meeting with President Sam Nujoma and other government  officials.    [Robaina] That is correct. We leave early tomorrow morning  for Namibia. We have many meetings scheduled in Namibia. We will  be meeting with members of the parliament, ministers, and with  President Sam Nujoma. I think we can continue to talk on the  telephone. We are happy to say that our tour ends in Namibia and  then we will be going back home.    [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister Roberto Minister, I greatly  appreciate your talking to me. I know I have robbed you of some  minutes of sleep. It is now 0220 in Lusaka, Zambia.    Listeners, as you have heard, we have been talking to  Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina who is on a tour of several African  countries.    Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister, for your statements to  Radio  Rebelde in Havana, Cuba.</p>

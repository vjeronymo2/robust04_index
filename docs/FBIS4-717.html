			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign radio stations said this morning that talks  have been planned between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and  another side. Some have been misled to say that the RPF might  meet the government. Which government? Major General Romeo  Dallaire for his part said on BBC radio that the talks will be  between soldiers at the front and troop commanders at the front.  He added that the talks are low level. Maj. Gen. Dallaire did  not say what the aim of the talks is.    There are two things which must be explained: Which people  will the RPF meet and what is the aim of the talks? We refer  here to those who may wrongly think that the talks concern a  cease-fire. Going back to the first point, who will the RPF talk  to? There are soldiers who have dissociated themselves from the  clique of killers. These soldiers, in addition to meeting the  RPF, even said they could work together with the RPF to plan how  to get rid of the clique of killers. On the other side, there  are soldiers and politicians who are part of the clique, for  example government members. They cannot all hold talks with the  RPF. The clique is the one which kills; it is the one the RPF  is fighting, and the RPF will only relax once it has saved  Rwandans from it. Therefore those who can meet the RPF and who  can work with it are the ones who have distanced themselves from  the clique.    Even the talks would not be aimed at stopping the war. The  talks would rather be aimed at removing the case for resuming  the war. The reason for resuming war is that the Presidential  Guards continue to kill innocent people, and the Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development militia continue  to bereave the country in all corners. There are people like  Rugambarara from (Bicyumbi) commune who have massacred people.  Therefore the talks would be aimed at restoring peace to the  country.    This is one of the reasons why the RPF has resumed fighting.  To restore peace in the country means annihilating the killers;  to defeat the enemies of peace means continuing the fight until  they are defeated. So, even if the talks took place, they would  not be about a cease-fire but rather to form a coalition to  fight the enemies of peace so that they are completely defeated.  That means that they would be held between the RPF and those  who have distanced themselves from the clique. We have always  said that soldiers who really believe they are Rwandan soldiers  should distance themselves from the clique of presidential  guards and work together with the RPF. Many of these soldiers  have always distanced themselves from the clique. They should  show their courage and love for the motherland by officially  declaring that they are with the RPF. Rwandans will thank them  for that.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Kymmene in FM1.5bn cash call Kymmene, Finland's second-largest forestry group, is to launch a share issue in Finland and overseas which should raise more than FM1.5bn (Dollars 319m) to reduce debt and strengthen the group's balance sheet. Kymmene, which returned to profit this year as the forestry products industry swung out of recession, will offer up to 15m shares. The move follows the breakdown in June of merger talks between Kymmene and United Paper Mills, the forestry unit of fellow Finnish company Repola, which would have created one of Europe's biggest forestry groups. 'This offering is very significant,' said Mr Harri Piehl, Kymmene's chief executive. 'It will strengthen our balance sheet and provide a firm financial base for our growth.' Kymmene's net debt to equity stands at 210 per cent. It had interest-bearing net liabilities in August of FM15.3bn. Retail and institutional investors in Finland will be offered 2.5m shares in a public offering. The overseas tranche will be divided into 4.4m shares for North America and 6.2m for elsewhere, marketed on a book-building basis. A further 1.9m shares will be available to cover over-allotments on the global issue. Merrill Lynch International of the US is lead manager for the global tranches. Pricing, to be the same for all three geographical offerings, will be fixed in December. This week, Kymmene shares have been trading around FM123 in Helsinki. Kymmene reported a FM545m pre-tax profit in the first eight months of the year, compared with a (restated) loss of FM337m in the same period in 1993, on sales of FM12.11bn. The group forecast earnings for the full year of FM1bn, compared with last year's FM256m loss.</p>

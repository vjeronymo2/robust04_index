He insisted that  it is just a technical collaboration and said that the Armed  Forces' 1994 objective is to capture the guerrillas' leaders.    Gil reiterated today that the presence of U.S. soldiers in  the Colombian Pacific area is simply due to technical  collaboration.    [Begin Gil recording] The real reason why they--not Marines,  but military engineers or a detachment of military  engineers--are here is to execute an operation of mutual  assistance. [end recording]    Gil downplayed the importance of the Americas Watch reports,  which accuse the mobile brigades of violating human rights in  certain areas of Colombia.    [Begin Gil recording] The reports that reach these  organizations have already been distorted; they have an  intention that favors criminals. [end recording]    Gil said the Army's main objective for 1994 is to reduce the  offensive capability of guerrillas and, if possible, capture the  leaders.</p>

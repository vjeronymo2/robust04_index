			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ejup Ganic, vice president of the </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, at the session of the Constituent  Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation in Sarajevo on 31  May -- live]    [Text] High house, esteemed deputies and representatives!  I thank you for the trust you have shown in me.    My vision of the federation of the Bosniak and the Croatian  peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina has always been a positive one.  For me, beside other things, the federation means the  inescapable and as rapid as possible closure of all trenches  between the forces of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The federation means the opening of all  communications for free passage of goods, people, and capital.  The federation means the return of each exiled person to his  own home. The federation means directing our armed forces and  all other antifascists forces against the Serbian fascism if a  just peace cannot be achieved through negotiations. The  federation means the reanimation of the transportation and  economic backbone, from Brcko to Neum and from Capljina to the  Usora River. The federation is the best guarantee for the  preservation of the internationally recognized borders of our  country. The establishment of the federation is the biggest  strategical defeat of the Serbian fascism. This is a Stalingrad  of the idea of Greater Serbia.    The federation means the normalization of all relations  between our country and the Republic of Croatia and their joint  international economic cooperation with a great number of  countries who are Bosnia's friends. The federation is a joint  historic interest and, let us be frank, also a marriage of  convenience. Marriages that are based on joint interests, as  experience shows us, are stable, long-lasting, serious, and  prosperous.    Gentlemen, deputies and representatives! I feel the need to  also issue a message to the part of the Serbian peoples who  stood for the Serbian fascism, that is, to the so-called  Karadzic's Serbs. My message to them is: Condemn the crimes,  return whatever is not yours, and join the federation. Learn to  respect human rights, organize your cantons to suit the norms of  the civilized world if you want to be a part of it. Do not plan  on bringing up your children on foreign soil, in foreign homes,  on foreign property. Those who base their future on seized  property do not have a future. [applause] For this reason, the  leaders of the czarist Serbian Democratic Council are, en masse,  buying villas for their children in Cyprus. Remember that any  type of fascism has always been defeated. This was my message.    Gentlemen, deputies and representatives! Wars, sorrows,  fires, occupations, [word indistinct], and horrors of all sorts  have ravaged this suffering country of Bosnia. However, Bosnia  has always survived and, as they say, defiant with dreams, it  has always resurrected more beautiful and proud than before. On  us, gathered in this hall, the resurrection of Bosnia greatly  depends.    Finally, I would say something entirely personal, with your  permission. Whenever I am entrusted with a responsible and  difficult task, I remember my deceased mother and father who  taught me to do any job thoroughly and finish it. Thank you!  [applause]</p>

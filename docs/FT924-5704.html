			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel plans sale of wire division BETHLEHEM Steel, the second biggest US steel group, has signed a letter of intent to sell most of its bar, rod and wire operations to Ispat Mexicana, a member of the Calcutta-based Ispat Group. Under the terms of the deal, Ispat will acquire the entire operations apart from the Johnstown wire mill, which Bethlehem has agreed to sell to TMB Industries of Chicago. Bethlehem said Ispat planned to follow a modernisation programme which would essentially follow Bethlehem's earlier plans, including installing a continuous caster and a rod block at the local plant to increase efficiency and production capability. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The bar, rod and wire operations bring in less than 10 per cent of Bethlehem's annual sales of roughly Dollars 4bn. Bethlehem said most of the bar, rod and wire operations were being sold as a unit to preserve as many jobs as possible.</p>

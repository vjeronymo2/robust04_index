			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Guide for banks on securitisation THE BANK of England has published guidelines for the securitisation of credit card receivables by banks. This process allows banks to bundle up a large number of credit card receivables and sell them, via the bond markets, to outside investors - a practice common in the US, writes Philip Coggan. Through securitisation, banks will be able to remove credit card receivables from their balance sheets - thereby freeing them to make other loans. A number of banks, including Barclays, have been pressing for this change. The Bank of England has been concerned to ensure that, before such loans can be taken off balance sheet, all the risks involved in the loans are removed from the banks. In particular, where goods bought via credit cards are faulty, the customer may have a claim against the card issuer; it wants banks to receive an indemnity against such liabilities, or take out insurance to cover the risk. In addition, the Bank intends to impose a limit on the amount of credit card receivables which a bank can remove from its balance sheet. The limit, which will be reviewed periodically, has been initially set at 10 per cent of a bank's capital base.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First of "several" installments of a report by Raul </F> Rodriguez on an interview with Subcommander Marcos, spokesman  for the Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN, by Television  Azteca special correspondent Francisco Rubio; place and date not  given; from the "First Thing in the Morning" newscast --  passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] In Chiapas, dialogue has been chosen over force.  However, in developing this strategy, which benefits the  country, the respect for the state of law has not been strictly  observed. Subcommander Marcos himself addressed the issue in an  exclusive interview by Francisco Rubio, special correspondent  for Television Azteca, just before leaving for the mountains to  meet with the Indian communities. He addressed the paradox  regarding the legality of the illegality of the negotiation  process, the authority of those who discussed the issues, and  the legal validity of the resulting agreements.    [Marcos] "It is a paradox. Two people who do not exist are  talking. On the one side there is a commissioner who does not  legally exist. On the other, there is a Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN] that does not legally exist either.  Furthermore, there is an intermediary who does not legally exist  either. This, legally speaking, is all science fiction."    [Constitutional law expert Ignacio Burgos] "The so-called  Marcos is an unknown individual. He is an enigma. No one knows  who he is. He says he represents the indigenous peoples of  Chiapas State, but that representation remains unproven. On the  other hand we have Camacho Solis who appointed himself the  commissioner for peace. He has not been invested with any sort  of authority because he does not represent the Mexican  president, the state, or the government."    Other specialists and experts, without contradicting the  law,  express the opposite.    [Raul Carranca y Rivas, of the National Autonomous  University  of Mexico Law School] "The government, Subcommander Marcos, and  Marcos' followers accepted this ideological confrontation, where  talks are the main element. Given these circumstances, the  process gains its legal status. What I mean is that two parties  meet by mutual accord to resolve ideological conflicts, to reach  conclusions, and to find agreements. This is an agreement in  itself, which we could call legal."    However, what can be said about the validity and binding  nature of the agreements?    [Marcos] "The agreements we can reach here are quite fragile  no matter from what angle one looks at them. The person signing  for one party does not have the authority necessary; not one  single group has authorized him to do so. The person signing  for the other party is nothing more than a ski mask with a  pseudonym."    [Carranca y Rivas] "As long as Mr. Camacho has the blessing  of the president and Marcos has the blessing of his people, they  automatically become legal agreeing parties."    According to Commissioner Camacho, federal and state  government officials will sign the agreements in San Cristobal.  Riding on that fact is the validity and the binding authority  the agreements will enjoy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 30 (XINHUA) -- China is ready to  enhance economic cooperation with German businessmen, Beijing  Mayor Li Qiyan said today while meeting with Dr. Hans-Dietrich  Winkhaus, chief executive officer of Henkel KGAA, a leading  German manufacturer of chemicals.    Li said that the German firm is welcome to invest in  Beijing,  especially since Germany is an economically developed country  and possesses advanced technological know-how.    A memorandum has just been signed between the firm and  Beijing to set up an enterprise, with an investment of eight  million U.S. dollars from the German side, to produce glue and  chemicals for civilian construction use.    As the world's leading manufacturer of chemicals, the firm's  volume of business for 1993 reached 13.4 billion U.S. dollars.  So far it has set up six joint ventures in China's Shanghai,  Guangzhou and Tianjin cities.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REJECTS REQUEST TO BLOCK INVESTIGATION OF SEXUAL 'RITES'  </P> <P> A federal judge on Monday refused to issue a court order barring Los Angeles  police and the city attorney from investigating or prosecuting a Canyon Country  couple who include sex acts in what they say are ancient religious rites.  </P> <P> Will and Mary Ellen Tracy, convicted this month on misdemeanor prostitution  charges, had sought a temporary retraining order to end what they charged was  harassment by the Los Angeles Police Department and prosecutors in the city  attorney's office.  </P> <P> A temporary restraining order would not overturn their recent conviction but  would spare the couple further harassment, Will Tracy said. The couple charged  that undercover police officers are loitering near their new headquarters in  Glendale.  </P> <P> "I believe we are under constant threat and surveillance," Mary Ellen Tracy  told U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. Tracy said her followers  were being "denied spiritual guidance" because they are intimidated by police.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sexual Rites  </P> <P> Tracy, 47, is the self-proclaimed high priestess of the Church of the Most High  Goddess and claims to have had sex with more than 2,000 men in the name of  religion. In the Tracys' church, women act as priestesses who absolve the sins  of men through sexual rites.  </P> <P> Prosecutors say the church is a sham because male followers give the  priestesses donations to take part in the rituals. The Tracys call the  donations religious sacrifices.  </P> <P> Byrne said it was unclear whether he could issue a temporary restraining order  because the Tracys have related litigation pending in state courts. Will Tracy,  51, acting as his own attorney, has argued that an undercover officer violated  the separation of church and state by pretending to be a believer in the  church.  </P> <P> Byrne did not discuss the Tracys' church in detail but said there is a  substantial question of whether the Church of the Most High Goddess is a bona  fide religion.  </P> <P> Tracy said he will take the next legal step and ask Byrne for a preliminary  injunction against police and prosecutors Oct. 16. Byrne said he is willing to  hear Tracy make further arguements on whether his court has jurisdiction over  the case.  </P> <P> The Tracys said the church's income has plummeted since their arrest, forcing  them to move to Glendale from the four-bedroom house in West Los Angeles, not  far from the Beverly Center, that served as church headquarters.  </P> <P> The Tracys are scheduled to be sentenced Friday in Los Angeles Municipal Court  but plan to ask for a mistrial.  </P></p>

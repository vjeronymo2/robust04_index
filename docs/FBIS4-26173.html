			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- State Councilor Chen  Junsheng today called on China's flood-fighting forces to be  ready for any big floods that may appear.    Presiding over a conference at the State Flood Control and  Drought Relief Headquarters, which he heads, Chen also urged  authorities to do a good job in flood relief in Guangdong and  Guangxi, where major floods have struck and may worsen.    Chen was briefed about the flood situations at the  conference  by the headquarters, the Ministries of Water Resources and  Construction and the National Meteorological Bureau.    As a result of sustained heavy rainfalls, record water  levels  have been reported on the Xijiang River in the Pearl River  Valley in south China and the Xiangjiang River in central Hunan,  causing major economic damage and loss of a few lives.    Reports from Hunan Province said that 40 counties and 5.3  million people there have been affected by floods. A total of  400,000 ha [hectares] of crops were afflicted.    Chen warned that special attention has to be paid to the  Pearl River Delta, where a fast-growing economy may suffer huge  losses should floods hit.    The conference decided to send working groups to Guangdong  and Guangxi. The groups will be composed of officials from the  Ministries of Water Resources, Construction and Civil Affairs,  and the State Economic and Trade Commission, as well as from the  headquarters of the General Staff of the People's Liberation  Army, to help coordinate local flood control efforts.</p>

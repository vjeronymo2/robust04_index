			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Uros Komlenovic: "Mobilization: Inexpensive </F> Heads of Refugees"]    [Text] In Serbia these days the constant fear that Bosnian  refugees of military age have of the long hand of the fatherland  has grown into panic. Potential fighting men are receiving draft  calls in which the Defense Ministry of the Srpska republic  reminds them that they are the descendants of the glorious  defenders of their people and their land and that it is now  their turn to do their patriotic duty. In short, to report  immediately to the military section, district, or garrison in,  say, Zajecar, Smederevo, or Belgrade to perform service in the  Army of the Srpska republic.    There is no explanation of the surprising detail that  Zajecar, Novi Pazar, and Belgrade are located in the Republic of  Serbia, but on the other hand the reverse of the draft notice  contains detailed instructions about how many sets of  undershorts, socks, undershirts, and towels the draftee should  bring with him. Fascinating advice is given that they should  report to the police or military officers IMMEDIATELY those who  hinder them from fulfilling their patriotic duty (mothers,  sisters, girl friends, wives, friends, pacifist organizations?),  but that there is no need to interrupt their trip for that  reason and lose time. It concludes with the warning in capital  letters: "In case of failure to report, police authorities will  apprehend the draftees and charges will be filed." They do not  say what police will apprehend Karadzic's recalcitrant subjects,  but it can be assumed that it would be Sokolovic's people.  Concluding that the president of Montenegro has truly earned the  right to wear Karadzic's medal, VREME's correspondent in  Podgorica, Velizar Brajovic, reports that the situation is  similar in that republic, where the Social Democratic Party  [SDP] has publicly opposed the practice of doing all this, which  is moreover being done with the knowledge and approval of the  government.  <H5>  Delivery </H5>   It is of interest that the draft notices are being  distributed in refugee camps by teams made up of officers of the  Army of Yugoslavia, people from opstina defense secretariats,  and the military police, accompanied by a warning that those who  refuse to sign will lose refugee status and will be crammed into  a military prison before they are sent across the Drina. Short  and clear, accompanied by a warning that there is an agreement  between the Army of the Srpska republic and the Army of  Yugoslavia and that answers to all questions can be found in the  Srpska republic, whose medical and social welfare agencies will  resolve any possible problems. In other words--the FRY is only  delivering, while the Srpska republic is deciding.    Nothing easier, of course, than to get to people tired of  living in refugee camps, but neither have those who have found  private refuge been forgotten. Draft notices from opstina  military sections are arriving at their addresses. If someone  makes a mistake and comes in for a conversation, the opstina  official presents him the "picture postcard" from the  fatherland, accompanied by the threats we have already  mentioned. Those receiving the draft notices are terribly  uninformed: Some people have reported to the Red Cross, but not  to the police, and there have been some who have not reported to  anyone. It is not just the "humanitarian" nature of the Red  Cross here that has been confirmed, then, but also the tradition  of reporting those around it "to the proper authorities." The  appearance of uniformed people bearing the insignia of the  Military Police of the Army of the Srpska republic in Novi Sad  suggests the conclusion that no one is taking great pains to  disguise the joint effort. Judging by its scale, that would not  have been possible anyway.  <H5>  The Law </H5>   The people manning the hot line for victims of  discrimination  say that this is a violation of international documents on human  rights and rights of refugees. The Human Rights Council of the  Center for Antiwar Efforts (which operates the hot line) took  the initiative the other day for an assessment of the  constitutionality of the republic Law on Refugees.    "Article 2 of that law, which was adopted in April 1992,  states that refugees are subject to military and labor  conscription under the same conditions as citizens of the  Republic of Serbia," says Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco, an attorney in  the Human Rights Council. "The republic Law on Refugees, then,  is contrary to the federal Law on the Army, which states that  only citizens of the FRY are subject to military conscription."    The problem, however, is that the courts here have remained  loyal to the advice of the late marshal that there is no need to  "hold to the law as a drunk man holds onto a fence," so that  refugees subject to the military obligation of the Srpska  republic who have no liking for the possibility of losing their  heads in some ravine can only heed the advice of the High  Commissariat for Refugees of the United Nations in Belgrade:  "Hide."  <H5>  Total War </H5>   A new wave of mobilization was for that matter to be  expected  after Karadzic's threat that unless the Muslims sign the peace  plan, he will wage total war. The announcement of amnesty for  deserters of the Srpska republic who put on the uniform before  10 February and news about Mladic's muffled grumbling that  recently the Serbs have not managed to move the line of the  front were reminders of the constant problem of Serbian units in  Bosnia--the shortage of "cannon fodder." The Serbs, to be sure,  still have a significant superiority in armament, but all that  military equipment is useless if there is no one to operate it.  On all the fronts in Bosnia, the Serbs are numerically weaker  than the Muslims. In Sarajevo, for example, the Army of Bosnia  and Herzegovina, on their own admission, have about 48,000 men  at their disposition, while the number of Serbs in the  surrounding hills is a fraction of that. It is not possible to  carry out the announced Serbian offensive which is supposed to  compel the Muslims to sign some document with the present  personnel, so that Karadzic has probably asked Belgrade for  help. Aware that the Army of Yugoslavia does not dare for the  present to become openly involved on the Bosnian battlefield,  Milosevic seems to have offered his protege an inexpensive and  worthwhile gift--the heads of the refugees.    No one, of course, knows the details of the agreement  between  the Army of Yugoslavia and the Army of the Srpska republic, but  it has been clear for a long time that Milosevic's and  Karadzic's territorial priorities in Bosnia differ. The  president of Serbia wants to "cleanse" the Muslim enclave on the  Drina in order to expand the security zone westward, while  Karadzic's political destiny is bound up with Sarajevo--choosing  Banjaluka as the capital of the state of the Bosnian Serbs would  drastically limit his power, and Pale is only a temporary  solution. Milosevic and Karadzic have obviously agreed to strike  from both sides.    Aside from the fronts we have mentioned, Mladic probably is  trying to reinforce his lines around Olovo (cutting the road  between Zenica and Tuzla, in which paratroopers from Nis,  according to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports, are taking  part) and Modrica (a preventive attempt to isolate Tuzla in case  the airport should be opened). Accordingly, there are places  tailor-made for getting killed. All that is needed is to find  enough people. For the present, the refugees are the first  target, and because it is certain that the number apprehended  will not be sufficient for operations on that scale (the  Bosnians move around a lot), citizens of Serbia and Montenegro  who have FRY citizenship, but the misfortune of being born west  of the Drina, may soon find themselves in danger. In Croatia,  which recently became an ally, such moves are not uncommon  anyway, and confirmation is offered by the case of Viktor  Ivancic, FERAL TRIBJUN editor, about which VREME has written.  The regimes in Belgrade and Zagreb have a common interest in  Bosnia, and so they are resorting to similar methods. Those with  a malicious tongue would say that there is an obvious  coincidence of character here as well.</p>

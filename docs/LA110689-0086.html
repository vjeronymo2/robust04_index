			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMPHITHEATERS SHOW DIP IN ATTENDANCE, BOOKINGS;  </P> <P> CONCERTS: WHILE THE SEASON WAS THE "LIGHTEST IN YEARS" FOR ORANGE COUNTY AND  THE NATION, EXPERTS EXPECT OUTDOOR ENTERTAINMENT TO REBOUND.  </P> <P> After setting records for bookings and attendance in 1988, Orange County's two  large amphitheaters found leaner pickings during the recently concluded 1989  outdoor concert season.  </P> <P> The intense annual competition between the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa  and the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Irvine finished in a dead heat in terms  of number of shows. Each venue staged 36 concerts -- a marked decline from 1988  totals of 55 shows at the Pacific and 45 at Irvine Meadows.  </P> <P> Total attendance at Irvine Meadows "approached 400,000 people," according to  Bob Geddes, the amphitheater's managing partner -- down from almost 500,000 in  1988. Attendance at the Pacific Amphitheatre was about 300,000, according to  spokeswoman Laura Gold -- down from 410,000 in 1988.  </P> <P> "There's no question that the season not only in Orange County, but nationally,  was the lightest we've seen in many, many years," Geddes said.  </P> <P> "There weren't as many tours out in general, and there weren't as many bigger  shows out," said Alex Hodges, the vice president in charge of West Coast  concert promotion for the Nederlander Organization, which runs the Pacific  Amphitheatre. "There were some real elements of a good season (at the Pacific),  but there were too many dark nights."  </P> <P> One element completely missing from the Pacific's season was heavy-metal rock.  Instead, the Pacific offered a schedule dominated by acts with roots in the  '60s and '70s. The parade of Boomer-oriented acts included Rod Stewart, Elton  John, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr, Carole King, the Jefferson Airplane  and the Doobie Brothers  </P> <P> Heavy metal, with its younger audiences, was a staple at Irvine Meadows, where  10 metal shows made up nearly a third of the theater's 31 pop music offerings  (the Irvine Meadows schedule also included five concerts by the Pacific  Symphony). Two of metal's hottest draws, Bon Jovi and Metallica, each played  three shows at Irvine Meadows.  </P> <P> The Pacific Amphitheatre is involved in a continuing lawsuit in which  neighboring homeowners claim that the amphitheater is a source of noise  pollution. Could that have led amphitheater officials to shy away from booking  earsplitting metal bands?  </P> <P> "I don't want to suggest that I'm de-emphasizing or emphasizing anything" in  concert bookings because of the noise controversy, Hodges said. The Pacific  Amphitheatre did announce one early season show by the heavy metal band Poison,  but it was canceled when the band's singer developed voice problems. Hodges  said he also made bids for some of the metal acts that wound up playing at  Irvine Meadows instead of the Pacific.  </P> <P> "I think it's incumbent upon us to have some shows that attract younger people,  and get a broad base," Hodges said. "We feel we offer diversity, but more  diversity would be great."  </P> <P> Geddes echoed the idea that diversity is a key to success. "I think Irvine is  typically perceived as the more rock 'n' roll venue," he said, but it isn't an  image that Irvine Meadows is trying to cultivate. The goal, he said, is to book  the biggest possible draws, regardless of genre. "We want to make sure we  appeal to a broad base of people. We did for a number of years go to a rather  strict diet of rock 'n' roll. Now we try to balance it."  </P> <P> After this year's drop-off, both amphitheaters are looking toward a rebound in  1990, when some major acts that took time off from touring this year return to  the road. "It's a cyclical business," Geddes said. "Next year appears to be the  antithesis of this year."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "From the Press Conference of </F> President Rugova in Prishtina" -- issued by the Democratic  League of Kosovo]    [Text] Repression throughout Kosova has been continuing  unabated during the past week, too, President Rugova said  speaking to journalists today in Prishtina. New political  trials against nine Albanians have been announced, he said,  adding that persecution against political activists was  increasing.    "Serbian authorities have been doing everything possible in  order to recolonize Kosova. Refugees from Slovenia, Croatia,  and Bosnia have been brought in Kosova to be settled  permanently," President Rugova said. As to this, President  Rugova called on the UN Commissioner for Refugees that these  people be treated as what they really are, war refugees, and not  be used for colonization of Kosova. "If this is [words  indistinct] stands otherwise we will consider that there is  [words indistinct] Kosova, which would be very tragic,"  President Rugova said.    In spite of continued violence, Kosova is present on the  international level. In this respect, President Rugova  mentioned the statement of the U.S. General Staff Chief,  Shalikashvili, who said during his visit to Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] that the  international military presence in Macedonia is a preventive for  Kosova, President Rugova said, speaking on international aspects  of the Kosova issue.    "We continuously stress that an independent and neutral  Kosova would be the best solution for both Albanians and the  others, a Kosova which would be open to both Albania and Serbia.  Having in mind the situation prevailing in Kosova, and with the  wish to prevent an escalation of violence, we demand  international protection," President Rugova concluded his  comments.    Replying to a comment on possible prospects for dialogue,  President Rugova said: "Naturally, we stand for a genuine  dialogue with a third party presence. We have made attempts to  negotiate the educational issue within the Geneva Conference,  but unfortunately negotiations failed."    The correspondent of the Belgrade-based BORBA asked for  President Rugova's comments on the rumors that Prime Minister  Bukoshi has allegedly offered resignation, to which President  Rugova replied:    "There is no conflict. The government was established three  years ago. It is normal to discuss the activity of the  government in a democratic system. We never asked for Prime  Minister Bukoshi's resignation."    [Words indistinct] from the Istanbul conference on the  Balkans, Dr. Rugova said that it was an important conference and  hoped that the final document would include real attitudes  toward Kosova.    The correspondent of the BBC asked whether there were any  plans of completing the Government of Kosova, and if so, did it  mean a replacement of those making the government presently.  President Rugova said that under the given circumstances "we  have set up a combined system, by utilizing also party  organization, such as LDK [Democratic League of Kosovo],  peasants, and parliamentary parties. We have established  medical institutions, educational, and solidarity institutions.  It is natural that the wish of the people is to have all the  institutions, but the situation has made us use combined systems  which is proving to function."    President Rugova replied to many other questions put forward  by a large number of journalists covering today's press  conference.</p>

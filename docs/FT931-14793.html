			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Polish state industries perform strongly POLAND'S state-owned industries have reacted much better than expected to the tough market-oriented policies introduced three years ago. Their performance strengthens hopes for resuming solidly-based economic growth, a World Bank study concludes. The study, which examines the experiences of 75 of the country's 8,000 state-owned companies, says 'success stories are emerging and the state sector is far from a write-off'. The paper adds that 'good and bad performers are emerging in all sectors', indicating Poland's potential to build up a 'diversified manufacturing base'. The study comes against the background of a 3.5 per cent rise in industrial sales in 1992 and a slowdown in the rate of increase in unemployment, announced yesterday by the government statistical office. Inflation also declined last year to 43 per cent, from 60.4 per cent in 1991. The rise in industrial sales reverses three years of steep decline. Evidence that state-owned as well as private enterprises are contributing to the turnaround indicates that 'recovery has a solid micro-economic foundation and will therefore be sustained', the World Bank team headed by Mr Brian Pinto said. It noted that privatisation is taking longer than originally expected and suggested that 'restructuring and clarifying managerial accountability and rewards' in the state sector should be stressed. It also recommends that privatisation decisions should be decentralised and that management buyouts and hitherto neglected schemes to reward managers who enhance the value of enterprises before privatisation should be favoured.</p>

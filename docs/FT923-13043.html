			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Marubeni buys 10% of smelter MARUBENI of Japan has bought a 10 per cent stake in Portland Aluminium Smelter from the Victoria state government of Australia, AP reports from Melbourne. Portland Smelter is majority-owned by Alcoa of Australia, a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary of Aluminum Company of America, with 45 per cent. The Victorian government retains a 25 per cent stake in the smelter following its sale of 10 per cent. China International Trust &amp; Investment Corporation (CITIC) and Australia's First National Resource Trust each own 10 per cent stakes. Marubeni will pay ADollars 171m (USDollars 127.6m) for the stake, to be used by government agency, Aluvic, to retire debt. A stamp duty charge of ADollars 9m will lift the cost to ADollars 180m. Victoria state has been hard hit by recession, being forced to sell assets including State Bank of Victoria, and a stake in its Loy Yang B power station. It is now selling the State Insurance Office.</p>

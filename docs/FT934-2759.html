			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: What to buy her with the bonus If the bonuses have been good, spoil her with a soft crushed velvet evening coat by Romeo Gigli. The label is one almost any woman with any fashion nous will cherish and the coat itself will lend warmth and glamour to a life-time of evening outings. It comes long, short or swing-style, in anthracite, coffee, ginger, pearl grey or, most stunning of all, deep claret. It iscapaciously cut so if she is small they may be rather overwhelming. Pounds 450 from Design Label, 3 Sloane St, London SW1. 071-823-2883. Most men find women's lingerie departments daunting. This is a pity for many a splendid Christmas present is lurking in them. In particular there are glamorous evening tops which fall halfway between underwear and outerwear. Provided you know the beloved's bust size they are relatively easy to choose. The classy names to look for are Natori and La Perla. They are expensive but - as mother always said - you get what you pay for. The lace (when there is some) is of high quality and they are beautifully constructed so that they can be worn without feeling either that something dire is going to slip or that one looks like an escapee from a bordello. They look effortlessly, classily glamorous. The lacey Natori top (Pounds 199 from the lingerie department of Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1), sketched here, is typical of the genre - it can be worn on its own, teamed with a skirt or trousers, or under a tuxedo or any other jacket. Another label that women like to snuggle into is Nicole Farhi. At Fenwick of 63, New Bond St, her roll-necked cotton cable-knit sweaters are, 'simply walking out of the shop'. They can be worn with leggings, crinkle-skirts, trousers. At Pounds 139 a time choose from aubergine, berry, black, navy or charcoal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The National  Federation of Public Employees Unions (FENASEP) of Guatemala  rejected today, Monday, the 70-quetzal ($12) wage increase and  the yearly bonus proposed by the government of President Ramiro  de Leon Carpio. FENASEP Secretary Felix Hernandez asserted that  his organization, which includes approximately 40,000 public  employees, cannot accept the increase offered by the economic  cabinet because it does not fulfill the people's expectations.    FENASEP does not support the strikes' being held by 180,000  public employees and has directly negotiated wage adjustments  with the government. However, Hernandez reiterated today that  they have not managed to reach any agreement with the ministers.  "We cannot accept" the increase offered by the president not  only because it does not satisfy the needs of the workers but  because merchants would take advantage of such an increase and  hike product prices by more than the increase, he stated.  Hernandez, who has been charged with being a "traitor" by his  striking union colleagues, said that this Tuesday FENASEP will  announce the measures it will take and did not reject the call  to strike if the government does not improve its offer, which  also includes a yearly bonus of 260 quetzales ($44.80).    Meanwhile, the State Workers Unitary Organization (UITE)  [Instancia Unitaria de Trabajadores del Estado] that has  semiparalyzed public administration as a pressure mechanism to  get a 40-percent wage hike, asserted that the labor strike  initiated five weeks ago will continue. The UITE and the  National Federation of State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) have also  rejected the increase, although they admit that their demand for  a 40-percent increase is negotiable.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the editor: East-West co-operation on farming beneficial Sir, In his Farmer's Viewpoint ('Exaggerated threat seen in eastern promise', November 8), David Richardson argued that British farmers need not be too concerned about the huge potential of agriculture in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He says British farmers lack the skills necessary to start operating in these countries, and the threat of competition back home is still a long way off due to cultural, capital, political and climatic problems. He is wrong on both counts. Countries like Ukraine have a clear potential to compete in world markets for leading crops like cereals and oilseeds. Yields of the most progressive farmers are already well above the UK average and farmers are exporting profitably, not only to the huge regional market but to Europe and North America as well. The answer is not to bury heads in the sand waiting for a 'serious threat 10 years from now'. The countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe should be regarded as a new opportunity for western Europe's beleaguered farmers. East/West co-operation in farm production offers significant benefits to both sides. For eastern farmers co-operation brings access to investment capital, farm business and marketing skills, knowledge about new technologies and customer contacts. To western farmers it opens up a whole new set of potentially profitable investment opportunities and access to new markets. We should stop talking about ensuring that the EU's protected markets remain closed to unfair competition and become more proactive in encouraging western farmers to take some practical steps to invest in the east.

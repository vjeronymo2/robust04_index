			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THINGS HATCHING AT SEA WORLD'S PENGUIN ENCOUNTER  </P> <P> At 10 degrees below freezing, the delivery room at Sea World is colder than  most.  </P> <P> So far this year, however, a record-breaking number of feathered couples have  become parents at the marine park's "Penguin Encounter," and recently the 45  tiny hatchlings have started to get some notice.  </P> <P> Lately, the glassed-in, 5,000-square-foot cold climate exhibit has begun to  resemble a hospital infant ward, as park visitors strain to get a glimpse of  the 14 fast-growing adelie penguins that are just beginning to venture outside  their nests.  </P> <P> But some of the the most exciting additions to the park's penguin colony are  not yet on public display. Besides 23 more adelies, two baby gentoo penguins  are being hand-raised by park keepers, the first gentoos to be born from eggs  laid in captivity at Sea World. Six baby Humboldt penguins are being  hand-raised as well, and keepers say that, by observing the young, they hope to  learn more about preserving Humboldts, the one penguin species that is  endangered.  </P> <P> "If there was a oil spill off the coast of Chile or Peru where the Humboldts  are, that could disrupt the whole species," said Joop Kuhn, supervisor of  aviculture at Sea World. "We'd need to know what to feed them, how often, how  much. But we're getting a pretty good understanding -- we'd know where to  start."  </P> <P> With more than 500 penguins, the marine park's 6-year-old exhibit is the  largest penguin colony outside of the Antarctic. As part of a project conducted  with the National Science Foundation, the park keeps detailed records on each  penguin from nine species.  </P> <P> There's a file, for example, on King Tut, the first king penguin park keepers  hand-raised from an egg that was laid in the wild. There's another on Elvis,  another king penguin named for the "king of rock 'n' roll," Kuhn said.  </P> <P> Files include personal details, he said: "Who they're paired up with, how many  offspring they've had, if they've changed mates -- for the most part, they're  monogamous, but we've seen a slight divorce rate in our enclosure."  </P> <P> Park experts know which birds have showed a knack for keeping their eggs warm,  and which birds have wandered off to let the eggs fend for themselves. They  know that a penguin lays two eggs, as they often do, as a kind of "insurance,"  Kuhn said.  </P> <P> "Most penguin species will lay two eggs  </P> <P> but rarely will they be able to raise both young. It's survival of the  fittest," he said.  </P> <P> But park keepers, eager to supplement their growing colony, have begun rescuing  the second eggs from the nests before they hatch.  </P> <P> "Mother Nature is very tough on her own. We try to sort of soften that by  artificial incubating," Kuhn said. "If we take one egg from our birds, and  leave them with one, they will put all their effort and energy there."  </P> <P> The hand-raised babies are treated to what keepers call penguin milkshakes, a  tasty mixture of herring filets, shrimp-like crustaceans, half-and-half cream,  water and vitamins that is heated to 90 degrees to resemble the regurgitated  meals their parents would feed them in the wild, Kuhn said.  </P> <P> Kuhn said the park had also hoped to hatch some chinstrap penguins this year,  which have never been hatched in captivity. Chinstrap penguins, named for the  black stripe across their necks, laid eggs for the first time at Sea World this  year. But the eggs proved infertile.  </P> <P> "The first year they try and do it," Kuhn said. "They do their best sitting on  the eggs. Hopefully, by the second year, they've figured out the copulation  thing and see if they can pull it off."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian, EC Experts Unable To Smooth </F> Over Differences on Uranium"]    [Text] According to a source at the Russian Federation  Government, during talks in Brussels, EC and Russian experts did  not manage to eliminate existing differences on nuclear fuel  exports from the Russian Federation. In particular, France  opposes the proposal that nuclear fuel be included in the list  of commodities mentioned in the framework agreement between  Russia and the EC. The French side is intent on having a  restricting quota imposed on natural and enriched uranium  exports and setting the minimum price for these commodities. At  the same time, the French do not object to Russia's exports of  uranium-enrichment services. Russia, for its part, insists that  nuclear fuel should be included in the agreement, the source  said.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: The yen returns to the stage THE Japanese yen enjoyed a remarkable rally against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday after months of almost dormant trading, writes James Blitz. The cause of the rally was growing speculation that G7 policy-makers might call for a stronger yen to try and reduce Japan's huge trade surplus vis-a-vis the US. Two specific incidents triggered the flight into the Japanese currency. The first was a Japanese newspaper report, which could not be substantiated, suggesting that the European parliament had expressed concern that the yen was undervalued against the dollar. Reports that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, would have a weekend meeting with Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, also raised speculation that the Clinton administration would like to see a stronger yen. The currency finished at Y73.42 against the D-Mark after a previous close of Y74.91. Against the dollar, it ended at Y121.35, up from a previous Y124.0; and later in New York closed at Y121.17. In Europe, sterling continued to dominate events, falling to an historic low against the Exchange Rate Index and testing the all-time low against the D-Mark of DM2.3470. For the second day running, the UK currency was the victim of a heavy sell-off in the morning, only part of which was retraced in the afternoon. At about 7.45am in London yesterday, the pound was trading at about DM2.3775. Over the following two hours its exchange rate against the D-Mark suffered a sharp fall, bottoming out at DM2.3480 at around 9.30am. The currency recovered around a pfennig over the next hour, but was again hit by the release of the January input prices data. This showed that the cost of raw materials purchased by manufacturers rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent between December and January. Sterling closed in London at DM2.3625, down 2 pfennigs on the day and 3.25 pfennigs on the week so far. In trading yesterday, the pound hit its lowest level against the dollar this year, Dollars 1.4150, before finishing at Dollars 1.4305, off nearly a cent on the day. In New York it ended trading also at Dollars 1.4305. Some said the pound's loss of value was exaggerated by the thinness of the market, although there were signs of heavy selling by institutions from the US and Middle East. Few dealers could make a firm bet on how the currency would move in the next few days. Sterling's fall was partly triggered by a perception that German rates were unlikely to come down by much at today's weekly Bundesbank intervention. 'We can expect a lowest accepted repo of 8.50 per cent at the very best,' said one dealer, recalling that last week's rate was 8.57 per cent. The duller sentiment was felt by the French franc, which closed at FFr3.3850 per D-Mark, down from FFr3.3810.</p>

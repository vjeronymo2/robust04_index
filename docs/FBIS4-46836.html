			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Socialist Demonstration Is a Useless Activity"] </F>   [Text] Mr. Melikyan, minister of Labor, has come forth with  an initiative for a radical change in personal income tax.    There are two approaches to an active income policy:  economically rich in content and politically demagogic. The  first path presupposes a rigid policy on income and a strictly  time-limited phase of financial stabilization. That is, to put  it simply, a wage freeze.    It is quite obvious that it is much easier to suppress  inflation by combining a restriction on emission with a  restriction on income. Here one must clearly see that it is a  question of restricting the wages of "laborers," and that this  measure, with its unquestionable effectiveness, is related, in  the first place, to the existence of a conscious desire to  eliminate inflation, and on the other hand, to the presence in  the government of self-confidence and a political mandate which  is the only thing that can make it possible for it to be solved  by such an extremely unpopular measure. Our government is not  attempting to do this, and it is somehow awkward to accuse it of  this, unless one has in mind a compulsion for suicide.    On the other hand, our government, and specifically the  Ministry of Labor, headed by Mr. Melikyan, is professing an  alternative approach to the income policy, that is, the struggle  for its (the income's) control so beloved by the broad masses.  The staff members of Mr. Melikyan's department are not at all  inclined toward productive activity, and have obviously done a  lot of reading of the newspaper PRAVDA, which particularly loves  to stir up not fully intelligible information on the  unprecedented gap between incomes of various groups of the  Russian population. Since the president sharply expressed to the  government his concern for the lack of reform activity, the  Ministry of Labor, trying not to lag behind other departments,  hastened to make a show of its activity. Moreover, in the most  inoffensive and at the same time purely populist form.    No real harm will come from the initiative of the Ministry  of  Labor on introducing a more "progressive" income tax. Or rather,  nothing will result from it at all, since all countrymen who are  more or less oriented to the situation know that for a long time  now no one has revealed his real income, if it exceeds a certain  level. There are innumerable, fully legal, ways of getting any  part of a personal income out from under taxation.    In a country where the entire real legal support of economic  interrelations between all the participants in economic life is  implemented exclusively by gangsters, where the state is  incapable of providing a guarantee of even one payment, Mr.  Melikyan has decided to regulate incomes. Let him submit the  plan of his socialist initiative to the Mr. Gangsters and ask  them if they will permit him to tax their indecently high  incomes more "fairly."    I do not think that Mr. Melikyan will turn to the gangsters,  since he is pursuing no specific economic goals with his  project. Just as the entire government as a whole pursues no  such goals, since it consistently portrays some sort of efforts  to reform and regulate some abstract picture of economic life,  which has no relation to reality.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> UKIAH;  </P> <P> JUDGE APPROVES LOGGING PLANS  </P> <P> A judge ruled that logging plans already approved by the Department of Forestry  are safe from the state's new spotted owl protection rules. Superior Court  Judge James Luther made the ruling in lifting a temporary order barring  Louisiana-Pacific Corp. from logging five acres of old-growth trees in the  Navarro Ridge area near Mendocino.  </P> <P> Luther said the new rules approved last month after the spotted owl was  declared a threatened species are "inapplicable to this plan or any other plan  approved prior to (the board's) decision." The judge said the state does not  need to reassess logging plans already approved for their possible impact on  spotted owls, but cutting can be limited if owl nesting sites are spotted.  State forestry officials argued that applying the new owl rules retroactively  could mean suspending 3,000 timber harvest plans covering 14 million acres of  private timberland.  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Ukraine takes step towards own currency THE Russian rouble yesterday ceased to be accepted by the Ukrainian state sector for cash transactions. Salaries are to be paid primarily in Ukrainian coupons - which have effectively become a separate currency - and all purchases from state sectors must be made through coupons or rouble savings in bank accounts. Ukrainian media announced over the weekend that as of March 1, 75 per cent of wages will be paid in coupons and the remainder will be deposited in workers' rouble bank accounts. All purchases in the state shops of less than Rbs4,000 are to be made in coupons. Larger transactions cannot be made in cash, but must be paid through bank transfers. Moreover, the wholesale sector is to switch to coupons. The measures are a reaction to Ukraine's critical shortage of roubles and are in preparation for the introduction of a fully separate Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, scheduled for this summer.</p>

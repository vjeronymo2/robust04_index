			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: American Trust net asset value off 5% The net asset value of American Trust stood at 200.5p at July 31 - a decline of some 5 per cent on the 210.3p of 12 months earlier. The trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, saw attributable revenue for the six months to end-July fall to Pounds 1.99m (Pounds 2.07m) for earnings of 2.41p (2.51p) per share, a decline which partly reflected a less favourable dollar/sterling rate. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.</p>

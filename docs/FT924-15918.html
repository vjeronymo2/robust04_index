			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Long Beach rejects foreign bid for former Cunard flagship SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping company, has lost its attempt to acquire the Queen Mary, the former Cunard flagship moored as a tourist attraction in Long Beach, California. The City of Long Beach, which bought the vessel in 1967, rejected Sea Containers' bid yesterday after deciding to seek a local operator rather than see the liner towed overseas. The California port has been seeking buyers for the 56-year-old vessel following Walt Disney's decision not to renew its lease on the site near Los Angeles. Harbour officials had been expected to sell the liner to a Hong Kong consortium before the city council suspended the bidding process. The Queen Mary has been losing Dollars 5m a year as a floating museum and hotel. Repairs needed to make the ship seaworthy have been estimated at Dollars 27m by US marine engineers and its scrap value would not cover the cost of towing her to the breakers' yard. Supporters of the Sea Containers bid said they were disappointed by the decision.</p>

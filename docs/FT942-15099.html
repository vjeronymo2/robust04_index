			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Treading a tricky tightrope / Admiration of a new clothing range Regular readers of How to Spend It will already know that I am a fan of John Smedley knitwear. So, it has to be said, are lots of other people - from Sir Terence Conran 'for me John Smedley represents everything I believe in', to Vivienne Westwood 'it's the best knitwear in the world, nothing else will do', and Paul Smith who likes 'its simplicity and quality'. The John Smedley range has made that big step from being simply articles of clothing - albeit extremely fine ones - to cult products. Along with Bass Weejun loafers, Sebago docksiders, Levi's 501s, Lewis leathers and Barbours John Smedley knitwear has become an icon of our times. Those who wear the clothes need no logos - a fan can spot a Smedley piece at 50 yards. Nothing becomes an icon without good cause - and the good cause in Smedley's case is the simplicity of the styling coupled with the high quality of the fine-gauge knitwear (Sea Island cotton in summer, botany and merino lambswool in winter). For years the company simply did underwear - archetypal shapes in the finest Sea Island cotton. As underwear increasingly became outerwear, so it became more and more visible and more kudos began to attach to the name. As there is a limit to the number of simple vests, knickers and boxer shorts that even the most lavish wardrobe requires, it seemed only sensible for John Smedley to provide its fans with a wider range. From simple underwear it expanded into what it calls the Second Skin collection - a cunning mixture of underwear shapes, slightly updated so that they fit more naturally into fashionable outerwear wardrobes, these offer bra tops (which double as bra and a decent top), cropped T-shirts that skim the top of the shoulders, shorties, ribbed vests and some sweetly old-fashioned vests (to be worn, of course, as tops) with insets of lace panels. There are also grandad shirts and fine leggings that can be worn as nightwear or underwear. Second Skin comes only in black or white and all are only in Sea Island cotton. Newest of all is an even more overtly outerwear range for the coming summer. Homing in on plenty of navy and cream, with soft nautical stripes, there are short-sleeved shirts with collars (such as the one photographed here), flared skirts, cropped tops and waistcoats. For men there are button-through oversized shirts, high V-neck cardigans and boxy waistcoats. The classic polo shirt, the one that Arena magazine described as being a vital ingredient in the 'tieless in Soho' look, has been updated with a button and loop fastening and the roll-neck has been modernised with a zip. So there you have it - John Smedley is treading that tricky tightrope of trying to be timeless and classic as well as up-to-the-minute. So far it is doing pretty well. The best places to see a good selection of John Smedley clothing are: Fenwick of New Bond Street, London W1, which has a splendid department given over entirely to John Smedley wear; Selfridges of Oxford Street, London W1; Harrods of Knightsbridge, London W1; Harvey Nichols of London W1 and good stores around the UK.</p>

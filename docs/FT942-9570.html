			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: You can take it with you - Your pension / In the second of three articles, Eric Short discusses changing jobs Question: I am being made redundant after 10 years with my company. What happens about my pension benefits in the company scheme? A. The benefits available on leaving are set out in the scheme booklet; a copy would have been given to you when you joined. You have a choice of: 1. Leaving them in the scheme. 2. Taking a transfer value and transferring to your new company scheme. 3. Taking a transfer value and investing in a personal pension or buy-out contract from a life company. Q. What benefits do I get if I leave them in the company scheme? A. You get a deferred pension payable from the normal retirement date of the scheme. The value is calculated on how long you worked for the company and your salary at the time of leaving. If your scheme provides a pension at 65 of 1/60th of earnings for each year of service, and your salary at leaving was Pounds 18,000, your deferred pension payable from age-65 would be 10/60ths of Pounds 18,000  - that is, Pounds 3,000 payable from age-65. Q. Would this pension be increased to offset inflation? A. Yes. By law, the scheme must revalue this pension each year up to retirement by the increase in the retail price index, subject to a maximum of 5 per cent a year. Some schemes, particularly those in the public service, revalue without any maximum. Once the pension becomes payable, it is treated like any other pension as set out in the scheme rules, with guaranteed increases as well as any discretionary rises to offset inflation. Q. Are there any other benefits from the company scheme? A. Yes. You can take a cash sum and a reduced pension. There would be a pension payable to your spouse - usually half the full pension. You would also be able to take the pension early if you retired before the normal age. You would also be entitled to a pension if you fell ill and were unable to continue working. Q. What is a transfer value? A. The transfer value is the cash equivalent of your deferred benefits in the company scheme at the time of calculation. It represents the value of the assets the scheme needs to hold in order to pay your pension or other benefits when they become due. Q. How is this cash equivalent calculated? A. It is done by the actuary to the scheme, in conjunction with the trustees. The actuary estimates what the pension payments and other benefits will be and how long they will be made. He also consults with the trustees on the likely increases in those payments. Then, the actuary discounts those payments at a rate of interest related to the expected investment returns on the fund. Q. How does the actuary know what the pension payments will be, how long I and my spouse will live to receive those payments, and what the future investment return on the fund will be? A. The actuary is trained to assess the most likely values for all these parameters. Besides which, the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries, the professional actuarial bodies in the UK, have laid down guidelines for calculating transfer values. Nevertheless, there is considerable scope for individual actuaries to use their professional judgment in calculating transfer values. As such, there is considerable variation in calculated transfer values for the same deferred pension because actuaries have different views on investment returns, mortality and pension increases. Q. How do I find out the amount of my transfer value? A. You simply ask your pension department for a quotation. If there are mass redundancies, it might take a while to receive it. A point to remember is that transfer values will vary in amount, down as well as up, as investment conditions change. The quotation should give a date up to which the quotation is valid. Q. If I take the transfer value, what do I do with it? A. What you cannot do is take the cash. You have to tell the trustees where you want it invested; then, they will do the transaction on your behalf. You can invest the transfer value in a protected rights personal pension or a Section 32 buy-out from a life company. The choice between the two contracts is meaningful only for very large transfer values. For the vast majority of transfers, you would invest in a personal pension. Q. How does a protected rights personal pension function? A. A personal pension operates on what is known as the money purchase principle. This means that: 1. The life company takes the amount of the transfer value, deducts its charges, and invests the balance in a fund(s) of your choice. 2. The fund accumulates in value until the time when you take the benefits. 3. You take these by using the accumulated cash to buy an annuity. Q. How much of the transfer value will the life company take in charges? A. Initially, around 5-6 per cent. Then, there will be an annual charge on the fund. This might, or might not, be specified. Q. In which funds can I invest the personal pension? A. You have a wide choice of funds - UK and overseas equities, gilts and fixed-interest, property, cash - and you can divide the value between the funds. Alternatively, you can leave it to the life company by investing in the managed fund, or, if it is a traditional life company, in the with-profits fund. Q. When can I take the benefits and in what form? A. Your transfer value is divided into two parts: the protected rights and the excess. The benefits on the protected rights element, representing the Serps contracted-out element, have to be taken at state pension age. The accumulated fund is used to buy an annuity on a uni-sex, uni-status basis, increasing by 3 per cent a year. Benefits on the excess element can be taken, wholly or in part, at any time between your 50th and 75th birthday (both dates inclusive). Up to 25 per cent of the combined value (protected rights and excess) can be taken in tax-free cash, provided it can be taken from the accumulated value of the excess. The remaining value of the excess has to be used to buy an annuity of your choice. Q. How do I decide whether to leave the benefits in the company scheme or transfer to a personal pension? A. Company schemes provide guaranteed benefits in terms of your salary at the time of leaving, with a degree of protection against inflation both up to and after retirement. If the scheme has a record of protecting benefits fully against inflation, as with the public sector schemes and those in nationalised industries (present and previous), then you should not usually transfer. The personal pension provides the chance to have your own pension arrangement, manage your own investment, and take part of the benefits at a time of your choosing. But things can go wrong, particularly with the investment, and there are the charges deducted by the life company. Q. Is there any means of comparing benefits? A. The life company will produce a transfer value analysis which indicates the overall investment return needed for the personal pension to match the company scheme benefits. You have to decide if your choice of funds, and the life company's investment performance, can better that return. But the analysis is produced by the life company actuary and is subject to as much uncertainty as the transfer value calculation. Q. What questions should I ask the salesman? A. First, ask why he is recommending a transfer and get the reasons in writing. Be sure they are sound and feasible. Second, make certain you know why the salesman thinks the life company can achieve the required investment return. If you are still comparatively young, the pension provided from the company scheme or the personal pension will be a minor part of your total pension. You can afford to take the risk in getting a higher return from a personal pension while securing the greater part of your overall pension from other, more stable sources. If you are older, though, this pension will form a much larger part of your overall income in retirement. So be wary of taking chances with it unless you are prepared to accept the consequences. Q. Do I have to decide now whether to transfer? No. You do not have to make a decision at the time of leaving employment. So, you can leave the benefits in the company scheme and transfer into a personal pension later. You have a legal right to transfer at any time up to one year before the scheme's retirement age. Many schemes will allow transfers right up to retirement. But do not transfer simply because you feel bitter against your old employer and everything connected with your previous employment. Consider transferring on financial grounds only.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Merger unleashes new powerhouse: Saudi Arabia's big oil deal The merger of Saudi Arabia's two main state-owned oil companies, Aramco and Samarec, will create an international powerhouse in the world oil industry. The deal, announced by the Saudi government on Monday, creates the world's largest integrated oil company and an important competitor for multinational energy businesses such as Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon. While Saudi Aramco has long been the world's largest oil producer, the addition of Samarec's refining and marketing interests will put a sharper focus on the kingdom's downstream ambitions, particularly overseas. The merger will make Saudi Aramco the world's third largest refining company, behind Exxon and Shell, moving up from seventh place. Joint capacity will run to 3.9m barrels per day. The Saudi merger is evidence of a trend among state-owned national oil companies to create fully integrated concerns operating in all parts of the oil business. State-owned companies from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries have played a growing role on the world stage as they have looked to channel investment into markets closer to consumers. But while they have the raw oil power to take on the majors, they often lack the financial muscle and technical expertise of the privately held multinationals. Their lack of marketing know-how has forced them, in the past, to turn to partnerships with the majors in areas such as refining, although they are well placed to compete head to head on production. Their current eagerness to secure outlets for their crude in markets close to consumers may lead them to buy into existing ventures run by the majors. Mr Peter Bogin, at the oil consulting group, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, suggests there is a growing trend towards partnerships between the state-owned companies and the oil majors such as Shell and Exxon. For example, Aramco has been involved in a joint venture with Texaco in the US for three years - the Star venture includes jointly running two oil refineries and operating a chain of petrol stations in the mid-western and south eastern states. It also has a refining venture with Ssangyong in South Korea. And Aramco still has close links with its four original American owners, Exxon, Texaco, Chevron and Mobil. In addition, Saudi Aramco has for some time been looking for a refining foothold in Japan and Europe as a way of securing outlets for its crude. It has a preliminary agreement with Nippon Oil for a feasibility study and is exploring a possible joint venture deal in Europe. Saudi Arabia has in turn opened its borders to joint-venture refineries for export. Aramco is involved with Mobil at Yanbu and Shell at Jubail. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela have led the drive to expand outside their own countries. Oman and Libya have also been extremely active. But Mr Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies is sceptical that the state-owned companies will take on the majors on their own turf. 'Will they emerge as competitors to the majors by following similar policies - I doubt it.' He points to the fact that few companies from Opec have started exploring for oil outside their own borders. 'These companies, including Aramco, are going to take a long time to build up market share outside their own countries and I don't think the majors have much to fear for some time,' he said. Saudi officials said this week that while the merger would give greater 'dynamism' to Aramco, it would not necessarily accelerate its expansion overseas. 'We will not stop being patient,' said one official in Riyadh. The integration of the two companies should, however, streamline the decision-making process, enabling the new group to respond more quickly to market opportunities. Many industry observers point to the enormous challenge facing the kingdom in combining the two large companies effectively. The complexity of the task might slow down its international ambitions in the short term. 'It is a challenging step for Saudi Arabia, but it will eventually give the joint company a clearer and more transparent strategy in its international moves,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw at Cambridge Energy. The shape of the merged company will be decided over several months by a taskforce set up yesterday and headed by Mr Ali Naimi, Saudi Aramco's executive vice president for industrial relations. One of the prime goals of the merger is to give Samarec's activities the benefit of what is generally considered to be Aramco's stronger and more experienced management. In part it is a question of management style. 'In Jeddah, with Samarec, it's a question of coffee, tea and long discussions round ornate brass tables, while in Dhahran with Aramco it's shirt-sleeves, styrofome cups and 'let's get down to business',' said one Riyadh industry observer. But the amalgamation is also expected to have a direct effect on streamlining the merged company's operations. Saudi officials suggested, for instance, that training, marketing, accounting and finance for the combined operation are all likely to be managed within the existing Aramco structure. Opec's state-owned oil operators acquired the expertise to perform on the world stage since they were nationalised in the late 1970s. But low oil prices have left some companies strapped for cash, forcing them to team up with other operators. In addition, many still want to gain access to western technology through joint ventures and partnerships.  ------------------------------------------------              TOP REFINING COMPANIES  ------------------------------------------------ EXXON                                 4.13 ROYAL DUTCH SHELL                     4.10 PDV                                   2.33 MOBIL                                 2.14 CHREVRON                              2.08 BP                                    2.07 SAUDI ARMAMCO                         1.67 PEMEX                                 1.52 TEXACO                                1.51 PETROBRAS                             1.38  ------------------------------------------------</p>

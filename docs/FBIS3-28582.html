On 7 February,  the official stated: "The atmosphere surrounding the ongoing  economic framework talks will be greatly changed depending on  whether Japan can indicate its macroeconomic policies during the  upcoming summit meeting." Thus, he expressed concern over the  situation in which the government and the ruling parties are  facing difficulties in working out plans to implement income tax  cuts.    Moreover, in view of the worsening situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the deadlocked talks between the DPRK  (North Korea) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  over the former's suspected nuclear program, the official  indicated: "At the summit meeting, measures to deal with the  former Yugoslavia and North Korea issues will be discussed in  addition to the economic framework talks."</p>

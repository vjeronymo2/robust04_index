			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Brussels nears deal on new medicines THE European Community yesterday came a step closer to establishing a central agency which would authorise new biotechnology and high technology medicines. Internal market ministers reached broad agreement on a system for authorising new pharmaceutical products in the EC. However, final agreement on a pan-European system - aimed at reducing delays and confusion caused by multiple authorisation - will have to wait, because Denmark is concerned that EC proposals may conflict with its own strict laws on drugs derived from biotechnology. The highly political question of where to site a European medicines agency has also been deferred. It will be added to a list of unresolved problems about the location of newly created EC agencies to be decided at December's Edinburgh summit. The bulk of new pharmaceuticals will still be approved at national level, but it should be possible to market a product approved in one EC country elsewhere without having to repeat the authorisation procedure. Reuter adds: Ministers broke a deadlock yesterday by agreeing how to protect cultural treasures once border controls disappear. EC officials and diplomats said internal market ministers agreed in principle on a two-pronged strategy - export certificates for treasures leaving the EC, and procedures for returning treasures that have been taken illegally from one EC country to another.</p>

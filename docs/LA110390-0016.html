			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYERS NOT GUILTY, BUT USC BAND IS  </P> <P> In response to Nancy Rothenberg (Oct. 27) concerning the three USC football  players "charged" with sexual battery, am I missing something or are these  young men not citizens of the United States, where one is presumed innocent  until proven guilty? If they are found guilty, fine, boot 'em out and use my  boot. But let's wait for the verdict. The Constitution is for all of us, not  just non-athletes.  </P> <P> CHUCK BOYER  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

He reiterated France's appreciation of His Majesty  King Husayn's wise and moderate views on many international and  regional issues.    Speaking at a news conference in Amman today, Juppe said he  came to Jordan and the region with two objectives. He said his  objectives are represented by reiterating France's commitment to  the peace initiative in the region, signed by the Palestinians  and the Israelis on 13 September, as well as by expressing  appreciation of Jordan's contribution as represented by the  signing of the Jordanian-Israeli agenda on 14 September.  Furthermore, he added, the visit is designed to stress the ties  of friendship and cooperation between the two friendly countries  in various fields.    Juppe said France is concerned about helping Jordan  reschedule its debts during the upcoming Paris Club meeting. He  said an agreement had been reached with the Jordanian officials  to review all aspects of the agreement signed between the two  countries in 1965 in order to expand it and develop it to be  more comprehensive and more effective within the framework of  the joint committee between the two countries. This, Juppe  added, will foster greater cooperation, noting the French desire  to increase cooperation within the civil service.    The French foreign minister said that during his talks with  Jordanian officials, he became aware of the difficulties facing  the Jordanian economy as a result of the siege of the Port of  al-'Aqabah. He stressed France's readiness to alleviate the  burden of the embargo on Jordan without detriment to the  objectives of the sanctions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Victor Tirado] </F>   [Text] On other occasions I have emphasized that for all  nations, whether capitalist or underdeveloped, economic problems  take priority; they are more important than purely political and  military matters, since a nation's strength or weakness depends  on the state of its economy.    I have also said that the political movements that are going  to prevail and have a broad social base are those that are  capable of finding solutions for serious economic and social  difficulties.    A response must be made to the problems of inflation,  stagnating production, unemployment, and many others. Of course  there are political and social problems, but economics is also  political, and it combines with everything; ultimately,  economics is what matters.    This is how the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]  should see Nicaragua's situation. But first the responsibilities  must be clearly established, because, let us say this straight  out, the truth is that we all have a stake in the fundamental  cause of our economic crisis.    The FSLN's real debate should now focus on analyzing where  this country is going. We need to examine, one by one, the  social conflicts that have arisen from the election results, and  so prepare to define the major lines of the economic battle for  production and productivity.    The new FSLN cannot remain outside a revolution that  emphasizes the market, competitiveness, efficiency,  productivity, and scientific and technological innovation; in  order to act in this situation, the front must prepare itself.    The FSLN needs to take part in this new reality, for  otherwise it could lose its social influence. What must be  defended now is economic reconstruction and the economic  advancement of the nation. I believe there is no other way in  sight at this time than convergence, economic collaboration, and  working with the government on those points where we can agree.  <H5>  Organizing Economic Thinking </H5>   This is the new economic thinking the FSLN should organize  to  continue integrating into a single activity the informal  sessions, and some that appear clandestine, so they will become  legal meetings.    The present economic model cannot progress in the midst of a  socioeconomic conflict that is the result of the aftermath of  war. During the last three years the military conflict has not  ended, and in the midst of all this, economic adjustment plans  are being applied that have, and can have, no populist character  because the present system that has been established here is one  of market forces and free competition. According to the  government, there is no other way to develop the nation.    However, some elements that do not warrant support in the  stabilization plan are the orthodoxy of the adjustment,  insensitivity toward unemployment, the concentration of wealth  in sectors having little interest in investing and making  sacrifices to boost production, business nepotism, and the use  of this presidential term to engage in corruption.    For example, the government alleges that privatizing  everything will solve the problem. No, it will worsen it. Any  economic system that we want to construct requires a process  during which an economic and educational level is developed  (which we do not have today; it will take a number of years,  many generations to achieve this). We must also look at the  experience of other countries so that we will not act too  hastily, and so that we can avoid making the same mistakes.    Our economic growth strategy must be based on two elements  of  maximum importance: our society is overindebted and the major  part of this debt is our external debt. This means that we do  not generate sufficient liquid resources to cover our  consumption, much less to invest. In this situation, what  strategy should we pursue? Should we consume based on our  financial potential, or continue to go deeper into debt?    This is the reason why political language should not fall  into the temptation of offering people what can never be  produced in the mid- and long-term. We cannot offer a war, we  cannot offer excellent hospitals, we cannot offer free services,  we cannot offer special privileges and perks; instead, what we  have to offer are hard work, sacrifice, and honesty.  <H5>  Clash Between New and Old </H5>   There are no universal remedies for overcoming economic  ills.  Every nation, depending on its own particular circumstances and  its level of development, must find the appropriate way to get  through its crisis.    The burden of the aftermath of the war falls on farmers and  workers. The government has been forced to devote a large part  of the budget to fighting people who have taken up arms again.  However, the government has been using this as a pretext to  design a fiscal and tax policy detrimental to production.    In its debates the FSLN should concentrate on these problems  in order to restore the model of a mixed economy, one that can  again begin to function normally. At this time, the important  thing is to solve the economic crisis; this is an urgent task  that cannot be postponed. To accomplish it, a national consensus  is needed; we need cooperation among the government, the  workers, and the business community: agreement among all social  sectors.    An enormous vacuum can be seen in the FSLN leadership. Now  we  need to decide whether the partisan structures that are being  maintained in a traditional format are appropriate or not.  Thousands of workers and campesinos are rallying around the  properties that have been acquired and that have to be paid for.  Thousands of unemployed are supporting whoever can offer the  most at this time. Departmental committees are more concerned  about the unemployed than about the workers and people who own  some land. The masses are experimenting with new social and  production systems, while the FSLN still clings to its  traditional system of leadership.    The forthcoming Extraordinary Congress needs to resolve this  situation and weigh the need to develop a new type of cadres,  people who are prepared to promote change and pursue a new  course, for this generation of Sandinists has been unable to  respond to the organization itself and even less to create a new  program for the nation's economic sector. We are trapped in  worn-out economic and political thinking. The congress needs to  address this issue. The FSLN crisis is everyone's responsibility.    The different currents within the FSLN and the debate must  be  a part of the partisan democracy that gives life to the FSLN.    Still, this should not be considered simply politics as  usual, as that would lead to the paralysis of the front; nor  should these groups be treated as suspect. We need to be open  and transparent. This is a fight between a new Sandinism and an  old Sandinism that is refusing to die.</p>

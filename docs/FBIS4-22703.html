			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with N.A. Klimenko, chief of the Main Branch of </F> the Russian Federation Central Bank for Kabardino-Balkaria, by  R. Kronik; place and date not given: "Nikolay Klimenko: The Laws  of Banks Are the Rules of the Road for Money"]    [Text] This phrase in a conversation with Nikolay  Alekseyevich Klimenko, chief of the Main Branch of the Russian  Federation Central Bank for Kabardino-Balkaria, struck me in  particular, perhaps because it presented money as something that  is both alive and significant rather than as generic inanimate  capital.    Klimenko confirmed: "To me, this is indeed so. I have been  working in finance organizations for 33 years. I was assigned to  a job here upon graduating from the Saratov Economic Institute.  I started out in the position of credit inspector at the Terskiy  Rayon Branch of the bank, gradually climbed up all the rungs of  the official ladder, and have been heading the republic branch  since 1984.    [Kronik] Has the work ever seemed dull to you? It is very  specific, after all.    [Klimenko] It never has. As it is, you can take different  views of any job. I was always attracted by personal work with  clients, even at the time of rigid restrictions imposed by all  kinds of instructions, and it is even more attractive at present.    [Kronik] You may find this offensive, but until recently we  only recalled the existence of the bank twice a month,  associating purely run-of-the-mill situations with it: "The  cashier has gone to the bank." For this reason it is still  difficult to get used to the fact that the bank has now become,  in a way, the principal figure not only in economics but also in  politics.    [Klimenko] I could not agree with you more. We did indeed  turn into a cashier's window for the payment of wages in a  socialist planned economy, acting under instructions and  directives. Certainly, reforms in the economy called for  restructuring financial structures, too. Unfortunately, many  hasty and ill-conceived steps were taken along the way. As a  result of recurring reorganizations, our bank, which previously  pooled the best cadres of specialists, was forced to start from  scratch.    [Kronik] Has your status been determined now?    [Klimenko] As you know, a two-tier system has been created  in  Russia: the Central Bank and a network of commercial banks.    Regardless of its name and structure, in all countries of  the  world there is one main bank which puts money into circulation  and withdraws it, as well as accomplishes a number of other,  highly necessary tasks. The Central Bank has been declared the  main bank of the country, and has been charged with pursuing a  uniform federal monetary policy, regulating monetary  circulation, ensuring the stability and reinforcing the  purchasing power of the ruble, and financing capital investment.  The Central Bank establishes settlement procedures for the  national economy, protects the interests of depositors, issues  the banks licenses to perform banking operations, including  those with foreign exchange, registers charters, and supervises  the conduct of operations in foreign economic activities.    The KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] National Bank, which is  a  structural subdivision of the Russian Federation Central Bank,  must also accomplish all of the aforementioned principal tasks.    [Kronik] Incidentally, what is your attitude toward being  made a member of the KBR government?    [Klimenko] I view this as an expression of the recognition  of  the role and significance of the KBR National Bank in the  development of the economy of the republic. This was a personal  initiative of KBR President V.M. Kokov, who has an excellent  idea and understanding of the operation of the banking system  and wishes to take advantage of our closer cooperation to meet  the needs of the KBR as much as possible.    To be sure, participation in the work of the government  takes  extra time, but at the same time, interaction with the organs of  state power makes it possible to resolve pressing issues jointly  and more promptly.    [Kronik] Nikolay Alekseyevich, the views of the second tier,  the commercial banks, are most contradictory.    [Klimenko] A market economy without commercial banks is  impossible. Please recall that under the old system money was  squandered right and left; it was frequently invested in  patently unprofitable projects. Of course, no commercial  operator who wants to survive would do this.    [Kronik] How many commercial banks operate in the republic?    [Klimenko] Eleven independent banks and four branches,  including the Kabardino-Balkar Regional Branch of the  Rosselkhozbank, with five offices in the rayons, and the  Joint-Stock Commercial Savings Bank with a chain of branches.    [Kronik] Is this a little or a lot?    [Klimenko] I think that this is a sufficiently extensive  network which is in a position to perform the entire complex of  banking operations in the republic. The establishment of new  subdivisions has now been suspended, although we do have 10  petitions; this is primarily associated with higher requirements  for the newly established banks.    [Kronik] Does the operation of commercial banks produce real  returns?    [Klimenko] The independent commercial banks operated in a  stable manner and turned a profit last year. Proceeding from the  requirements of the Russian Federation Central Bank, they  increased their statutory capital to 100 million rubles [R] or  more. As a result, even under the conditions of inflation, the  banks were able to considerably raise, out of their proceeds,  the level of interest rates on funds attracted from the  population and be worthy competitors for the institutions of the  Savings Bank.    [Kronik] Is their role in investment in the national economy  of the republic perceptible?    [Klimenko] The KBR National Bank still plays a leading role  in controlling funds from the budget which are earmarked as  capital investment. In 1993 their volume came to R19 billion.    The volume of credit outlays of commercial banks for the  economy of the republic grew by a factor of 5.8 last year.  However, centralized resources allocated by the Bank of Russia  account for one-half in the process, and in some commercial  banks--for 70 percent. These resources are provided primarily  for the extension of loans to enterprises and organizations of  the preferred sectors of the national economy of the KBR, in  coordination with the Cabinet of Ministers.    Last year, the increment of centralized credit resources in  our republic came to 335.4 percent. It was higher than in the  Russian Federation on the whole, and the highest in the North  Caucasus region. The credit support provided by the state  facilitated a degree of stabilization in production in the KBR.    However, it is of course necessary for the commercial banks  to attract the spare funds of enterprises as deposits in order  to operate in a more stable manner. The banks themselves make a  poor effort, while economic units are reluctant to give up their  spare funds, preferring to use such funds for their own needs in  the environment of continuously high inflation. As a result, the  commercial banks use in their transactions the temporarily spare  funds of economic units in settlement and current accounts, thus  exposing to risk not only themselves but also their clients.    [Kronik] You have mentioned that the National Bank has the  right to monitor the operation of the commercial banks.    [Klimenko] The monitoring of the authenticity of accounting  and statistical reporting and compliance with economic norms is  entrusted to us. In July of last year we established the  inspections department. In the time since, two commercial banks  and three branches have been audited. It came out that the  monitoring of compliance with cash discipline by enterprises and  organizations and the proper use of monies from the consumption  fund is lax. The conditions and the principle of credit  extension are violated. At times the resources issued are not  used as earmarked, which brings about late repayment or the  impossibility of recovering them, and ultimately creates losses  to the banks themselves, as was the case with the branch of the  Eurasia commercial bank. Violations were revealed in the conduct  of accounting and operational work and the drawing up of  monetary settlement documents.    [Kronik] Can you take any enforcement measures?    [Klimenko] Directives and warnings on the use of sanctions  are forwarded based on the results of audits. The sanctions are  substantial: If economic norms are not complied with, or  operations that run counter to the law are conducted, we are  entitled to raise with the founders the issue of taking measures  to ameliorate the bank's financial situation, replacing its  manager, or even reorganizing and liquidating it.    However, the legislation in effect does not envision control  over the operation of branches whose banking headquarters are  located outside of the republic. In general, this legislation  does not precisely specify the rights of banking commercial  structures. So it turns out that everything that is not banned  is allowed.    Meanwhile, laws on banks are the rules of the road for  money.  Such laws may be good or bad, but they should definitely be the  same for all. Otherwise, nothing will be in order in the  country; there will be chaos.    [Kronik] There is a reason they say "as safe as in a Swiss  bank" when they want to stress the reliability of the  safekeeping of valuables....    [Klimenko] Certainly, the reputation of a bank means a lot;  it is built over centuries, not even decades. Please recall that  in prerevolutionary Russia even the bank buildings themselves  were imposing and respectable, underscoring how serious and  significant the operations performed inside them were.    [Kronik] In this reference, we would like to know how the  notorious case in which a number of commercial banks of the KBR  credited false transfers in April and May 1992 ended.    [Klimenko] At the time a wave of crediting sums under forged  transfers swept over Russia. Despite a warning from the Central  Bank, no due attention and vigilance was shown here, which  brought about forged transfers being credited to the accounts of  commercial structures from Nalchik, Nartkala, and Baksan  totaling R1,387,009,000 (the Nalchik commercial bank, a branch  of the Rosselkhozbank, the Chegem, and the Savings Bank).    A large proportion of such forged transfers was intercepted  through the joint efforts of the KBR National Bank and the  commercial banks of the republic. The remainder, approximately  R300 million, still has not been recovered. The KBR law  enforcement organs have instituted criminal proceedings based on  all of these cases.    [Kronik] What does the KBR National Bank do to protect  banking documents?    [Klimenko] We have implemented a system of up-to-date  technical protection features for payments; we are using the  method of data coding. A new system for transporting banking  documentation within the KBR has been organized. Methods for the  exchange of information between banks have been modified. We  should note in particular that all work, even top secret work,  is done by specific employees whom they tried and are still  trying to bribe and whom they threaten with physical harm. In  order to avoid unpleasant facts, personal chains for mutual and  repeated control over the processing of banking documents have  been established at all Clearing Centers. If a forgery gets  through at one stage, it will certainly be detected at others.  Of course, special attention is being paid to the selection of  cadres, their reliability and integrity.    [Kronik] What measures have you taken to speed up  settlements  in the national economy?    [Klimenko] Our answer to this question should be divided  into  two parts. They are settlements within the KBR and settlements  effected with other regions of the Russian Federation.    Since the middle of last year our Clearing Centers have been  effecting settlements between the banks of the city and in the  rayons within the same day, with funds being credited to the  accounts of clients on the following day. The introduction of a  new method for the exchange of information on magnetic media  (computer diskettes) and the extensive use of technical assets  facilitated this procedure.    Intrarepublic settlements with all rayons of the KBR are  effected on the second or third business day, with funds being  credited to the accounts of clients on the third or fourth  business day. We have rejected postal services and deliver all  correspondence there ourselves. Incidentally, such deadlines for  effecting settlements are in line with commonly accepted foreign  norms.    [Kronik] And outside of the republic?    [Klimenko] With a view to speeding up the movement of  banking  documents outside the KBR, solely the state courier service has  been used since July 1992. The service delivers documents within  two to five business days to all oblast and kray seats of  Russia, with their protection guaranteed.    Standard deadlines for cable and postal transfers have also  been established. However, numerous instances of forged  transfers, so-called "Chechen advice notes," being sent have  unfortunately forced the Central Bank of the Russian Federation  to establish special control over settlements effected, for the  most part, in the region of the North Caucasus, where  Kabardino-Balkaria is. This considerably delays the crediting of  funds outside the KBR.    However, practice indicates that such control is not at all  in vain. In the last 1.5 years alone the employees of our bank  and the Clearing Centers have prevented the theft of R10.307  billion, as well as detected forged advice notes ostensibly  generated at the KBR National Bank for R52.067 billion.    [Kronik] When will regular procedures for settlements of the  KBR at the interregional level be restored?    [Klimenko] This depends on the effectiveness of the efforts  of law enforcement organs to put an end to forced transfers and,  most importantly, on the speed of the introduction of a more  reliable transmittal of banking information. Thus, the plan is  to introduce the Bankir satellite communication system which  should ensure interbank settlements in the territory of Russia  on the same day before the end of 1994. A special-purpose  program for information services developed by the Central Bank  of the Russian Federation is also being implemented. It is based  on a system of electronic payments which makes it possible to  exchange banking information without paper documents, through  communication channels, with the necessary protective features.    [Kronik] At the moment the banking system is frequently  blamed for the existing, most complex situation involving mutual  nonpayments.    [Klimenko] This criticism is not leveled at the culprits.  The  liberalization of prices, the severance of economic relations,  the introduction of prepayments for goods and services, and a  multitude of other objective and subjective causes have brought  about an "eating away" of the internal working capital of most  enterprises and organizations. All of these have caused mutual  nonpayments to snowball; in the KBR, mutual nonpayments exceeded  R100 billion.    Last year, the repayment of loans to the banks deteriorated.  The defaulted debt increased sharply. A particularly difficult  situation developed in the agro-industrial complex.    The KBR Cabinet of Ministers resolved to conduct the  offsetting of mutual claims in order to reduce the mutual  indebtedness of economic units. However, it is necessary for the  Government of the Russian Federation to allocate funds for  conducting an offset throughout the territory of Russia because  the enterprises of our republic also engage in settlements  outside of its territory. If this is not done, the chain of  nonpayments will in all likelihood reach commercial banks, which  may drive them to the brink of bankruptcy.    [Kronik] Residents of our republic are traveling abroad more  and more often. For this reason, the foreign exchange policy is  of special interest. Have there been any changes in the new year?    [Klimenko] Without infringing on the freedom of commercial  banks, the KBR National Bank monitors compliance with  legislative and regulatory acts concerning foreign exchange  operations. In January of this year new procedures were  introduced for currency control over the receipt in the Russian  Federation of foreign exchange proceeds from the exports of  goods. All exporters now must draw up transaction profiles for  contracts at authorized banks prior to the shipment of the  freight abroad, and submit the profiles to the Customs  Committee. Previously an exporter could leave foreign exchange  proceeds at a foreign bank, whereas the new procedure which  provides for three layers of control will make it possible to  rule out the outflow of capital abroad.    [Kronik] Where can foreign exchange be purchased and sold  locally?    [Klimenko] Seven authorized commercial banks in the republic  hold licenses to conduct foreign exchange operations issued by  the Russian Federation Central Bank: Nalchik, Bum-Bank,  Prokhladnyy, Nart, Oshkhamakho, Namys, and Kavkaz-Inkombank,  along with two branches: of the Rosselkhozbank and the Savings  Bank commercial bank.    Settlements in foreign exchange cash have been banned on the  territory of Russia since January. Nonetheless, the demand of  the population for foreign exchange is growing, and the reserves  are being replenished in a timely manner.    [Kronik] A majority of the population is concerned about  regular rubles, after all. Will we receive them in a timely  manner?    [Klimenko] Unlike the year 1992, when a cash shortage was  felt, the KBR National Bank and its Clearing Centers met the  needs of the national economy of the republic for currency fully  and without delays last year, including coins whose total weight  came to about 108 tonnes, or almost two railway carloads.  Therefore, all talk of the bank not issuing money is a result of  a lack of funds in the settlement accounts of enterprises and  organizations.    [Kronik] However, are you not concerned with safekeeping  this  cash?    [Klimenko] A reliable security and alarm system exists to  this end. At any rate, there have been no emergencies so far.</p>

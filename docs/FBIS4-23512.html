			<p>BFN     [Text] General Jose Pedro, commander of the Cabinda  Military Region, has accused the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Front for the Liberation  of the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] of jointly having murdered five  civilians in the Micuma area -- two men, two women, and a child.    [Begin recording] [Pedro] A few days ago we were working to  establish the connection between Bucu-Zau and Belize, since the  bridge over (Bungozimunu) River had been destroyed. We were  reconstructing the bridge to permit the free movement of people  and goods between the two districts, as well as with the city.  Considering previous UNITA and FLEC activities, it is not  surprising that two days ago they again discharged their fury on  civilians, killing five people including a year-old child.    [Unidentified correspondent] Where did this happen?    [Pedro] In the Micuma Primeiro village.    [Correspondent] It has been reported that UNITA forces are  entering the Viede settlement near the border with Zaire,  heading toward Necuto, which is described as Front for the  Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda  [FLEC-FAC] headquarters. Do you have anything to say about the  issue?    [Pedro] It is no news that they are entering Viede. As you  know, UNITA's main bases are in the Zairian territory, and it is  from there that it carries out attacks in Cabinda Province. It  is only possible for UNITA to carry out operations in that area  with a major cooperation of the FLEC-FAC, since without the  cooperation of FLEC-FAC it is impossible for them to operate  there.    [Correspondent] Has the Military Front Command taken  measures  in view of this?    [Pedro] Yes, we are taking measures, and you will be  informed  of them. [end recording]</p>

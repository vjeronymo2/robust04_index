While such a material is on board the vessel, smoking is prohibited in spaces adjacent to the cargo hold and on the vessel's deck in the vicinity of cargo hatches, ventilator outlets and other accesses to the hold containing the material. ``NO SMOKING'' signs must be displayed in conspicuous locations in the areas where smoking is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;148.410 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fire hoses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A fire hose, supplied with fresh water from a shore supply source, must be available at each hatch through which a material that is listed in table 148.10 of this part with a reference to this section is being loaded. When the material is being transferred between vessels, the hoses may be supplied with salt water if no fresh water is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;148.415 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Toxic gas analyzers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When transporting a material that is listed in table 148.10 of this part with a reference to a paragraph of this section, a gas analyzer appropriate for the toxic gas listed in that paragraph must be on board the vessel, except for unmanned barges. At least two members of the crew must be knowledgeable in the use of the equipment, which must be maintained in a condition ready for use. The atmosphere in the cargo hold and adjacent spaces must be tested before a person is allowed to enter these spaces. If toxic gases are detected, the space must be ventilated and retested prior to entry. The toxic gases for which the requirements of this section must be met when a paragraph of this section is referenced in table 148.10 of this part are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Arsine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Carbon monoxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Hydrogen cyanide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Hydrogen sulfide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Phosphine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Sulfur dioxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;148.420 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Flammable gas analyzers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When transporting a material listed in table 148.10 of this part with a reference to a paragraph of this section, a gas analyzer appropriate for the flammable gas listed in that paragraph must be on board the vessel, except for unmanned barges. At least two members of the crew must be knowledgeable in the use of the equipment, which must be maintained in a condition ready for use and capable of measuring 0&hyph;100% LFL for the gas indicated. The atmosphere in the cargo hold must be tested before any person is allowed to enter. If flammable gases are detected, the space must be ventilated and retested prior to entry. The flammable gases for which the requirements of this section must be met when a paragraph of this section is referenced in table 148.10 of this part are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Carbon monoxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Hydrogen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Methane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;148.425 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Oxygen analyzers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When transporting material that is listed in table 148.10 of this part with a reference to this section, equipment capable of measuring atmospheric oxygen must be carried on board the vessel, except for unmanned barges.

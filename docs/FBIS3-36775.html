This  will make it possible to earn money for conversion and preserve  highly qualified staff of the domestic (military) industry",  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in an address to  readers published in the first issue of a new journal, "The  Military Parade", which was presented at a news conference here  Tuesday.    The new edition, which is available both in Russian and  English, is aimed at providing Russian and foreign readers with  updated information about the Russian defence complex  development, new sample weapons and military equipment.    The first issue specifically describes the new combat  helicopter KA-50 "Black Shark", 152-mm self-propelled howitzer  "MSTA-S", the air defence system "Arrow-10MZ", the state-of-art  aircraft complexes, and the modern submarine "Piranha".    "This is the first step towards the implementation of the  large-scale program to support defence industries in Russia and  extend the export of Russian weapons and technologies of binary  usage", the news conference participants said.    The journal has been founded by the League of Defence  Industries, the association of investors in the Russian defence  complex conversion, and the U.S. company "Zigzag Venture Group".    Authors will include Russian top military officials,  developers and producers of weapons and military materiel,  scholars, experts and all those whose activities are related to  this field.

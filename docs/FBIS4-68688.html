			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Petr Aksenov, prefect of Moscow's </F> Southwestern District, by unidentified KURANTY correspondent;  place and date not given: "What Gives the Authorities a  Headache"]    [Text] Petr Nikolayevich Aksenov was born in 1946 in  Lipetsk Oblast. Upon graduating from school he went to work in  construction. Worker; foreman; supervisor; construction  administration chief; trust director; chairman of the Sovetskiy  Rayon Executive Committee; first deputy prefect of the  Southwestern district; and, finally, prefect--this is his  resume. Married. Two children.    [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, your first 200 days on the job  are behind you now. How was it?    [Aksenov] I am not new to the prefecture; I know the  specifics of the district, the existing problems, the  "bottlenecks" in the work of district services and units. The  task is to strengthen the work of local administration, and  first of all of its lower tier--municipal district  administrations headed by subprefects. Because they are the ones  carrying the main burden of working with the population,  resolving the daily problems of life support for the territory.  Therefore I have set a goal for myself: Give subprefects the  opportunity to demonstrate their abilities most fully. Not guide  them by the hand, not tell them what to do in municipal  districts and how, but give them the freedom to show initiative,  to experiment, at the same time not forgetting that we are at  the service of district citizens who will be the main judges of  the local authorities' work.    What concerns district residents? Warm homes and clean  streets, and the ability to buy everything they need. The  prefecture staff must do everything possible--and sometimes  impossible--to make it so.    How do we arrange for the timely removal of household trash;  how to perform quality road repairs; how to provide heat for  residential buildings? These should be our "headaches," not the  residents'.    [KURANTY] When you agreed to become a prefect, did you have  a  maximum and minimum program?    [Aksenov] Of course. Let us start with the maximum program.  First, we have an ambitious plan to change the situation with  respect to road repairs. The Southwestern district is the only  one that does not have its own asphalt- and concrete-making  plant. We have allocated a site for its construction. The money  the city appropriates for capital repairs and maintenance of  roads clearly is not enough. At the same time the volume of work  is growing. Which means that we have to attract nonbudget means,  organizations-investors.    The second acute issue is trash. The state of the services  responsible for cleaning and trash removal is such that much  effort has to be devoted to strengthening their material and  technical base and selection of cadres. In addition, in order to  put an end to monopolism and create competition to already  existing road-maintenance organizations, we have organized two  new alternative services. We are bringing various commercial  organizations into the business of keeping order in the district  on a large scale.    Although the state of cleaning and trash removal on the  territory of the district is far from ideal, the situation has  improved to a considerable extent.    [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, does your maximum program  include solving the housing problem?    [Aksenov] Of course. First, housing in the district varies  greatly. We have five-story buildings--in the famous  Cheremushki, Kotlovka, and Zyuzino municipal districts; we have  areas with standard prefabricated panel nine-story buildings--in  the Gagarinskiy and Konkovo municipal districts; and we have  modern high-rise buildings in Yasenevo, Tyoplyy Stan, and  Butovo. Therefore, along with new construction we will devote  much effort to reconstruction of old quarters, increasing the  density of existing housing. The concept of socioeconomic and  city planning development of the Southwestern district, approved  by the Government of Moscow, envisages a large program of  housing reconstruction, and not at the expense of the city  budget but through investor financing.    Despite active construction and reconstruction, however, the  housing problem in the district remains quite acute. In the end  of 1993, 26,810 families were on the waiting list for  improvement of housing conditions.    So we do have a lot of work to do in this direction. We have  outlined the following ways of solving this problem.    First, we will increase control over which housing is being  vacated; for this purpose we will first and foremost arrange for  a mechanism to receive timely information from housing  utilization offices about vacated rooms and apartments.    Second, we will take the necessary steps to implement the  mayor of Moscow's order regarding stricter controls over the use  of privatized housing, preventing the use of privatized  apartments and rooms for purposes other than intended. Such  things do occur--this housing is being used as office space for  various commercial organizations, and as illegal hotels and  dormitories.    Third, we will work more actively with the courts, since we  disagree with the practice that has become widespread  lately--families that are not in acute need of housing  improvement get extra rooms as the latter become vacated in  their communal apartments.    [KURANTY] One of the main problems of concern to everyone is  trade. A lot of hopes were pinned on the privatization of trade  enterprises; however, such phenomena as cheating customers and  rudeness persist in privatized stores anyway. How do you feel  about this?    [Aksenov] You can look at this problem from different  angles.  From the standpoint of market saturation with goods,  privatization has done a lot, of course, and we all can feel it  today. The old distributive system does not exist anymore. You  can buy anything today. There is a great selection of goods in  the stores. As to rudeness--what can one say? This is a question  of a person's culture.    [KURANTY] Can the authorities help; who should the offended  customer turn to?    [Aksenov] He can turn to the prefecture's consumer market  administration, or to the relevant department in the  administration of the municipal district on whose territory some  or other point of sale is located. Depending on the nature of  the complaint, the local administration will take necessary  steps--either through its administrative or trade inspectorate,  or though the organs of sanitary-epidemiologic oversight. I  would like to emphasize that in the new economic conditions  local authorities still have real levers to enforce trade  enterprises' unconditional compliance with established rules and  norms.    The analysis of complaints and petitions we receive shows  that the greatest number of them are about street-stand and  kiosk trade. We have put together a program for getting small  retail trade in order on the territory of the district.    About 250 kiosks already have been removed from the  district's territory. They were kiosks that had either been  illegally set up or did not have licenses or cash registers, did  not meet merchandise assortment requirements, did not maintain  the adjacent territory in proper order, and so on. In addition,  we have tightened the procedures for issuing permits to conduct  trading from stands, vehicles, and small retail outlets.    We do not have such complaints with respect to large trade  establishments--such as "Moscow," "Leipzig," or "Bucharest" (we  have about 40 such stores).    [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, which line of prefecture work  do  you consider most important?    [Aksenov] Absolutely everything is important--construction,  repairs, improvements, trade, transportation, social security,  and many other things. Only a comprehensive solution to all  these issues will allow us to carry out the task that is the  responsibility of the bodies of local authority--ensuring normal  living on the district territory and satisfying the needs and  demands of the population.</p>

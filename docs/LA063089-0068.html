			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROTHER OF MOB BOSS IS JAILED IN HEROIN CASE  </P> <P> Reputed mobster and convicted heroin trafficker Gene Gotti went to jail  Thursday, seven years after he was arrested on charges of running a major  heroin operation.  </P> <P> With eight minutes to spare before a 10 a.m. deadline set by a judge, Gotti and  co-defendant John Carneglia -- both wearing nylon jogging suits and sneakers --  stepped out of a maroon Lincoln and swaggered into the federal courthouse in  Brooklyn, where they surrendered to U.S. marshals.  </P> <P> "Afraid we weren't going to show up?" Gotti, the brother of reputed Gambino  crime family boss John Gotti, joked to his lawyer.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge John R. Bartels on Wednesday revoked their $1-million bail  after a three-day hearing, saying both men continued to pose a danger to the  community, and ordered the pair to await their July 7 sentencing in jail.  </P> <P> Prosecutors maintained that Gotti and Carneglia continued to traffic in heroin  and deal in Gambino family affairs after their conviction.  </P> <P> Prosecutors asked that the two be jailed immediately after the bail hearing in  U.S. District Court, but Bartels gave them an additional night to be with their  families.  </P></p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Buoyant sales for life insurance In spite of growing press criticism, sales of life insurance products rose substantially in the first quarter of this year, according to figures published yesterday by the Association of British Insurers. Single premium business - which often increases during a recession as consumers look to invest redundancy payments - rose by 85 per cent compared with the same period last year. Much of this was due to the continued popularity with-profits bonds - sales increased by 156 per cent. Doubts remain about the validity of the sales techniques used in promoting these products and Lautro, the industry's regulator, has launched an inquiry into them. Annuity business increased by 32 per cent and single premium pensions by 51 per cent. Total new annual premium business rose by 4 per cent.</p>

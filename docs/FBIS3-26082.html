Li Changchun also explained to them Henan's five  favorable conditions for the introduction of foreign investment.    First, Henan is located in the central plains and has  convenient railway and highway transportation facilities and  three civilian airports: Zhengzhou Airport, Luoyang Airport,  and Nanyang Airport. Zhengzhou International Airport is still  under construction and will be completed in 1996.    Second, it has a variety of mineral resources. Its outputs  of farm products, industrial crops, and animal husbandry rank in  the forefront of the country. It has adequate electric power  supply.    Third, it has a long history and beautiful mountains and  rivers and is rich in cultural relic resources.    Fourth, it is rich in labor resources and has low labor  costs  and hard-working and honest people.    Fifth, the two high-tech development zones in Zhengzhou and  Luoyang, which have been approved by the State Council, provide  good environments for foreign investors in Henan. The State  Council has also provided Zhengzhou City with the preferential  policies offered to Chinese open coastal areas. In addition, we  have the same language for communication with each other,  similar cultures, and the same habits and customs. This is also  a favorable condition. [passage omitted]</p>

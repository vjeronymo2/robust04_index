			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> BIG SPIN WINNER ALSO WINS BIG IN COURT; $3.4-MILLION VERDICT UPHELD  </P> <P> The California Lottery lost a court bid today to overturn a $3.4-million  judgment awarded to a Los Angeles woman who was denied a $3-million lottery  prize when her ball bounced out of its slot in a Big Spin game.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Robert Lopez refused to grant a new trial in the case  after hearing arguments by lawyers for Doris Barnett and the state lottery.  </P> <P> Barnett, 54, was elated Dec. 30, 1985, when she watched her ball land in the  $3-million slot. Geoff Edwards, the master of ceremonies, declared Barnett a  $3-million winner, but seconds later, the ball bounced out and came to rest in  a $10,000 slot. Barnett sued and a jury decided she should get $3 million and  $400,000 for emotional trauma.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Thing From Space"] </F>   [Text] An obscure research institute is working for the  military and for the Federal German Intelligence Services (BND).  It is costing Bonn a lot of money.    From a distance, the monstrous dome towering over the  village  of Werthoven near Bonn looks like a space station. Anyone  trying to learn the answer to the puzzle that dominates the  rural idyll here quickly gets into trouble. "No photography  here," say the guards to curious sightseers. "Go back, this is  of no concern to you."    The guards watch over one of Germany's secret institutes,  the  Research Institute of Applied Natural Sciences (FGAN).    According to peace researcher Erich Schmidt-Ennboom, the  institute in question, unusual in that it is a registered  association entitled to be treated as a charity and enjoying tax  privileges, is a BND front. German reconnaissance personnel,  whose work is supposed to be limited solely to foreign countries  according to the law, are using this institute to develop new  espionage and reconnaissance methods without being disturbed.    Even Bundestag deputies consider the enterprise a "quite  mysterious affair," which, according to one security expert, "no  one has taken a closer look at."    But for members of the Budget Committee, "Effgann," as it is  called by insiders, is supposedly not so mysterious. It is  virtually a federal enterprise. With an annual budget of 65  million marks [DM], the mysterious institute is almost fully  financed out of the federal budget. In 1994, only DM100,000 of  this DM65 million came from private sources.    The members of the institute are an exclusive group. For  years, the exclusive circle has never exceeded ten. They  include leading enterprises in the German armaments industry  such as Dasa, Siemens, Dornier, Atlas Elektronik, and MAN  Gutehoffnungshuete.    The institute's task is the pursuance of "scientific  research  mainly in the fields of electronics, cybernetics, and  information science," in the "interests of national defense."    But in fact, FGAN is paid for by Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe, who lavishes out of his ministerial budget some DM41  million for operations, almost DM4 million for investments, and  DM19 million for projects.    "Original defense research constitutes almost 100 percent of  the institute's work," says Horst Heger, executive member of the  board. Appropriately enough, the institute's clientele is  restricted. The recipients of the institute's work are the  defense minister and the armaments industry. This work is  actually performed at state expense. In any case, contributions  from members do not possess any significance in the FGAN  business plan.    If necessary, the scientists also supply information to the  Federal Chancellery and "other relevant and competent organs in  the federation and in the laender," says board chairman  Friedrich Wiekhorst, thereby suggesting recipients whose names  are better left undisclosed, such as the secret services.    Altogether, FGAN maintains six agencies whose capacity is  closely linked to military and intelligence needs. For  instance, the Research Institute for High Frequency Physics  (FHP) is developing new radar procedures to improve "efficiency,  even in the face of enemy weapons."    With an antenna of 34 meters in diameter, the Wethhoven  station is the "largest radar facility in Europe," claims  Wiekhorst. With it, the scientists can observe the functions  and operations of even military satellites high in earth's  orbit. Wiekhorst: "We are not looking for stars. We just want  to know what is going on up there." Wiekhorst brushes aside a  question whether the intelligence service lies at the roots of  all this research. "We take a look at the things up there and  draw conclusions," he says.    During the Cold War, the scientists, considered the best in  the world, would have "cooperated to the best of their ability  in preventing a surprise attack," says Wiekhorst. The Federal  Government had committed them to this task. But Wiekhorst says  the institute has no idea who receives the results of  observations and experiments on an individual basis.    The institute's Research Institute for Radio and Mathematics  develops mathematical and technical procedures for computers on  reconnaissance systems, something also of great interest to  intelligence services. "After all, we have the right to listen  to the electromagnetic waves that flow through our facility,"  says Wiekhorst.    Wiekhorst dismisses as a "lie" the accusation that FGAN with  its subsidiaries is merely one of the BND's fronts. Needless to  say, the BND in Pullach does not deny "points of contact" with  FGAN. A leading BND official says that there have been contacts  between FGAN and the BND "for ages." There is "nothing  exciting" about that. It is just a "well-worn story among the  employees."    The institute's eavesdropping and surveillance experts have  allegedly taken part in "specialized talks between the BND and  the Bundeswehr leadership" for a long time. The FHP high  frequency physicists cooperate with BND Department III  (Analysis) in matters concerning space flight reconnaissance and  satellite observation. In addition, the institute has received  occasional requests from the BND to perform a particular study.    However, whether or not the confidential cooperation will  continue to run so smoothly in the future hangs in the balance  because the fiscal authorities are knocking on the research  institute's door.    The tax office at St. Augustin near Bonn doubts whether the  research work is "exclusively and directly for the common  welfare," something which the FGAN has been claiming for years  in order to be exempt from turnover tax.    Both the tax office and the Finance Ministry in Dusseldorf  agree that research in defense technology "is not directly  connected to the broad common good." As a result, a legal  dispute has been brewing in the fiscal court in Cologne for five  years.    A defeat there could prove very expensive for researchers in  defense and intelligence work. Their tax arrears already add up  to over DM70 million. "And we cannot pay that," moans Wiekhorst.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BIG STEP TOWARD LEGITIMATE PLURALISM;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: GORBACHEV AND HIS REFORMERS DID NOT GET ALL THEY WANTED FROM THE  CENTRAL COMMITTEE SESSION. BUT THEY GOT ENOUGH TO EMERGE THE VICTORS.  </P> <P> The task of describing, never mind analyzing and interpreting, the Soviet  political system becomes more difficult by the day. It is also, however,  infinitely more fascinating. Within less than five years the Soviet system has  moved from being highly authoritarian to one in which a substantial element of  de facto pluralism exists and in which political pluralism is at last becoming  legitimized.  </P> <P> A crucial step toward legitimized pluralism was taken last week when the  Central Committee gave its reluctant agreement to the proposals of Mikhail  Gorbachev that the Communist Party give up its guaranteed monopoly of power and  open the way to party competition. A number of political parties other than the  Communists already exist in some Soviet republics. But now that the way has  been opened for the Supreme Soviet to rescind Article 6 of the Constitution,  which made the ascendancy of the Communist Party a significant part of the  fundamental law of the land, a growth in both the number and size of other  parties can be expected -- in Russia as well as in the peripheral republics.  </P> <P> One of the major ways in which a competitive party system could emerge in the  Soviet Union is through a split in the Communist Party itself. Such splits are  already beginning to occur on an ethnic and territorial basis (with the  Lithuanians leading the way), but the Party Congress -- which has now been  advanced from October to this summer -- will bring out as never before the  fundamental ideological differences within the Communist Party and could hasten  a division with reformist and conservative wings forming separate parties.  There could even be a three-way division among radical reformers, centrists and  conservatives.  </P> <P> Gorbachev and his reformist advisers did not get all they wanted in Moscow last  week. The language of the resolutions was fudged and watered down in order to  achieve the remarkable feat of getting every Central Committee member except  Boris Yeltsin to vote for a package that went against the convictions of many  of them.  </P> <P> Gorbachev also wanted -- against all the traditions of the Central Committee --  to televise the proceedings of the plenum. This would have made it harder for  members to defend the Communist Party's monopoly of power and to express their  distrust of the people, given that the people would be watching. While  Gorbachev and his allies lost on this point, the speeches of participants in  the debate have been published in the Soviet press.  </P> <P> Not the least of the points on which Gorbachev had to make a tactical retreat  was in his desire to ease the path of acceptance of more consistently reformist  proposals to be presented to the 28th Party Congress by securing the removal of  at least one of the remaining conservatives on the Politburo. A senior official  in the ideological department of the Central Committee said at the beginning of  the week that Gorbachev would remove the conservatives in the leadership "step  by step" and indicated that a resignation could be expected. It did not happen,  but there is to be another Central Committee plenum within a month.  </P> <P> Gorbachev also failed to get the Central Committee reduced from its normal size  of around 300 members, plus at least half as many candidate members, to a mere  200 full members. It emerged after the meeting that the revamped Central  Committee would be a body of between 300 and 400 members.  </P> <P> All this indicates the constraints upon Gorbachev's power and it helps to  explain why his supporters believe that a strengthened state presidency is  necessary. One of the fundamentally important points to come out of the plenum  was acceptance of the need to move to a new-style presidential system in which  the president would not only have greater powers than accrue to that office at  present, but would be elected directly by the people. A president elected by  universal adult suffrage would have a legitimacy and authority that a leader  who becomes head of state purely on the say-so of a Communist Party forum  (performing the functions implicit in its "leading role") could not.  </P> <P> The details of the latest political reforms will have to be settled in the  Soviet legislature -- the Congress of People's Deputies and especially its  inner body, the Supreme Soviet. But it looks as if a directly and freely  elected president and competition between political parties in elections to  both local soviets and national legislatures are on the way.  </P> <P> That is a dramatic change in the Soviet political system. It means that even if  the reformers did not get all they wanted last week, they emerged the victors.  Given the problems of everyday life in the Soviet Union, it is not a foregone  conclusion that Gorbachev will be the winner in a popular election for the  presidency, but it is highly unlikely that he will be defeated by a more  conservative Communist candidate. If he were to lose such an election, it most  likely would be to an advocate of more radical change who was not tainted by  the compromises forced upon Gorbachev by the need to carry a more conservative  group of colleagues with him and by the economic failures and intra-ethnic  unrest that beset him.  </P></p>

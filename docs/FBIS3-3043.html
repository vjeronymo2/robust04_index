Because Deng Nan  is Deng Xiaoping's daughter, reporters from Shanghai were  already waiting for her when she arrived. Before she stepped  into the meeting room, the reporters surrounded her and began to  interview her at lightning speed.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] How do you feel after your  return from Shanghai? What are your impressions of Shanghai?    [Deng] I have new impressions every year. [laughter]    [Repporter] What are your impressions of the Yangpu bridge?    [Deng] The Yangpu bridge is famous nationally and  internationally.    [Reporter] We saw Comrade Xiaoping on television during his  trip to Shanghai. He appeared to be thinner than last year.  Right?    [Deng] It is better to be thinner when one gets old.    [Reporter] Does Comrade Xiaoping watch television at home or  how does he....    [Deng, interrupting] He watches television everyday. He is  very concerned about the NPC and Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference sessions. Thank you for your concern.  He is in very good health. He is really in very good health.  Most important, he does not have any real disease. He is only  getting old with each passing year. [laughter] This is a  natural process. He has no problems whatsoever with his internal  organs.    [Reporter] How does he learn of national and international  events?    [Deng] He has a lot of information at his disposal. He reads  many newspapers and reference materials. Everyday, he reads the  newspapers, watches television, and hears feedback relayed to  him from various quarters. He is very concerned about national  development, especially scientific and technological  development. On many occasions in the past, he said that China  should carve out a niche in the world in the field of science  and technology. If people asked for his advice on this issue,  he would express his views. [laughter]    [Reporter] I read in the newspaper that he walks three  li....[changes thought] three km each day.    [Deng] Three km is on the lower side. He sometimes covers  more distance. Besides taking a walk, he also plays bridge and  has a good appetite. His appetite has always been very good.    [Reporter] Is he still into swimming?    [Deng] He only swims in the ocean. He loves the ocean; he  does not like the swimming pool because it is so oppressive.    [Reporter] We hope he will go to Shanghai every year.    [Deng] We hope so. [laughter]    [Reporter] The people of Shanghai welcome his visit with  open  arms.    [Deng] Given Shanghai's tremendous changes, it is only  natural that he go there. [laughter]    [Reporter] After 1997, he probably will go to Hong Kong.    [Deng] Even if he goes to Hong Kong, he will stay there for  only a brief period. He will not stay there longer than in  Shanghai.    [Reporter] The changes that have occurred in Shanghai in  recent years are mainly the result of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  encouragement, concern, and exhortation.    [Deng] The people of Shanghai should be largely credited for  these changes. Shanghai is now in the best period ever; it  should seize opportunities.    [Reporter] You went to Shanghai this Spring Festival. When  will you go there again?    [Deng] We do not have any plan yet. [laughter]    [Reporter] The people of Shanghai are very concerned about  this issue. We hope he will go there every year.    [Deng] That is for sure.    [Reporter] What are your own impressions of Shanghai?    [Deng] Shanghai is the largest industrial, financial, and  trade center in China. Therefore, it is the most promising city  in China.    [Reporter] What did you study in the past?    [Deng] Physics.    [Reporter] In your current capacity as vice minister of the  State Science and Technology Commission, what is your area of  responsibility?    [Deng] Social development [as heard].    [Reporter] Please convey the regards of Shanghai's deputies,  listeners, and people to Comrade Xiaoping. We wish him good  health.    [Deng] Thank you. I will surely do it. [end recording]</p>

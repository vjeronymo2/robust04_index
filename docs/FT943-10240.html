			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Talks offer few clues to Pyongyang stance High-level talks between the US and North Korea resumed yesterday in a fresh attempt to persuade Pyongyang to put its suspected nuclear programme under full international safeguards. The talks, suspended a month ago after the death of North Korea's president, Kim Il-sung, are expected to last a week or more. Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state, and Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister, said their initial eight hours of talks at the US mission in Geneva had been 'businesslike and intensive'. The talks have been adjourned until Monday to allow the delegations to consult their respective capitals. Yesterday's encounter was seen as offering the first pointer towards any shift in North Korean foreign policy following the assumption to power of Mr Kim Jong-il, the late president's son. However, speaking to journalists after the meeting, Mr Gallucci refused to be drawn on whether Mr Kang had indicated any change in Pyongyang's stance. The US is said to be offering diplomatic recognition and economic aid in return for North Korea's agreement to reveal details of its nuclear activities and to comply with international inspections under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Before leaving Washington for Geneva, Mr Gallucci said he expected the talks to be 'broad', 'thorough' and aimed at reaching 'an overall settlement' of outstanding issues. Apart from the nuclear issue, the talks would cover political, economic and trade relations, he said. Mr Gallucci's first priority, though, is to find a solution to the problem of the 8,000-odd spent fuel rods from North Korea's only operational nuclear reactor which are now decaying in a holding pond at the Yongbyon nuclear complex north of Pyongyang. The rods were removed from the reactor in May without international supervision, sparking fears that North Korea intends to reprocess the fuel to make nuclear bombs. In June, after mediation by Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president, Pyongyang agreed to 'freeze' its nuclear activities in return for new US talks. However, North Korea says it will have to start reprocessing the spent fuel at the end of this month, when the rods could begin to pose a radiation hazard. Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna confirmed yesterday that the rod casings are of a type susceptible to corrosion which would allow radioactive material to leak into the pond. They said the casing housing the uranium was made of a magnesium metal alloy prone to corrosion under water. The rapidity of the corrosion depended on the temperature and the state of the water. The only solutions were either to remove the rods into dry storage, thereby halting any further damage, or to reprocess the fuel as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Who Will Buy Bull?"; first </F> paragraph is 01 INFORMATIQUE introduction]    [Text] The state is giving Bull capital of 11 billion  French francs [Fr] and a new head, Jean-Marie Descarpentries.  His mission: to turn Bull into a profitmaking company like any  other and, in the long term, to privatize it.    A carte blanche, an Fr11 billion stash, and the job of  readying Bull for privatization are the means and mission  industry minister Gerard Longuet has assigned to Jean-Marie  Descarpentries, Bernard Pache's successor as the head of Bull.  Despite the high financial stakes (Fr7 billion from the state,  Fr1.6 billion from France Telecom, and Fr2.5 billion from a loan  granted early this year), neither the entrepreneur nor the  politician has unveiled a strategic plan. They have also failed  to sketch out a profile of Bull's indispensible partner.    Despite the new CEO's reluctance to present a plan of  action,  Jean-Pierre Muller, president of Bull's user club Cube, thinks  "things are starting to pick up speed." Muller is happy with the  inverted pyramid model cited by Jean-Marie Descarpentries,  because "it puts the customer first." The challenge now is to  preserve a customer base attractive enough to lure potential  investors into participating in a private-sector-handled  (not-yet-scheduled) privatization. The most palpable hypothesis,  given the reticence of IBM, is that a big Japanese group  prepared to invest in a beachhead in Europe will come forward.  NEC, a top international company with long-standing ties to  Bull, seems the most likely rescuer. In addition, the Japanese  manufacturer needs to expand its geographical territory in  personal computing, notably in the United States.    Before it can be freed from state tutelage, Bull must post  profits again. To make the manufacturer "a profitable company  like any other, responsible to its market," Jean-Marie  Descarpentries must act quickly, persuade NEC and IBM to inject  fresh capital, and attract new customers and partners while  cutting costs. What price will the manufacturer pay for a return  to profits, once its debts of Fr9.5 billion are cleared?  Claiming that he does not want to touch "Bull's core",  Jean-Marie Descarpentries has left the question of the  manufacturer's future scope totally up in the air. The new CEO  has enumerated five business the group must preserve: company  servers, personal computing, open architectures, systems  integration, and all customer services. Jean-Marie  Descarpentries envisions a structural change for Bull, to make  it "a clearly-organized, lean, decentralized company, in which  decisionmakers will have the authority they need." He wants to  move quickly to implement the company's thinking about a  specialized business-based and not geographically-based  organization. On the other hand, Descarpentries has not a word  to say about Bull's manufacturing base, which in France now  consists entirely of the Angers factory. He is just as silent  about the United States, where Bull has lost a pile of money in  the past. For the immediate term, the debate centers around the  future of Zenith Data Systems and of Bull's service strategy.  ZDS, which Bull acquired for 500 million dollars in 1989,  remains the manufacturer's greatest lossmaker. Following a  restructuring of its industrial base and a partnership agreement  with Packard-Bell, ZDS CEO Jacques Noels says "We will have a  good idea of the impact of the steps taken" by mid-1994. As for  services, Bull, which has still not scored any major successes  in France, got into FM late and has had no luck persuading  France Telecom to team up with it. Yet the idea of an FM  partnership between the two is making headway in the Ministry of  Industry, where officials are working on [finding] areas,  particularly in services and multimedia, where the two French  technology hubs overlap.  <H5>  Boxed Material: Luc Fayard's Opinion </H5>   Here the state goes again, toying with its favorite  plaything, Bull. While grousing about "the last time", the  government is kicking another almost Fr9 billion into the pot.  It is presenting a new CEO with no strategy as the nth archangel  of a miraculous rescue mission, and inventing a new sort of  "good riddance" privatization. This has been going on for 20  years. What a mess -- and what a shame! For the French firm has  many assets it could use to pull through, provided it was given  the means to follow its head. It is time to decide. Should Bull  shift its focus back to high-added-value technical products such  as its Unix (with IBM) and GCOS (with NEC) systems, even if that  means selling off its personal computer business (Zenith Data  Systems)? Or should it expand into services and systems  integration? Whether alone or with a partner, Bull must finally  be allowed to act.  <H5>  Boxed Material: A Commando Fighter </H5>   First came the era of technician or strategist bosses, then  the reign of manufacturer Bernard Pache. Now a commando fighter  has taken over the helm at Bull. Jean-Marie Descarpentries has  built up his image as a "come-hell-or-high-water" type through  takeovers and mergers (Carnaud-Metal Box), but also as a result  of his views on what motivates people.    The 56-year-old polytechnical school graduate, who also has  a  Harvard degree, has thought out and refined those ideas while  working for Shell, McKinsey, Belgium's Glaverbel, and -- until  recently -- the logistics and transport group Novalliance. While  working as the director of Carnaud-Metal Box (CMB), he adopted  the Swedish manager Jan Carlzon's ideas on the "inverted  pyramid", which makes the customer the basis for company  decisions.  <H5>  Bull's Assets </H5>   -- Its installed customer base and distribution channels.    -- Close long-standing ties with Japan's NEC, which supplies  Bull with its GCOS 8 big systems line. NEC's investment in CMB  in 1992 enabled Bull to reorganize its businesses in the United  States.    -- Its alliance with Cisi in FM, which offsets Bull's late  start in that niche.    -- DCM, its architecture for non-homogenous environments.    -- The international service contracts it has won, notably  in  the United Kingdom, Poland, and the United States.    -- The efforts Bull has made since 1991 to cut structural  costs, which have resulted in staff reductions and a  reorganization of its industrial base.    -- The PC agreement with Packard-Bell, which opens the doors  to large-scale distribution for ZDS in the United States, and  gives it the critical mass to buy components.    -- A RISC line that will be relayed by the PowerPC, the  future generation of microprocessors.    -- Recent successes in the United States (including the  Desktop IV contract and a $62-million contract recently  concluded with the American federal government to reengineer big  system applications).  <H5>  Boxed Material: Bull's Handicaps </H5>   -- State tutelage, which has slowed decisionmaking. This was  especially true when NEC acquired a capital stake in Bull or  during RISC negotiations with IBM and HP. The discussions  between Bernard Pache and the government over the last few  months heightened the wait-and-see attitude of customers.    -- Internal fiefdoms, watered-down decisionmaking within the  company, and a lack of money, particularly among sales forces,  for implementing strategies. -A deplorable financial structure,  aggravated by heavy interest expenses on a Fr9.5 billion debt  (reduced in 1992). Losses over the last three years of nearly  Fr15 billion, and sales that have declined for the last two  years.    -- A Unix strategy that depends on IBM's. The French  manufacturer has still not come out with any  multiprocessor-based computers.    -- A tardy and unsuccessful foray into personal computing,  which led to the costly acquisition of ZDS. Bull's integration  of the American PC manufacturer, which it undertook at the same  time as an overhaul of its distribution channels, was  time-consuming and caused significant development delays.  <H5>  Dates </H5>   1931: The French company HW Egli Bull is created in Paris,  to  make machines based on the patents of the Norwegian engineer  Frederik Rosing Bull.    1951: The Bull machine company brings out the Gamma 3, an  electronic computer.    1962: Honeywell concludes a technology agreement with NEC  allowing the Japanese firm to use the American company's  technology.    1964: General Electric takes control (66 percent) of Bull,  Europe's top and the world's second-ranking computer  manufacturer.    1966: A merger of CAE (born of CGE/CSF), SEA (Schneider),  and  Analac (CSF) creates CII.    1970: Honeywell buys back General Electric's computer  business and Honeywell Bull is born.    1972: Bull and NEC sign an agreement to collaborate on  integrated circuits.    1976: Honeywell Bull merges with CII's big computer  business,  creating a company controlled 53 percent by the French state and  47 percent by Honeywell.    1978: CII Honeywell Bull acquires R2E, the designer of  Micral, the first personal computer marketed in the world.    1980: Saint-Gobain takes control of CII Honeywell Bull.    1982: Bull is nationalized.    1983: NEC, Honeywell, and Bull sign a long-term licensing  agreement for powerful, central computers. Following the  acquisition of Sem and Transac, CII Honeywell Bull becomes Bull.  The state owns 94 percent of the group.    1984: The Micral 30, the first French compatible, is  launched.    1989: Bull buys Zenith Data Systems.    1990: Bull announces a three-year reorganization plan.    1991: NEC swaps its interest in Bull HN for 4.7 percent of  the capital of CMB, the group's parent company in which France  Telecom holds a 17-percent stake.    1992: IBM acquires 5.68 percent of the capital of CMB as  part  of a manufacturing (portables and electronic boards) and  technology (Unix) agreement. Bull launches the Zeus project, to  replace the DPS 9000/800, with NEC.    1993: The state makes its final allocation before Bull's  privatization, to be handled by the private sector.</p>

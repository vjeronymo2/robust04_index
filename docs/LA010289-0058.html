			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLE THEFT SUSPECT WOUNDED BY LA MESA POLICE  </P> <P> A La Mesa police officer shot a man in the chest Friday night while police were  attempting to arrest him in Lemon Grove.  </P> <P> The victim, identified as James L. Warnicke, 22, of Lemon Grove was listed in  serious condition Sunday at UC San Diego Medical Center.  </P> <P> La Mesa police spokeswoman Allison Moore said Officer Jeff Allen followed two  motorcyclists to a Lemon Grove liquor store.  </P> <P> Waiting outside, Allen was advised by his radio dispatcher that one of the  motorcycles had been reported stolen. The officer asked for backup assistance  and when other officers arrived, they confronted the two men.  </P> <P> Moore said that the officers asked both men to raise their hands, but that  Warnicke "suddenly moved his hands to an object in his waistband." She said the  officers again ordered him to stop, but that Warnicke repeated the movement and  that Allen then fired one shot, hitting Warnicke in the right side of the  chest.  </P> <P> Warnicke was taken by Life-flight to the medical center, where he was held on  suspicion of motorcycle theft.  </P> <P> His companion, Andre Perez, 26, of La Mesa, was held in the downtown county  jail on suspicion of possessing a dangerous weapon and on several outstanding  warrants.  </P> <P> Moore said detectives found a knife at the scene, but she said it was unclear  what, if anything, Warnicke may have had inside his waistband.  </P> <P> Allen, a 3-year police veteran, was placed on administrative leave while the  investigation is continuing.  </P></p>

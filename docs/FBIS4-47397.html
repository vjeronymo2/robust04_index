Dzhavakhishvili,  Tbilisi; Department of Chemistry, University of Colorado,  Boulder, USA; UDC 547.857.7'455.057:577.113.6]    [Abstract] Technical details are presented on liquid- and  solid-phase syntheses of oligonucleotide dithioates as potential  antivirals and antineoplastics. Liquid-phase triester approach  yielded dimers and tetramers in millimolar quantities and  octamers at the 0.1 mmolar level. Solid-phase approach on  polyethelene glycol support with thioamidite reagent provided  the octanucleotide dithioates (T[.sub]8[/](S[.sub]2[/])  and C[.sub]7[/]T(S[.sub]2[/]) in yields of 0.02 and 0.12  millimoles, respectively. The products of solid-phase synthesis  were purified by a novel method including cleavage of the  protected oligonucleotides from the polymeric carrier,  adsorption chromatography on silica gel, complete removal of  protective groups and, finally, reverse-phase chromatography on  silica gel C[.sub]18[/].

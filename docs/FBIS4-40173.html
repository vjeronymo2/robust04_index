			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- "It's for the first time that  the world encounters such outrageous nuclear blackmail as in  North Korea's case," said chairman of the Duma Committee for  Defence, Sergey Yushenkov, when he met his British counterpart,  Chairman of the Permanent Committee for Defence Nicholas Bonser,  "Ekho Moskvy" radio reported on Tuesday night.    Commenting on North Korea's problem, Bonser pointed out that  the most important thing in this crisis was to show firm  determination so that other countries would not be tempted to  follow North Korea's example. Otherwise, a potential threat of  a nuclear conflict might appear for the first time after the  Second World War, the British lawmaker said.    Yushenkov pointed out that the "Partnership for Peace"  programme can play an important role in the prevention of  conflicts similar to the Yugoslav and Korean crises.</p>

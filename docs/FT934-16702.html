			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / US banks confirm merger: The creation of a giant 'super-regional' KEYCORP and Society Corporation, two of the US's strongest regional banking groups, yesterday confirmed their merger in a deal which creates a new giant among the US's 'super-regional' banks. The new bank, to be known as KeyCorp, will have assets of Dollars 58bn (Pounds 38.5bn), making it the 10th largest in the US on this basis. Among super-regionals - banks with operations which span a number of US regions - the new group will rank behind only NationsBank and Banc One. Mr Victor Riley, chairman and chief executive of KeyCorp, said the merger was intended to enhance the two banks' earning power by making available a broader range of products through their combined branch network. By contrast, the deal was only expected to shave 4-5 per cent from the combined cost base of the two companies, or Dollars 80m-Dollars 100m a year. Unlike other recent regional bank takeovers, the deal is structured as a pure merger, with the two groups combining their operations in a new holding company. KeyCorp shareholders will receive 1.205 shares in the new holding company for each one they hold, while Society shareholders will retain their existing number of shares. KeyCorp, based in Albany, New York, has built a 836-branch network by expanding into eight states in the north-east and north-west: Maine, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Society has concentrated on the middle corporate market and has 456 branches in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Florida. The return on equity of the combined banking group would be 19.75 per cent, making it one of the most profitable in the US. In an attempt to dissuade rival bids for either bank, the two sides have granted each other options over 19.9 per cent of their shares. These options would become exercisable if either side was acquired by a third party. KeyCorp also said it had adopted a 'poison pill', similar to one already in place at Society. Analysts questioned whether the attempt to put together a true merger, leaving the management of neither bank in overall control, would slow down the group's development. However, both banks' shares rose on the news yesterday.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            COMBINED RESOURCES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        No. of                                                        states                                      Return    Return  (bank-      Bank                              Total   on        on      ing         Bran-                              assets  assets    equity  operations) ches  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Dollars  Percent  Percent Society Corp Cleveland, Ohio   26bn     1.52    20.39      4       456 KeyCorp Albany, New York       32bn     1.27    18.94      9       832 Combined                       58bn     1.38    19.75     13      1288  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             TOP US BANKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      Assets (Dollars bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

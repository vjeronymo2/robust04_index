			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER OF LUXURY HOTEL GETS OK TO BRING IN NEW MANAGER  </P> <P> The winner of a competition to build a resort-style hotel on Harbor Island won  approval Tuesday from the Board of Port Commissioners to bring in the  Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. as the new hotel manager.  </P> <P> In doing so, developer R. Barry McComic officially dropped Stouffer Hotel  Management Corp. as the luxury hotel's management partner.  </P> <P> Port District Director Don Nay said he was reluctant to endorse the change. He  noted that McComic and Stouffer as a team had won out over several others last  year in a stiff competition to build on the last remaining hotel site on the  picturesque island in San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> He said McComic, through his Boulder Creek Co., and Stouffer had submitted a  specific plan and hotel design and that switching partners would be contrary to  the rules of the competition.  </P> <P> In addition, Nay said McComic now wanted substantial changes in the design of  the hotel to accommodate Ritz-Carlton, which was one of the losers of last  year's competition and is set to operate a new hotel in La Jolla.  </P> <P> But McComic said he was unable to reach a satisfactory management agreement  with Stouffer and stressed to commissioners that he wasn't "shopping around"  his development option.  </P> <P> He said the new hotel, which on the outside is very similar to the original  design, will cost $100 million instead of $75 million, which was the cost of  the Stouffer facility. McComic said much of the additional expense will be used  to upgrade the interior of the hotel to Ritz-Carlton standards.  </P> <P> Commissioners said they weren't particularly concerned with the change to a new  hotel operator, but wanted to make sure the design would be as close as  possible to the one approved last year.  </P> <P> "Unless Mr. McComic can produce what we agreed to, (then) we have to consider  the possibility of (another competition)," Commissioner Ray Burk said. "The  issue isn't one of design, it's one of fairness."  </P></p>

The president of the Russian Federation and the prime  minister of Japan are at one in their understanding that the  democratic transformations and economic reform being undertaken  in Russia are of extraordinary importance not only for the  peoples of this country but also for the world as a whole and  that the success of Russia's transition to a genuinely market  economy and the smooth integration of the Russian Federation in  the world democratic community are, what is more, in the sides'  opinion, an inalienable factor of a strengthening of  international stability and the irreversibility of the process  of the formation of a new world order.    In this connection the prime minister of Japan conveyed to  the president of the Russian Federation the following message of  the leaders of the Seven.    "We regret that as a result of the armed clashes in Moscow  provoked by supporters of the former parliament, there were  numerous human casualties, but at the same time we welcome the  fact that the situation is returning to normal and that legality  and order, including respect for human rights, are being  restored.    "We confirm once again that support for the policy of  democratic and economic reforms pursued by President B.N.  Yeltsin remains invariable and express great hope that as a  result of elections to a new parliament, free and fair and with  broad public participation, a genuinely democratic society which  reflects the will of the people will be born and that the  reforms will be continued."    2. Of a common opinion on the need to surmount in bilateral  relations the grim legacy of the past, the president of the  Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan conducted  serious negotiations on the question of the ownership of the  islands of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai. The parties  agree that it is necessary to continue the negotiations for the  speediest conclusion of a peace treaty by way of a solution of  the said question, proceeding from historical and legal facts  and on the basis of documents formulated in accordance with an  agreement between the two countries and also the principles of  legality and justice, and in this way to fully normalize  bilateral relations. In this connection the Government of the  Russian Federation and the Government of Japan confirm that the  Russian Federation is the state-continuer of the USSR and that  all treaties and other international accords between the Soviet  Union and Japan continue to apply in relations between the  Russian Federation and Japan.    The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government  of Japan note also that there has thus far been a constructive  dialogue within the framework of the working group on a peace  treaty between the two countries and that a result thereof was  the joint publication by the Russian and Japanese sides in  September 1992 of the "Joint Digest of Documents on the History  of the Territorial Demarcation Between Russia and Japan."    The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government  of Japan agree to take a number of steps for a deepening of  mutual understanding, primarily in the plane of a further  improvement in reciprocal trips of the permanent residents of  the above-mentioned islands and inhabitants of Japan made within  the framework of the procedure established on the basis of an  agreement between the two parties.    3. Certain that a broadening of the political dialogue is a  useful and efficient means of the development of  Russian-Japanese relations, the president of the Russian  Federation and the prime minister of Japan agree to continue,  intensify, and develop political dialogue by way of regular  reciprocal visits at top leader and foreign minister and also  deputy foreign minister level.    4. Welcoming the results achieved thus far in the sphere of  arms control and disarmament, and confirming the need for their  conscientious fulfillment, the president of the Russian  Federation and the prime minister of Japan are united in their  understanding of the importance of the further advancement of  this process and of its being made irreversible.    Having a common understanding of the importance for security  throughout the world of the question of the dismantling of  nuclear weapons and of the problem of the storage of the nuclear  materials and control over them and their processing which  arises in this connection, the parties confirm their desire to  cooperate in the said fields. Confirming also that the discharge  of radioactive waste into the sea is causing serious concern  globally, particularly from the viewpoint of its effect on the  environment in adjacent states, the parties agree for further  consideration of this problem to hold close consultations along  the lines of the joint Russian-Japanese working group.    The parties welcome the signing in January 1993 in Paris of  the Convention Banning Chemical Weapons and express the hope  that as many states as possible will subscribe to this  convention and that it will contribute to peace and stability  worldwide. The parties agree also to cooperate closely with each  other for the effective nonproliferation of weapons of mass  destruction and their delivery systems and also the material,  equipment, technology, and knowhow associated with them and to  enhance the transparency of conventional arms supplies.    5. The president of the Russian Federation and the prime  minister of Japan are of a common opinion concerning  possibilities for dynamic development that could be demonstrated  by the Asia-Pacific region in the world of the 21st century on  the basis of the common principles of freedom and openness. The  parties confirm the significance of the fact that the Russian  Federation will by way of the implementation of the principles  of legality and justice become an active and constructive  partner in this region and will make a further contribution to  the development of political and economic relations between the  states located therein and are also agreed that considerable  importance for the accomplishment of this task is attached to  the full normalization of relations between the Russian  Federation and Japan, which perform an important role in this  region, in the sense that it would make it possible to make this  region a zone of peace and stability and also an area of the  development of economic cooperation based on a system of free  trade open to all countries and regions, the Russian Federation  included.    Proceeding from a common understanding of the need for a  strengthening of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,  the president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister  of Japan confirm the importance of dialogue between government  bodies of two countries on a wide range of issues, including  aspects of security, and agree to continue to stimulate such  exchanges of opinion.    6. Taking account of the debate under way at the United  Nations, including that on the issue of what the organization's  functions and structure should be in order that it might,  adapting to the changing international situation, perform a  central role in maintaining and creating peace throughout the  world, the president of the Russian Federation and prime  minister of Japan agree to step up the contribution of both  countries to the efforts of the United Nations aimed at a  settlement of global and regional problems and thereby to make  joint efforts for the further enhancement of the authority of  the organization.    13 October 1993, Tokyo    [Signed] The president of the Russian Federation    [Signed] The prime minister of Japan.</p>

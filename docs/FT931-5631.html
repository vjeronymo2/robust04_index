			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Think-tank operator seeks a refill of ideas: The task facing OECD chief economist Kumiharu Shigehara as he tries to restore the body's credibility MR Kumiharu Shigehara, who took over last April as chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is trying to restore the international think-tank's dented image in economic analysis. The OECD's credibility has recently taken a battering. It under-estimated the seriousness of the global economic downturn, and gave no public warning of the crisis that hit the European exchange rate mechanism last year. As the world's economies languish, Mr Shigehara has great opportunities to make his mark. Today and tomorrow, he discusses the poor growth prospects in Japan and Europe with an OECD committee of officials from 10 nations which meets quarterly to review economic trends. Mr Shigehara, a gangling 54-year-old who heads a team of 80 economists at the OECD's Paris headquarters, goes some way to acknowledge criticism that the OECD has turned into an expensive talking shop, doing little more than turn out rehashed versions of the nostrums presented to it by member governments. He says he would like to see the OECD devote less time to describing economic events and production of numerical economic forecasts. Instead, there should be greater analysis of the trade-offs between different policy objectives, and the problems of implementing desired policies such as reforms of labour markets and cuts in government debts. Current methods of producing economic forecasts are 'very primitive', he says. Mr Shigehara believes the OECD might do better to devise a range of forecasts, based on analysing different eventualities instead of devising central projections which will almost certainly turn out wrong. Mr Shigehara's ideas about economic practicalities evolved in the two decades he spent in high-level jobs at the OECD and the Bank of Japan, where he was chief economist. A lifestyle that has meant switching between Paris and Tokyo every three or four years since 1970 has given him a good grasp of the intricacies of international deal-making in areas such as monetary policy and exchange rate targeting. It has also provided - besides an almost unnerving fluency in English and French and a lack of formality which belies his nationality - a good relationship with many top officials in the policy making world. One former economist at a continental European central bank says of Mr Shigehara: 'He's an outstanding person, although he can be a little self-assertive.' According to another person who knows him, Mr Shigehara has at times at the OECD irritated colleagues by wanting to impose fixed points of view. A more approving comment comes from Professor Charles Goodhart, a former Bank of England official now at the London School of Economics, who says Mr Shigehara is 'highly approachable and personable, a scrutable Japanese'. On the technicalities of forecasting, the OECD's chief economist likes the UK Treasury's approach of recruiting part-time, private-sector advisers to help on projections. This, he believes, could act as a check against over optimistic government projections. He indicates that the method might be appropriate for the OECD, even though he says he is unsure of who could fill the posts. Mr Shigehara is particularly keen that economists spend more time talking to politicians to learn about putting economic ideas into practice. 'It's easy enough to write the beautiful language of economic commentaries. What's hard is the implementation,' he says. On ideas about how countries should shift structurally - perhaps to move workers away from declining manufacturing sectors into high-growth services  -he suggests that the west might learn from Japan's approach in the 1970s and 1980s. He says that because of Japan's lack of status as a world power, hardly anyone in the country thought the government could protect them from the effects of the 'economic shocks' of this era, including the quadrupling in oil prices and the sharply rising yen, through policy measures such as trade restrictions. 'As a result people just learned to accept a series of shifts from one kind of industry to another,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BR'ER NRA IS COZY IN BUSH'S BRIER PATCH  </P> <P> Br'er Rabbit is the National Rifle Assn. The brier patch is President Bush's  new $1.2-billion anti-crime package.  </P> <P> The NRA wailed predictably that the President would violate the Bill of Rights  and deprive patriotic American voters of their constitutional right to pack the  firepower of a Marine infantry battalion. Now the arms industry, driving force  of the NRA, will make even more profits out of the President's proposal.  </P> <P> Much of the package is what its title claims: anti-crime. It includes tougher  sentencing, more jail cells and hundreds of new federal agents and prosecutors.  The controversial and sadly laughable part is about controlling deadly weapons.  </P> <P> Four modifiers are necessary to describe the guns that Bush dared suggest  banning: "certain imported semiautomatic assault" weapons.  </P> <P> That's slicing it pretty thin. And those weapons would be permanently banned  only if a government review finds that they are not for sporting purposes.  </P> <P> Domestic production and sale of such weapons -- three-fourths of the total --  would not be affected. Of course, they fire just as fast and kill just as  efficiently as the imported models. But the only restriction on them would be  to ban cartridge magazines holding more than 15 rounds.  </P> <P> That's slicing it even thinner. Bush said that magazines feeding 15-plus rounds  are "unjustifiably large." Thus, those holding 15 or fewer are justifiably  large.  </P> <P> The fuss over "semiautomatic assault weapons" has distracted from the serious  question of gun control. The most emotional control advocates are simply  ignorant of what the terms mean. The gun lobby is happy to watch a fierce  debate over this marginal issue while debate over the vast majority of deadly  weapons is forgotten.  </P> <P> Some advocates have urged a ban on all semiautomatic weapons. That means all  guns that chamber another round for firing after each trigger pull. The  familiar Dick Tracy "automatic" and Army Colt .45 "automatic" pistol are  semiautomatics. So are hunting rifles and shotguns that fire one shot with each  trigger pull, without manual cocking or feeding.  </P> <P> The great 1989 campaign against "semi-automatic" weapons began with the  massacre of children in a California schoolyard. As Bush noted, the murderer  used an AK-47, the Soviet assault rifle with which communist arsenals have  flooded the world. The AK-47, like the American M-16, can be rendered fully  automatic, firing bursts with a single trigger pull, and is often used that way  in combat.  </P> <P> To control all semiautomatics might be a good thing, but that's not what the  current hullabaloo is about. However, the President did his bit to confuse the  question further. He decided to define assault weapons as those with magazines  feeding more than 15 rounds, and to halt their import (but not their  manufacture here). Yet he spoke of boosting penalties for use of "semiautomatic  weapons." Does he mean that, or does he mean assault weapons? There would be  little point in toughening up against criminals who use slide-operated pistols  but not against those who use revolvers. There also seems little point in  banning imported weapons but shrugging at identical domestic ones.  </P> <P> Little practical point, that is. Politically, there is a major point: While the  gun lobby, as a matter of tactics, rises up against all gun controls, its  special interest is the U.S. arms industry. It won the Administration debate  leading up to Bush's anti-crime package, as it has won repeatedly against  congressional arms-control efforts.  </P> <P> The gun lobby argues that any slightest restriction on firearms in any city or  state is a first step toward destroying the Davy Crockett tradition in America.  The simplest gun nuts actually believe that. But the more sophisticated know  better. They are publicly upset today, as if Bush had dealt their business a  mortal blow instead of a meaningless feather-tap. But they are chortling as  they shriek. (Try it).  </P> <P> By condemning over-15-round magazines and blessing 15-and-under, Bush has  created for them a new marketing opportunity. Watch for it in all your  "outdoor" magazines: the 2-for-1 deal on 15-round banana clips, tailor-made for  your AK-47, M-16, Uzi, all your favorite sporting rifles.  </P> <P> Remember, guns don't kill people, magazines do.  </P></p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: AEG to spin off drive system unit Daimler-Benz's shrinking AEG subsidiary is to spin off its drive systems operations into a joint venture with France's Cegelec, a member of the Alcatel Alsthom group. The loss-making German company will be the junior partner with a 49 per cent stake in a business turning over DM1.4bn (Dollars 890m) annually - DM600m from AEG - which will fall under management control of Cegelec. The undertaking would be one of the world's leading suppliers of project and drive systems with factories in four European countries, the US, Australia and China, AEG said. The move marks a further step in AEG's slimming and restructuring programme, launched last December with the announcement of the sale of its household appliances business to Electrolux, the Swedish multinational group. Electrolux has since paid DM730m for the 80 per cent of the AEG operations it did not own. Other measures include the establishment of a 50:50 joint venture in computer controls for plant and machinery with the French group Schneider. Philips of the Netherlands bought the lighting technology business, and the remnants of the Olympia office equipment division were sold to Hong Kong's Elite group. Meanwhile, AEG has taken control of most of the Daimler-Benz group's microelectronics interests and absorbed the high-performance diesel engine operations of MTU. It is in the process of expanding its electronic mail-sorting equipment arm through a Dollars 260m agreed takeover of ElectroCom, a Texas-based group. Although AEG has forecast a further deficit this year after a DM1.2bn net loss in 1993, improving world demand for industrial plant and electrical components is expected to help it towards its goal of breaking even in 1995. Its railways division, for example, yesterday forecast annual turnover would rise almost a third to about DM3bn in the next five years due to DM5bn of outstanding orders.</p>

A little before midnight, after devoting almost three times  longer than expected to the debate on the draft charter of the  BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], the delegates succeeded in  adopting the new charter. Having concluded the debates on the  section of the new charter that prescribes the procedure for  electing the BSP Supreme Council, the All-Party Control-Auditing  Commission, and the chairman of the Supreme Council, the  delegates started discussing the candidates for posts in the  supreme BSP organs. The voting went on for almost three hours.  After the results are announced, the congress will go into  another closed session to discuss the candidatures for the  chairmanship of the Supreme Council. According to unofficial  information, along with the present leader Zhan Videnov, Georgi  Pirinski and Aleksandur Marinov are also in the contest.    The delegates also have to vote on the political resolution  of the 41st BSP Congress. The main point in the resolution is  that the Socialists call for early parliamentary elections in  the fall of 1994. According to the resolution, power in the  country can be stabilized only through new national elections.  The congress continues.</p>

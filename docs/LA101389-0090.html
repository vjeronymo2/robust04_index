			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD COCAINE SEIZURE IN SYLMAR  </P> <P> Just say no to drugs? Who are we fooling? The message we send to our children  via network TV, radio, billboards and magazines is more like this: Just say no  to drugs unless you can't fall asleep. In that case, take a pill. Just say no  to drugs unless you are constipated. In that case, take a spoonful. Got a  headache, upset stomach, athlete's foot or piles? Go for the instant relief.  </P> <P> Want to be a real man, Sport? Then come to Marlboro Country and puff with all  the macho dudes. Want to be popular? Want to pal around with the "in crowd?"  Then you should know that the "Silver Bullet won't slow you down." And hey, by  the way, kids, don't drink and drive . . . that's not why we sell beer at the  gas stations!  </P> <P> STEPHEN C. LEE  </P> <P> La Habra  </P></p>

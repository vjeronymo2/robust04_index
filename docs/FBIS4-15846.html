			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. Dolgopyatova: "Women and Workers Were Not </F> Elected"]    [Text] Yesterday the city electoral commission held a news  conference in Mariynskiy Palace and made public the preliminary  results of the second round of elections to the St. Petersburg  City Assembly.    Only 18.76 percent of the overall number of registered  voters  participated in the voting. Elections were held in 24 electoral  precincts. The social composition of the deputies is curious:  eight were managers, five were teachers, four were businessmen,  three were scientific associates, three were representatives of  public organizations, and one, an office employee. Not a single  worker was among the candidates who were elected. Among the  deputies there is not a single representative of the fairer sex.  All five women who entered the second round suffered defeat by  their male competitors.    The deputy chairman of the city electoral commission, R.G.  Malova, noted that the situation was calmer in the second round  of the elections. There were no serious complaints or  grievances. In Rita Grigoryevna's opinion, the voters made  their choice, which was significantly different from the results  of the first round, on the basis of television and radio  debates, which helped the Petersburgers to get to know the  candidates directly.    According to observations of the state electoral commission,  it was mostly the older generation who voted and there were  practically no youth at the precincts except a certain number of  students and military servicemen.    A very strange situation developed in the 39th electoral  district of Oktyabrskiy Rayon. As we know, the state electoral  commission kept an eye out for violations when the results of  the first round of voting were being summed up. According to  information from the chairman of the city electoral commission,  V.I. Fomichev, only 20,030 people voted here during 20-21 March,  while there are 80,875 voters registered in Oktyabrskiy Rayon.  Thus, the necessary 25 percent did not participate in the first  round of voting. On these grounds the city electoral commission  declared the first round of elections in the 39th district to be  null and void. But the city's mayor, A.A. Sobchak, subsequently  overrode the decision of the city commission, and on 3 April  there was a repeat vote in this district as well. But the city  electoral commission did not intend to take these results into  account.    V.I. Fomichev thinks that the city acted in keeping with the  Statute on Elections to the City Assembly within the limits of  its authority and that no official has the right to override its  decision. This can be done only though the courts.    Thus another has been added to the many points of confusion  regarding the past elections.</p>

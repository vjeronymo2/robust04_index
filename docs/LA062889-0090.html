			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pilots Union Seeks Mediation: The Air Line Pilots Assn. asked federal mediators  to intervene in talks with strikebound Eastern Airlines, a request that could  complicate the troubled carrier's plans to reorganize. The union made the  request of the National Mediation Board even as it continued negotiations with  Eastern in talks ordered by the bankruptcy judge overseeing the airline, which  filed for protection from its creditors after its machinists union struck in  March. A Mediation Board spokesman said the request had not been logged in as  of the close of business. The request for mediation could trigger a pilots'  strike as well.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 27 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Non-ASEAN  Southeast Asia can also spawn viable and active growth triangles  (GTs) to the same level of success as those in the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations, says Deputy Finance Minister Mustapa  Mohamed.    He said that although the idea of GTs, aimed at accelerating  sub-regional economic growth, has not progressed in these areas,  it was a matter of time before there was greater collaboration  and collective action with ASEAN, which groups Brunei,  Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.    Most regional trade and investment links had been chiefly  among countries in ASEAN and North-East Asia and a lot more  needed to be done within the non-ASEAN Southeast Asian  countries, he said when opening the fourth Southeast Asia  roundtable on economic development growth triangles in  South-east Asia, organised by the Institute of Strategic and  International Studies (ISIS) here Monday.    Mustapa said while ASEAN was home to some of the fastest  growing economies, it was also home for a number of poorer  states, thus there was a need to step up growth in the slower  regions as the faster ones surge ahead.    ASEAN has, within a short span of time, seen the emergence  of  several successful GTs such as the Batam Triangle or Sijori  involving Singapore, Malaysia's southern Johor state and  Indonesia's Riau, the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand GT (IMT-GT) as  well as the recently agreed East-ASEAN Growth Triangle  comprising Brunei, Kalimantan, East Malaysia and southern  Philippines.    Nevertheless, Mustapa said ASEAN was heartened to see the  few  seed-beds of regional growth zones beginning to take more  concrete forms such as among southern Laos, west Cambodia and  eastern Thailand.</p>

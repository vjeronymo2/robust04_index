			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (12): Decade of growth - Horticulture EVERY NIGHT the freight terminal at Nairobi's International airport comes alive in a frenzy of activity. Vans pull up loaded to the limit with boxes of strawberries, French beans and fresh cut flowers. Anxious producers mingle with customs officials and handling agents under dim neon lights. Produce is carefully checked, loaded into airline containers and put on-board flights heading for Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris. In the past decade Kenya's horticultural sector has grown rapidly providing the country with vital new sources of foreign exchange and the only serious success in diversification of exports. In 1990, Kenya exported 49,920 tonnes of fresh horticultural produce, more than double the 22,266 tonnes of a decade earlier. Foreign exchange earnings from horticulture during the same period nearly doubled from Dollars 76m in 1980 to Dollars 139m in 1990. Exports are expected to rise by a further 12 per cent for 1991 with estimated earnings of Dollars 157m. Horticulture seems likely to overtake coffee as Kenya's third biggest foreign exchange earner (behind tourism and tea) if coffee prices remain depressed this year. Much of the growth in horticulture has taken place in exports of fresh produce such as cut flowers, French beans, strawberries and pea. Fresh produce earned Kenya Dollars 90m in 1990 up from Dollars 31m a decade earlier. At least half of this figure has been made up of floral exports which have increased from 2,746 tonnes in 1975 to 14,365 tonnes in 1990. Agricultural experts say there is great potential for further growth in the sub-sector - there are less than 1,000 hectares under cultivation for flower exports and ideal climatic conditions. In spite of an average freight cost of Dollars 1.20-Dollars 1.40 a kilogramme Kenya retains a competitive advantage. Britain and Germany have proved to be the main markets for Kenyan produce. There is a strong demand for fresh cut flowers in the Netherlands which re-exports the produce under Dutch labels. France has been a strong market for French green beans. The success of the horticultural sector has primarily been due to the absence of excessive government regulation and controls and the presence of big, private Kenyan businessmen with political connections in the sector. Horticulture exports have benefited from Kenya's sensible depreciation of its currency and strong international prices. The government has specifically recognised the mounting importance of horticulture to the Kenyan economy by granting some of the demands of producers - duties on aviation spirit were lowered, although by an insufficient amount, and the government abolished import duties on packaging materials - which had prevented Kenya packaging its produce competitively. Opportunities for further expansion lie in taking advantage of the Sameer Industrial Park private sector export processing zone in Nairobi. Constraints to further growth remain, primarily the limited availability of air freight space to Europe. Many of the European flights originate in South Africa and Kenyan produce has had to fight for space with southern African producers. It is unclear whether this problem will improve or deteriorate when Kenya airways and South African Airways take up their monopoly of the Johannesburg-Nairobi route this April. Bureaucratic regulations and controls implemented by the Horticultural Crops Development Authority and problems with the inefficient Kenya Airfreight Handling, which has a monopoly on handling cargo, has hampered growth. Another problem lies with the excessive valuation by Kenyan authorities of duty on air freighted imports which discourages charters because they cannot get a return southbound load. Delays in handling, high handling charges and insufficient liberalisation of cargo at the airport have restrained growth. Horticulture has demonstrated that opportunities for growth in non-traditional exports do exist if the private sector is given a relatively free hand. If the government can iron out the few remaining obstacles to expansion horticulture is likely to continue growing giving the government an excellent source of foreign exchange and opportunities for job creation.</p>

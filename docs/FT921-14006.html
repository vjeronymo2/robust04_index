			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Singapore SE to introduce option trading THE STOCK Exchange of Singapore (SES) is to introduce trading of stock options in six local companies by the middle of this year, Reuter reports from Singapore. Mr George Teo, SES deputy chairman, told a seminar on Asian capital markets that the six - which he did not name - would be among the 32 main board companies traded under a central automated settlement system. 'Both put and call options will be introduced on six scripless equity stocks,' he said. The exchange would also select foreign brokers for SES international membership, which gives wholly foreign-owned securities companies rights to trade directly on the main board, the secondary board and the over-the-counter market. Securities companies in South Korea are expected to be allowed to deal in forward foreign exchange contracts on behalf of their clients, Mr Koh Byung-woo, chairman of the Korea Stock Exchange said.</p>

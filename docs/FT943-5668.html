			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Production rise helps Brit-Borneo A 31 per cent rise in production helped British-Borneo, the oil and gas exploration company, offset lower oil prices and boost net profits for the six months to the end of June to Pounds 4.36m, a 49 per cent Increase on the previous Pounds 2.94m. Earnings per share were 9.7p, also up 49 per cent. The value of oil and gas sales rose 34 per cent to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 13.1m), although the average oil price for the period fell from Pounds 12.20 to Pounds 9.84 a barrel. The company was helped by its strong position in natural gas, especially in the US, where prices firmed during the first half. Gas accounts for 80 per cent of British-Borneo's production revenues. Mr Alan Gaynor, chief executive, said the company was encouraged by its acquisition earlier this year of a 50 per cent stake in an onshore field in Cuba, its first big international diversification away from UK and US markets. An unchanged interim dividend of 2.667p is declared.</p>

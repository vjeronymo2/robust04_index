			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Early independence urged for central banks THE NATIONAL central banks of the European Community should be made independent as soon as possible after the planned start in January 1994 of stage two of European economic and monetary union, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor, said yesterday. Mr Hoffmeyer, who also chairs the committee of EC central bank governors, said central bank independence would improve the co-ordination of EC monetary policy, which is an important part of moves towards Emu. He was giving the 11th annual Mais lecture at the City University Business School in London. Mr Hoffmeyer was careful not to mention any EC central bank by name. However, his remarks are likely to renew controversy about the status of the Bank of England. The Bank has made no secret about wanting more independence. The Treasury acknowledges that the Bank will have to be independent if Britain moves with other EC member states to full monetary union in the third and final stage of Emu but the government has rejected earlier independence for the Bank because monetary policy will remain a national responsibility and it says that should be accountable to parliament. Mr Hoffmeyer also criticised the Emu provisions of the Maastricht treaty for being 'weaker than appropriate'. He noted that monetary policy would be concentrated in the European System of Central Banks once full Emu had been established, while governments would very largely retain responsibility for fiscal policy. As a result, a close relationship between the future European central banking system and 12 national decision-making units in fields other than monetary policy would be difficult. Although Mr Hoffmeyer said the proposed Emu blueprint 'is definitely a workable proposition', he expressed concern about how it would operate. Lines of liaison would have to be created between the future EC monetary authority and national economic policy-making units. Such lines would be weaker than existing links at the national level. 'This implies that the system will be more vulnerable,' he warned. 'There will be a higher risk that tensions will create dissatisfaction at the national level.'</p>

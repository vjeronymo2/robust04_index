			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to Washington talks, by Sayyid  'Abd-al-'Ati in Gaza -- date not given]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Ati] How do you view the events and  developments that followed the Oslo agreement?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] I would like to point out that I am  independent; that is, I am not committed to any political  faction. To avoid ambiguity, I am not an oppositionist, but I  express my own views as a Palestinian citizen. I have expressed  my opinion about the Gaza-Jericho agreement right from the  start. I believe that my mission ended with the announcement of  the secret talks in Oslo.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has led the Palestinian  negotiating team of the Cairo talks and you led the negotiating  team of the Madrid process. Do you believe the change was  intended to introduce more flexibility in the negotiations with  the Israelis?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] The change has come because the Palestinian  leadership wanted it, and I do not want to comment on it. As  for the choice of Nabil Sha'th, I believe that he has followed  the leadership's instructions, but not out of conviction. The  Cairo agreement itself did not tackle the Israeli claims about  several issues.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] How do you explain the fact that the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories have not come out  to express their views on the Cairo agreement?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] The whole process has lost much of its  credibility. Since September 1993, in many ways what had been  told to the people about the agreement removing obstacles and  opening the door for a just peace has turned out to be untrue.  This is because the attitude and the practices of the Israeli  Army remained unchanged. Their settlement activity still  continues, as do the repressive measures. In brief, the reality  refutes the words. As a result, the people are not pleased with  the Cairo Agreement. Even the question of the detainees and  their release has not been completed the way we would have  liked. Israel turned the issue of the political detainees into  a bargaining chip. All this has frustrated the Palestinian  people.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] In your opinion, what are the drawbacks to  the  Cairo agreement?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] One of the negative points in this agreement  is that it is subject to different interpretations. In the  absence of equality in the balance of power, the stronger party  will prevail. One of the most serious drawbacks is Israel's  control of the crossing points in Rafah and at the Allenby  Bridge. This means that Israel will control all the borders and  exit points of Palestine. We want peace to end the sufferings of  our people. I disagree with the opposition, which is too  emotional in handling the differences with the PLO.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Will you run in the coming elections after  the  establishment of the Palestinian Authority?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] I do not rule out my participation in any  coming elections when the Palestinian Authority is fully  established. When elections are called, I will think about  running. So long as the goal of every Palestinian is to ease the  sufferings of his people, there is no justification for  boycotting an election, if there is one.</p>

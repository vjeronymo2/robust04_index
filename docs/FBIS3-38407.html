			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative, began a new round of  consultations on the Cyprus issue with a meeting with President  Glavkos Kliridhis this morning.    In a statement after the meeting, Gustave Feissel said that  he had a good discussion with President Kliridhis. Feissel  noted: President Kliridhis reaffirmed that the Greek Cypriot  side accepts in principle the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] as outlined in Paragraphs 37, 38, 42, and 43 of the UN  secretary general's report of 1 July 1993. He also said that he  looks forward to hearing from Mr. Butrus-Ghali on how the  process is to move ahead, given the positive reply by the two  sides.    Responding to a question on President Kliridhis' reaction to  the second letter from Rauf Denktas, Mr. Feissel said that it is  known that the secretary general and the Security Council are  guided by the Security Council resolutions. He remarked: There  is nothing new in this. Answering another question on whether  Denktas' second letter had been conveyed to the secretary  general in the correct manner, Mr. Feissel said that President  Kliridhis knows that Rauf Denktas has accepted the CBM's in the  same manner. Feissel added: The next step will be to brief the  secretary general on all the developments and then, I imagine,  Mr. Butrus-Ghali will convey his views, suggestions, and  appraisal on how we should proceed. Asked if he has any dates  in mind, Feissel said that he will not make any forecasts but  added: Both sides have now given a positive response to the  CBM's as they are outlined in the [secretary general's] report  and it is up to Mr. Butrus-Ghali to express his views to both  sides.    Mr. Feissel further noted that a significant element is that  time is valuable; therefore, we should then proceed with the  main goal of the process, which is to reach an overall  settlement. Asked if the three questions raised in President  Kliridhis' letter were discussed, Mr. Feissel said that Denktas'  reply to this correspondence is categorical and added: Rauf  Denktas says that he accepts everything that is in the four  paragraphs of the secretary general's report. Responding to a  remark that Denktas is invoking principles, Mr. Feissel said  that the key is how we accept and interpret the replies by the  two sides. Responding to a question on whether he expects  negotiations to begin before or after the secretary general's  report at the end of February, Mr. Feissel said that he believes  things will have advanced a considerable degree by then. Until  then, the Security Council will wait for the Butrus- Ghali  report so that it may proceed with a detailed review of the  situation. Asked about Joe Clark's report, Feissel said that  the report will be submitted to the secretary general on  Thursday [3 February] at the latest.    In conclusion, Mr. Feissel said that yesterday evening he  had  a meeting with Mr. Robert Lamb who, he added, had come to Cyprus  to support the secretary general's efforts.    In a statement after President Kliridhis' meeting with  Gustave Feissel, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said  that they made an analytical assessment of the situation  following the contacts Mr. Clark and Mr. Feissel had in Athens  and Ankara. Kasoulidhis added: We are waiting for  Butrus-Ghali's reply to the second letter from President  Kliridhis on his position concerning the CBM's.    Gustave Feissel will have a meeting with Rauf Denktas this  afternoon.    Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special Cyprus  coordinator, also began a round of contacts in Nicosia this  morning. Robert Lamb met with President Glavkos Kliridhis at  approximately 0900 today. Robert Lamb avoided making any  statement after his meeting with President Kliridhis. He merely  said that he thinks that talks might be starting now. Lamb  noted: We probably are starting the process of talks.    Commenting on Robert Lamb's statement that the talks might  be  starting now, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that  the discussion had not yet begun.    Robert Lamb then left for the occupied areas to meet with  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Planning your future together - A closer relationship with customers can bring benefits to both sides Hunter Plastics, a manufacturer of pipes and guttering, thought it knew what its customers wanted. But market research came up with some unexpected answers and set the company off on a quest to really get to know its customers. 'That research was our Rubicon,' says Chris Nunn, managing director of the south London company, which has turnover of Pounds 15m and 200 employees. 'We thought that price and quality would be at the top of the list. It turned out that customers wanted service and profits. They are related but different.' Hunter's customers - mostly builders merchants - were looking for products promoted and priced so as to leave them a satisfactory profit margin. They wanted the products delivered at convenient times, in handy quantities with a minimum of hassle. As a result, Hunter has spent the past three years working much more closely with its customers. Buyers have been invited to Hunter's factory to meet staff in production, stores and quality assurance, not just sales. Customers have been visited to discuss their requirements and products, such as a new line of guttering, have been developed. Better ways of running the business have been discussed and Hunter has replaced its cumbersome, labour-intensive method of processing orders with a computerised system. Closer links with certain customers have led to Hunter becoming the single source for some supplies. Nunn says the closer relationship with customers has developed naturally. But the strategy - known as partnership sourcing - has been growing in popularity around the world in recent years. In the UK the Department of Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British Industry have established a joint venture, called Partnership Sourcing, to promote the concept. Hunter was somewhat unusual in suggesting the partnership idea. In other cases of partnership sourcing the impetus has usually come from large companies buying from smaller suppliers. IBM UK, Nissan and British Airways are among the large purchasing organisations featured in one explanatory Partnership Sourcing booklet*. Not surprisingly, suppliers used to the traditional adversarial relationship with buyers have often reacted cautiously to the idea. 'If a buyer has been aggressive for years and then suddenly wants to give you a cuddle there is bound to be some initial suspicion,' comments Norman Hosford, deputy director of Partnership Sourcing. Adapting to relationships based on partnership requires considerable change on the part of both suppliers and purchasers. Companies that commit themselves to a single source of supply run the risk that the supplier could be hit by a strike, go bust or attempt to push up prices. Suppliers that become overdependent on one large customer, or who reveal too much about the details of their business, might also be making themselves vulnerable. What has brought the two sides together in a growing number of instances is the realisation that hard-nosed confrontation, based on price alone, benefits neither side. 'If price is everything, the time comes when the law of diminishing returns begins to apply,' says Malcolm Diamond, managing director of TR Fastenings. TR, based in Uckfield, East Sussex, with sales of Pounds 27m and a workforce of 400, was introduced to the idea of partnership sourcing by a DTI initiative. 'You reach the point where savings don't reflect the time involved,' Diamond says. 'When there is nothing else to grab then something else will go wrong  -deliveries will be late or quality will be poor or inconsistent.' Contacting potential suppliers, sifting through the quotes and selecting the cheapest products from a number of companies is enormously time consuming, Diamond says. It can lead to uneven quality and create an administrative jungle. For basic products such as the nuts and bolts supplied by TR, 80 per cent of the cost to the purchaser goes into handling deliveries, breaking up bulk consignments and getting them to the right place in the production line. For those customers with which TR has reached partnership sourcing agreements - accounting for 30 per cent of the company's turnover - deliveries are made direct to the production line without the need to count or check them for quality. One customer, Worcester Controls, bought more than 800 items at a cost of Pounds 200,000 a year from TR. But 35 items accounted for Pounds 130,000 of the total and involved more than 400 deliveries a month. Each delivery could take up to two weeks to pass through the goods-in and inspection departments before it was available for use. TR's delivery driver now stocks up these 35 items himself with one delivery note per delivery and one invoice each month. Adapting to partnership sourcing does not require sophisticated systems but it does require a change in attitudes on the part of both partners, comments Hosford. Very few partnership sourcing arrangements involve written agreements so they depend to a great degree on trust. Suppliers and purchasers must invest a lot of time and effort in establishing new procedures. In practice they will only do this with companies they have dealt with for many years. 'It is difficult discussing problems with a customer,' says Chris Nunn. 'But if something is going wrong in production or delivery it is better for the customer to know. That is the way a long-term relationship builds up.' Once a supplier can count on such a relationship it is in a better position to make long-term investment plans, says John Edser, managing director of Hatfield-based Applied Digital Devices (ADD), which repairs computer equipment for ICL and others. ICL accounts for half of ADD's Pounds 2m turnover. ADD, which is one of more than 180 partnership suppliers signed up for ICL's vendor accreditation programme, has received help in bringing its quality assurance system up to ISO9000 standard. It has also been encouraged to adopt electronic data interchange (EDI), a paperless method of exchanging orders, and qualify for Investors in People, a government-backed scheme to improve workforce skills. Implementing such new procedures can place enormous pressure on suppliers - ADD has not found it easy changing over to EDI - but it does give a small company access to skills and systems that help it deal with other customers. 'It gives us a competitive edge in the market place and services we can offer to other customers,' Edser says. In theory, partnership sourcing can lead to such close contacts between the two companies involved that the supplier opens his books to the customer. The idea is that this openness allows the customer to see where further cost savings could be made and overcome any fear that the single source supplier is overcharging. In practice open-book accounting has proved extremely controversial and has yet to be implemented by many companies. 'The idea has been raised by a few customers but I would regard it as a little high-handed,' comments Diamond. 'I don't mind showing people my management accounts if they really need them. But I have a certain distaste for the idea. You don't go into a restaurant and ask to look at the kitchen. Anyway production costs can change from month to month.' ADD does not give ICL access to its accounts, though it was asked to do so a few years ago. But ICL does use its partnership sourcing arrangement to maintain tight controls on costs. It expects cost reductions in return for putting more business ADD's way, explains Edser. He calculates that prices have been reduced in three of the past five years and held steady in the other two. The supplier benefits by being able to spread his overhead costs over a bigger volume of business. Partnership sourcing may represent a move away from traditionally adversarial relationships between suppliers and purchasers but it is not a cosy alternative, says Hosford. 'It requires a large investment up-front and continuous, close monitoring. It is not an easy option.' * One of three booklets entitled Partnership Sourcing, Making Partnership Sourcing Happen and Creating Service Partnerships. Pounds 7 each or Pounds 18 the set.

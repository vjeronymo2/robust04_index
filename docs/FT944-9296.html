			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Reynolds voices 'deep regret' in attempt to save coalition Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday launched a last-ditch attempt to hold on to his premiership by expressing 'deep and genuine regret to the Irish people' over the mishandling of a child abuse case that has led to a crisis for his Fianna Fail-led coalition. His undertaking that the bungled extradition of the priest accused in the case 'will never be allowed to happen again in this country' bought a 24-hour delay in a confidence vote now scheduled for today. As Mr Reynolds' Labour party partners last night considered whether to accept his explanation, the future of the 22-month-old coalition hung in the balance. Mr Reynolds' future depends largely on the response today of his deputy, Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader and foreign minister, who is considering joining opposition parties to force a general election. This would come at a critical point in the Northern Ireland peace process as the UK and Irish governments are working on a framework document to provide a durable constitution for Ulster. While the paramilitaries' ceasefire has held for 10 weeks, their participation in the political process is by no means assured. In an atmosphere of tense expectation in the Dail, Mr Reynolds attempted to appease Labour concerns over his appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general who allegedly delayed the priest's extradition, as president of the High Court. In a special debate, he fell short of an outright apology to Mr Spring but said he was committed to restoring trust with his Labour partner. Mr Reynolds urged the House not to let 'a single judicial appointment' jeopardise 'the biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in 25 years'. In an appeal to Mr Spring, the prime minister paid tribute to the Labour leader's role, affirming that 'the success of these negotiations will underwrite the future of this country and history will record Dick Spring's essential contribution to that success'. Labour party backbenchers responded with disappointment. In spite of Mr Reynolds' announcement of immediate reforms in extradition procedures, they felt he had not adequately explained the attorney-general's seven-month delay in extraditing the priest involved in the case. Labour left the House early to evaluate Mr Reynolds' statement. Mr John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael the main opposition party, accused Mr Reynolds of acting as 'a political bully' in the row.

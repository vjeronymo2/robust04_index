This was the aim stressed by the all-Army discipline  inspection work meeting which was held yesterday.    With the approval of the CPC Central Military Commission,  the  General Political Department and the Commission for Discipline  Inspection of the CPC Central Military Commission decided to  call the all-Army discipline inspection work meeting when the  Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for  Discipline Inspection was being held. According to the  instructions given by leaders of the CPC Central Military  Commission, this meeting was mainly to analyze and sum up the  situation and experience of the Army in implementing, in  particular, the work plans of the CPC Central Committee and the  CPC Central Military Commission on combating corruption and  encouraging clean administration and to discuss and draw up a  plan for strengthening the work of building party discipline and  clean administration in the Army.    Xu Huizi, deputy chief of general staff and deputy secretary  of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Military  Commission, presided over the meeting, and Zhou Ziyu, deputy  director of the General Political Department and secretary of  the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Central  Military Commission, delivered a report entitled  "Conscientiously Implementing the Guidelines Laid by the Third  Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection, Doing Well the Building of Party Discipline and  Clean Administration in an In-Depth and Lasting Manner."    In the report, Zhou Ziyu reviewed the greater achievements  scored by the whole Army in the work of combating corruption and  encouraging clean administration in 1993. After that, he said:  If we take measures step by step, we will have clearer  objectives, more appropriate demands, and more concrete  measures, which help promote the work of combating corruption  and encouraging clean administration step by step. The general  response is good.    Regarding the key tasks of planning the work of combating  corruption and encouraging clean administration in the Army in  1994, the report pointed out: It is necessary to understand and  grasp the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean  administration in the Army from the high plane of the overall  situation of state and army building, and the work must be  subordinate to and serve the overall situation of state and army  building. Leading cadres must take the lead in setting an  example to their subordinates in the building of clean  administration, and this is a demand which can never be altered.  However, as far as self-discipline is concerned, efforts must  be made to constantly add more concrete details to it and  substantiate it in light of new conditions. We must continue to  implement, in a conscientious manner, the five stipulations laid  down by the central authorities last year on leading cadres'  honesty and self-discipline. The Third Plenary Session of the  CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection put forward and  restated the five stipulations, and leading army cadres must  carry out them in an exemplary manner. An important mark to  profoundly combat corruption and encourage clean administration  is to accomplish the work of investigating and handling cases.  Party committees at all levels must enhance their leadership of  handling cases, and discipline and law enforcement departments  must handle cases in an impartial manner. We must buttress up  and maintain mass enthusiasm for fighting against negative and  corrupt phenomena and, at the same time, teach and guide party  members and the masses to properly exercise their democratic  rights and to present problems to party organizations in a  down-to-earth manner. Regarding the five outstanding issues of  ideology and work style mentioned by the CPC Central Military  Commission in the decision of enhancing the building of clean  administration, we must keep devoting every effort to solving  them and to consolidating our achievements and scoring greater  success.    As stressed by the report, as far as the work of discipline  inspection in the Army is concerned, we still have a very  important task, that is, we must maintain our party's political  discipline and ensure implementation and enforcement of the  party line, principles, and policies as well as the decisions,  instructions, and orders made by the CPC Central Military  Commission. Party committees and party commissions for  discipline inspection at all levels must teach and guide party  members and cadres to uphold the principle of democratic  centralism to conscientiously subordinate the whole party to the  CPC Central Committee and to maintain a high degree of unity  with the CPC Central Military Commission. When various reform  measures adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the CPC  Central Military Commission are introduced, we must  conscientiously study and grasp their essence, analyze and  predict problems which may arise, and set relevant demands of  discipline on party members to guide their conduct. We must  inspect the situation of implementing relevant reform measures  taken by the CPC Central Committee and of the CPC Central  Military Commission and resolutely redress and seriously handle  misconduct which severely violates political and organizational  disciplines, such as not implementing orders, not enforcing  bans, or each going his own way.    The report called for stronger leadership and a down-  to-earth work style to ensure implementation of the tasks of  combating corruption and encouraging clean administration. To  carry out the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean  administration in an in-depth and lasting manner, we must pay  attention to education and take precautions against corruption,  which is the way to get at the root of the problem. To do a  good job in studies and education, the most essential thing is  to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to arm party members' and cadres' minds,  to foster a correct outlook on life and on value, to lay a solid  ideological foundation against corruption and degeneration, and  to enhance our capability of resisting the corrosive influence  of money worship, radical individualism, and decadent  life-style. All units and departments must proceed from reality  and take such forms as sending teams for investigation to  strengthen supervision and inspection. Units and departments at  each level must be accountable to their immediate superiors.  Supervision and inspection must be linked to cadre assessment,  and whether or not a cadre is honest should be used as an  important yardstick for promoting him. Under the unified  leadership of party committees, all departments of leading  organs must conscientiously bear responsibility for the task of  combating corruption and encouraging clean administration in  accordance with the principle that those who are in charge  should be responsible for it, thus ensuring fulfillment of the  task in their own departments and affiliated organizations.    Members of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection coming from the Army, members of the CPC Central  Military Commission, secretaries of commissions for discipline  inspection of various major units and of the Armed Police  Headquarters, and leading comrades of discipline inspection  departments attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Active session in Fisons THE PRICE of Fisons shares was marked up sharply at the opening as the company announced that Mr John Kerridge had resigned as chairman and chief executive of the group because of ill health. Mr Kerridge had been seen by many as one of the main barriers to workable communication with the stock market. The change also prompted speculation that, with no-one at the helm and the company undervalued on fundamental assets, Fisons may be vulnerable to a bid. Traders revalued the shares by more than 20p, which encouraged sellers who forced the price back to the low 360s. The stock saw good two-way business at that level, ending the day as the most heavily traded issue with a turnover of 14.4m shares and up 11 at 365p. Mr Robin Gilbert of agency broker James Capel said: 'On one hand there was bid speculation. Others took the view that Kerridge's departure is a prelude to something even worse than we have been exposed to so far.' The shares fell 47p in mid-December when the company announced that it had lost Pounds 65m since the US Food and Drug Administration decided to ban the import of two of its products, Opticrom and Imferon. Analysts are looking towards the company's research and development meeting next Wednesday, its first for some years. GRE finds buyers The best performance of any Footsie stock yesterday came from Guardian Royal Exchange, which moved up 5.3 per cent or 9 to 132p in response to talk of an influential broker buy recommendation and very vague hints that a stakebuilder may soon make an appearance. The shares shrugged aside the lingering effects of at least two bearish broker circulars which had pointed out GRE's need for a capital injection. Dealers said the impetus behind the share price rise came from an impending buy note from the insurance team at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland. Charterhouse said it had prepared a 'strong buy' recommendation on GRE but declined to give details. Dealers said the Charterhouse note focused on asset values, notably GRE's Albingia insurance business in Germany, and a Charterhouse assertion that other brokers' estimates of a 50 per cent cut in GRE's dividend may have been overdone. Glaxo fell almost 20p in early trading as investors decided to take profits. Observers said the fall had been prompted by selling in Merck, the worlds biggest pharmaceuticals company, to which Glaxo was recently compared in a US business journal. However, US buyers returned in the afternoon and the shares closed only 5 off at 925p with just over 4m traded. Buying ahead of Friday's annual meeting helped Wellcome to gain 12 to 1053p. BZW was thought to have been behind some strong gains in the oil sector. Shell was 12 higher at 491p, Enterprise 8 firmer at 436p and BP also 8 ahead, at 294p. A sell note issued by the banks team at Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL) kept Standard Chartered, a strong performer since the end of November, in negative territory throughout the day. The stock closed a shade off at 428p. CLL told clients: 'Expect a profits plateau in 1992/93. The inevitable rise in loan loss provisions post 1992/93 will lead to a significant reduction in profit before tax and capital ratios.' Cable and Wireless surged ahead 18 to an all-time closing high of 618p as speculators grew more convinced that a major deal involving the group is in the offing. C and W shares have risen rapidly during recent days amid suggestions that AT&amp;T, of the US, was about to acquire a stake of up to 25 per cent in Mercury, C and W's telecoms division. C and W's previous closing high was 611p, reached on September 8, 1989. Dealers said yesterday's burst of buying followed strong suggestions that AT&amp;T was preparing a blockbuster bid for the whole of C and W. The latter's market capitalisation is approaching Pounds 7bn. 'AT&amp;T is the obvious candidate to buy C and W and it has the means to do so,' commented one leading telecoms analyst. AT&amp;T has stated it wants at least half of its income to come from outside the US by the turn of the century. Turnover in C and W was an above-average 4m shares, following the 3.8m traded on Tuesday when the share price rose 11p. Institutional buyers pushed Bass up 21 to 1070p. Panmure Gordon has the company on its buy list and argues that the stock remains cheap against the rest of the sector. The power generators met selling ahead of the second calls on the stocks. The second payment, of 75p a share, falls due on February 4. National Power held at 129p but PowerGen eased 3 1/2 to 135 1/2 p. A series of profits downgrades, commonly from Pounds 140m to Pounds 125m, failed to damage Blue Circle Industries, which rose 6 to 229p. Wolseley, the building supplies group, put on 6 to 384p after a buy note issued by Nikko Securities. Hazlewood Foods slid 20 to 142p, just above the 1991/92 low of 138p, after a further big profits downgrade by SG Warburg Securities. Mr Mark Lynch at Warburg, who only last Friday reduced his current-year profits estimate from Pounds 58m to Pounds 55m, chopped it again yesterday to Pounds 51m. Chemicals manufacturer MTM continued to see heavy activity on the back of company presentations to institutions hosted by Robert Fleming Securities. The company was signalling 1991 profits of around Pounds 23m and was optimistic about 1992 growth. The shares firmed a penny to 253p with 1.3m traded. Caravans to property group Burndene Investments shot up 56 to 175p as the company announced final profits of Pounds 4.3m against Pounds 3.8m, far better than the market had expected in view of the cautious statement at the interim stage. Vague bid speculation left APV 5 higher at 119p on turnover of 1.6m. British Steel edged ahead 1 1/2 to 68 1/2 p after its broker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, turned buyer of the shares. TI advanced 15 to 580p after the stock was included among County NatWest's top 30 best buys. Smiths Industries gained 10 to 279p after UBS showed a keen interest in the shares. A squeeze was noted in Siebe, which climbed 20 to 558p. There are signs of a resurgence of interest in retailing shares after the bout of substantial underperformance against the market that occurred from mid-December onwards. Worries about Christmas trading and general uncertainty regarding the progress of the economic recession in the UK triggered the steep fall in stores shares in the middle of last month. Analysts are now slightly more optimistic amid talk of better than expected January sales. Provisional retail sales figures for December are expected on January 20 and may give the market a shot in the arm. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (65).

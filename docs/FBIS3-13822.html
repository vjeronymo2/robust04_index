This is because, among other reasons, he fears that the  authorities will use firearms during his arrest. In a letter  sent to his wife, Marzel asserted that he is unarmed and has no  intention of resisting arrest.    Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that Marzel, one of the  leaders of the Kakh movement, has been in hiding from the police  for several weeks.</p>

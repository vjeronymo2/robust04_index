			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Unions criticised over training and flexibility David Goodhart, Labour Editor UNIONS fail to take the lead in vital workplace activities such as training, fostering workplace flexibility and employee involvement, says a submission to the Commons employment committee inquiry into the future of unions which begins its hearings today. The submission, from the Involvement and Participation Association, an organisation supported by both unions and employers, also says that unions could expand their work on individual grievance issues. 'Employees need more support over redundancy procedures, abuse of employee rights and individual contract bargaining,' the IPA says. The association stresses that employee involvement is not dependent on unions, and points to the John Lewis Partnership and Black &amp; Decker as non-union companies with model involvement systems. Yet it also says that individual and collective representation are not alternatives and should complement each other. 'There is a continuing need for a collective voice but if trade unions are to play a beneficial role when the recession lifts they will have to adapt very rapidly to the changes which surround them,' the association says. It states that unions have two main roles: first, as guardians of individual rights and providers of individual services to members; and second as providers of an employee 'voice'. It adds: 'Change is only possible today with employee support, and it is essential for survival. Unions have a particularly important role to play in creating a better balance between job security and job flexibility.' It believes unions should lobby for the maintenance of training budgets and employee involvement activities when times are hard. Unions should also encourage their members to develop mobile skills, thereby giving them greater flexibility. At today's first hearing the Trades Union Congress will call for a change in the law to give workers a legal right to be represented by a union. The TUC says world-class companies recognise unions and that unions in Britain, as in Germany and Japan, are committed to the best standards in employment as the basis for producing the best goods and services. Workers in unions, says the TUC, have better wages and conditions and are better protected against arbitrary employer action. The casualised labour force of the 1990s lacks power in the labour market and so has a greater need for unions, it says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Council for Call and Relief yesterday  denounced the Austrian government's intention to grant its  European Literature Prize to Indian-born British author Salman  Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses.    In a statement it issued, the Council said that the panel of  judges' choice of The Satanic Verses as an example of  contemporary European literature is a shock that arouses  feelings and shows a clear bias and vile prejudice on the part  of the atheists and apostates. It appealed to the Austrian  Government to reject the panel's choice.    The Austrian Ministry of Education and Arts has proposed  that  the prize be not awarded publicly, while Arts Minister Rudolf  Scholten refused to hand it over in secret and postponed the  award ceremony.</p>

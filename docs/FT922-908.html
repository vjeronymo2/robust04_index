			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Investors get ready to deal in HSBC securities INVESTORS in the UK equity and bond markets are preparing to trade in securities issued by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, ahead of today's final closing date of its offer for Midland Bank. Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, said yesterday it would launch an equity option on HSBC shares if the offer for Midland was declared unconditional. HSBC has said that it would list sterling-denominated shares on the London Stock Exchange if the offer went through. The merged bank is likely to be in the top 20 UK companies ranked by market capitalisation. The steering committee which controls the FT-SE 100 Index of leading UK equities ruled earlier this month that HSBC shares will qualify for inclusion in the index. Stock options are increasingly popular with institutional investors as a tool to manage portfolio exposure to individual equities. The option will be the 69th individual stock option traded on Liffe and the first since the exchange merged with the London Traded Options Market in March. The exchange already trades options on Midland Bank shares, which will be phased out when the last outstanding contract expires in December. The HSBC option will follow the same contract specifications as other equity options, with each contract carrying a nine-month expiry date. On Friday, 'grey market' dealing - trading before the issue price has been announced - begins in the Pounds 454m subordinated loan stock offered to Midland shareholders under the offer. Banks not involved in underwriting the bond issue were generally optimistic on the prospects for the deal. Under the revised offer unveiled last month, the 10-year paper will be priced to yield 2.4 per cent more than UK government bonds, more generous than the 1.6 per cent yield spread originally proposed.</p>

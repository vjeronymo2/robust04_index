			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Patten's plans for Hong Kong reform irritate Beijing AMBITIOUS PLANS for demo-cratic reform in Hong Kong were unveiled yesterday by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, to the irritation of China and a mixed reception locally. Opening the 1992-93 session of the Legislative Council, the local legislature, Mr Patten made proposals that would lead to a significant increase in the level of democratic representation at elections due in 1995. Xinhua News Agency, China's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong, which was briefed by Mr Patten on Tuesday, last night accused the governor of ignoring confidentiality, and of irresponsibility. It said Britain had ignored a request from China that the plans should be agreed with Beijing before they were unveiled. It warned that China would not be held responsible for any controversy arising from the unilateral publication of his plans. In addition to political development, Mr Patten outlined a multi-billion Hong Kong-dollar spending programme to improve social welfare and education, and to address the colony's pressing environmental problems. He announced the creation of a Hong Kong Monetary Authority which will result from the merger of the Office of the Exchange Fund - which manages the colony's foreign exchange reserves and sets interest rates - and the office of the Banking Commissioner. Mr Patten flies to Beijing in two weeks to discuss his plans with the Chinese leadership. Mr Martin Lee, a prominent liberal who leads Hong Kong's United Democrats, said Mr Patten had taken the easy way out. Splitting the executive from the legislature was 'retrograde'. 'What he should have done - the right and honourable thing to do - is give us full democracy now and use the next four-and-a-half years to convince China,' Mr Lee said. 'Poll after poll shows that Hong Kong people want democracy although they know China would not approve.' Mr Patten's plan does not include an increase in the number of directly elected seats to the legislative council - 20 in 1995. But it would lead to a significant increase in the level of democratic representation by broadening the franchise for the remaining 40 seats in the legislature. However, Mr Patten said he would continue to press Beijing to accept a greater number of directly elected members of the Legislative Council. 'The pace of democratisation in Hong Kong is, we all know, necessarily constrained,' he said. 'But it is constrained, not stopped dead in its tracks.' The political blueprint will have to be discussed with China, but the governor said his ideas were consistent with the Basic Law - the colony's Beijing-drafted mini-constitution that comes into effect at the end of British rule in 1997 - and followed consultation with the colony's political and community leaders. Mr Patten said his proposals struck a balance between the democratic aspirations of Hong Kong's people and 'the implacable realities of history, geography and economics (which) determine the way in which such views can be applied,' he said. The governor also reshuffled his Executive Council, or quasi-cabinet, and outlined ways in which the Legislative Council could become more effective in monitoring the business of government. He promised more openness and offered to appear before the council each month to take legislators' questions on government policy. Underlining the UK government's support for Mr Patten's plans, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he fully endorsed the governor's proposals 'which represent the best way forward for Hong Kong'.

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Rents for shops begin to rise Shop rents are rising for the first time in three years, Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors, said yesterday, Vanessa Houlder writes. The 1.1 per cent rise in retail rents in April provides the first evidence of a recovery in tenant demand. Although investor demand has pushed property values up sharply since last summer, there have been few signs of any fundamental recovery in the letting market. The rise in shop rents contributed to a 2.4 per cent rise in shop values in April. In the past year, capital values have risen 20.3 per cent. Office rents showed little movement for the third consecutive month. They were down 0.2 per cent in April. The capital value of offices has risen 23.2 per cent during the past year. Industrial premises have also increased in value by 23.2 per cent. The Richard Ellis Monthly index is based on 249 properties valued at a total of more than Pounds 1bn.</p>

The general director of the Board of  Governors is Miguel Mancera Aguayo and the deputy governors are  Guillermo Prieto Fortun, Ariel Buira Siera, Jesus Marco Jacaman,  and Francisco Gil Diaz.    In leaving the Permanent Commission conference room, newsmen  asked Mancera Aguayo whether the nation was facing the risk of  an economic crisis. He answered:    [Begin Mancera recording] Nothing of the sort. The economy  is  very firm. The country has strong reserves and the markets are  calm following yesterday's transactions. [end recording]    Mr. Mancera refused to disclose the exact amount of Banco de  Mexico's international reserves. He said this information is  reported every four months, and added that it is not an  appropriate time now to release this information. He did say,  however, that the bank has attained its highest level of  international reserves ever.    Mancera also commented on the Institutional Revolutionary  Party's [PRI] political situation and its impact on the economy.    [Begin Mancera recording] The prompt designation of a new  PRI  presidential candidate is very desirable. Political calm greatly  contributes to economic stability. [end recording]    The Permanent Commission of Congress will resume its  sessions  Monday.</p>

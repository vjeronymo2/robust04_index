			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Rolls-Royce - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Rolls-Royce's proposed acquisition of Allison Engine makes sound industrial and commercial sense. It takes the UK company into new niches within the defence market - for example, large turbo-prop engines and small engines used by light helicopters - and broadens its offering in civil markets. The deal appears to make financial sense as well, even if Allison has an uninspiring sales record and is only now making a nominal operating profit after three years of losses. For next year, there is little danger of dilution: Rolls-Royce's shares are rated at about 25 times next year's expected earnings and recovery at Allison need not be too pronounced to enhance earnings overall. Thereafter, it may be trickier as, for 1996, the rating drops to more modest levels in line with an expected upsurge in Rolls-Royce profits. But Rolls-Royce has done its sums and predicts 'unbelievable' cost savings as it cuts research and development expenditure further and extracts operating and administrative efficiencies. Revenues are also set to rise as four new engines go into production. The transaction will give Rolls-Royce greater clout with its powerful North American customers, and reduce its vulnerability to fluctuations in the dollar. But the deal does not answer the big question hanging over Rolls-Royce's future, which is whether the UK group has the financial and market muscle to compete with Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric over the long run. Nor does it do anything to remove scepticism about the Rolls-Royce share rating, which is taking rather too much in the way of cyclical recovery for granted.</p>

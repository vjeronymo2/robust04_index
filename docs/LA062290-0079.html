			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE SCHOOLS TO AWARD BUS CONTRACT DESPITE DISPUTE OVER SERVICE;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS SAY THEY STAND BEHIND THE DECISION ALTHOUGH ANOTHER  DISTRICT CANCELED ITS CONTRACT.  </P> <P> Palmdale School District officials said Thursday that they still plan to award  a multimillion-dollar contract to a private bus company, despite learning that  it left hundreds of handicapped students stranded at home for weeks during a  1988 contract dispute in Orange County.  </P> <P> "We certainly don't have any different opinion of Durham Transportation than we  had before," said Forrest McElroy, superintendent of the 11,800-student  Palmdale district. "We think they're a good operator. We think they will do a  fine job."  </P> <P> McElroy's comments followed a Los Angeles Times story on Thursday that reported  Durham's past problems in Orange County. Unaware of those problems, the  Palmdale district's Board of Trustees voted Tuesday to hire Durham -- the  nation's fifth largest school bus operator -- to transport virtually all of the  district's 4,500 bus-riding students starting this fall.  </P> <P> The contract is expected to earn Durham about $3.1 million over three years.  </P> <P> McElroy said he was not troubled by Durham having provided the Palmdale  district with incorrect bid information that made it appear as though the  company still had a contract with the Orange County Superintendent of Schools.  The contract was canceled in mid-1989.  </P> <P> Orange County officials took that action after Durham failed, starting in  September, 1988, to provide enough buses to transport mentally handicapped  children from their homes to schools.  </P> <P> As many as half of the 800 children were left without bus service for several  weeks.  </P> <P> Durham executives have blamed Orange County school officials for not increasing  their payments to cover higher operating costs. A top Orange County school  official this week called Durham's actions "despicable and not very ethical."  </P> <P> After talking Thursday with Orange County school officials, McElroy said he  still stood behind Durham.  </P> <P> He said the company, which operates about 1,900 buses in California, Washington  and Texas, has received favorable reviews from other school districts.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DRUGS: A TRUE EMERGENCY  </P> <P> I've been to homes of parents whose children have been shot on the streets.  Gangs and violence closed good, bright eyes before they could truly see the  world. I've heard people cry in front of a hundred others as we marched to  mourn with them the senseless death of a young person in the wrong place at the  wrong time.  </P> <P> I've taken the phone calls from people in La Jolla and Scripps Ranch who lament  the loss of their children to cocaine, crystal and crack.They did not die on  the streets, but they are dead to work and beauty nevertheless.  </P> <P> So it is with bitter reception that I met the immediate negative undertone in  the questions from media about Mayor O'Connor's call for a "state of  emergency." Time will tell if she is merely passing the buck to the governor.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, for the present, can we appreciate a metaphor? Are we so cynical  that we cannot appreciate a creative political statement -- one that has the  potential to galvanize the people in a way that will produce funds to fight to  save our children, to save our communities? An "emergency" does exist and not  in Southeast San Diego alone.  </P> <P> Our city is under siege today, as more and more drug dealers and crystal makers  from other sections of the country come here to exploit a naive community for  filthy profit.It is an "emergency." The crisis is gradually choking the life  and heart out of our beautiful and great city.  </P> <P> Let's not get trapped in our own strategic technicalities. The facts are  simple: The state has $2.5 billion in unallocated resources, a significant  portion of which must go to schools under the Constitution; the city of San  Diego is suffering death and rising crime in the streets; and we need an  infusion from the surplus to protect our future. But make no mistake about it,  we will expect the city manager to fund the relief effort in this "emergency"  should the governor turn a cold ear to our plea.  </P> <P> HERB L. CAWTHORNE  </P> <P> President and chief executive officer  </P> <P> The Urban League of San Diego  </P></p>

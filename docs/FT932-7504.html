			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' transactions BACK IN January Kenneth Ladd, a non-executive director of St Ives, the printing company, sold 198,000 shares at 318p, since when the share price has underperformed the market. This week Robert Gavron, the chairman, sold 2,013,262 shares and another 1,500,000 non-beneficially, all at 317p, reducing his beneficial holding to 7,218,960 shares. On May 6, the Bank of Scotland announced slightly lower than expected profits for 1992 and an increase in bad debt provisions. Last week Angus Pelham Burn, a non-executive director, sold 42,000 shares at 130p to reduce his holding to 166,226. This sale follows purchases made by two of the banks directors last year at prices between 110 and 119p. In recent months, the company has seen its premium rating eroded. Four directors of Photo-Me International, the manufacturer of coin operated photo booths, exercised options over a total of 145,000 shares. Two of the directors then sold all their new shares; the other two kept about a third to a half of theirs.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 No of Company                     Sector      Shares      Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AAH Holdings                Hlth         2,875         15           1 Adwest Group                EngG        30,000         47           1* Bank of Scotland            Bank        42,000         55           1 Barlows                     Prop       100,000         45           1 Carlisle Group              OthF       100,000         17           1 Haden MacLellan             EngG        25,000         11           1 Jupiter Tyndall             OthF        10,000         16           1 Photo-Me Intl               Misc        45,000        159           2* Reed Intl                   Med         63,200        423           1* Saville Gordon              Metl       200,000         80           1* Schroders Non-Vtg           Merc         3,500         53           1 St Ives                     Pack     2,013,262      6,382           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aberforth Sm Cos Wt         InTr        18,000         12           1 Oliver Group                Stor        48,095         15           2 Osprey Communicatn          Med         50,000         14           1 S'kline Beecham ADR         Hlth         1,000    Dlrs 38           1 Unichem                     Hlth         5,000         12           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

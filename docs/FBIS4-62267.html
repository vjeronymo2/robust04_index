			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Gerasimov under the "Power" rubric: </F> "Struggle for the Post of Turkmenistan President Has Already  Commenced. Rumors Around the Republic Speak of Possible Coup  d'Etat"]    [Text] According to information from trustworthy sources,  the state of health of Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] President  Saparmurad Niyazov continues to worsen every day, and he is  planning a new course of treatment in Houston (United States),  where he recently was operated on for blood vessel problems, or  in Turkey. For this reason he has been absent of late from  ceremonial events including those held in his honor. The  Turkmenia president's press service denies information on  Niyazov's deteriorating health while rumors are circulating in  the Republic about a possible coup d'etat.    The rivalry for the Turkmenian presidency is already on.  Those intending to compete for the position of head of state  are Agriculture Minister Payzgeldy Meredov, and Kurban Orazov,  head of the Mary Oblast administration. Notably, according to  information from trustworthy sources, both "rivals" will not  stop short of a coup d'etat in the president's absence.    Payzgeldy Meredov has headed the republic's agricultural  agency for many years, and he makes his own decisions on the  destinies of Turkmenian cotton by setting prices and export  quotas. As his comrades-in-arms think, he has amassed a vast  fortune selling cotton and is the country's wealthiest man.    Kurban Orazov has long been head of the republic's Mary  Oblast in addition to heading Turkmenistan's central electoral  committee.    President S. Niyazov, who once gambled on these men, lately  has been preferring Valeriy Otchertsov and Boris Shikhmuradov,  vice prime ministers for the economy and politics. They,  however, enjoy no prestige among the republic's inhabitants  because they do not know national peculiarities, traditions, and  the local language. Both vice prime ministers are openly  hostile to one another and compete for influence with President  Niyazov.    Valeriy Otchertsov is a more devoted follower of President  Niyazov. In Soviet times, he held the position of second  secretary of the Komsomol Central Committee and, being Moscow's  protege, controlled local leaders' activities.    Local observers believe that rumors of a possible coup are  being spread mainly by P. Meredov's men in order to psych up the  public for this event. The majority of the Turkmen leadership  gamble precisely on Meredov, regarding Vice Premiers Otchertsov  and Shakhmuradov as temporary executors of the current  Turkmenistan president's will.    In the meantime, leaders of the Turkmenian opposition based  in Moscow are alarmed at the rumors being spread about a  possible coup d'etat in Turkmenistan, and they firmly state that  the opposition, in the shape of the "Turkmenistan" fund  organization, has enough resources and potentialities to hinder  this.    Characterizing the information about a possible coup d'etat  in Turkmenistan, Murat Esenov, an opposition leader and the  "Turkmenistan" fund general director, stated in an interview for  your SEGODNYA correspondent that the actions of P. Meredov and  K. Orazov could entail undesirable consequences for the country.  Due to the absence of a social base and prestige among the  population, they intend to gamble on the "power" ministries in  the struggle for power. Therefore, heads of these ministries  should take into account the experience of their close neighbors  Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where civil war erupted after a  similar situation had developed.    Answering questions from your correspondent, Murat Esenov  confirmed information on the deteriorating state of health of  the head of state and added, "We would be glad to see the  president in good health and compete with him on a legal basis  in the 1997 presidential elections. Members of the opposition  will by all means insist on holding them irrespective of the  referendum results on extending President Niyazov's powers.</p>

It is the first time in almost a quarter of  a century that new trading firms are trying to enter the rice  import business, they said.    Under the designated agent system, established in 1957 when  Japan was still importing rice, the government imports the grain  but consigns the actual importing to approved trading companies.  Japan later halted rice imports, and since there have been no  new participants in the business, although the agency accepts  applications every March. [sentence as received]    The number of designated trading firms has long remained at  about 20, according to the sources.    With the government's decision last December to partially  open the rice market next year, more traders are now eager to  enter the business. The sources refrained from revealing the  number and names of new trading firms that applied this year,  but Okura and Co., a medium-ranked trading firm, said it has  applied.    In order to become a designated agent, a trading firm must  be  a joint-stock corporation set up in Japan with capital of more  than 100 million yen, and must have staff knowledgeable in rice  trading, according to the agency. The agency will examine the  applications and soon announce the results, the sources said.</p>

"It is high time to stop dividing and tearing  apart the once single space of the former USSR. The party of  war, represented by the nationalist opposition, is using the  slogan of vital interests as a pretext for provoking a war. The  party of peace, to which I attribute myself, on the other hand,  intends to build friendly relations with all states of the  former Union," the minister said.</p>

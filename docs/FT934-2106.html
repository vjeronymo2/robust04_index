			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Grupo and GMD start trading on New York SE Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media group, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday after placing Dollars 989m of stock in a secondary equity offering. GMD, Mexico's third largest construction company, also started trading on the NYSE yesterday, after completing an initial public offering for Dollars 283m. It becomes the third Mexican construction company to be listed on the NYSE after an IPO, following ICA and Tribasa. The GMD offering was split 50 per cent in the US, 25 per cent in Mexico and 25 per cent the rest of the world. It was managed by Bear Stearns in the US. Televisa's offering completes a complex stock restructuring that began when Ms Laura Azcarraga sold a portion of her stake in the company earlier this year to Mr Emilio Azcarraga, her brother and company chairman. She also gave him the option to buy the remaining part of her stake between 1994 and 1996, and full voting rights over the shares in the meantime. Mr Azcarraga sold some of his privately held Televisa stock in the public markets partly to finance the purchase of his sister's stake. Other leading shareholders in Televisa also sold some of their stock to bring the total amount on offer to one tenth of the company's capital.</p>

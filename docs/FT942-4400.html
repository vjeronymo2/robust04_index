			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Bonn projects increasing rate of growth The German government yesterday forecast a recovery in economic growth from 1.5 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 1995, and an average growth rate of 3 per cent per year from 1995-98. Figures from the German finance ministry suggest that in spite of a soaring debt burden, fuelled by borrowing for unification, the country will comply by 1998 with the main convergence criteria for European economic and monetary union. It forecasts an inflation rate below 2 per cent in 1995, deficit spending as a proportion of gross domestic product reduced from the current 4.5 per cent to just 0.5 per cent by 1998, and overall government debt (in spite of a surge to 62 per cent in 1995) falling back to 57.5 per cent of GDP by 1998. The limit set in the Maastricht treaty for public sector debt as a proportion of GDP is 60 per cent, and the finance ministry forecast suggests that may only just be achieved by 1997, the first possible date for a move to monetary union. In five-year forecast figures submitted yesterday to the finance planning committee, involving both federal and state governments, the finance ministry suggests that strict spending control would reduce the current DM69bn budget deficit to DM25bn by 1998. The growth figures were presented by Mr Johann Eekhoff, the state secretary in the economics ministry, who warned that, nevertheless, average unemployment this year would rise by some 400,000 over the level of 1993, and only be cut by some 50,000 in 1995. The figures were sharply criticised by finance ministers from several Social Democrat-ruled states as little more than wishful thinking. They failed to provide adequate finances to subsidise the continuing heavy cost of unemployment on the federal budget, and they exaggerated the likely revenues from future privatisation plans, the ministers said. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, insists that he will cut the present budget deficit after 1995, from a level of DM69bn this year and next, to DM60bn in 1996, DM40bn in 1997, and DM25bn in 1998. He said he could do so by strict spending control, and not by increased taxation. Mr Heinz Schleusser, the finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, said the figures were far too optimistic. 'They are simply misleading the public,' he said. 'Neither the states nor local authorities can plan seriously on the basis of these figures.' Nominal spending growth by all public bodies, including the federal government, the 16 states, and local authorities, will be limited to just 3 per cent a year over the next five years, the finance planning committee agreed last night. Mr Waigel warned that the situation of public finances would remain 'very tense' until 1998. In particular, the figures have yet to include any allowance for the gradual introduction of an increased basic tax threshold from 1996, as ordered by the federal constitutional court. The court has called for the basic tax-free allowance to provide a guaranteed subsistence level for the lowest income-earners.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 12  April.    Data collected by the Foreign Investment Superintendency,  Siex, and the National Committee for the Promotion of Foreign  Investments indicate German companies made $43.6 million in  direct investments in Venezuela in 1993. Sven Heldt, president  of the Venezuelan-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has  said most investments focused on the chemical and pharmaceutical  areas. The main investors were Hoechst ($24.9 million), Bayer  ($7.5 million), Siemens ($4.6 million), Schering ($3.5 million),  Wella ($ .8 million), Fichtel and Sachs ($ .6 million), and Viex  Anstalt ($ .6 million) (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in  Spanish 5 April 94 p 22)    The most recent Siex figures indicate foreign investments  reached $3.03 million in March 1994 compared to $30 million in  March 1993, a 90-percent drop. The accumulated investment for  1994 is $21.867 million compared to $33 million for the first  three months of 1993, a 30-percent drop. The major contributors  of foreign capital are Denmark, the United States, the  Netherlands, Switzerland, and Saint Martin. The manufacturing  sector, with $13.5 million, was the main recipient of foreign  capital in the first three months of 1994. Transportation,  storage, and communications also received major investments.  (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 7 April 94 p E-8)    The Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation on 5 April announced a  price increase of its crudes and other products as of 6 April.  Heavy crudes increased by 50 cents, light crudes by $1 per  barrel. Other products increased by 2 to 3 cents per gallon.  Gasoline increased by $2.50, jet fuel by 3 cents, and distilled  products by 2 cents. The decision stems from an increase in  international petroleum prices and an adjustment in the price of  Venezuelan petroleum to the price established by the  international market. This increase established the price of  Venezuelan export petroleum at $12.05 per barrel. (Caracas EL  DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 7 April 94 p 15)    The Central Bank has reported Venezuela paid $783.5 million  of its foreign debt during the second half of 1993. Of that  figure, 5.4 percent was used to pay capital, the rest to pay  interest. Aggregate domestic demand dropped by 5.6 percent in  real terms during the second semester of 1993 due to a  1.2-percent drop in private consumption and 4.1-percent drop in  government consumption.    Investment dropped by 3.3 percent in real terms due to a  12.5-percent drop in public investment. In contrast, private  investment grew by 13.4 percent, fueled by demand from the  construction sector. Hotels and restaurants, commerce,  agriculture, construction, and manufacturing were the most  affected areas. The Central Bank has reported the domestic  public debt amounted to $223.641 million bolivares during the  second half of 1993 in comparison to $156.546 million over the  first half. Treasury bills totaled 30.7 million bolivares during  the first half of 1993 compared to 66.08 million in 1993 over  the second half. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 10 April 94 p  E-8)    Banco Latino spokesmen have reported this bank increased its  cash savings and deposits by 6.19 percent between 4 to 7 April,  the first week following its reopening. Deposits and savings  amounted to 84.961 million bolivares as of 7 April. (Caracas  REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 11 April 94 p 3)</p>

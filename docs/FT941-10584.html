			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Bid to avert environment rows - Guidelines proposed to smooth controversial world trade issues An ambitious attempt to heal the rift between trade, environment and development interests was launched yesterday with the publication of seven key principles designed to guide decision-makers on trade and environment issues. The principles* are the work of a nine-strong expert group brought together by the Canada-based International Institute for Sustainable Development. The group is hoping that the principles will help underpin the current debate in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over its future work on trade and the environment. This work is due to be decided by ministers when they meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round global trade accords. Developing countries have expressed anxiety that rich nations could bar their goods on environmental pretexts. Mr Richard Blackhurst, head of economic research at Gatt, said on Monday that the principles encompassed Third World concerns by opposing protectionism and dealing with the issues of resource transfer and poverty alleviation essential for sustainable development. The seven principles are: Prices of goods and services should reflect their full costs, including environmental costs. Policies should promote equity, especially by tackling Third World poverty, which is a prime cause of environmental degradation. Trade and development policies should respect 'environmental integrity'  - the need to preserve species, ecosystems and the like which cannot necessarily be costed. 'Such special conservation measures may represent an important exception to normal trade rules,' the group says. Subsidiarity - the taking of decisions at the lowest level consistent with effectiveness. In particular, the group says countries should not use trade or other coercive measures to try to eliminate differences in national environmental standards. 'Where there are significant transborder environmental impacts, solutions should be sought multilaterally,' the group says. International co-operation on environment, development and trade policies should be strengthened. The group says international disputes procedures should be capable of addressing simultaneously environment, development and economic interests. Policies should be guided by scientific knowledge and, where uncertainty exists, by the 'precautionary principle'. Decision-making should become more open to public participation, with access to information for all those affected. Dispute settlement procedures should also be transparent, the group says. * Trade and sustainable development principles. Available from IISD, 161 Portage Ave. East, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3B 0Y4.

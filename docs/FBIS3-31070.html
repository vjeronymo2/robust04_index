			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] This morning at 0700 the trade unions  affiliated with the Targu Jiu Lignitul Mining Trade Union  Federation stopped work. [passage omitted]    This information was confirmed by Vasile Chirculescu,  director of production at the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Mining  Corporation, who also added that, quote, the strike has no legal  basis, as it is taking place in the town's center and not in the  miners' workplace, unquote.    Miron Cosma, the chairman of the Confederation of Romania's  Mining Trade Unions, who arrived in Targu Jiu at about 0900,  made a statement to our correspondent saying that the principal  reason behind the strike is the financial blockage, that is, the  fact that the mining industry has been not paid debts of almost  200 billion lei. Another reason is the fact that during the  [January] talks with the prime minister, he hinted at the fact  that by 12 February all problems would be solved. However,  nothing has been done until now, and the promised dialogue in  connection with this labor conflict has not taken place either,  Cosma asserted, adding that the government and the Gorj County  Direction of Labor and Social Protection have violated the law  by avoiding negotiations with the trade unions. According to  Cosma, the strike that began today will be stopped only if a  governmental delegation comes to Targu Jiu and signs a protocol  offering guarantees for strikers' demands to be met.    At this hour several hundred miners from the Gorj County  coal  mining units have gathered in the courtyard of the Targu Jiu  Brown Coal Mining Public Corporation. They are to be joined  later by employees of mining units in Valcea and Mehedinti  counties, reports our correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu.    In connection with the demands expressed by the Lignitul  Mining Trade Union Federation, State Secretary Octavian  Partenie, specially authorized government representative for  relations with the trade unions and employers, pointed out the  following things to our correspondent: The indexation of  salaries, the increase in the reference fund on the basis of  efficiency parameters, and the possibility of negotiating  salaries on the basis of performance criteria have been  partially solved by a draft decision that is to be presented to  the government later this week.    The decision regarding salary indexations will also contain  the text upon which the government has already agreed with the  trade unions. The main problem, namely the issue of the  financial blockage of the entire economy of the country, has  been discussed by the executive over the past several weeks and  they are trying to solve that problem. The brown coal mining  corporation is not facing any difficulty in paying salaries and  other payments to its employees or to pay its taxes and fees to  the state budget, Partenie said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Tatyana Khudobina] There is a New Year  surprise for Vesti viewers in the next report, about the Alpha  special troops unit. It turns out that these are the same kind  of people as us, with the same cares and worries.    There is much more rumor than reliable information about the  Alpha unit. The unknown is always more frightening. In August  1991 Alpha was supposed to storm the White House, but did not do  so. The slogan -- "Hurrah for the Alpha Lieutenants" --  appeared on the Moskva hotel and other buildings.    In October 1993 Alpha did take part in storming the Supreme  Soviet, which was armed to the teeth, and without firing a  single shot. The words -- "Alpha's coming" -- were enough to  make the gunmen drop their weapons. So who are these super  warriors?    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Z. Gindeleyev] The Alpha  anti-terrorist group: a unique military unit and the only one in  the country whose profession is to stop acts of terror. The  unit has dozens of successful operations under its belt,  including the release of hostages from remand cells in Sukhumi,  and from aircraft seized in Tbilisi, Sarapul, Ufa, and Tashkent.  They disarmed the Serov gang in Yerevan and the (?Levshiyants)  band of criminals.    The recent successful operation to free the Rostov  schoolboys  was largely due to the professional skill and patience of Alpha  members.    The first interview with the commanding officer of Alpha in  the entire history of the unit has been given to the Vesti  program.    [G. Zaytsev, Alpha commander; identified by caption]  Analysis  of the crime situation in the country, including the operation  in Mineralnyye Vody, leads to this conclusion: We cannot expect  the level of terrorism to fall. On the contrary, incidences of  not only criminal but also political terror are on the rise and  we must be ready for this. I think that an integrated  anti-terrorism system should be formed and that it should be  directed and coordinated from a single center.    [Gindeleyev] Hero of the Soviet Union Maj-Gen Zaytsev, who  has accounted for 14 terrorists, is worried about the safety of  Russian citizens, although the future of Alpha itself is not  clear during the current reform of the country's security  agencies.

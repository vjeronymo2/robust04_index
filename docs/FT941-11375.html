			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Mr Hosokawa's balancing act Japanese politics is changing fast, as the hostile domestic political reception given to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's latest Y14,000bn (Pounds 84bn) fiscal package, designed to boost the Japanese economic recovery, reveals. Mr Hosokawa's proposed tax package - a combination of immediate income tax cuts and a deferred rise in the consumption tax  - has cautious Ministry of Finance and US government approval. But that, it seems, is no longer enough. Managing a fractious coalition in Japan's new democracy means that the prime minister must take other interests into account, not least the wishes of his coalition partners. The point currently holding up announcement of the economic package is a planned rise in Japan's consumption tax from 3 per cent to 7 per cent from April 1997. The MoF, worried about the profligate tendencies of Japan's politicians, has fought tooth and nail to ensure that the tax package is revenue neutral. It calculates that the Y6,000bn tax cut, the extra welfare spending to soften the blow of the consumption tax increase, and the cost of servicing extra borrowing before that tax rise, would mean a combined cost of Y9,500bn a year after 1997. A 4 percentage point increase in the consumption tax should cover this. US endorsement The US government, keen to see the Japanese government boost consumption, increase imports and so reduce its trade surplus, has consistently opposed this increase in consumption taxation on the grounds that it would jeopardise recovery. But it has also made it clear that a deferred consumption tax rise would be fine so long as the net effect of the package was large enough. How stimulatory Mr Hosokawa's package would actually be will not be known until the full details are released. The MoF's baffling determination to announce the headline value of fiscal packages, while refusing to disclose a baseline figure against which the extra spending and tax cuts could be compared, makes reading Japanese fiscal pronouncements difficult. But the fact that the US Treasury secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, has given a cautious endorsement of the proposed package suggests Mr Hosokawa got the international politics right. Whether the package as planned would deliver the Japanese recovery that the US Treasury wants is more doubtful. The problems in the Japanese banking system and the current strength of the yen suggest that a further easing of monetary policy would be more effective, especially if reinforced by a rise in US rates. But widespread deregulation of the economy is the only way to reduce the trade surplus permanently. Bad miscalculation Yet Mr Hosokawa, flush perhaps from last week's success in forcing through his electoral reform bill, appears to have badly miscalculated domestic opposition to higher consumption taxes, even in deferred form. By renaming the measure a 'people's welfare tax', suggesting a link to higher welfare spending, he appears to have reasoned that, despite Socialist opposition, support from the rest of the coalition and the LDP would carry the measures through. But the strength of opposition across the coalition, the LDP and the Japanese press suggests that Mr Hosokawa may be fighting a losing battle. To ignore the MoF's concerns and simply remove the consumption tax increase from the package would be a mistake. Japanese and international experience suggests that unstable politics can easily lead to fiscal profligacy. But the MoF's insistence on a revenue-neutral package is unnecessarily severe. Even after four previous fiscal packages, the OECD calculates that Japan had a structural (cyclically adjusted) budget surplus equal to 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product last year, compared with deficits of 3.3 per cent in the US, 3.7 per cent in Germany and 5 per cent in the UK. What Japan's prime minister needs is a compromise that satisfies the MoF, holds together the coalition and allows him to pursue the deregulatory agenda that is the key to trade relations with the US. If a smaller rise in the consumption tax is the price of a deal, then the MoF must be prepared to accept it.</p>

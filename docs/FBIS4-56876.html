			<p>BFN     [Text] Last night, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro made a  technical stopover in Accra, Ghana, on his way to South Africa,  where he will attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as that  nation's first black president. Despite the briefness of the  visit, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings declared Castro's  stopover an official visit.    In remarks made in Barbados, where he participated in the  first Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small  Island States, Castro said that in keeping with our  revolutionary convictions, we feel solidarity with all African  nations. He added that Mandela is the leader with the necessary  talent and wisdom required right now in South Africa.    During his last day in Barbados, Castro was moved and  saddened upon throwing a wreath into the Caribbean off the coast  where, 18 years ago, a Cuban commercial plane sank, sabotaged by  individuals paid by the U.S. CIA.</p>

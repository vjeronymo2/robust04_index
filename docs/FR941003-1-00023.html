			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) RIN:0651&hyph;AA66_``Patent Interference Practice_Separate Patentability of Claims,'' 58 FR 39704 (July 26, 1993), reprinted in 1153 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 59 (Aug. 17, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Miscellaneous Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Throughout the rules, the term ``examiner-in-chief'' has been replaced by ``administrative patent judge'' to reflect the change in the title of the members of the Board. See Commissioner's Notice of October 13, 1993, published as ``New Title for Examiners-in-Chief,'' 1156 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 332 (Nov. 9, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.11, it is proposed to amend paragraph (e) to allow access to the file on an interference involving a reissue application once the interference has terminated or an award of priority or judgment has been entered as to all counts. Although it was intended that the public have access to any interference that involves a case which is open to the public and &sect;1.11(b) provides that a reissue application is open to the public, interferences involving reissue applications were inadvertently not included in current &sect;1.11(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.192, which specifies the contents of the brief of an appellant for final hearing in an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  appeal, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) in three respects. The first proposal is to simplify the language used to refer to a brief filed by an applicant who is not represented by a registered practitioner. The second is to delete the requirement that such a brief be in substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (6) and (7), because experience has shown that it is better to evaluate such briefs on a case-by-case basis. The third is to codify the ``good cause'' standard that is currently used to determine whether the Board will consider any arguments or authorities not included in the brief. It is proposed to make clarifying amendments to paragraphs (c), (c)(5) and (c)(5)(ii), to redesignate current paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) as paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(9), and to add new paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) that would require an appellant who has filed an appeal to the Board to identify the real party in interest and any related appeals and interferences. The proposed requirement to identify the real party in interest is derived from Federal Circuit Rule 47.4 and Federal Circuit Form 7. For some time, it has been necessary to know the identity of the real party in interest. This information would permit members of the Board to comply with ethics regulations associated with working on matters in which the member has an interest. The proposed requirement to identify related appeals and interferences is derived in part from Federal Circuit Rule 47.5 and, if adopted, would prevent the Board from entering inconsistent decisions in related cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.601 is proposed to be amended in several ways. Paragraph (f) as proposed to be amended would specify that a count should be sufficiently broad as to encompass the broadest corresponding patentable claim of each of the parties without being so broad as to be unpatentable over the prior art and also to indicate that a phantom count is unpatentable to all parties under the written description requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. Paragraph (g) as proposed to be amended would broaden the definition of ``effective filing date'' to mean the actual filing date when the involved application or patent is not entitled to the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application. Specifically, paragraph (g) would provide that the effective filing date of an application is the filing date of an earlier application accorded to the application under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121 or 365, or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application. The effective filing date of a patent would be defined as the filing date of an earlier application accorded to the patent under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application which matured into the patent. The reference to 35 U.S.C. 121 is included to eliminate any doubt that a divisional application may be entitled to an earlier filing date in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 121. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (j) is proposed to be amended by changing ``which'' to ``that.'' Paragraph (1) is proposed to be amended by changing ``assignee'' to ``assignee of record in the Patent and Trademark Office.'' Paragraph (q) is proposed to be amended by deleting ``a panel of'' as superfluous. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.602 is proposed to be clarified by changing ``within 20 days of'' to ``within 20 days after.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

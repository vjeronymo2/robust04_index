			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis concluded the  first round of his talks in New York and today will go to  Washington for talks with U.S. Government and Senate officials.  Mikhailidhis will meet U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  Talbott; U.S. presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos;  Claiborne Pell, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee; and Senator Paul Sarbanes.    In New York the foreign minister had meetings with the  representatives of all the UN Security Council members except  U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, who was not in New York. He  also had a working luncheon with UN official Marrack Goulding.    In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  correspondent in New York, Mikhailidhis said he was satisfied  with his talks, adding that the Security Council members see the  need for a new opening. He mentioned that he is starting to be  optimistic that continuous involvement by the Security Council,  either the entire council or just the permanent members, in  efforts to find ways to change the basic problem--the lack of  goodwill by the Turkish side--is an idea that is becoming more  acceptable.    Referring to the talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus, and  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, Mikhailidhis said it is  important whether Denktas has accepted the 21 March UN document  in its entirety, not if he has accepted one or the other  provision.    In his statement, the foreign minister said that all  indications show that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  communication with the Security Council about the talks between  Denktas and Feissel will be based on the report that Feissel  will submit to him. Mikhailidhis said this report is expected in  New York soon.</p>

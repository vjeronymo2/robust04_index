			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Efficiency 'must be priority for EU policy': Questions on Europe Edzard Reuter, 66, chairman since 1987 of German industrial group Daimler-Benz. A long-standing member of the Social Democratic Party, Reuter has presided over Daimler-Benz's diversification into the high technology and aerospace business. Can Germany give a lead in attempting to steer Europe out of its political and economic difficulties? There can be no doubt that Germany has an important role to play, as Europe's largest country in terms of population and with its sound economic basis. No European nation alone can face all the challenges. These are problems we need to solve together - because they are European problems. We must remember that Europe does not just consist of the EU. The development of social and economic stability in eastern Europe will greatly influence the future of Europe as a whole. Should the European parliament be given greater powers? An integrated legal system is a pre-requisite for effective relationships with partners outside the EU. I believe that the EU is developing from an economic community into a political union, an internationally recognised political force. This has brought with it many rights, but also many duties, in particular a duty towards political integration incorporating a strong democracy. Where do you think the EU should place its greatest priorities in economic and social policy during the next three to four years? We must strive to improve the structures and efficiency of our economies. That means developing innovative products and gaining access to new markets. We have to exploit our creativity and increase our flexibility. The sooner we do this, the better. Protectionism does not help anyone. We need to be in a position to stand up to worldwide competition. Should the EU during the next few years give priority to deepening the current level of integration of the 12 members, or to widening it towards eastern Europe? Both goals must be pursued simultaneously. What is the earliest EU membership by the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland might be practicable? We must take care not to put the existing community under unnecessary strain. The expansion of the EU must be carried out step by step and not overnight. Is the aim of economic and monetary union by 1997 or 1999 still practicable? Yes - and that I can say with every confidence. The concept for European monetary union revolves around the principle of stability, ruling out the possibility of sudden fluctuations which can produce destructive effects in business. Monetary integration is without a doubt an integral element of economic as well as political integration. What other objectives should the EU follow? Economic integration alone will not be enough to create a stable European Union. The other objectives of the Maastricht Treaty, a common foreign and security policy, must be implemented without undue delay.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (9): Aggression increases - Channel Islands THE Channel Islands may be the legacy of an ancient feudal past, with their loyalty to the English Crown and independence from its parliament. But when it comes to cultivating financial services, they are extremely up-to-date. From a low base in the early 1960s, the financial sector has grown substantially and now compromises around half of national income in both bailiwicks, while employing about one-fifth of the workforce. For a long time, the flows of offshore funds helped keep the economies of the Channel Islands buoyant and sheltered them from the downturn in the UK. As the recession spread throughout the world in 1992, activity began to slow considerably. That has brought a new sense of aggression to the islands. Mr Colin Powell, chief adviser to the states of Jersey, says he has begun running selective seminars and lunches across Europe to encourage new 'high quality business'. There are also negotiations to launch new bilateral arrangements with EC countries for the marketing of financial service products. He claims Jersey coined the phrase 'offshore Europe', to describe the Channel Islands, which are adjacent to the EC and yet free of its requirements - notably the financial services directives. While other onshore European centres with tax advantages such as Luxembourg and Dublin gradually see their privileges eroded, the Channel Islands have no plans to relinquish their special status. Mr Powell sees Switzerland as his main competitor, and says there has been considerable interest from business looking for new offshore centres since that country announced it was considering membership of the European Economic Area and the EC. Marketing efforts by Guernsey are more vigorous still. The island is conscious it has fallen behind Jersey, and is making attempts to catch up. 'When anyone thinks of the Channel Islands, they think of Jersey,' admits one local Guernsey official. The blunt fact is that there are more similarities than there are differences between the two islands, except that Jersey has a larger share of the market. The Channel Islands initially grew as a centre for offshore funds after decolonisation in the 1960s, which left a large number of British expatriates looking for new safe locations in which to live or to deposit money. The contraction of the sterling area and the search for new locations for offshore funds by US banks and other institutions helped boost flows during the 1970s. More recently, a lifting of exchange controls in countries such as Taiwan has helped increase the volume of money looking for a home. Both the principal Channel Islands were able to take advantage of their perceived stability, respectability and historical links to help garner new business. Mr Powell thinks Jersey was able to benefit most because it had already attracted a substantial tourist industry, which brought with it infrastructure of communications, restaurants and hotels. Once financial services followed and legal, accounting and other specialist expertise built up, the momentum rapidly gathered pace. Both islands have attempted to regulate financial services by controlling the quality of institutions which are permitted to set up operations there. The authorities have the power to refuse new admissions, and their policy has been to increasingly reject all but the more prestigious businesses, with a good reputation, healthy profits and a strong regulator in the country of the parent. That does not mean the islands have been free from use as a channel for tax evasion by companies and individuals through bank accounts, the contents of which are shrouded in commercial confidentiality. Neither are the company reporting requirements too arduous. Little public information such as financial performance or even beneficial owners is available for public consumption on the official returns filed by Guernsey and Jersey corporations. But they stress that they have introduced legislation to help co-operate on money laundering and fraud. Both Guernsey and Jersey also proudly point out how they refused application to open branches by the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. There are differences between the two islands. Guernsey is far ahead of Jersey in the cultivation of captive insurance companies - it had the largest net additions for any offshore centre in the world last year. Jersey was impeded by Victorian companies legislation which forbade the creation of insurance companies and which was was only repealed in 1983. In general, the authorities keep one eye on business and the other on what their rival island is doing. The International Business Company is a new concept to be enshrined in both islands' laws this year. It allows companies to pay tax on a sliding scale from less than 1 per cent to more than 20 per cent. The signs are that the market for offshore funds - always insulated from domestic recession - is beginning to recover. Mr Richard Wilkinson, chairman of the Guernsey Fund Managers' Association, draws confidence from a recent survey of his members suggesting that profits will be higher this year than last. Meanwhile, the challenge for the Channel Islands will be to balance the importance of future financial service growth against the needs for other sources of income such as tourism, and the physical constraints and growth policies of the islands as they try to maintain their identity.</p>

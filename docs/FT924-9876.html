			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (7): Desert gas for electricity - Only politics mars Algeria's attractions THE decision of Italy's state electricity company, ENEL, to sign a 20 year contract with Algeria's oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach, reinforces Italy's position as Algeria's principal overseas market for gas. The deal, for delivery of 4bn cubic metres of gas a year starting in 1995, also marks out Italy as the most exciting market for Algerian gas, especially as supplying gas for power stations demands more flexibility from the supplier than other types of contracts. The latest contract confirms the shift in attitude of Sonatrach, a company which has, since 1988, increasingly come to recognise the mutual benefit to be gained from working together with international oil and gas companies and sharing the benefits of their combined resources. The rush of oil companies signing exploration deals with Sonatrach continues. So high is the chance of any company finding gas rather than oil that it was only earlier this year, when exploration terms for gas were improved to an acceptable level, that major oil companies decided the risk was worth taking. The new hydrocarbons law passed last December was the personal achievement of Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the former Minister of Energy, who left the government after the assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf last June. The policies he promoted have, however, been strongly endorsed by the new minister, Mr Hasen Mefti, and the Prime Minister, Mr Belaid Abdesslem. From 1965 to 1977 Mr Abdesslem was the architect of Algeria's energy policy. Since the new law was passed, Sonatrach has signed exploration agreements with Occidental Petroleum, Total, Arco, Mobil, Phillips Petroleum and BP and an important service contract with Halliburton. These come on top of contracts with Total, Cepsa, Agip and Repsol. Apart from the political factor, nearly everything else in Algeria is attractive. The political uncertainty comes from the continuing violence between Islamic fundamentalists groups and the security forces following the cancelling of Algeria's first multiparty elections last January. These events have not affected the guarantees the US, Japan and France are prepared to give for exim-type loans whose proceeds are earmarked for the revamping and extension of the country's existing gas liquefying capacity. Nearly Dollars 1bn worth of loans to this effect have been signed this month. Conditions have changed on two fronts simultaneously. First, Algerian terms for exploration have become more rewarding for gas. Companies searching for oil and finding gas now have a realistic chance of getting a return on their exploration investment. As a result some companies might be willing specifically to look for gas. Another dimension of the new law is that it creates investment opportunities for foreign companies able to enhance production from Algeria's existing oil and gas fields. Rates of recovery had fallen below 20 per cent because Sonatrach lacked the same degree of international experience gained by global operators. Like many countries in the 1970s and the early 1980s, Algeria's drive to assert its own sovereignty over all oil and gas production excluded it from the advanced technology that less closed third world countries such as Indonesia were able to enjoy. Meanwhile, external demand for Algerian gas has grown beyond Sonatrach's current ability to supply it. Sonatrach is also lucky in another respect. As James Ball, director of Gas Matters points out, in a world where greenfield liquefied natural gas projects cost Dollars 4bn for a couple of trains of LNG able to produce 5bn cubic metres of gas a year, the prospect of increasing capacity by 10bn cubic metres a year for half this outlay must be as frightening to competitors as it is comforting to customers. Through the renovation and upgrading project being carried out by the same three companies that built the LNG plants in the late 1960s and 1970s, M. W. Kellogg and Bechtel of the US and Sofregaz of France will increase capacity at LNG plants in Arzew and Skikda from 19bn cubic metres to 32bn cubic metres. Meanwhile, the capacity of the nine year-old trans-Mediterranean pipeline which brings gas to Italy through Tunisia and the Straits of Sicily is being increased from 16bn to 24bn cubic metres. Two or three extra pumping stations in Algeria could boost that figure further. Exports to Spain are to increase and the first supplies are to reach Morocco. Spain, a long established buyer of Algerian LNG, committed itself earlier this spring to continuing its imports at the current level once the gas pipeline scheduled to run through Morocco and under the Straits of Gibraltar is completed. It is to supply Spain with 6bn-7bn cubic metres a year from 1997. The dramatic rise in Spain's gas requirement is largely driven by a policy decision to freeze the nuclear programme in favour of gas fired power. A further 1bn cubic metres will be bought by Morocco. Agreements have already been signed to supply LNG to Turkey and Greece, while newcomers such as Portugal and Germany have expressed interest in buying Algerian gas. The collapse of the US market for LNG, the latest possible victim being a 2.4bn cubic metres contract Sonatrach had signed with Shell US, will free some extra supply for such customers and potential Central European buyers. All in all, Sonatrach has set itself a ceiling of 60bn cubic metres of exports a year by the second half of the 1990s, with commitments of 56bn cubic metres already made. In addition to traditional oil and gas sales, a significant number of spin offs have produced new joint venture opportunities. One of the first such ventures was that between L'Air Liquide, Air Products and Sonatrach to extract helium from the gas stream going into the LNG plants. A much larger joint venture is the expansion of liquid petroleum gas export facilities at Arzew. It encompasses the expansion of the existing 'Jumbo' LPG plant and the increasing of production as a result of an upstream field enhancement project in which Total is playing a key role. The Algerians can only hope political uncertainty will not bedevil their plans, particularly at a time when political and other uncertainties make Russian gas far less secure than it was until the break up of the USSR. Algeria has a window of opportunity which those who manage its oil and gas industry seem intent on exploiting to the full.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            ALGERIAN GAS EXPORT COMMITMENTS AND POSSIBILITIES                   (billion cubic metres per annum)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BUYER                 LNG       LNG            PIPELINE    PIPELINE                       Now firm  possible 1995  firm 1995   possible 1997  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gaz de France          10.3       10.3 Enagas                  3.8        3.8                        6-7 Distrigaz (Belgium)     4.5        4.5 Distrigas (US)          1.25       1.3 Trunkline (US)          1.0        nil Shell Cove Point (US)*  2.4        nil Botas (Turkey)          2.0        3-4 DEPA (Greece)           0.7        0.7 Portugal                           1.8 Italy (SNAM)                       1.4-3         25.25       25.25 Italy (ENEL)                       1.0            4.0         4-6 Northern Europe                    4.0 Slovenia                                          0.6         1.0 Tunisia                                           0.7         1.0 Morocco                                                       1.0 Others                             3.9 TOTAL                  26.39      34.9-43.5      30.55       38.25-41.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Subject to discussions between Shell and Columbia Gas System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SOURCE: GAS MATTERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Letter: Banking on Little England Sir, Mr Russell's point about the UK insurance industry's approach to the EC and 1992 (April 12) is well taken. I have returned to the UK after working in Belgium for 15 years. Although I have a maximum no claims bonus I was hard-pressed to find a UK insurer to allow me to maintain it. Town and Country building society made me feel like a criminal when I asked to open an account because I did not have 'residence in the UK for the last three years'. Natwest Bank, where I regularly cash my Eurocheques, cannot decide whether I have to go to the main counter or to the 'foreign till'. The cheques are, of course, drawn in sterling] I used to believe that, come the single market, UK financial institutions would rise to the challenge.

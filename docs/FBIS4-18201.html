			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No DOC/IP/94/264: "Meeting of the G-24 </F> Brussels Network on Macro-Financial Assistance to Bulgaria,  Romania, and Albania"]    [Text] The Brussels network of the G-24 industrial  countries, co-ordinating official financial assistance to  Central and East Europe at a meeting, held in Brussels on 28  March and chaired by the European Commission, made good progress  in providing balance of payments assistance to Bulgaria and  Romania complementary to financing provided by the IMF and the  World Bank in the context of those countries' new macro-economic  programmes to be supported by IMF stand-by arrangements. The  group also reviewed the situation with respect to G-24  macro-financial assistance in favour of Albania.    In view of the results of this meeting, Vice-president  Christophersen indicated that the Commission will now submit to  the Council of the European Union a proposal increasing the  Union's balance of payments assistance to Bulgaria to up to  ECU150 million. The vice-president also indicated that the  Commission is ready to consider proposing further assistance for  Romania and he urged the Romanian authorities to immediately  complete the agreed prior actions. Mr. Christophersen finally  confirmed that the Commission has now adopted a proposal for a  new balance of payments grant of up to ECU35 million in favour  of Albania. In the case of Bulgaria the G-24 noted with  satisfaction that all the policy measures considered as prior  actions by the IMF were now in place and that subject to  adequate financing assurances from the EC/G-24, the stand-by  arrangement will be considered by the IMF board on 11 April  1994. The G-24 noted that some USD157 million committed by Japan  and several EFTA countries under the previous G-24 assistance  package will be disbursed in the coming weeks on the basis of  the approval of the stand-by arrangement and the new Paris club  rescheduling agreement that would follow. Furthermore, subject  to final approval by the governments of the donor countries, the  European Commission on behalf of the European Union and  representatives from Japan, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden,  Norway, Finland and the Netherlands indicated their intention to  provide additional macro-financial assistance of up to  approximately USD260 million in support of Bulgaria's 1994-95  macro-economic programme.    These financing assurances were necessary for the executive  board of the IMF to consider the new stand-by arrangement and a  second drawing under the systemic transformation facility  (overall some USD420 million during the programme period).  Along with assistance from the IMF and the World Bank, the  EC/G-24 complementary financing will facilitate Bulgaria's  adjustment and reform efforts, will allow for the successful  implementation of the debt and debt service reduction  arrangement recently agreed between Bulgaria and its commercial  creditors, and will alleviate part of the cost of the UN  sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, from which Bulgaria has  considerably suffered.    In the case of Romania, the G-24 took note of the  information  provided by the IMF representative on the progress with respect  to the implementation by the national authorities of the policy  measures considered as prior actions for the new stand-by  arrangement. The European Commission and several G-24  representatives indicated their positive stance and their  readiness to consider new macro-financial assistance in favour  of Romania on the proviso that all the agreed prior actions  required for the IMF programmes are promptly and fully  implemented. The group agreed to hold a pledging session on  Romania as soon as these actions are in place.    Concerning complementary balance of payments assistance to  Albania, of which the principle was agreed at the G-24 high  level meeting held in November 1993, the group noted with  satisfaction that the performance under the enhanced structural  adjustment facility (ESAF) arrangement agreed with the IMF on  July 1993, was satisfactory and that the authorities were  pursuing the agreed macro-economic policies with determination.  The group examined the implementation, in terms of effective  disbursements, of the 1992-93 G-24 assistance package and noted  that some US28 million committed by Japan and several EFTA  countries were expected to be disbursed shortly. Furthermore,  the European Commission indicated its intention to propose  further balance of payments assistance to Albania in the context  of the 1993-94 assistance package and a number of  representatives from EFTA countries also pledged to participate  with additional financing. It was recognized that further  commitments were necessary and that the group should meet again  in the coming months for this purpose.</p>

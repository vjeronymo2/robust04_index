Faced with many difficulties in reform in the new year,  the party finds itself with many different opinions which it has  to address urgently, so it has made necessary preparations for a  grand meeting in March, and therefore news about convening the  Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have  come from the party.  <H3>  CPC Central Committee Plans to Convene Fourth Plenary  Session in Early March </H3>   On 3 February, the CPC Central Committee General Office  telephoned various ministries, commissions, and offices under  the central authorities, the party committees of various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and various  arms of service and the party committees of major military  regions, telling them that the CPC Central Committee planned to  convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, that various party committees should usher in the  plenary session with actual work results, and that they would be  kept informed of the exact date of the session.    Ding Guangen, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee, disclosed during a meeting with party and government  leaders from Guangdong on 5 February that the Central Committee  planned to convene the Fourth Plenary Session on 5 March or so,  and that the session would last for three or four days.    A newsletter from the CPC Central Committee, dated 5  February, disclosed that Jiang Zemin said when meeting non-party  celebrities that the CPC Central Committee planned to convene  the Fourth Plenary Session to strengthen understanding, unify  thinking, and standardize action regarding some important issues  at this time. He earnestly hoped non-party persons could offer  ideas, proposals, and criticisms concerning the current work by  the Central Committee, for non-party persons have a unique  understanding of many conditions.  <H3>  Hu Jintao: Usher in the Fourth Plenary Session With  Consensus </H3>   The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee also disclosed  that the theme at the Fourth Plenary Session is to further  foster consensus and standardize action on maintaining a  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy; to unify thinking on how to expedite the building of  the socialist market economy, and on how to establish an  integral and open market system which is characterized by  orderly competition; and to summarize work in strengthening  construction of leading party groups of various levels and the  work in self-construction of party members, in particular, the  issue of the recent anticorruption drive within the party will  be addressed and new arrangements will be made. In addition,  the session will also have to examine the topics to be discussed  and adopted by the second session of the Eighth National  People's Congress.    Hu Jintao said at a work meeting of the Secretariat in early  February: The party's essential work must be to get rid of  interference from controversies on nonessential topics within  the party; and it is necessary to usher in the Fourth Plenary  Session with unified understanding, unified thinking, and  standardized action.    People are waiting to see if the Fourth Plenary Session can  solve the contradictions and difficulties faced by the party.</p>

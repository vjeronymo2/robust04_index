At its opening on 21 May German and Austrian  politicians called on the Czech Republic to enter into a  dialogue with the Sudeten Germans. Theo Waigel, German finance  minister and leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union,  welcomed and expressed his support for the progress of the  Czech Republic toward joining the European Union. However, he  also said that the Czech Government should officially distance  itself from the Benes decrees of 1945 [ordering confiscation of  Sudeten Germans' property] and declare them invalid.    As he did in a recent article in the weekly newspaper  SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock  again drew an indirect parallel between the postwar expulsion of  Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia and ethnic cleansing in the  present Balkan war.

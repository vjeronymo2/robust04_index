That, in plain language, would be the  meaning of the stand it has now taken on Kashmir, if it decides  to stick by that stand.    It has stated that the next round of talks between the two  countries must focus on the modalities and time schedule for  holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. Such an agenda can be agreed  upon between the two countries only if, and only after, they  have agreed, at least in principle, that a plebiscite is to be  held and the time has come to sort out the modalities. Since no  agreement of the kind has been reached as yet and none is in  sight, the agenda stipulated by Pakistan puts the cart before  the horse.    Why has Pakistan done so? One part of its motivation is  clear  enough. By making such a proposal Pakistan is trying to convince  what remains of its constituency in Kashmir that it is still  working for the Valley's exit from India. It is also trying to  convince the people of Pakistan that while the Mujahideen may  have failed to tire India out of the Valley, Pakistan has not  lost its zest for its parallel tussle with India on the  diplomatic front. Nor has it lost diplomatic initiative despite  India making the first move in suggesting a substantial and  constructive agenda for the next round of talks between the two  countries.    There is very little India can or needs to do about this  part  of Pakistan's game plan. It is a matter which lies between  Pakistan on the one hand and on the other those who have put  their faith in Pakistan's ability to undo, by one means or  another, the State's accession to India. India can only wait  while they come to terms with the realities. India's concern  needs to be more with what Pakistan may be attempting to convey  to the United States by these tactics.    What Pakistan is seeking to do at that level is to blackmail  the United States and other peace-makers into putting further  pressure on India on its behalf, and by that means to scare  India into making further concessions quickly in order to spare  itself the pain of these pressures. This is a subtler game than  Pakistan has played so far, which makes it all the more  necessary for India to avoid either of the two opposite kinds of  diplomatic fumbling, one by showing too much flexibility and the  other by showing too little. Too much would only whet the  appetite of Pakistan and the secessionists, too little would  narrow the opportunities which have opened up in Kashmir thanks  to the recent successes in the fight against terrorism.    The blackmail Pakistan is attempting may seem to be  convoluted. But its logic is quite simple, and it may well  persuade those decision-makers in Washington who, as recent  events have shown, are either intentionally unfriendly or lack  the knowledge or the patience to understand the complex  situations in far off South Asia.    An important part of Washington's concern about Kashmir has  long been known to be an outcome of its concern over the nuclear  intentions or capability of India and Pakistan. The argument it  puts forward is that so long as the issue of Kashmir is not  resolved, there will always be the risk of a war between the two  countries, and in anticipation of it each country will be  tempted to arm itself with nuclear weapons. That will only  aggravate the possibility that either may use them, whether  pre-emptively or when faced with imminent defeat in a  conventional war.    Pakistan is now playing judo with this argument, by using  its  force to flip it over and stand it on its head. It has been  proclaiming from the highest policy-making levels--for instance  through Mr. Moeen Qureshi when he was the Prime Minister of  Pakistan, and much favoured by the American establishment  because of his commitment to economic liberalisation, and more  recently through the current Foreign Minister--that there is a  linkage between Pakistan's nuclear policy and its demands  regarding Kashmir.    More simply stated what this means is that if America is  interested in forestalling a conventional war in South Asia  which might escalate into a nuclear war, then it must pile more  pressure on India until Pakistan's demands with regard to  Kashmir are met. Reluctant as yet to go along with that, the  United States has been urging both countries to enter into  purposeful talks. But talks do not suit Pakistan's book. A  deadlock does, and better still a breakdown, because then  Pakistan can resume the game of playing upon America's anxiety  to prevent any serious escalation of the risk of war by  neutralising India on Kashmir.    India checkmated Pakistan when it not only agreed to put  Kashmir on the agenda of the recent talks but also accepted  Pakistan's demand that this subject be given a separate and  pre-eminent slot. India gained some more when Pakistan admitted  that the talks on Kashmir had been "serious." And then, even  before that round ended, a distinct possibility arose that the  two countries might yet put themselves on the track of  substantial and long-term negotiations because India indicated  its willingness to make a series of proposals, some on very  substantial issues, and from which much good could come for both  countries if the talks continued to be serious and purposeful  and if Pakistan refrained from making the Indian proposals a  hostage to its own.    Pakistan has now tried to stymie that chance with its demand  that the focus of the next round of talks must be on the  modalities of a plebiscite. Pakistan probably expects that it  stands to gain no matter which way India moves. If India accepts  the demand, Pakistan earns the gratitude of the secessionists.  If India rejects it, Pakistan can proclaim that the negotiating  exercise has been thwarted by India, and India must be subjected  to further and perhaps terminal pressure, while Pakistan escapes  the embarrassment of having to discuss India's six proposals.  Pakistan is simultaneously trying to give teeth to this logic by  stepping up military actions along the border to make it look  more likely that the only alternative to America pressing India  harder diplomatically would be a military conflict in South Asia.    Therefore it is necessary for India to move on a dual track.  On the one hand it must prepare itself, seriously and sincerely,  for the next round of talks. To this end it should consider  whether there is any way it can further enrich its own  proposals, and at the same time hold its patience if Pakistan  insists on putting the modalities of a plebiscite on the agenda.  If and when that item is reached there will be time enough to  argue the absurdity of it, but it must not be India that turns  its back on the negotiating table.    At the same time Indian security forces must avoid the kind  of overreaction they committed on January 27 because it plays  straight into the hands of Pakistan's scare tactics.    On the other track India must anticipate the blackmailing of  America which Pakistan is sure to begin as soon as it can find  an excuse to say that it is India which has brought the talks to  a dead-end. This again will require simultaneous movement on  many axes. Despite the insensitivity or ignorance of many in the  American administration, and the prejudice of a few, the actual  score on the negotiating table must be kept as clearly before as  many Americans as may be possible.    This will test India's own patience also of course, and the  competence of the lobbying agency which has just been engaged  will have to go through an early baptism of trial under fire.    A tougher axis will be for the effort which must be made at  the same time to carry conviction with America at the highest  level, that while India will go as far as it possibly can to win  back the confidence and allegiance of the people of the State of  Jammu and Kashmir--especially now, when the situation on the  ground is rather more auspicious than it was before--it will not  place the State either at the disposal of Pakistan's ambition to  complete what it holds to be the "unfinished task" of  partitioning India along religious lines, nor will it make the  State available for any next generation of strategic games that  the United States might be cooking up, as China suspects it is,  against the new enemy America is inventing for itself.    But the toughest axis is going to be the one on which India  will have to make up its own mind on what and how it will face  whatever it might have to face once it decides that it cannot  bow any further to American interests or prejudices.    India has already seen on the economic front that even a  good  policy like deregulation of the economy can do much harm if it  has to be tailored constantly to the values and demands of those  who pull the strings, and is not governed sufficiently by  India's own needs and conditions for optimum benefit. But such  harm is nothing compared with what can ensue if in an abject and  unwarranted spirit of helplessness India gives in to pressures  on Kashmir which may be wholly incompatible with the country's  territorial and, what is more important, social integrity. After  doing its best for obtaining America's understanding, India must  learn to do without it if that becomes necessary.  *</p>

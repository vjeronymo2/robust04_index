			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: US seeks a balance with proposed export licensing legislation Sir, Your February 24 article, 'Radical reform of US export licensing proposed', discusses the US administration's proposal for a new Export Administration Act. For the first time in more than a decade, the executive branch has put forward draft legislation that balances national security, foreign policy and economic concerns. Regarding several points the article raises, Cocom will not 'be replaced by the expansion of multilateral groups'. Our goal to expand membership of existing multilateral non-proliferation regimes is different from what we seek in discussions with Cocom partners to establish a new arrangement to control sensitive dual-use items and conventional weapons to regions and countries of concern. Rather than a 'shift' decisively in favour of business we believe our bill strikes an appropriate balance between national security and economic competitiveness. Economic impact on US companies, while considered in our proposed control review process, does not mandate any automatic de-control. We are committed to using unilateral controls only when absolutely necessary. Our proposed revised dispute resolution system maintains the roles of the national security agencies in licensing reviews, while continuing the commerce department chairmanship. Several new features, including strict time-lines, improve the process and the accountability of all involved. Your article also states that 'the number of products for which licenses are needed will be vastly reduced and the licensing process will be simplified'. Our bill would simplify the process, but it would not automatically de-control any exports. The number of products (notably computers and telecommunications) for which licenses are required has been reduced in recent months by separate action. Finally, Iran and Iraq will not 'be allowed to buy more sophisticated digital computers'. These countries will remain under broad trade restrictions because of their unacceptable policies.

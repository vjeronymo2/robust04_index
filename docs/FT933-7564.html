			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Stakis likely to buy Rex Leisure Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, is believed to be close to agreeing the purchase of Rex Leisure, a privately-owned Coventry-based company which runs the Rubicon casinos in Coventry, Wolverhampton and Northampton. The Glasgow-based company, which returned to profit last year after heavy losses and write-offs in 1991, recently signalled its intention to make acquisitions. Last month it raised Pounds 9.6m by a share placing. Of the proceeds Pounds 5.85m is being used to buy a 128-room hotel in York, at present managed by Holiday Inns (UK). The balance was for other acquisitions. Stakis refused to comment yesterday.</p>

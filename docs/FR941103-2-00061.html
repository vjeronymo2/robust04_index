			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To illustrate the process, the transformation of the FY 1995 Work Program into the final FY 1995 Budget is outlined below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) (The commentor) reviewed the FY 1995 Work Program and had opportunity to make suggested changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The revised FY 1995 Work Program became the FY 1995 Internal Review Budget. At this point, more changes were made. Those changes then were reviewed by Western. Further changes, usually a lowering of spending projections, are common in this stage of budget preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The FY 1995 Internal Review Budget was then sent to Washington to be approved by DOE. There are usually reductions in spending estimates at this stage, as well, dictated by DOE's spending priorities. The DOE-approved budget was called the FY 1995 OMB Budget Request and was sent to that agency for review and approval. Any changes were then incorporated into a document called the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Finally, the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission went before Congress, where any final changes desired by the legislative branch of Government were made. Only after it was approved by Congress after public debate was the final FY 1995 Budget determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission was officially sent to Congress in January 1993. When the April 1994 rate brochure PRSs were being prepared, the data in the FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission/1995 Work Program was already more than 2 years old (having begun as the FY 1994 Work Program in early 1992). Because of this timing, most of the information was outdated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western had completed turning the FY 1995 Work Program into the FY 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional Budget Submission by that time. As is usually the case, some of the planned expenditures had been deleted in the process. Further, because of extra impetus to keep costs down, a Western-wide decision was made in which O&amp;M costs would be allowed to rise only 2-percent per year between FYs 1994 and 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In keeping with Western's policy to set rates at the lowest possible level consistent with sound business principles, Western used data from the lower-cost (and more current) FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission rather than that in the customer-reviewed FY 1995 Work Program in the Rate Brochure PRS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When Reclamation, Western, and CREDA entered into the September 1992 agreement, the parties did not anticipate that expenditure plans would change significantly between the Work Program review and the congressional budget submission. Events have proved otherwise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

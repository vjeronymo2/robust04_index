			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 10 Jun (MENA)--Muhammad Mu'tasim Hakim,  spokesman for the Sudanese opposition Democratic Unionist Party  [DUP], has denied newspaper reports that Sudanese opposition  radio will transmit programs from Cairo.    In a statement to MENA, he said that Sudanese opposition has  never thought of setting up a radio in Egypt or in any other  Arab country to beam at Sudan.    He asserted that the Sudanese opposition is eager to improve  relations between Egypt and Sudan and that opposition radio will  transmit in the coming days from an undisclosed location. He  explained that the transmission will be for two hours daily, one  hour in the morning and one in the evening. He added that the  broadcast will contain programs for the Sudanese people to  uncover the Islamic front's plots in Sudan.    He said the radio will be called "The Opposition National  Democratic Grouping Radio." He added that the grouping consists  of the DUP led by Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani, the Ummah Party,  the Popular Movement led by Colonel John Garang, the southern  parties, the Sudanese Communist Party, the Sudanese National  Party, and 51 workers unions and federations, in addition to the  Sudanese Army's legitimate command.</p>

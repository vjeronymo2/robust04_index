			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Mikhail Nikulin from </F> Tajikistan; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Announcer Boris Kostenko] Russia's 201st Motor Rifle  Division has held a tactical exercise in Tajikistan.    [Nikulin] This was some exercise. The young tank crews of  Russia's 201st Motor Rifle Division pitted their skills against  mountainous conditions, and tested their ability to withstand 40  degree heat. The latest combat materiel was also tried out. As  the military usually say in such circumstances, the exercises  were carried out with great skill and many tactical and combat  objectives were achieved.    But we were interested in something else. The exercise  coincided with the inter-Tajik talks in Tehran. Furthermore,  the shooting at practice targets was carried out very close to  the border. What is this, then? A display of strength or a  flexing of muscles?    [Begin B. Melnik, deputy commander of a tank regiment,  recording] That cannot be said. We are carrying out routine  summer combat training. But everybody knows that the officers  and men of the 201st Motor Rifle Division are stationed on the  border, are protecting the Tajik border. The 201st Division is  stationed there together with the Armed Forces of Tajikistan and  Russia's border troops. So, those who wanted to test the  division and its muscle already know and feel its power. [end  recording]    [Nikulin] The border where the men of the 201st Division are  serving with Russian border guards as part of the CIS collective  peacekeeping forces continues to be unsettled. According to  authoritative sources, Tajik opposition guerrillas in  Afghanistan are continuing to transfer their armed formations  toward the Pamir sector of the border.</p>

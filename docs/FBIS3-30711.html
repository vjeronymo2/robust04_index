			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, Feb 3 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  Slovakia overdrew the credit in the clearing with the Czech  Republic by $50 million, Vice-Governor of the Slovak National  Bank (NBS) Marian Jusko tells the opposition SME. The balance  is exceptional and it should be reduced substantially in next  months, he adds.    Half of the January amount resulted from paying installment  for credit drawn sooner, the balance will presumably be lower  later on, Jusko says.    The foreign reserves of the NBS, excluding gold, reached  $384.7 million as of January 31, Jusko reports. [passage omitted]</p>

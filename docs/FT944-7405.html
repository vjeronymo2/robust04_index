			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Dollar takes its lead from firmer US treasuries The dollar yesterday took its lead from the firmer US treasury market, to finish higher on the day, writes Philip Gawith. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond dropped below 8 per cent for the first time in five weeks, and this set the tone for the dollar, rather than the continued weakness in equity markets. The US currency closed in London at DM1.5537, from DM1.5536, and at Y98.335 from Y98.075. In New York it finished at DM1.5565 and Y98.455. Short-term interest rate futures were also beneficiaries of the weaker equity markets, investors assuming that this diminished the need for higher interest rates. The March 1995 short sterling contract ended at 93.09, up from 92.98. The Italian lira stabilised following losses after it was announced that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, would be investigated in connection with corruption charges. The lira finished at L1,034 per D-Mark from L1,033. Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade weighted index closing at 79.9 from 79.8. Analysts have likened the behaviour of markets this week to the 1987 crash, albeit on a smaller scale. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, noted that in the two weeks after the 1987 crash, the bond market rose by 10 points, while most G7 short-term rates were cut. These moves were prompted by fears of systemic risk in the banking system, and poss-ible damage to consumer con-fidence and corporate investment. This time round, though, while the fall in equity markets did not compare with 1987, 'the thought processes and price action have been similar', said Mr Parsons. Referring to the firmer short sterling prices, he said markets regarded falling equity prices as an effective monetary tightening, in the same way that declining bond prices earlier in the year amounted to a monetary tightening. 'The pace of rate rises is going to be nothing like the pace which the market is currently discounting,' said Mr Parsons. He added that it made little sense that the UK yield curve was steeper than the Italian yield curve. The spread between March and September 95 short sterling contracts was 105 basis points, compared to a 98 basis-point spread for the equivalent Eurolira contracts. Traders said that turnover in the dollar had been quite brisk, in spite of markets winding down ahead of today's US Thanksgiving holiday. Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank, said this time round the dollar was benefiting from its link with the bond market. For much of the year, weakness in the US bond market has been a factor in dragging the currency down. He said the fact that the dollar tracked bonds, rather than equities, was probably a reflection of capital flows; foreign investors have larger holdings of bonds than equities in the US. Mr Burke added that the dollar appeared to be fairly well supported, given the way it had reacted to what had been a potentially serious blow to sentiment. He cited this as further evidence that the dollar was on a recovery path. Mr Michael Gallagher, director of IDEA in London, said nervous equity markets were ambiguous for the dollar. On the one hand, foreign divestment from US equities, and the feeling that the next tightening of Fed policy would be delayed, were negative for the dollar. On the other hand, tumbling world stock markets could prompt US mutual funds to repatriate some of their offshore investments. This would help the dollar. Analysts said the stability in the lira probably reflected the fact that the market is already pricing in a lot of bad news, including Mr Berlusconi's possible resignation. Mr Gallagher said a survey of clients showed that most felt the lira would not slip below L1,045-50 should he resign as prime minister. Elsewhere in Europe, the focus today shifts to the Bundesbank council meeting. Mr Gallagher said a lower than expected October M3 money supply figure had renewed speculation that the Bundesbank 'might give us an early Christmas present (in the form of lower interest rates)'. Overnight money traded between 2 per cent and 5 1/4 per cent as the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 600m day's shortage in UK money markets.</p>

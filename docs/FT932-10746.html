			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Directors try to get CrossRail moving LEADING FIGURES from the private sector yesterday mounted a campaign to end the delay on the Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme, the biggest public transport project planned for central London. They called on the government to demonstrate its commitment to the scheme by allowing the CrossRail bill, currently held up in parliament, to go forward to a second reading before parliament recesses for the summer. The CrossRail scheme involves building a pair of rail tunnels under central London which would allow trains from east or west to run through the City and West End. It was postponed in March following a decision by the government that it should only go ahead if it could be jointly funded by the private sector. The campaign is being organised by London First, the private-sector group of 59 companies formed last October to lobby on behalf of the capital. It has brought together by businesspeople such as Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, Sir Colin Marshall, chairman and chief executive of British Airways, and Mr Peter Foy, senior partner of McKinsey &amp; Company. Mr Foy said there was a danger of deadlock because the government was not prepared to take the bill forward without private-sector participation and the private sector was not prepared to join in until the bill had been passed.</p>

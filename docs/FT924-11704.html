			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hanson hits out at RHM demerger plan HANSON condemned Ranks Hovis McDougall's demerger plan as 'ill-conceived' and attacked the milling, baking and grocery company's record in the offer document it posted to its target's shareholders yesterday. RHM again urged its shareholders to reject the offer. The terms, 220p in cash for the ordinary shares and par for the preference shares, values the whole company at Pounds 790m. In a letter to RHM shareholders Lord Hanson, chairman of the Anglo-American conglomerate, said: 'Your board's defensive proposal to break up your company has confirmed our view that change is required.' He continued that 'the split would create three companies of much less significance, with an uncertain future and uncertain values.' Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, said the management of the three parts would be unchanged. 'What is going to happen to deliver value to shareholders?' he asked. He said the milling and baking division had failed to do anything about the changing trends in that market. In the grocery products side it was 'difficult to see a rational approach to the management of a brand portfolio'. Hanson's brand management skills were displayed in its Imperial Tobacco cigarette business and its Seven Seas vitamin subsidiary. RHM riposted, saying: 'Hanson is well known as a purchaser of businesses at below their true value and is trying to do the same with RHM'. Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman of RHM, said: 'Hanson's document ignores the fact that the offer price sits 27p below the current market price of 247p'. During the day RHM shares rose 2p to 249p, and Hanson shares were 1p higher at 233p. Hanson's document says that RHM's earnings per share record since 1988 is worse than other leading competitors. Its share price has underperformed the stock market and the food manufacturing sector since the 465p offer from Goodman Fielder Wattie was rejected in 1988. It contrasted statements by RHM management about expansion and acquisition plans with subsequent disposals. For example, in 1988 RHM paid Pounds 80m for the Shredded Wheat breakfast cereal business and said it was part of a plan to grow a strong breakfast cereal business. Within two years RHM had sold all its breakfast cereal interests. Hanson also said the demerger plan was complex, lengthy and uncertain while its cash bid offered certainty. Dalgety said yesterday that Federal Bakeries, the business it sold to RHM a week ago for up to Pounds 28m, including debt repayment, had net assets of Pounds 14m and made a trading profit of Pounds 2m in the year to the end of June. RHM now has two weeks to produce a defence document. Hanson's offer could run until December 22, or longer if there is a rival bid, but the first closing date has been set at November 13.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin Hacthoun] </F>   [Text] Havana, 11 Jan (PL) -- John Savage, prime minister  of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, who is heading a  mission on an official visit here, today explored the  possibility of expanding commercial ties in Cuban agriculture  and industry.    Savage was greeted by Jose Gonzalez Torres, vice minister of  agriculture, and Marcos Portal, minister of basic industry, who  briefed him on different aspects and propspects in their  respective ministries.    Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of Ministers, and  Public Health Minister Julio Teja Perez also met with Savage and  members of his retinue.    The visitor expressed an interest in the ongoing  transformation of Cuban agriculture, the large state farms, and  basic production cooperatives wherein land is turned over to  farmworkers and peasants who are then given work tools and  credit.    There are currently four forms of land property in Cuba:  small private peasant holdings, peasant cooperatives, new basic  production units, and state production units, which will be  considerably reduced.    The state controls 70 percent of all cultivable land in the  country. It is estimated that by the end of the transformation,  the state will retain barely 20 percent, according to figures  submitted by Gonzalez Torres.    As for the farming sector, in which the two countries  maintain traditional ties, the visitors expressed great interest  in obtaining Cuban fruits and fresh vegetables. They explored  the possibility of investing capital through joint ventures, for  which Savage estimated "there are real opportunities."    The Canadian visitors and Minister Portal studied Canada's  participation in Cuban mining. Several Canadian companies are  already participating in nickel, gold, and copper mining in  Cuba, as well as in other fields, such as rubber production.    "I believe there are many opportunities that deserve to be  exploited. Our objective precisely is to strengthen such ties  for our mutual benefit," Savage stated. He visited the island  with 17 representatives from Nova Scotia who want to negotiate  with Cuba.    The economic reforms promoted by the Cuban Government,  specifically opening up ties to foreign capital, have elicited  great interest among businessmen, who hope to explore such  possibilities, Andre Hare, trade director of Nova Scotia, told  PRENSA LATINA.    "We really do not want to arrive too late and want to get  here before others do," Hare said.    Savage is accompanied by businessmen on the tight agenda of  meetings that he is holding with his island counterparts.    Hare noted that 35 meetings were held Monday, 55 others are  scheduled for Tuesday, while a memorandum of agreements is being  drafted.    Savage, a career physician, also visited a family doctor's  clinic, a health clinic in the neighborhood, and was greeted at  the Ameijeiras Brothers Modern Hospital.    The prime minister of Nova Scotia will be declared  illustrious guest of honor of Havana and will be given the keys  to the city at a ceremony on Wednesday. Before ending his  official visit on Thursday, he will hold meetings with  specialists in the Cuban biotechnological industry, and Nicolas  Rodriguez, acting foreign minister, according to the agenda.</p>

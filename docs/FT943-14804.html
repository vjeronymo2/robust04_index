			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Hong Kong plan for age pension The Hong Kong government, usually noted for being non-interventionist, yesterday proposed an old-age pension scheme requiring compulsory contributions from personal and corporate taxpayers, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The territory, which has a comparatively low tax regime, has minimal welfare services and no pension scheme for its aged residents. But it has recently debated the establishment of a government-administered scheme similar to Singapore's. Under a consultation paper issued for comment, Hong Kong workers and companies would have to contribute 1.5 per cent of earnings to a pension fund that would be run by a non-government body. The government would also have to contribute about HKDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 100.8m) in 1994 on behalf of its civil servants.</p>

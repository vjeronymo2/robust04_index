			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CABLE TV PACT MAY BE NEGOTIATED  </P> <P> Cable television may finally be coming to Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> Dimension Cable Services, which serves about 20,000 subscribers on the Palos  Verdes Peninsula, has announced that its budget next year includes the costs of  wiring the three-square-mile community.  </P> <P> However, construction of the system depends on whether Dimension and the city  reach agreement on a franchise. City Manager Terrence Belanger said  negotiations will probably begin early next year.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills is the only South Bay city without cable television service.  Because of its rugged terrain and low density, cable companies have been  reluctant to invest there.  </P> <P> However, Dimension would have to spend less than other companies to serve  Rolling Hills because it could use antennas and other equipment already  installed to serve neighboring communities.  </P> <P> A Dimension spokesman said it could cost twice as much per mile to wire Rolling  Hills as other cities, and that the company could wind up spending $1 million  on the job. Whether residents would pay higher subscription fees than those in  neighboring cities depends on the franchise agreement and other factors,  another spokesman said.  </P> <P> Basic cable service costs $18.95 a month in Rancho Palos Verdes. Dimension is a  subsidiary of Times Mirror Cable Television Inc., a sister company of the Los  Angeles Times.  </P></p>

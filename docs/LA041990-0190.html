			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> NEW SMOKING RULES URGED FOR EATERIES  </P> <P> This city, which considers itself a leader in regulations against cigarette  smokers, took two more steps this week to clear smoke from city restaurants.  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously to ask city staff to write a city ordinance  requiring restaurants to provide at least 60% of their space for nonsmokers.  </P> <P> The ordinance also would give restaurant owners the option of banning smoking  altogether.  </P> <P> Mario Mendoza, the manager of Ron's in Laguna, spoke against the proposed  ordinance.  </P> <P> "We're a fine dining restaurant," Mendoza said. "We depend on customers who  smoke and drink alcohol. Couldn't you leave it up to the patron as to whether  or not he chooses to go there?"  </P> <P> Since 1985 when the city approved its first regulations on smoking in public  places, City Councilman Neil G. Fitzpatrick said Laguna Beach has fallen behind  other cities that have adopted stricter regulations. While current city law  requires Laguna Beach restaurant owners to provide only 25% of their space for  nonsmokers, cities such as Irvine require that 50% of restaurant space be set  aside for nonsmokers and Beverly Hills requires 60%, he said.  </P> <P> "This city was the first in the county to have a ban on smoking in particular  locations, including restaurants," Fitzpatrick said. "The screw is being turned  tighter all the time on smoking and I think it's time to add additional  restrictions."  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance will have two additional public hearings before it is  adopted into law, City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger said.LEN HALL  </P></p>

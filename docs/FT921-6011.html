			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Residency and stocks I EXPECT to become resident in the UK after an absence of several years. I am aware of the desirability of closing share income sources for tax purposes before my return. Does this include selling gated British Government stocks: ie stocks whose interest is tax free to overseas residents. No, because (a) there is no prospective CGT -bill and (b) the fact that income tax will be deducted at source as soon as you become ordinarily - resident in the UK will prevent the interest from being assessed -on the preceding-year basis (by virtue of section 67(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

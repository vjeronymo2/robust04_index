			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Observer: Inside job If Rupert Murdoch's men really are intent on bringing down Britain's monarch they have certainly done their homework. The Times' timely wall chart celebrating the 350th anniversary of Britain's civil war shows an unusually sharp attention to detail. It puts the number of people killed at 84,738, and another 117,534 were taken prisoner. There is also a big puff for John Pym, King Charles' number one enemy in Parliament, whom the Times describes as a 'man of genius'. Could this be any relation to John Pym, text editor of yesterday's wall chart?</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Outhwaite backed by underwriter MR RICHARD OUTHWAITE, the Lloyd's underwriter at the centre of the biggest civil action in the history of the London insurance market, could not have foreseen the scale of potential asbestos claims when he underwrote a number of loss-making contracts in 1982, the High Court was told yesterday by another prominent underwriter. A 987-strong group of Names, who face insurance losses of more than Pounds 200m, are taking the action against RHM Outhwaite Underwriting Agency and 81 other Lloyd's agents who placed them on syndicate 317/661 in 1982. Appearing as an expert witness for Mr Outhwaite, Mr Richard Hazell, a deputy chairman of Lloyd's, told the court: 'If Richard Outhwaite was living in a cocoon, we all were.' Mr Outhwaite had been entitled to trust the information provided to him by Lloyd's insurance brokers. The case continues today.</p>

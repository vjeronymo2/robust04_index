It praised the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. It said that  this alliance constitutes a political drive of the large-scale  massive rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and is solid  ground for unifying our people in their confrontation of the  dangers threatening them.    The Islamic Jihad statement added: Toppling those who are  negotiating with the Zionists in the name of our people requires  an extensive popular action to prove to the whole world that  this desperate team does not represent our people, and  therefore, cannot determine their future. This team's  agreements are not binding on our people. We must all move  within cohesive national ranks to show the whole world that  those negotiators only represent themselves and parochial  interests.    The Islamic Jihad in Palestine called on the valiant people  of the revolution to direct their bullets to the chests of the  occupiers.    On the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan, the month  of  jihad and sacrifices, it said: We call on all the sons of our  people to strictly adhere to God's teachings, to safeguard the  sanctity of the blessed month, to abide by the principles of the  true religion, to carry out more acts of jihad, and to escalate  the intifadah activities. It declared 6 February a day of  comprehensive strike and popular indignation all over Palestine.</p>

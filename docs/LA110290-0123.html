			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER TRAPPED 2 HOURS BY CAVE-IN AT HOTEL  SITE  </P> <P> A 25-year-old construction worker suffered minor injuries Thursday after being  trapped for more than two hours in a cave-in at a Glendale hotel construction  site where a similar accident in August killed another worker.  </P> <P> Two dozen firefighters and city crews worked carefully to free John Jehlik of  Long Beach, who was trapped chest-deep in dirt at the bottom of a 15-foot-deep  sinkhole on Glenoaks Boulevard.  </P> <P> On Aug. 10, Enrique Ayala, a 33-year-old drilling company foreman, was buried  head-first in another cave-in. A series of trenches is being dug alongside the  Verdugo Wash and filled with concrete to anchor an 18-story Red Lion hotel.  </P> <P> Cal/OSHA concluded that no negligence was involved in Ayala's death, said  spokesman Rick Rice. But after sending two investigators to the scene Thursday,  the state ordered the site closed until officials meet today with companies  working on the project, Rice said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Peshawar June 25 -- In a sudden move, the head of  his own faction of Hezb-e Eslami Afghanistan Maulvi Mohammad  Yunes Khales has announced his candidature for the presidentship  of Afghanistan. This has been done at a time when Borhanoddin  Rabbani had categorically refused to quit the presidency while  his chief adversary Golboddin Hekmatyar, was desperately engaged  in evolving some strategy to pull down the sitting President.    The timing for the announcement were coincided with the  efforts to hold a meeting of the Afghan leadership in Jalalabad  to reach a consensus on the interim set-up in Kabul to replace  President Rabbani and prepare the ground for a permanent  settlement. The proposed meeting had already run into  difficulties as only three leaders including former president  Sibghatollah Mojaddedi, Prime Minister Hekmatyar and Karim  Khalidi of the Hezb e Wahdat (Shiite) had so far reached the  venue while Yunes Khales had refused to associate himself with  any of their plans.    Similarly, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, Rasool Sayyaf and Syed  Ahmad Gillani, too had neither showed up in Jalalabad nor were  traceable. Sources in Nangarhar capital said the leaders already  present there were hectically [word as published] trying to  contact the missing leadership in order to give the Jalalabad  summit a representative look. However, the sources added it was  not an easy task to persuade the absentees to join in unless  some of their preconditions had been included in the agenda.  The sources without elaborating, added that the conditions  virtually amounted to securing certain guarantees. Besides, the  missing leaders have not been so enthusiastic about the summit  in Jalalabad as they believed that in view of the rigid stand  taken by President Rabbani and his allies, it could hardly serve  any purpose. These view were also shared by some other major  groups including leading commanders.    Meanwhile, Maulvi Yunes Khales, while announcing his  candidature, claimed in a statement that he had been persuaded  by the commanders, Ulema and the elders to run for the  Presidency. He said "I consider it my duty as a Mujahid and  religious scholar to accept this responsibility." He regretted  that no stable and Islamic government had been established so  far in the free Afghanistan. On the contrary he believed the  anti-Islamic forces had become more powerful. In this  connection, all the attempts initiated to set things right and  restore reconciliation and peace, had failed and even the  leadership council had failed to resolve the crisis. He said  now that the Afghan government was about to come to an end, he  was duty bound to come to the rescue of the country. He also  announced a five-point charter for running the affairs of the  country.    In a related development, the seminar of Afghan Leaders,  Ulema, scholars and commanders initiated by Herat Governor,  Ismail Khan, which was earlier postponed is now being held  Sunday (June 26). The response to the seminar, too has been  much below expectations with the Coordination Council having  already decided to abstain. In all probability, the seminar,  convened to discuss the Afghan situation in detail and suggest  measures to end the deadlock, would hardly affect the overall  scenario obtaining in the country for the last more than a year.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Maverick poses an interesting question THERE HAVE been several attempts to provide British chancellors with independent outside advice. Nigel Lawson had a Group of Independent Economic Advisers (soon christened 'Gooies'). This had the advantage that it discussed a wide range of economic questions and did not confine itself to forecasts. Its disadvantage was that its proceedings were oral and that no record was available to members. Norman Lamont's Panel of Independent Forecasters has the advantage that its members submit papers which are published in a convenient volume. Its disadvantage is that the chancellor has tried to confine it to forecasts, a much overrated activity. There is, however, a chance that the Lamont panel will turn out to be more interesting than either the chancellor or the official Treasury intended. This is because of its three maverick members - in alphabetical order, Tim Congdon, Patrick Minford, and Wynne Godley - who show no intention of confining themselves to a series of numerical guesses about GDP a few quarters ahead. Indeed Congdon has just made a strong attack on the present fashion of simply looking for predictive indicators and has insisted on understanding the forces behind economic changes in a paper in the April issue of the Gerrard &amp; National Economic Review. He is concerned to argue that excessive or deficient money balances are the causes of changes in the national income and not merely an advance warning. But is not this what all monetarists believe? Apparently not. For Congdon's main argument is not with the orthodox panellists, but with fellow monetarists such as Minford who discuss the money supply mainly as an indicator of present or future activity. Indeed they have little option. For Minford's favoured indicator has been 'M0', which is mainly notes and coins and which no one in the British debate has claimed is an actual cause of changes in activity or prices. Although I have some sympathy for Minford on another issue - the supply side changes since 1979 - Congdon seems to me more nearly right on the monetary side. For if you can identify some of the causal processes you are much more likely to understand the economy and to avoid policy mistakes than if you simply go by the economic tea leaves. None of this means that any school of monetarists has at last found a key to securing stability at low inflation. Congdon's own greatest triumph was his diagnosis of inflationary overheating in the mid-1980s - when neither Minford-type monetarists nor the official Treasury could see cause for concern. Unfortunately, however, a detail of definition played a crucial element in Congdon's predictive success. His diagnosis was made in terms of Pounds M3, which had been the target aggregate for well over a decade. But this aggregate was becoming more and more unsuitable as it omitted for instance building society deposits which were becoming an increasingly important part of the money supply, as Congdon himself came to recognise. The broader aggregate, M4, which takes these into account, and for which the Treasury now has a monitoring range, did not give nearly as clear cut a sign that something was wrong. Some kind of test is now looming. M0 is above its monitoring range. What its most discerning supporters claim is that it is a good indicator of what is already happening. If they are right the turn-up in economic activity now taking place is much more vigorous than the modest sprouting of green shoots which is all that the government claims. On the other hand, if the advocates of broad money targeting are right, whatever recovery is now happening will turn into dust and ashes before the year is out. Congdon is, however, careful to avoid saying just this. He reminds us that 'the drop in interest rates has made interest-bearing deposits a less attractive asset to hold . . . this behaviour may be able to stimulate demand for a few quarters even if money growth is modest'. One can agree with him that 'eventually' faster broad money growth will be required to sustain recovery. But broad money growth is not something that either just happens. It would be most likely to occur if there is a rise in business borrowing which the government does not need to knock on the head by high interest rates. So no school of monetarists has got the causality quite right.</p>

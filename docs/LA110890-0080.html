			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INCUMBENTS' MONEY ADVANTAGE DECISIVE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: ELECTION RESULTS INDICATE THAT CHALLENGERS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE AGAINST  WELL-FINANCED OFFICEHOLDERS.  </P> <P> Abortion. Taxes. The budget. All were important in determining the outcome of  the 1990 elections but perhaps the single most decisive factor in many  campaigns was something the candidates never mentioned: How much money they had  to spend.  </P> <P> With a few notable exceptions, the results of Tuesday's election reinforced the  basic tenet of American politics that well-financed incumbents are almost  impossible to beat.  </P> <P> Not even the apparent wave of anti-incumbent sentiment that engulfed the nation  during the recent battle over the budget was sufficient to overcome the  financial advantage of most incumbents.  </P> <P> "The big story of this election was that incumbents were insulated by money, in  spite of the incredible frustration that many voters felt," said Ellen Miller,  executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a think tank that  specializes in studying campaign financing.  </P> <P> The disparity in spending between incumbents and challengers was worse this  year than in any recent election, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common  Cause, a group that advocates campaign finance reform.  </P> <P> "You've clearly got a rigged political system," he added.  </P> <P> According to Federal Election Commission records on campaign spending through  Oct. 17, congressional incumbents spent $214.8 million in advance of the 1990  elections -- nearly four times more than the $60 million available to  challengers in those same races.  </P> <P> Subsequently, about 96% of House incumbents were reelected. All but one  incumbent senator won -- the highest return rate in the Senate since 1856.  </P> <P> "When incumbents in the Senate are able to outspend their opponents by  three-to-one and House incumbents enjoy a nine-to-one money advantage over  challengers, there is little reason to expect much turnover in Congress," said  Joan Claybrook, president of Ralph Nadar's Public Citizen, another advocate for  campaign finance reform.  </P> <P> "As has been the case in most recent elections, money talked and challengers  walked."  </P> <P> Nowhere was the advantage of money more apparent than in races where incumbents  such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Reps. Denny Smith (R-Ore.), Craig T.  James (R-Fla.) and Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) were targeted for defeat by the  opposing party. A surprisingly large number of these targeted incumbents were  able to withstand strong challenges with the help of a substantial cash  advantage.  </P> <P> There were some exceptions to this rule of financial dominance, of course.  </P> <P> Most notable was the victory of Democrat Paul Wellstone, who spent only  $781,000 against one of the Senate's most skillful fund-raisers, Sen. Rudy  Boschwitz (R-Minn.). Boschwitz spent almost $6.3 million.  </P> <P> In addition, Republican Christine Todd Whitman, with expenditures of $465,000,  nearly defeated Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who spent $10.5 million.  </P> <P> Political scientist Norman Ornstein said that the Boschwitz and Bradley races  prove that reformers such as Miller, Wertheimer and Claybrook sometimes  overstate the role that money plays in guaranteeing the reelection of  incumbents.  </P> <P> "It is a big thing, but it is not everything," he said. "It's not as if you've  got an electorate that is a bunch of Stepford Wives who are willing to reelect  every incumbent."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the reformers believe that Boschwitz and Bradley encountered  trouble at the polls in part because their opponents made an issue of their  enormous campaign war chests. Wellstone gained attention by joking about his  lack of funds; Whitman publicly challenged Bradley to adhere to a $3-million  spending limit, but the incumbent refused.  </P> <P> "Wellstone was able to hang the money issue around Boschwitz's neck like a  millstone," Miller said. "In Boschwitz's case it became an embarrassment of  riches."  </P> <P> In Florida, likewise, Gov.-elect Lawton Chiles, who defeated incumbent Bob  Martinez, capitalized upon voter frustration with big-money candidates by  refusing to accept contributions in excess of $100.  </P> <P> Challengers in the most hotly contested Senate races were woefully underfunded,  according to FEC records of expenditures prior to Oct. 17.  </P> <P> Sen. Paul Simon spent about $8 million, or twice as much as his opponent, Rep.  Lynn Martin (R-Ill.); Sen.-elect Hank Brown (R-Colo.) spent $3.1 million, or  almost three times as much as his opponent, Josie Heath; Helms' $15-million  expenditure was more than three times the money spent by his opponent, Harvey  Gantt.  </P> <P> In House races where targeted incumbents won despite expectations that they  would lose, the incumbent consistently had a spending advantage. Annunzio spent  $686,670 through Oct. 17, compared to $246,600 spent by his opponent, Walter W.  Dudycz.  </P> <P> James spent $787,650, compared to $519,000 spent by his opponent, Reid Hughes.  And Smith spent $696,638, compared to $560,600 by his opponent.  </P> <P> Money appears to have been what saved Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) against a  tough challenge by Democrat David Worley. Gingrich spent $1 million; Worley  spent $267,000, and some experts suggested that the challenger could have won  with more money.  </P> <P> Even incumbents themselves acknowledge that their biggest advantage is often  money.  </P> <P> "If a guy has a $300,000 cannon to aim at his district, that helps a lot," said  Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland). "It's a horrid difficulty for non-incumbents  trying to make a crack in this system."  </P> <P> In some rare cases, a challenger actually spent more money than the incumbent.  In Rhode Island, for example, Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete was defeated by  Democrat Bruce Sundlun, who outspent him, two to one.  </P> <P> But just as money does not necessarily guarantee victory for an incumbent, it  cannot save an otherwise weak challenger. Case in point: Jim Salomon spent  $297,100 to challenge Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles). Beilenson  spent only $80,300 and won.  </P></p>

The Russian vessel, apparently a patrol boat, forced the  83rd  Kintoku Maru and the 18th Tenyu Maru to stop on Wednesday  morning as they were sailing in waters 20 kilometers south of  Etorofu, one of the four disputed islands held by Russia. The  two trawlers were taken to Shikotan, also one of the four  Russian-held and Japanese-claimed islands, and underwent  inspection by Russian authorities, they said.    The Tenyu Maru with a crew of 16, based in Ishinomaki,  Miyagi  Prefecture, was released later that day and returned to Kushiro  on Thursday morning but the whereabouts of the Kintoku Maru also  with 16 crew members from Kushiro is still not known, the  officials said. The Kintoku Maru and its crew are believed to  be detained there, the officials said.    The two vessels had been engaged in fishing operations south  of the Kuril chain of islands under a fishing agreement between  Japan and Russia. Disputes over sovereignty of the four islands  -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai groups of islets  -- have marred relations between the two countries.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Revenue misses accuracy targets A quarter of self-employed tax returns processed by the Inland Revenue last year were not right first time, according to details of a survey released yesterday. Nine per cent of returns processed for schedule E taxpayers - employees and pensioners - also contained some inaccuracies, the figures showed. To attain its targets, the Revenue is not allowed a single error with a tax consequence in the returns, which are randomly selected from across the country. The survey was conducted in a pilot exercise as part of efforts to get bills right first time. The accuracy rates were below the planned targets for the year 1994-95, which were 93 per cent for schedule E and 82 per cent for self-employed taxpayers. The Revenue also released details yesterday of three new targets for its services to the public: to deal with every aspect of people's tax affairs correctly first time; to answer telephone calls in 30 seconds; and to deal with repayment claims within 42 days during peak periods and 28 days at other times of year. It stressed that it was continuing to aim for its existing objectives: to reply to correspondence within 28 days and to attend to callers to its tax inquiry centres within 15 minutes.</p>

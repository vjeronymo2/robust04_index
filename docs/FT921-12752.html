			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Leukaemia link with low radiation proved A STUDY of the UK nuclear workforce has proved for the first time that long-term exposure to low doses of radiation carries an increased risk of leukaemia. Scientists at the National Radiological Protection Board have analysed the records of 95,000 past and present workers in civil and military nuclear plants, of whom 6,600 have died. Among the 50 deaths from leukaemia there was a clear statistical link with the workers' radiation doses. The board also found a correlation between all cancer deaths (1,800) and radiation exposure, although that did not reach the scientific threshold for 'statistical significance'. A recent study in the US failed to detect any risk from exposure. The board's report, published today, suggests that the risk of developing cancer through radiation exposure is twice as great as the International Commission on Radiological Protection assumes in its latest recommended dose limits. Those are based on studies of people who have received large radiation doses in a very short time - mainly Japanese survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs. Anti-nuclear groups seized on the board's report as ammunition for their attack on the industry. Greenpeace called for the immediate closure of all nuclear plants. Mr Simon Boxer, Greenpeace nuclear campaigner, said: 'This is yet further proof that the nuclear dream has turned into a nightmare.' Dr Patrick Green of Friends of the Earth said the board's analysis justified an immediate tightening in occupational radiation dose limits. Nuclear Electric called the study 'good news' because it confirmed the 'healthy worker effect'. Death rates among the nuclear workforce are 20 per cent below those in the general population - and mortality from most cancers is also lower - because the nuclear industry tends to recruit healthy people. Mr Martyn Day, a London solicitor acting for several nuclear workers who are suing for compensation after contracting leukaemia, said the board's study would provide strong evidence to support their cases. 'Every time a major new report comes out, it shows that the risks of radiation are worse than previously thought,' he said.</p>

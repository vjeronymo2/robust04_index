			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Deficit deepens at Van Roll Von Roll, the Swiss steel and engineering group, revealed that losses ballooned last year to SFr441m (Dollars 306.25m), following losses of SFr55m in 1992 and SFr30m in 1991. Sales eased 6 per cent to SFr1.9bn. In a show of rare candour for an industrialist, Mr Heinz Frech, the retiring managing director, admitted that 'we have made some very grave errors'. The trading loss of SFr106m, compared with a budgeted SFr10m profit, was a 'fiasco', Mr Frech said, while restructuring charges of SFr333m were causing a liquidity haemorrhage. The group is closing a steelworks and a forge in Switzerland, at a cost of SFr98m. It has disposed of a venture into producing monorail trains, described by Mr Frech as a debacle, at a cost of SFr50m. 'We clearly underestimated the international complexity of the monorail business, and poorly evaluated the market potential and likely order flow,' he said. Rationalisation at the Isola wire and cable subsidiary, acquired in 1989 to offset the steel and building cycles, absorbed a further SFr96m. And there were more charges on a toxic waste disposal plant in the US. The plant, which started up two years late because of blocking manoeuvres by environmentalists had, Mr Frech said, been hit by a run of bad luck. Some of the plant's sensitive equipment froze during a cold snap. Shareholders' funds, following a SFr300m boost from a revaluation of fixed assets and liquidation of hidden reserves, were SFr351m at the end of 1993, 14.5 per cent of total assets. Mr Max Amstutz, incoming managing director, said the group aimed to break even this year.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Directors reject Icahn's bid for E-II Holdings MR CARL ICAHN has been rejected in his multi-billion dollar bid for E-II Holdings, the bankrupt parent company of Samsonite luggage, Culligan water softener and McGregor clothing. The creditors committee of E-II advised the directors to turn down the Dollars 1.8bn all-cash offer made last week. E-II has its own reorganisation plan that will be put before a bankruptcy court on Monday. The directors agreed with the rejection, saying that the reorganisation plan was 'in the best interests of all of E-II's constituencies, including its subsidiaries and employees,' because it allowed creditors to share in any appreciation in the value of the company. The creditors committee indicated in its response to the bid that it 'was sceptical that a sale of E-II's assets at this time would maximise value'. But, a company statement added, the committee noted it would recommend that the new board, which will take office after consummation of the reorganisation plan, 'give con-sideration to' Mr Icahn's proposal. E-II said yesterday that it was filing in court modifications to its reorganisation plan which would reflect a higher liquidation value and would provide 'a recovery to creditors in excess of the recovery which would have been received by them under a proposal made by Carl Icahn, had that proposal been capable of being implemented'. The company said that, from studying the offer, 'it became obvious that there were no firm financing arrangements supporting the Icahn proposal, and that the Icahn proposal did not take into consideration a number of critical legal and financial requirements for confirmation or the significance to the company of the settlements reached with certain creditors'. Mr Icahn, who owns almost 32 per cent of the group's junior bonds, reacted by saying that E-II 'has finally admitted what we charged all along - that the values used in formulating the plan were materially understated to the dis-advantage of the junior creditors'. Earlier, he said after his offer was rejected that he would be at Monday's court hearing 'with the cash'.</p>

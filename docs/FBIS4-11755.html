			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio talk between anchorman 'Adi Talmor in Tel Aviv and </F> correspondent Sefi Hendler in Cairo -- live]    [Text] [Talmor] The PLO and Israel signed an agreement on  security arrangements for the Arab residents of Hebron a short  while ago. This paves the way for the resumption of  negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First. Our correspondent in Cairo  Sefi Hendler attended the brief signing ceremony. Here is his  report:    [Hendler] Good afternoon. After having become accustomed to  the DOP -- the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the  Palestinians -- we will now have to learn a new acronym, TIPH:  Temporary International Presence in Hebron [acronym and  preceding five words in English]. This is the name of the  international force that will be composed of 160 soldiers from  Norway, Denmark, and Italy. The agreement stipulates that these  soldiers, who will have the status of civilian observers, will  be permitted to carry personal handguns for self-defense  purposes only. This force will deploy in Hebron for three  months. If at the conclusion of this period, the Palestinians  and Israelis are jointly interested in extending the observers'  mandate, then this will be possible. The goals of the TIPH --  the international force to be deployed in Hebron -- are  specified in the agreement, copies of which were handed out to  correspondents a short time ago in Cairo. The goals are as  follows: One, to give the Palestinians a sense of security.  Two, to maintain stability in Hebron in order to guarantee the  safety and wellbeing of local residents. Three, to supervise  the efforts to restore the Palestinians' sense of security and  to allow life to return to normal in Hebron. Four, to report on  developments in Hebron to several bodies: first and foremost to  a special Hebron committee which will be comprised of two  representatives from each side, including the mayor of Hebron  and the head of the Civil Administration in Hebron. The Hebron  committee will report to a subcommittee which will be  established within the framework of negotiations on the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles. The United  States and Russia, the cosponsors of the peace process, will  also establish a committee that will be briefed by the  multinational force deployed in Hebron.    The second part of today's agreement deals with the  implementation of Gaza-Jericho First. It stipulates that the  discussions on the implemention of Gaza-Jericho First will  resume today. We understood that this constitutes a temporary,  and not very significant piece of news which was only noted in  order to prove that the negotiations on the implementation of  Gaza-Jericho First would start today while the really practical  discussions would begin next week, apparently in Cairo. The  agreement also stipulates that the Israeli withdrawal from the  Gaza Strip and Jericho will be accelerated and posits the early  stationing of Palestinian policemen in the Gaza Strip by next  week in order to give the Palestinians there a greater feeling  of security and to further speed up the Israeli withdrawal.  These are the details. The negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First  will resume later today following the signing of the agreement  on the security package in Hebron known as TIPH. This is the  name of the international presence that will number 160  personnel from Italy, Norway, and Denmark.    [Talmor] When will the negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First  resume in a wider framework?    [Hendler] This is not mentioned in the agreement but we  understand that this will take place next week, probably on  Sunday or Monday [3 or 4 April] in Cairo.</p>

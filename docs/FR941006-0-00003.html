This delegation applies to collections of information that have been initially approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have an annual total public burden that is 5,000 hours or less and an estimated burden per respondent of less than 500 hours. In exercising this delegated authority, the Commission is to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the reauthorization review process. Commission-reauthorized collections of information will be incorporated into the official OMB inventory of currently approved collections of information. A report of delegated approval for each information collection reauthorized by the Commission will be placed in OMB's public docket files when that approval is made. Under the Act, OMB may limit, condition, or rescind this delegation at any time, but it is intended that OMB will exercise this authority only rarely and in unusual circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> October 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Timothy R. Fain, Policy Analyst, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 10236, New Executive Office Building, 725 17th Street N.W., Washington DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;7231. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3507(e) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and 5 CFR 1320.9 authorize OMB to delegate its authority to approve collections of information to an agency's designated senior official for paperwork reduction or to the agency head if certain conditions are met. The Act and OMB's implementing regulations require OMB to comply with the notice and comment procedures of title 5, United States Code, chapter 5, before providing delegation to any agency. Following extensive consultation with the Commission, OMB preliminarily determined that the FCC met all of the requirements for delegation of the authority requested. Following this determination, OMB published proposed changes to 5 CFR part 1320 in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on June 9, 1994 (59 FR 29738). No comments were received from Federal agencies or members of the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With one exception, this final rule adopts the NPRM. OMB has added, as new section 2.(a)(3)(v), a requirement that the FCC hold periodic training on meeting the requirements of the Act and 5 CFR part 1320 for the members of the functional bureaus and offices (B/Os) responsible for sponsoring information collections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The delegation is granted to the Commission's Managing Director who, as the Commission's designated senior official, has the authority to reauthorize the Commission's extension of collections of information, subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. OMB approval will still be required for new, revised, and expired information collections or those collections that represent more than a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or an individual respondent's burden of greater than 500 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of the delegation, each quarter, the agency clearance officer will identify the information collections that will need to be reauthorized during the next quarter and notify the appropriate functional Bureau and Office (B/O) of the Commission. Sponsoring B/Os will analyze each of these collections and consider: the continued need for the information, including the need for individual report items; how the Commission has used this information in the past; the reporting frequency; and selection of the reporting instrument. The review will cover clarity of format and instructions, reporting deadlines, costs and burdens, any public comments the Commission received during the previous clearance period, and other relevant items. For those eligible collections that the B/Os choose to extend, the reauthorization process would be initiated by B/O preparation of a ``request for extension of an information collection.'' This request, and the accompanying supporting statement, will be submitted to the agency clearance officer in the Office of the Managing Director. After screening by the agency clearance officer, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice and a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> FCC Public Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be issued requesting public comment during a 30-day review period beginning on the date of publication of the notice. Public comments will be evaluated and, where appropriate, incorporated into the collection. The agency clearance officer will provide written responses to all public comments. The Managing Director will not reauthorize collections with substantive changes. Finally, when appropriate, the Managing Director will reauthorize the collection for use and submit a report of delegated approval to OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This entire process will occur under the general direction of the Managing Director in his capacity as the Commission's designated senior official. The Commission's clearance process will be under the day-to-day supervision and management of the agency clearance officer who reports to the Managing Director and is outside and independent of any program office that would originate requests to extend information collections. The agency clearance officer would maintain administrative control throughout the review process regardless of how or where the request for extension originates. Each B/O will designate staff to act as liaison with the review structure described above and to help ensure their organization's adherence to the paperwork clearance standards and procedures. This staff will receive periodic training from the agency clearance officer on the Act and the requirements and procedures contained in 5 CFR part 1320. The agency clearance officer will ensure public access to the Commission's information collection files in compliance with approved retention and disposition schedules. Over the longer term, the agency clearance officer will work towards making summary information available electronically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB believes that this review and reauthorization process meets the requirements for a delegation of OMB's Paperwork Reduction Act approval authority. These requirements and the reasons why OMB believes that the Commission fully meets them follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The agency review process must exhibit independence from program office responsibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virtually all of these collections are contained in regulatory requirements. The Commissioners generally establish overall policies with the functional  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> B/Os responsible for the decisions to initiate or sponsor a collection of information. The Commission's Managing Director serves as the senior official for management and administrative matters and is independent of and separate from the functional B/Os. The Managing Director will serve as the final approval authority on all FCC decisions to reauthorize information collections. The agency clearance officer in the Office of the Managing Director will review each information collection to determine if the original purpose and intent of the collection warrants its continued existence. This review will also assess whether the collection remains necessary for the Commission to perform its duties and responsibilities as identified in the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the relevant parts of the Code of Federal Regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The agency must have sufficient resources to carry out paperwork responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB believes that the Managing Director has demonstrated a commitment to conduct reviews of information collections that include the use of resources and personnel from all areas within the Commission. Each functional B/O having programmatic responsibilities will provide staff resources to prepare the analytical materials described above. This staff will receive periodic training from the agency clearance officer on the Act and the procedures and requirements contained in 5 CFR part 1320. The agency clearance officer in the Office of the Managing Director will then conduct the reviews identified above. To ensure that the agency clearance officer can perform an adequate review of each information collection, the records management division in the Office of the Managing Director has been assigned a staff of two senior analysts. These individuals, under the direct supervision of the agency clearance officer, each have extensive experience in addressing issues related to the Paperwork Reduction Act and information collections. Finally, the resources of the Office of General Counsel will be available if additional assistance is needed to evaluate the necessity of an information collection in its current form. The Managing Director of the FCC has requested a delegation to review and reauthorize collections of information that represent a narrow scope of the Commission's collections. We believe that the limited number and relative lack of complexity of these collections will not overburden the ability of the agency clearance officer to perform these reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The agency review process must evaluate fairly whether the proposed collections of information should be approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB believes that the Commission has developed a process that ensures that the Office of the Managing Director can fairly evaluate and reauthorize collections of information. The Office of the Managing Director has assembled an experienced staff under the direction of a paperwork clearance officer who is independent from the program B/Os. Additionally, the Managing Director has proposed a process for reauthorizing extensions to approved information collections that will: maintain public participation; allow OMB the opportunity to consult during the review process; ensure prompt notification of OMB concerning decisions made about individual information collections and any public comments received during this process; and provide OMB with information necessary to maintain its inventory of approved collections. Under the proposed delegation, the Commission would continue to request OMB approval for new, expired, or revised information collections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes that OMB can and will continue to have a consultative role in the approval process. The Commission will work closely with OMB should an assessment of the existing information collection indicate that a modification would benefit the Commission or the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Evidence of successful performance of paperwork review activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite a dynamic regulatory environment that has resulted in the creation of numerous new information collection requirements, the Commission has been actively working to reduce its overall paperwork burden. The FCC has been working closely with the public to improve its ability to collect and evaluate information, particularly in the use of information technology to reduce or minimize the reporting burden of its information collections. Recent FCC innovations include: (a) use of ``800'' telephone lines to provide direct access to program experts who provide advice on completing the collection; (b) providing forms that can be faxed by the respondents directly to the program office for FCC advice or action; and (c) allowing submission of certain financial information in electronic format. The FCC is aggressively pursuing other applications of information technology to reduce the burden placed on the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In May 1990, the FCC erred in implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act when rules prescribing an information collection entitled ``Authorization to Construct a Cellular Telephone System'' were found to have been ambiguous concerning submission of certain documents required to be filed in support of an application. The Commission concurred with OMB's finding concerning this ambiguity and reopened the proceeding involving this collection. Since then, the Commission has upgraded the training of both the program B/Os and the Office of the Managing Director, and the Commission has been conscientious in managing its information collections. The Commission will develop a program of periodic training sessions to improve and maintain the knowledge of those individuals in the program B/Os responsible for managing information collections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on these facts, OMB grants the Managing Director of the FCC a delegation to reauthorize its approved information collections subject to three exclusions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first exclusion would apply to changes to an existing collection. Any change, revision, or modification, other than non-substantive clarifications or corrections of spelling or grammatical errors, would cause a collection of information to be submitted to OMB for review and approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second exclusion would apply to new collections of information or reauthorization of collections for which approval has lapsed. New or lapsed collections of information would continue to be submitted to OMB for review and approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third exclusion would apply to the reauthorization of information collections employing statistical methods. Because OMB believes that the agency clearance officer lacks the resources required to effectively evaluate such collections, these collections would continue to be submitted to OMB for review and approval. Voluntary customer surveys will be treated under streamlined procedures established by OMB Memorandum M-93-14 dated September 29, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will continue to follow OMB rules with respect to information collections excluded from this delegation. The Commission may also, at its option, request OMB to conduct any delegated review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's final action on the reauthorization of a collection of information would be taken after the public has a reasonable opportunity to comment through notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> FCC Public Notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The comment period will extend for at least 30 days following publication of the notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These notices will advise the public that a copy of comments may also be submitted to the OMB/Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) desk officer for the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Sally Katzen, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1320 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of information, Delegated review authority, Paperwork, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, OMB amends 5 CFR part 1320 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1320_CONTROLLING PAPERWORK BURDENS ON THE PUBLIC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Authority to review and approve currently valid (OMB-approved) collections of information, including collections of information contained in existing rules, that have a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or less and a burden of less than 500 hours per respondent is delegated to the Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) This delegation does not include review and approval authority over any new collection of information, any collections whose approval has lapsed, any substantive or material modification to existing collections, any reauthorization of information collections employing statistical methods, or any information collections that exceed a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or an estimated burden of 500 hours per respondent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Managing Director may ask that OMB review and approve collections of information covered by the delegation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In exercising delegated authority the Managing Director will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Provide the public, to the extent possible and appropriate, with reasonable opportunity to comment on collections of information under review prior to taking final action on reauthorizing an existing collection. Reasonable opportunity for public comment will include publishing a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  and an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> FCC Public Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  informing the public that a collection of information is being extended and announcing the beginning of a 30-day comment period, notifying the public of the ``intent to extend an information collection,'' and providing the public with the opportunity to comment. Such notices shall advise the public that they may also send a copy of their comments to the OMB/Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs desk officer for the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Should the Managing Director determine that a collection of information that falls within the scope of this delegation must be reauthorized quickly and that public participation in the reauthorization process interferes with the Commission's ability to perform its statutory obligation, the Managing Director may temporarily reauthorize the extension of an information collection, for a period not to exceed 90 days, without providing opportunity for public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) At the earliest practical date after granting this temporary extension to an information collection, the Managing Director will conduct a normal delegated review and publish a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice soliciting public comment on its intention to extend the collection of information for a period not to exceed 3 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Assure that approved collections of information are reviewed not less frequently than once every 3 years and that such reviews are conducted before the expiration date of the prior approval. When the review is not completed prior to the expiration date, the Managing Director will submit the lapsed information collection to OMB for review and reauthorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Assure that each reauthorized collection of information displays an OMB control number and, except for those contained in regulations or specifically designated by OMB, displays the expiration date of the approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Transmit to OMB for incorporation into OMB's public docket files, a report of delegated approval certifying that the Managing Director has reauthorized each collection of information in accordance with the provisions of this delegation. Such transmittal shall be made no later than 15 days after the Managing Director has taken final action reauthorizing the extension of an information collection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Ensure that the personnel in the Commission's functional bureaus and offices responsible for managing information collections receive periodic training on procedures related to meeting the requirements of this rule and the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) OMB will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide notice to the Commission acknowledging receipt of the report of delegated approval and its incorporation into OMB's public docket files and inventory of currently approved collections of information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Act upon any request by the Commission to review a collection of information referred by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of section 2(a)(2) of this Appendix. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Periodically assess, at its discretion, the Commission's paperwork review process as administered under the delegation. The Managing Director will cooperate in carrying out such an assessment. The Managing Director will respond to any recommendations resulting from such a review and, if it finds the recommendations to be appropriate, will either accept the recommendation or propose an alternative approach to achieve the intended purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) This delegation may, as provided by 5 CFR 1320.9(c), be limited, conditioned, or rescinded, in whole or in part at any time. OMB will exercise this authority only in unusual circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FRDoc. 94&hyph;24677 Filed 10&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3110&hyph;01&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Water needs watching - With a price review looming, Peggy Hollinger feels caution is required First impressions are often misleading, and the water sector bears out this maxim fully. After a disappointing year, water stocks have outperformed the FT All-Share by almost 7 per cent over the past month. While some may put this down to optimism about the present price review, Robert Miller-Bakewell, of NatWest Securities, points to the 6 per cent fall in the All-Share over the same period. It would seem the sector did little more than tread water while the stock market lost ground. Water companies have not always been such laggards. Indeed, shareholders have done rather well out of these stocks since privatisation in 1989, with the sector showing a 37 per cent market premium over the five years. Dividend growth has been equally impressive, with an average cumulative increase of 40 per cent since 1989. The question is whether this trend is likely to continue after the review which will decide the rate above inflation by which companies will be allowed to increase prices. From the bearish noises made in recent months by Ian Byatt, the industry regulator, the boom days seem to be over. The review, to be made public at the end of July, is expected to force companies - and thus investors - to take on more of the financial burden arising from increasing environmental legislation. The water sector has had a fairly gentle ride since being privatised. Then, the government feared potential investors would be frightened by the huge spending required to bring the long-neglected water companies up to date. To woo them, large chunks of debt were eliminated and the companies endowed with generous price increases to 1995. Investors were tempted further by under-priced shares and the promise of healthy yields. Those reasons for investing in water companies have largely disappeared now. Byatt has made clear that he sympathises with consumers unhappy at paying an average 57 per cent increase in water bills since 1990 while seeing aggregate company profits more than double. He has said, repeatedly, that the sector will now have to call on its own resources to fund commitments. Bill Dale, an analyst at SG Warburg, estimates that water companies will be allowed average price increases of just one percentage point above inflation, against an average of five in the first price review. Meanwhile, capital spending requirements have spiralled due to increasing regulation from Brussels. Analysts estimate the sector faces costs of up to Pounds 16bn over the next five years, against Pounds 13.6bn to 1995. So, while water companies are facing some of their heaviest obligations, the regulator is threatening to bring down the rate of return allowed on assets. 'There is a huge income gap,' says Dale, 'and, somehow, that gap will have to be made good.' But it is clear that the companies' efforts to build non-regulated income streams will not bridge that gap in the foreseeable future. This year, the sector is forecast to incur a deficit of up to Pounds 70m, including one-off costs, from non-regulated activities. The difficulties will be aggravated by the costs of financing the spending programme. Gearing, now averaging 20 per cent for the sector, is expected to reach 70 to 75 per cent. The knock-on effect of this, combined with a more tightly regulated income stream, will be flat earnings for the next five years. Earnings have never been important to water-watchers, since so much is dictated by the regulator. 'No one would value highly an earnings stream which can be regulated away at the whim of one individual,' says Dale. Dividend growth and yield have always been more important. Yet, with the pressures facing water companies, growth is going to be more difficult to achieve. Dividend cover, now three times against a market average of twice, is likely to be the first sacrifice. But the real returns will have to come from cost-cutting. If the companies are to fund investment needs and provide solid returns to shareholders, the only option is to beat the efficiency targets built into Byatt's price allowances. This will be no easy task and, says Miller-Bakewell, 'will involve questioning some of the diehard procedures in the industry'. Given the difficulty of finding bigger cost savings every year, analysts are not expecting cost-cutting to fuel dividend rises similar to those of first five years. Estimates are for real dividend growth to slow from 6 per cent real under the first price regime to about 3 per cent a year until year-2000. The real slow-down will begin after 1995 when the new pricing regime and higher capital spending commitments begin to take effect. Despite this, analysts maintain that water stocks will be able to increase dividends faster than the market. With lower dividend cover, corporate UK will have less room for manoeuvre than the water sector. Thus, the 4.5 per cent prospective market yield looks less secure in the medium term as companies will be forced to re-build cover. All this means that water companies now enjoying prospective average yields of 6.2 per cent are likely to retain their attraction as income stocks. But investors should approach the sector carefully, given the uncertainties imposed by the price review. In the end, longer-term value depends on an investor's view of the management. 'Everything will focus on cost-cutting,' says Dale. 'Investors should be asking themselves which companies are capable of delivering efficiency gains in an increasingly tough regulatory regime.'</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Europe's car sales continue to fall NEW car sales in west Europe dropped by 18.6 per cent last month as demand fell sharply for the fourth consecutive month. Sales declined by 29.6 per cent in Spain, 28.6 per cent in Italy, an estimated 16.5 per cent in Germany and by 11.7 per cent in France. In the first four months west European new car sales have fallen by 17.6 per cent to an estimated 4.15m, from 5.04m in the corresponding period a year ago. Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to implement short-time working and are cutting their workforces in the face of shrinking profits or mounting losses. According to industry estimates, new car sales in April fell to 1.087m from 1.334m in the same month a year ago. Sales last month were lower than a year ago in 16 of 17 markets. Registrations rose only in Ireland. The recent recovery in UK new car sales faltered in April with a 1.9 per cent year-on-year decline. UK industry leaders claimed the fall was misleading, however, as sales a year earlier had been inflated by a reduction in car purchase tax. In the first four months new car sales in west Europe were higher than a year ago only in the UK, with an increase of 8.2 per cent, and in Ireland. Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands all suffered declines in the first four months of about 30 per cent year on year, while sales have dropped by a fifth in Germany, Italy and France. Rover, the UK car producer and a subsidiary of British Aerospace, was the only carmaker in west Europe to increase its sales volume in the first four months, with a rise of 9 per cent. Among the big six volume carmakers, the Fiat group of Italy, which includes Alfa Romeo and Lancia, is being hit by the decline in its domestic market, where new car sales fell by 28.6 per cent in April.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- January-April 1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume      Volume   Share (%)   Share (%)                           (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Apr 93  Jan-Apr 92  -------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET            4,151,000       -17.6       100.0       100.0  -------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.        702,000       -19.4        16.9        17.3 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors            524,000       -16.8        12.6        12.5 (Opel/Vauxhall, US*** &amp; Saab)  - Opel/Vauxhall          503,000       -16.6        12.1        12.0  - Saab**                  14,000       -23.2         0.3         0.4 Peugeot (incl.

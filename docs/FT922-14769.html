			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Stay of execution surprises marketeers LABOUR this week took the wind out of the sails of several BES marketeers by announcing a stay of execution for the scheme, writes John Authers. Labour confirmed that 'abolition of the BES will not be backdated'. This removes one element of risk for schemes which aim to allot shares by election day. The party added: 'Given the current state of the housing market the Labour chancellor would be prepared to act flexibly. As BES abolition was not set out in the Shadow Budget this will not be regarded as a priority for immediate change.' Tim Villiers, chairman of the BES Association, welcomed this as excellent news, and said the scheme would probably survive until the second Budget of a Labour administration. However, this lessens the incentive to make a hasty investment in a BES for the 1992-93 tax year. Several schemes remain open for this form of investment. including Bessa Plus, which is sponsored by Close Brothers, and has a covenant from Hill Samuel Personal Finance to buy back shares in five year at a price of Pounds 1.25 for Pounds 1 spent now, and Short Leasehold, sponsored by Terrace Hill, which aims for high growth and also high yields by buying short leasehold properties.</p>

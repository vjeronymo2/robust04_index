The reason the group has chosen Shanghai for its first  office  in China is that the city is becoming China's financial center,  Mack said at a ceremony to mark the opening of the office.    He said, "I am sure that China will play an increasingly  important role in the global financial market."    Therefore, the Chinese market has become the focus of the  group's operations, he said. The Shanghai office will offer  consultancy and advice on how to turn Chinese enterprises into  shareholding companies, he added.    According to Mack, the office will also help Chinese  companies issue shares in the United States and Europe; help  Chinese securities institutions enter the international market;  become involved in issuing shares in China's securities markets;  offer advice on how to raise money for large industrial and  infrastructural projects in China; and seek opportunities for  cooperation with Chinese financial institutions.    The Morgan Stanley group intends to undertake a large real  estate project and plans to participate in foreign exchange and  futures trading in Shanghai, he said.    The group is applying to open another office in Beijing, he  said.</p>

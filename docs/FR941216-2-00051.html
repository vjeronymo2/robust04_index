The Agreement is submitted as a supplement to Tapoco Rate Schedule FERC No. 6 and Supp. No. 1 to Rate Schedule No. 6. Tapoco states that the effect of the Agreement is to provide the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) with certain dispatch rights for Tapoco's hydroelectric plants.

Tapoco requests that the Agreement be made effective as of April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of this filing were served on TVA and the Tennessee Public Service Commission.

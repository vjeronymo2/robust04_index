			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENATE PANEL BACKS EAGLEBURGER  </P> <P> The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously today to approve the  nomination of Lawrence Eagleburger as the No. 2 man at the State Department,  ending a controversy over his ties to former Secretary of State Henry A.  Kissinger's international consulting firm.  </P> <P> The 19-0 vote came after Eagleburger, who earned more than $900,000 last year  as president of Kissinger Associates, agreed to voluntarily disqualify himself  from all matters involving former clients of the firm during his government  service.  </P> <P> Eagleburger was not required to divulge the names of those clients to the  committee, a move that had been sought by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).  </P></p>

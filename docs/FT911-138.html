			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (3): Cadcam market is expected to rise to Dollars 26.2bn by 1995 - Computer-Aided Design, slower growth but healthy computer-aided design and manufacturing equipment - may be slowing down, but many users in manufacturing industry would give their eye teeth to match the growth rates projected for suppliers over the next few years. After the phenomenal growth of the early 1980s, the industry is expanding at rates of a mere 10-14 per cent a year, depending on the sector. According to Dataquest, the US market research company, the total Cadcam market was worth Dollars 13.9bn last year, but this is forecast to rise to Dollars 26.2bn by 1995. Most big Western manufacturing companies have Cadcam systems, although the level of maturity and sophistication varies from one country or industrial sector to another. While this means that some markets will see only incremental growth, there is little doubt that customers with successful installations are keen to come back and buy more. Much of the growth in the next few years, therefore, will come from a combination of new products and new applications to tempt long-standing users, and new customers. In the latter category some UK machine tool companies, for example, are only now replacing their draughtsman's tables with Cad systems, partly because the cost of the hardware is falling but also because their clients demand it. As with robotics, the use of Cadcam is spreading to smaller manufacturing companies, and particularly the subcontractors in the automotive and aerospace industries. Mr Roger Smedley, chairman of the UK engineering design company Ricardo International, remarks that 10 years ago it was hard to spend more than Pounds 1,000 per head in capital on each employee's drawing board, desk and chair. Now, with some computer screens costing up to Pounds 60,000 including software, capital expenditure per head has rocketed, but an enormous number of design companies have gone out of business because they could not finance a switch to computers or make it work, says Mr Smedley. Ricardo is spending Pounds 1.5m a year on computers, while one of its rivals, Worthing-based International Automotive Design, has just ordered an Pounds 800,000 CADDS 4X system from Computervision, enhancing its ability to provide design, build and prototyping services to big automotive manufacturers. IAD has been a customer of Computervision, one of the world's leading Cadcam suppliers, for six years. Mr Mark Holmes, a UK marketing consultant for Computervision, notes that manufacturers such as Rover and Ford are asking their supplier companies to ensure their Cadcam systems are compliant - a trend that is being driven by the desire for concurrent engineering (design for manufacturing.) Computervision, part of Prime Computer, is one of a handful of big players in an industry which continues to see new niche products and companies emerging, and thus boasts dozens of companies with revenues so small that they hardly register at all. Most of these are US companies, followed by European groups, with Japan back in third place. Industry observers see a continuing role for the smaller companies, even if sometimes it is only for their technology to be obtained by the larger players, through an OEM arrangement or acquisition. An example of the latter was the acquisition by Computervision of Massachusetts-based Premise, whose technology extends Cadcam back to the sketching, or back-of-an-envelope stage in the creation of a design. This process, known as conceptual engineering, is generating widespread interest among manufacturers. There have been takeovers of a different kind. The squeeze on margins in the late 1980s, caused by the rush into the market in the hope of fat profits, has left several companies by the wayside. The electronic design automation (EDA) sector in particular experienced particular turmoil during this period: Daisy Systems bought Cadnetics in 1988 to form Dazix, but a heavy burden of debt led to its bankruptcy filing in August. In January, the much stronger US company Intergraph snapped up Dazix for Dollars 14m. If the established companies play their cards right, they ought to be able to avoid Dazix's fate. There are significant opportunities in many geographic and product markets, and the big suppliers with marketing muscle are best placed to exploit them. Mr Jim Tully, Dataquest's UK Cadcam analyst, sees Europe maintaining its 35 per cent share of the world market through to 1995. Germany is already the biggest market, but still offers the best growth potential because of reunification. Reconstruction, refitting of factories and a modernised power network all offer scope for Cadcam sales. Dataquest predicts the more mature US market will see its share slip from 35 per cent in 1990 to 33 per cent in 1995, while Asia will maintain its 28 per cent share. In product sectors, Mr Tully sees the fastest growth in the geographic information systems (GIS) sector, where Intergraph is the undisputed leader. 'There's a great deal of interest in getting maps on to computer systems,' he says. The mechanical sector, which is by far the largest, is growing very slowly, but even here there are opportunities. In particular, users in this sector are interested in so-called knowledge-based applications of Cadcam. An example is a system developed by the small US supplier Rasna, which will design products such as car bumpers virtually automatically, minimising weight and performing stress analysis on the basis of a few parameters and criteria. Two other trends look like becoming increasingly significant for the industry. Until recently, most Cadcam systems have been mutually incompatible, and end-users wishing to change their system have faced a difficult and costly process. This, says Mr Tully, is changing, because of 'frameworks,' a set of software facilities that allows third-party Cadcam to be integrated into a user's existing system, or a supplier's product line. 'The whole issue of opening the systems up is the key to a lift to growth,' he says. Mr Holmes at Computervision sees another market place opening up - engineering data management. Cadcam, he says, was a reasonably controlled environment in the early 1980s with the host mainframes looking after files. But as engineering companies have been forced to move more quickly, it has become more important to find where information resides in a company. Changing technology has meant that Cadcam is more likely to be based on a workstation, leading to a proliferation of files, and the need for EDM to control data more closely. There is probably no better way of assessing the industry's prospects than to examine new uses for Cadcam. At Boeing, the introduction of a new generation of Cad tools is aimed at eliminating the risk of design mistakes. The lynch-pin is Catia, a three-dimensional Cad programme supplied by Dassault Systems of France, which incorporates a new stress analysis system. Linked to a network of IBM workstations and mainframes, Catia will enable Boeing's new 777 commercial jet to be the first designed completely on computer.</p>

Furthermore, some callboxes do not use telephone technology. The prohibition against voice-only communication has been maintained but TTY technology is not specified. The provision has not been changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.3&blank;Alterations [14.5 in the NPRM] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that altered pedestrian facilities comply with requirements for new construction to the maximum extent feasible under existing conditions of site development and provides exceptions for site infeasibility. This requirement is consistent with ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations). Special technical provisions for alterations of elements covered by this section have also been provided. Appendix notes provide examples of alterations and describe conditions of site infeasibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of commenters requested clarification of the differences between new construction and alterations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the construction in public rights-of-way will be considered alterations and will therefore be covered by this section rather than by ADAAG 14.2 (New Construction). Alterations occur in existing developed areas of an improved public right-of-way where existing construction is removed or altered, whether by intention or as a consequence of other work. The new work must meet established grades and existing construction at the project perimeter as well as at points within its area, such as at intersecting public sidewalks, curbs and street crossings, and at entrances to existing buildings and facilities. Alterations may occur within the physical boundaries of a project area or be described as a project scope of work. For example, the reconstruction of a length of street and public sidewalk will occur within a project area bounded by the limits of the public right-of-way for a stipulated distance. Within this project area, all new work must meet guidelines for new construction to the maximum extent feasible. Other alterations projects may consist of the installation of a typical element, such as benches or drinking fountains, dispersed throughout a neighborhood or other general area. In such work, the scoping of accessible elements is based on individual location. Where a single item is placed at a location, it is a common use element and must therefore be accessible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed that alterations to existing elements constructed as a part of a public improvement project comply with ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations) and section 14. Many commenters requested clarification of the application of ADAAG 4.1.6 to public rights-of-way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in ADAAG 14.1 (General), the entire section has been reorganized to address new construction and alterations separately. Provisions derived from ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations) have been added to this section to clarify applications to public rights-of-way. These requirements (1) prohibit decreasing the accessibility of existing pedestrian facilities; (2) require full accessibility to public sidewalks, public sidewalk curb ramps, and pedestrian street crossings within a project area if a series of small alterations has the overall effect of a reconstruction; and (3) require alteration projects involving public sidewalks, public sidewalk curb ramps, and street crossings to include alterations necessary to connect to adjacent portions of the continuous passage, to the extent it is not disproportionate in cost and scope. The latter requirement is based upon ADAAG 4.1.6(2) (Alterations to an Area Containing a Primary Function), which requires that alterations that affect or could affect the usability of or access to an area of primary function be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area, and certain elements serving that area, be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, unless such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope. Public sidewalks, including the continuous passage, public sidewalk curb ramps, and pedestrian street crossings are the areas of primary function in a pedestrian circulation network. Accordingly, when any of these elements is altered, the scope of work may need to be expanded to include accessible connections to existing work. For example, when a new public sidewalk curb ramp is constructed, existing contiguous areas of the public sidewalk must be altered to ensure that the newly-placed public sidewalk curb ramp complies to the maximum extent feasible with the provisions required of public sidewalk curb ramps in new construction, if it can be done by the expenditure of an additional 20 percent of the cost of this alteration. However, alterations in the public right-of-way that do not affect these elements or the continuous passage would not incur a path of travel obligation. For example, the addition of accessible benches at an intersection will not require the provision of a continuous passage or other accessible elements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure smooth transitions and structural integrity, public works specifications typically require that finished surfaces adjacent to altered work be removed and replaced beyond the minimum necessary to perform the work. Therefore, most jurisdictions already include improvements necessary to blend new work with existing surfaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The replacement of one flag, square, or section of public sidewalk paving within a larger area to remedy damage to, or deterioration of, a limited area is considered maintenance and repair unless a substantial area or significant element is involved. Alterations are generally planned as improvement projects and will be placed or constructed according to plans and specifications. Maintenance and repair items, however, are typically governed by work orders that assume an in-kind replacement of materials and surfaces that does not require detailed planning. As required by ADAAG 14.4 (Temporary Work), temporary repairs to public sidewalks must meet the surface requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special technical provisions for alterations derived from ADAAG 4.1.6(3) (Special Technical Provisions for Alterations to Existing Buildings and Facilities) have also been added to this section. These technical provisions include exceptions which were applied to new construction in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State and local government agencies responsible for public rights-of-way construction recommended a general exception to cover all instances of site infeasibility. A FHWA engineer noted: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Sidewalk reconstruction on ``continuous accessible routes'' in central business districts is often difficult due to the need to adjust the cross-slopes and the longitudinal grades to meet the ADAAG requirements. Existing curb line grades and the need to meet existing entrances in buildings abutting the back edge of the sidewalks impose many physical restrictions. Also, there may be underground structures (drainage, utilities, freight elevator entrances, subway and subway access structures) or other obstacles which may preclude full compliance with the ADAAG cross-slope requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

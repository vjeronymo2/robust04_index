			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Record pass rate for GCSEs the main examinations for 16-year-olds in England and Wales - reached record levels this year, but the number of entries in maths was sharply down, according to provisional results released yesterday. The results show that pupils sat for a total of 5.1m examinations, 1.3 per cent up on last year, with a 2.3 per cent increase in the proportion of passes at grades A to C. More than half the entries were awarded one of the top three grades, generally regarded as the pass standard. One in eight entries was awarded a grade A. The number of maths entries was down by 2.6 per cent, but the number for English was the same as last year. The Joint Council for the GCSE said the decline in maths, which will cause concern, might have been caused by a shift to non-national courses. There were increases in the percentages gaining grades A to C in all three national curriculum subjects. In English the percentage rose from 54 per cent last year to 55 per cent, in maths from 43 to 45 per cent, and in science from 37 to 44 per cent this year. Business studies was the subject recording the largest one-year increase in GCSE entries, up 17 per cent. Last week's figures for A-level entries also showed it to be growing rapidly in popularity among 18-year-olds. Entries in modern languages were up 5 per cent, with a large increase in entries for 'single science' at the expense of biology, chemistry and physics. Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, dismissed suggestions that the GCSE was getting easier. 'We can now look forward to seeing more students than ever continuing in education beyond the age of 16,' he said. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the improved performance made the government's determination to limit the coursework component of the GCSE 'totally inexplicable'. He added: 'All over the country the evidence points to coursework as a key motivating factor in improved performance.' The results broadly mirrored last week's A-level results, which also showed improved performance in spite of a continued decline in maths and science.</p>

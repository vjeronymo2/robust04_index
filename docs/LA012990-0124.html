			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> GROUP PLANS SUIT ON PETITION'S LANGUAGE  </P> <P> A residents' group seeking to control traffic noise through a ballot initiative  has decided to delay circulating a petition on the measure and to file suit to  change the wording of the petition's summary instead.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Save Our Bastanchury vowed to gather enough signatures to  call a special election and place its measure before voters.  </P> <P> The city attorney's summary of that measure, released Wednesday, must appear at  the top of each petition.  </P> <P> But Mary Homme, president of Save Our Bastanchury, said members considered that  summary biased and inaccurate. The group unanimously decided to file suit in  Superior Court in about two weeks to force the city to write a better summary,  she said.  </P> <P> City Atty. R. K. (Kerry) Fox, said he believed his summary is accurate and  unbiased. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

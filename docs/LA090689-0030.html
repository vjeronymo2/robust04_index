			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCERS APPLAUD BUSH SPEECH  </P> <P> Local law enforcement officials Tuesday applauded President Bush's drug  strategy, calling it "tough" and "balanced," and expressed optimism that San  Diego will get its fair share of federal dollars to stem the flow of drugs  coming across the U.S.-Mexican border.  </P> <P> San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen, whose street forces patrol a border area  in San Ysidro and other older residential areas where crack cocaine and other  illicit drugs have proliferated, said he is particularly pleased with Bush's  call for stricter enforcement of the laws.  </P> <P> "He touched on four important areas, and his first was a need to enforce the  law. I was pleased with his tough stance on enforcing the law. I was also  pleased with his stance on zero tolerance for casual drug users. These two  areas are crucial for local law enforcement officers," said Burgreen.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. William Braniff, the top federal law enforcement official in San  Diego and Imperial counties, said he was pleased with Bush's plan to prosecute  drug users, not just dealers. Braniff lauded the President's drug strategy as a  "balanced plan to attack drugs at all levels," and, like Burgreen, supported  Bush's call for zero tolerance.  </P> <P> Zero tolerance, a tough and uncompromising plan to deal with casual drug users  and dealers alike, was pioneered by Braniff's predecessor, Peter K. Nunez.  </P> <P> "A significant part of the program dealt with user accountability. . . . I  believe that users are the ultimate source of the problem and must be the  ultimate solution of the problem," said Braniff.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need for Interdiction  </P> <P> But still unclear is how local law enforcement agencies will benefit from  Bush's proposal to give local law enforcement across the nation $350 million to  combat drugs at the street level.  </P> <P> "I hope we get our fair share," Burgreen said. "I don't see any way that this  area of the country can be ignored, with our problems at the border and the  growing drug menace in our neighborhoods. . . . I was also pleased with the  President's comment on the need for interdiction. I would hope that would  include doing something to make our borders secure."  </P> <P> In May, Mayor Maureen O'Connor declared a "state of emergency" in San Diego and  asked Gov. George Deukmejian for $34 million to fight street crime, most of  which was blamed on street gangs and drugs. Deukmejian brushed aside O'Connor's  request, but the two are scheduled to meet later this month to discuss the  city's crime and drug problems.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, O'Connor said she hopes Washington will target San Diego as a "key  city with unique circumstances" and make available enough money to make a  difference in the city's war against drugs. Under this approach, the federal  government "would concentrate added resources" in San Diego, she said.  </P> <P> Bush said his plan to make $350 million available to local law enforcement  officials to battle drugs represents more than a 100% increase in the funds now  available. According to O'Connor, San Diego received only $1 million in federal  funds for law enforcement last year.  </P> <P> "What I heard tonight, if I take it as a literal interpretation, that would  mean we would only be getting $2 million. I hope that's not the case. . . . I  would hope they (Washington) would have the same sense of urgency for San Diego  that they have for other cities and Bogota, Colombia. People are also being  killed here. . . . We also have a major drug problem," O'Connor said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Push for Jail Funds  </P> <P> Both O'Connor and Burgreen said they will push to get some of the $1.6 billion  that Bush earmarked for new jails. The mayor and chief said that San Diego  County has the most crowded jail system in the country and hope that Washington  will take notice of this and make money available to build a new jail.  </P> <P> Braniff credited "the public attitude" for Bush's new push in the drug war.  Although, Braniff said, Bush failed when, as vice president, he was put in  charge of the Reagan Administration's war against drugs in 1982, the new fight  will succeed because the President appears to have public support this time.  </P> <P> "The most important ingredient is the public attitude that something has to be  done this time. The public realizes that drugs are a problem that spares no  one. We're all at risk," said Braniff.  </P></p>

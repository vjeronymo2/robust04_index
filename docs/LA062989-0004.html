			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST  </P> <P> "Angry Congressmen Vow to Protect Flag" is the headline on your article (Part  I, June 23) over reactions to the Supreme Court ruling upholding the right of  dissenters to desecrate the U.S. flag.  </P> <P> Congress already has authority, under the Constitution, to bar the high court  from ruling on this highly controversial case. Article III, Section 2, of the  Constitution includes the following language: "The Supreme Court shall have  appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions as the  Congress shall make" (emphasis added).  </P> <P> There it is, in plain language. The Supreme Court is not "supreme" in all  cases. Congress can make exceptions for some matters that it considers outside  the jurisdiction of the court. In view of the strong nationwide critical  reaction to the American flag decision, this would seem the logical time for  Congress to assert its authority.  </P> <P> That would be a better way to go instead of resorting to the proposed  constitutional amendment route, which entails the time-consuming requirement of  approval by three-fourths of the 50 state legislatures. Congress can achieve  the same objective by prompt action under the Constitution language cited  above.  </P> <P> ROBERT LEE  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

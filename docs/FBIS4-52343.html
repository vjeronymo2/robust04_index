			<p>CSO     [Text] On the 27th Mitsui and Information Resources (IRIC  of Chicago), a U.S. information services company, agreed to form  a joint venture in Japan. The joint venture will engage in the  contract analysis of point-of-sale (POS) data and attendant  consulting services offered to retailers and manufacturers. The  joint venture was entered into under the assessment that  U.S.-style leading-edge data analysis know-how could play a  useful role in Japan amidst rapid changes taking place in the  marketing field based on manufacturer-retailer collaboration.    The joint venture will assume the provisional name of "Japan  Information Resources." Capitalization has not been determined  thus far, but ownership will be set at 60 percent for IRIC and  40 percent for Mitsui. The new venture will contract with super  markets, drug stores and clothing chains to gather on-line POS  data. It will contract to analyze sales trends for retail  outlets as well as furnish advice on changes in categorical  sales data and appropriate stockage levels based on a  cross-section of data.    The venture will also have the capability to measure changes  in sales trends based on modifications to display methods and  price cuts and the scope and effectiveness of promotional  gimmicks offered by manufacturers such as discount coupons and  flyers. Additionally, the joint venture will engage in  comprehensive consulting projects such as linking manufacturers,  wholesalers and retailers into optimum marketing systems.    In U.S. marketing circles, POS systems and on-line receiving  and order systems are integrated to provide for rapid reaction  to changes in sales patterns and to reduce marketing costs. IRIC  plays a behind-the-scenes role and maintains data networks with  retailers and manufacturers.    On the other hand, Mitsui will use the joint venture to  establish collaborative relationships with domestic  manufacturers and retailers. Mitsui also intends to use the  joint venture to acquire additional clients for its own  marketing network.</p>

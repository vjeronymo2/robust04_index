			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria signs deal with BP-Statoil alliance NIGERIA YESTERDAY signed an oil exploration and production-sharing contract with the alliance between BP and Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, for three deep offshore blocks south-west of the Niger Delta. It was the third agreement in a month by a foreign oil group to take all the risks in developing new fields since shortage of cash forced the government to stop taking majority stakes in exploration joint ventures. After initial resistance to the terms offered by Nigeria's ruling transitional council this year, the foreign oil companies are falling into line following last month's signing by Royal Dutch/Shell and Elf of France. Exxon of the US is to sign a similar deal on Friday. The contract marks the return of BP to active exploration in Nigeria after an absence since 1979, when its Nigerian assets were nationalised. It was welcomed by Mr Philip Asiodu, the oil minister, who said at the signing in Lagos: 'We are all sorry that matters political led to a rupture'. The structure is estimated to hold reserves of at least 250m barrels and could have as much as 1bn barrels. BP-Statoil will pay a signature bonus of USDollars 42m and are committed to investing a minimum of Dollars 65m over the next six years. Seismic tests will begin this year and the first discovery is expected by the end of 1994. Mr Asiodu said that Nigerian law would be amended by August to allow more favourable terms for the increased risk taken by foreign oil companies in the new contracts. For deep offshore exploration the petroleum profit tax will be cut to 50 per cent, the investment tax credit will be 50 per cent and royalties to NNPC, the state-owned petroleum corporation, will be on a sliding scale from 16 per cent to zero, according to depth. Similar amendments will be made to terms for contracts covering onshore blocks. The BP-Statoil alliance, established more than two and a half years ago, expects to complete negotiations next year with authorities in Azerbaijan on terms and conditions to develop the Chirakh oil field, according to the chief executives of the respective companies, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Speaking in Stavanger at a briefing on the alliance's development, Mr David Simon of BP and Mr Harald Norvik of Statoil agreed that significant results had been achieved by the two companies in a very short time but recognised that its true test would be to bring production on stream with a resonable return on investment in the various areas where it was operating. Mr John Brown, BP vice-president of exploration and development, said the Chirakh development could need investment amounting to 'several tens of billions of kroner' but he would not be drawn on specific figures, which could be sensitive in current negotiations. The alliance believes the Chirakh field holds at least 1bn barrels of oil. The two companies aim to bring it on stream by the end of 1997 with output of about 200,000 barrels a day. In March, the alliance delivered results of a development study for Chirakh to Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, and also results of a study on the prospects of exploring for oil and gas in the Shak Deniz area, in the southern part of the Caspian Sea. Elsewhere in the South Caspian Sea, the BP/Statoil alliance is participating in a licence operated by Amoco, which has commenced negotiations on obtaining a production sharing agreement. Next month it aims to bring on stream non-productive wells in western Siberia that it has rehabilitated.</p>

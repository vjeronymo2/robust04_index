			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: Hedonism colours the mood - The work of Rothenstein AT 84, Michael Rothenstein has woken up to find himself not famous exactly, but certainly a Grand Old Man of British Art. Fame, or at least distinction, was never far away; his father was the painter, Sir William Rothenstein, principal of the Royal College of Art between the wars; his brother, Sir John, the first and often controversial post-War director of the Tate. In short he was born into the highest of art and cultural circles and, in his generation, was to be the artist of the family. So he has gone on over the years, ever prolific, showing regularly, his enthusiasm and commitment undimmed by self-doubt, his work direct and honest. If it has not always been so successful in the outcome as he may perhaps have supposed, his confidence has always carried the mark more of enthusiastic innocence than arrogance. Two current exhibitions now allow us to take his measure. At the Royal Academy is a retrospective of his Boxes, the constructions and assemblages he has been making since the 1960s (Piccadilly W1, until March 5), while Flowers East at Hackney (199 Richmond Road E8, until March 15) is showing his latest paintings and woodcuts. In considering the two shows together, it may seem surprising that the most recent production, even at the age of 84, should be so much better than the more self-conscious labour of several decades. But then he was ever an exuberant colourist and natural expressionist - and a refined and sensitive technician besides. He has only to forget himself in his work, allowing technique to serve him intuitively, to produce images of remarkable beauty and adventure. Such things now fill Flowers East. The paintings comprise the more substantial corpus, fat and succulent surfaces yet invested with images of wonderful energy and vigour, the drawing firm and certain, the colour rich and bright, the tone dark and warm, the mood overall one of hedonistic indulgence and excitement. Rothenstein is eclectic to a fault, and here his references range from Gauguin and the Douanier Rousseau to peasant art and popular prints at their most decorative and lively. The point is only that being unforced, such borrowings become entirely his own. His birds of Paradise perch in his trees, his peacocks strut in his gardens, his cocks crow to dawns of no imagination but his own. All is convincing, all carried through with a wonderful natural confidence and elan, none more so than the large colour wood-cuts, each a technical tour-de-force, each block and surface cut and printed as fresh and free as any of the birds whose image it might carry. The boxes are more problematical, for while they manifest in so many respects the same technical assurance and imaginative confidence, they stumble at last over their own self-consciousness. Here is the artist making art not about his own intuitive life and love of the world he lives in, but rather about art itself. He has looked at his references and examples, as before, but now with his mind and intellect rather than his heart. He persuades himself that his commitment is real enough, and so it is, to the idea, but yet the object remains forlorn, unresolved and often not a little ludicrous. This is not to say that the intellect has no part in art, that art should be thus thoughtless and impulsive, but only that the thought alone is not enough, nor even the half of it. Rothenstein in the 1960s was clearly looking closely at the latest American work, most especially at early Johns, Rauschenberg and Warhol. The ideas were interesting, the factuality of the objects - the brush as brush, paint as paint, pot as pot - for a while seductive. The loaded image lifted from magazine or newspaper seemed also to have a charmingly ambiguous potential. And so Rothenstein made his versions of car-crash pieces (Warhol), juxtaposed Rheims cathedral to a space rocket (Rauschenberg), and stuck his quota of brushes and paints into their boxes (Johns). We can see and understand why he did it, yet for the most part it remains an exercise, impersonal and unconvincing. The more portentous and insistent his justification, the more unconvincing it is. But some things he cannot resist, and when a cockerel unexpectedly pops out of a box, and the fun starts, we do begin to think again.</p>

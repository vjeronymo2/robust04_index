			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 12, BNS - Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas pursued only one aim by asking for NATO  membership -- he wanted to take away a trump card from the  rightist opposition, which sharply criticized the administration  for delaying an official request, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper  said in its editorial Wednesday [12 January].    The newspaper said key issues in foreign policy are used  only  as a "tool for internal struggle" and a lacks a clear attitude  toward this or that problem.    LIETUVOS RYTAS noted, however, that the international  community heard Lithuania's name once again after a considerable  break. "A majority of politicians consider the step premature,  but they realized that Lithuania's aspiration is sincere -- to  be safe on a dangerous crossing in Eastern Europe."</p>

The attendants were Foreign  Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri; Interior Minister  General Chawalit Yongchaiyut; Gen. Charan Kunlawanit, National  Security Council secretary general; Navy Commander Admiral  Prachet Siridet; and other officials concerned.    Reporting afterwards, the foreign minister said the meeting  discussed problems along the Thai-Cambodian border and  retaliatory measures against Cambodia. The Foreign Ministry  will today send a letter to Cambodian Prime Ministers Prince  Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen regarding the Cambodian  allegations about Thai support for the Khmer Rouge. The letter  will clarify what has occurred and point out that Thailand is  basically complying with the Paris Agreement. It will confirm  that Thailand has not supported any particular Cambodian group,  as well as not having supplied weapons to the Khmer Rouge.    The foreign minister said Thailand will not accept further  Cambodian refugees. The Foreign Ministry will encourage  Cambodia to promptly establish within one year a safety zone for  refugees fleeing the fighting. The foreign minister said the  Thai military will take drastic action to deal with shelling of  Thai territory by the Khmer Rouge or Cambodian Government forces.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Loans chief convicted of fraud The former chairman of Castlegate Securities, a Reading-based loan management company, was yesterday convicted of fraudulently mishandling the funds of investors who lost Pounds 35m, John Mason writes. A jury at Oxford crown court found Mr Roy Wharton guilty of two charges of fraudulent trading after a three-month trial brought by the Serious Fraud Office. The court heard how Castlegate grew from a small unsecured lending business into a group of companies managing secured loans totalling almost Pounds 44m by the time they were liquidated in December 1990. Institutional and private investors provided the backing for the group, but it was the private investors, mainly retired and elderly people, who bore the brunt of the Pounds 35m losses when Castlegate collapsed. Many lost their savings and some their homes. Investors had been assured that Castlegate would make up any shortfall suffered by one of its subsidiaries. But all assurances from the company proved false. Mr Wharton's speculative lending strategy meant that the companies bore the brunt of the risk while he reaped the financial benefits. The prosecution at his trial described his method as 'a sophisticated game of pass-the-parcel'. To keep Castlegate afloat Mr Wharton falsely inflated the values of properties under his control to expand his lending. He was remanded in custody until sentencing on October 7.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Hand over bomb suspects, Russia urges Libyans RUSSIAN Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev yesterday urged Libya to hand over to the United Nations secretary-general two Libyans accused of bombing a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. Mr Kozyrev made his comments to his Libyan counterpart, Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, in Cairo at a private meeting in the Russian embassy. 'I suggested to my Libyan friend that Libya should go along with the Security Council resolutions because this is the best way out in solving this problem,' Mr Kozyrev told reporters after a meeting with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. Mr Mubarak returned to Cairo at the weekend after visiting France and Morocco. He has been attempting to defuse a potential international crisis over Libya's refusal to yield the two Libyans for trial in either the US or Britain. France is also seeking four Libyans, including Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning over the 1989 bombing of a UTA jet over Niger, in which 171 passengers and crew died. Pointedly, the French judge responsible for investigating terrorism cases issued international arrest warrants for the four Libyans while Mr Mubarak was in Paris urging the west to show restraint. The US, Britain and France are working on a Security Council resolution that would impose limited sanctions against Libya should it continue to refuse to hand over the Libyan suspects. Initial sanctions would include a freeze on civil aviation links and a suspension of diplomatic relations. Sweden, meanwhile, has rejected a Libyan request for it to host the trial of the two Libyans suspected of blowing up the Pan Am jet. A spokesman for Sweden's foreign ministry said the government had decided to turn down the request, forwarded last Monday. The official said the trial should be held where the crime took place. He also urged Libya to abide by Security Council Resolution 731 of January 21 which condemned the bombings and urged Libya to comply with requests to hand over the suspects. The Libyan judge investigating the Lockerbie airliner bombing submitted his resignation yesterday, saying he was being pressed from all sides to violate the law, Reuter adds from Nicosia. The judge gave nine reasons why he could not conduct his investigation properly, including 'insults to the Libyan judiciary ..political pressures from inside and outside ..and attempts to force me to violate the laws,' according to the Libyan news agency JANA.</p>

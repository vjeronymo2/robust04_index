			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Environment agency given go-ahead THE GOVERNMENT is to press ahead with a 'one-stop shop for environmental protection', bringing together control of air, land and water pollution, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday. An independent environment agency was proposed by the government last year. The Queen's Speech two months ago, outlining the legislative programme after the election, failed to mention it. This prompted speculation that the agency had fallen victim to inter-departmental wrangles about river regulation. Since then, the Rio Summit and the UK's accession to the presidency of the EC have given environmental matters a fresh prominence. The bill needed to create the agency was 'a high priority', Mr Howard said, although he added that there was unlikely to be parliamentary time for the legislation in the next 12 months. The agency will combine the functions of the National Rivers Authority, the Inspectorate of Pollution and waste regulation by local authorities. In drawing together the NRA and HMIP, one of the agency's most important effects is likely to be an improvement in control of river pollution. The agency would cover England and Wales, and the arrangements for Scotland would be announced separately, he said. Local authorities will continue to be responsible for controlling low-level industrial air pollution. There would be no changes in ministerial policy responsibilities, Mr Howard said. Mr John Gummer, minister of agriculture, fisheries and food, will continue to be responsible for coastal defences and land drainage. The chosen structure of the environment agency was supported by the NRA, by the water supply companies and by environmental groups for its decision to leave the NRA in one piece. It ends speculation about whether the agency would take over only the NRA's pollution regulation role and split off its river management operations. Mr Gummer said it was important the agency's main purpose should be clearly perceived to be protection of the environment. He said he had initially been concerned that the twin roles of the NRA would blur this image. However, he was satisfied that the NRA would pursue vigorously its policy of contracting out its river management.</p>

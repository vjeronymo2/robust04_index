			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ANGELS MAY FILE GRIEVANCE AGAINST STEINBRENNER OVER WINFIELD TRADE  </P> <P> The California Angels plan to file a grievance seeking damages from the New  York Yankees over the Dave Winfield affair, New York Newsday reported today,  but in Anaheim, General Manager Mike Port would not confirm it.  </P> <P> Port told The Times this morning that although such an action is possible, no  grievance had been filed.  </P> <P> According to Newsday, Port said the grievance would be filed in the next few  days, charging that Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's two-hour "air-clearing"  meeting with Winfield last Monday was inappropriate and damaged the Angels'  bargaining position.  </P> <P> The Angels traded pitcher Mike Witt to New York for Winfield last Friday, but  the outfielder refused to report, citing his right, as a 10-year player who has  spent the last five years with the same team, to veto trades.  </P> <P> The matter seemed headed for arbitration until Winfield agreed to the deal  Wednesday when the Angels offered a three-year $9.1-million contract extension.  </P> <P> While the trade was in limbo, Steinbrenner met with Winfield, assuring him that  he would be a full-time player if an arbitrator ruled that he remain with the  Yankees.  </P> <P> The Angels, who were using a regular job as one of their incentives to get  Winfield to report, reportedly referred to the Steinbrenner meeting as  "tampering in its grandest form."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner said he saw nothing improper about meeting with Winfield, his  longtime adversary during the last 10 years.  </P> <P> "I was asked to meet with the player," he said. "And I got permission to meet  with him before I did it.  </P> <P> "I just went to tell him what had happened and clear the air on some things.  But (the Angels) offered him a multiyear contract and I did not."  </P></p>

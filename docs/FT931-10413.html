			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Hopes of lower Opec production boost Oils Wall Street US EQUITIES were narrowly mixed yesterday as the market took a breather after last week's record-breaking performance, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 4.60 down at 3,437.54, after gaining more than 8 points in the late afternoon. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 1.08 to 447.85, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.54 to 698.44. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 243.4m shares, and declining issues outnumbered rises by 944 to 939. The Dow, which rose 25.40 to a record 3,442.14 on Friday, added more than 132 points last week. In spite of the market's slight decline yesterday, the sell-off that some investors had feared would follow last week's stellar performance did not materialise. Oil shares benefited from speculation that Opec will agree to cut production when it meets at the weekend. An analyst at Salomon Brothers increased his investment ratings on British Petroleum, Chevron, Mobil and Texaco to reflect anticipated price improvements as well as bottom-line improvements following cost-cutting measures taken last year. BP was Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 47 5/8 , Chevron up Dollars 1 to a 52-week peak of Dollars 76, Mobil ahead Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 65 7/8 and Texaco Dollars 1 firmer at Dollars 62 3/4 . Auto company issues continued to see heavy NYSE trading, with General Motors rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 and Chrysler off Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 40 3/8 . Among other active stocks, Merck was up Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 , International Business Machines rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 52 7/8 and Philip Morris eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 74 1/2 . Supermarket group Kroger gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 17 3/4 on the back of fourth-quarter operating income of 74 cents a share, up from 46 cents the previous year. Morrison Knudsen, the construction and engineering company, climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 22. On Friday it posted fourth-quarter net income of 23 cents a share, against 19 cents a year earlier. Wheeling-Pittsburgh hit a 52-week high of Dollars 9 1/2 , up Dollars 2. Although the steel company last week turned in a fourth-quarter and annual deficit and predicted a first-quarter loss, investors were encouraged by predictions that the company expects to show a profit in subsequent quarters. In the Nasdaq market, declines in big stocks in the technology sector drove the composite index lower. Intel slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 106 1/8 , Apple Computer receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 56 1/2 and Microsoft dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 85 3/4 . Biotechnology shares also took a battering. Biogen tumbled Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 32 1/8 after Prudential Securities cut its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. Amgen weakened Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/4 . Canada THE TORONTO market continued its early-February rally, moving higher in heavy trading as the transportation sector led the way. The TSE 300 index ended 16.92 ahead at 3,394.83 and advancing issues outpaced declines by 346 to 297 after volume of 49.5m shares valued at CDollars 455.8m. The market has gained almost 90 points so far this month on large volume, showing signs of a solid rebound after suffering a stagnant January. Eleven of the 14 stock groups gained ground yesterday, with the transportation index up 3.3 per cent, forest products ahead 1.7 per cent, conglomerates 1.2 per cent higher and consumer products gaining 1.1 per cent. American Barrick declared a two-for-one stock split and boosted its dividend by about 23 per cent, but it closed CDollars  1/4 down at CDollars 39 1/2 .</p>

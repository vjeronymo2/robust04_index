			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "To Each His Own Invincible"] </F>   [Text] On 23 February 1994 the Soviet Army would have  celebrated its 76th anniversary, had it survived. But the  Belovezhskiye agreements closed the book on its history.  Sovereign units of the former Soviet Army are not simply living  separate lives; they are also confronting one another. Quite  likely, those who just a couple of years ago would have been  called up into the same army might now be looking at each other  across a front line -- in Azerbaijan, Ingushetia and the Dnestr  region. The question of invincibility will be answered  differently in the history textbooks of each nation. Still, the  army will always remain legendary. It is an army that was feared  by the entire world -- an army with Halhin-Gol and the Great  Patriotic War, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Tbilisi  and Baku in 1989, and Vilnius in 1991 behind its back. To some,  this is the stuff of a heroic legend, while to others it is  horrifying. But no matter what the official name of this day  brings to the minds of what used to be the Soviet people, 23  February will remain a holiday of the Soviet Army. It will  remain so for all who served in it, and who waited for their  soldiers to return from the front or from compulsory service.    Russia    Numerical Strength (as of 7 May 1992)--2.8  million.

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Observer: Wrong numbers Observer is also a trifle worried about BT's in-house maths expertise, if the specimen on show in the company's latest report to shareholders is anything to go by. A sharp-eyed reader points out that BT, boasting about its price competitiveness, seems to think that, if it keeps its prices stable while retail prices rise by 50 per cent, it has achieved a 50 per cent reduction in real terms for its customers. Would that life were so simple. It is, however, the mistake that chairman Sir Iain Vallance makes when he boasts that, in the 10 years since the company was privatised, retail prices rose 57 per cent in the UK, while a basket of BT's main services rose by 'less than 9 per cent'. Thus 'overall prices paid by customers have been virtually halved in those 10 years'. The maths whizzes at BT seem to have subtracted 9 per cent from 57 per cent to arrive at 48 per cent. Observer's suggestion is that the answer is actually (48/157)%, or a rather more modest 30.6 per cent decline, in real terms, in prices paid by the customer. Ah well. Just a word of warning to Vallance when he is next working out his salary.</p>

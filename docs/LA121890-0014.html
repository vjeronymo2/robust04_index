			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> PHILLIPS TO DISCUSS FUTURE  </P> <P> Nose tackle Joe Phillips will hold a news conference today at his agent's  office in La Jolla to discuss his future with the Chargers.  </P> <P> Phillips, on injured reserve since late September after he was assaulted in  Mission Beach, has been medically cleared to return to practice but hasn't  because of a salary dispute.  </P> <P> Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said Monday the Chargers intend to pay  Phillips 50% of this year's salary. Beathard said the Chargers wanted Phillips  to practice during the bye week to determine if he could handle normal contact.  According to Beathard, Phillips said he wouldn't return to practice unless he  was granted full payment on his contract.  </P> <P> The salary dispute is apparently only part of the holdup. Beathard said the  Chargers asked Phillips to sign a waver relieving the team of responsibility in  the event Phillips was re-injured on the football field. Beathard also said the  Chargers wanted Phillips to sign a new contract before his current one expires  Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Linebacker Billy Ray Smith reinjured his elbow in Sunday's loss to the Broncos  but said he expects to be ready for this week's game against Kansas City.  </P> <P> Linebacker Richard Brown (hamstring) is eligible to come off injured reserve  this week and Coach Dan Henning said he may be activated.  </P> <P> Asked if the Chargers would consider activating rookie quarterback John Friesz,  Henning said: "The only reason that we would consider that is if we we were  going to start him and we're not going to do that right now."  </P> <P> That doesn't mean Friesz won't give Billy Joe Tolliver a run for the starting  job in the future. Henning said the quarterback situation would be evaluated  during the off-season.  </P> <P> Henning said it would be nice to see what Friesz could do but that activating  him for the remainder of this season might do him and the team more harm than  good because of his limited experience.  </P> <P> After reviewing game films, Henning didn't agree with the call that ruled tight  end Derrick Walker had fumbled on the Broncos' one-yard line in the first  quarter Sunday.  </P> <P> "My impression is that he was down," Henning said. "The ball should have been  blown dead on the one-yard line."  </P> <P> The Chargers have distributed about 43,000 tickets for the last home game  Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, said Jack Teele, assistant to the  president. Teele expects a crowd of about 47,000 by kickoff. DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

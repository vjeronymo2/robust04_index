			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (such as evidence of shipment). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) While not required, Contractors are strongly encouraged to assign an identification number to each invoice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Interest penalty. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with any contract term or condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Computing penalty amount. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is prescribed by other governmental authority ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(3) of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with a contract provision. In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the Contractor furnishes correct electronic funds transfer data; provided, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7 days after the Government receives notice that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

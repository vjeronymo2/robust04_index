			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Concern over estimate for PSBR drives gilts lower SUPPLY fears dominated trading in the gilts market yesterday, in the wake of last week's Autumn Statement, pushing prices down more than a point. The market was driven down by concerns that the estimated 1993/94 public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 44bn could be exceeded. Traders said yesterday that a number of factors, such as lower-than-expected growth, or a collapse in public pay constraint, could push the government's funding needs even higher. Already, supply in the gilts market next year is expected to exceed Pounds 50bn, including refinancing of maturing debt. From the gilt market's point of view, the prospect of a tax increase may now be viewed as good news. 'A tax increase could be positive for the gilts market. It would show resolve in attacking the deficit,' said Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Capital Markets, who added that although such a move would be unpopular, a general election is still some time away. THE French market also fared poorly yesterday, despite the issue of positive inflation data. French consumer prices showed a monthly rise of 0.3 per cent, representing an increase of 2.4 per cent in year-on-year inflation, down from 2.6 per cent in September. French inflation has now fallen substantially below German inflation. However, French bond prices ended down  3/8 point, as the market lost some of its recent buoyant tone, due to fading expectations of further interest rate cuts. The French central bank yesterday kept a tighter rein on liquidity, dashing hopes of further cuts unless the Germans take action. THE German bund market also appears to have run out of steam, ending slightly lower, after losing some earlier gains. The revision of September broad money growth to 9.3 per cent from 9.1 per cent and a drop in western German wholesale prices for October helped depress sentiment in the German market. The December bund future on Liffe closed down 0.12 point at 90.97. US TREASURY prices were mixed across the maturity range in thin trading yesterday in the wake of more evidence showing continued improvements in economic activity. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue had recovered from early losss to stand  3/16 higher at 100, yielding 7.556 per cent. The two-year note was notably lower, however, down  5/32 at 99 7/32 to carry a yield of 4.655 per cent. Prices eased at the opening on news of a 0.3 per cent rise in industrial production during October and a small rise in capacity utilisation. Both figures were slightly above market expectations, and following last week's bullish news on the economy, backed up the growing perception of Treasury investors that economic growth over the coming quarters may prove more robust than anticipated. The early declines eventually prompted afternoon buying at the long end of the market, and simultaneous selling of shorter-dated securities in a series of 'curve-flattening' trades. CANADIAN bond prices fell more than a point, following a  3/4 point prime rate hike, as the Canadian dollar came under renewed pressure yesterday. The Canadian dollar seemed to stabilise somewhat at around CDollars 1.27 against the US dollar, following intervention by the Bank of Canada. As well as the weakness of the currency, concern about the mounting deficits facing not only Canada but many provinces pushed bond prices down. The yield curve has flattened substantially, despite the weak performance of bonds. The Government of Canada's 8 1/2 per cent 10-year bonds ended down 1 1/8 point.</p>

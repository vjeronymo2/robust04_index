			<p>BFN     [Text] The Australian ambassador to the Kingdom of  Cambodia has been appointed as a (?senior) adviser to Prince  Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of  foreign affairs. Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said  the appointment had been made at the request of the Royal  Government of Cambodia [RGC].    The ambassador will take up this assignment next month after  his term as the Australian envoy comes to an end.    Evans further said that the nomination is (?clear) evidence  of Australia's determination to further move forward with  Cambodia and that the ambassador will provide useful political  and diplomatic advice and assist in developing Cambodia's  national (?planning). The Australian Aid Agency, he added, has  asked for funds to hire two senior advisers to help the RGC in  the agricultural and educational sectors.</p>

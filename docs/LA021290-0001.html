			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SMILES IMPRESS SOVIETS ON TOUR OF U.S. BASES  </P> <P> It was handshakes rather than hardware that made the biggest impression on a  Soviet delegation visiting area military bases this weekend.  </P> <P> The high-level Soviet officials, whose tour of military bases included an  aircraft demonstration at the Miramar Naval Air Station and combat  demonstrations at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, said they were more taken by  American friendliness and hospitality than by the exhibitions.  </P> <P> "I am especially impressed by the openness of the arrangements," said Valeriy  N. Ochirov, deputy chairman of the defense and state security committee of the  Supreme Soviet.  </P> <P> "Today we came to the combined view, having seen all this, that we should look  at each other not as target devices in the cabins of planes," Ochirov said  through an interpreter. "The mountain of weaponry is already too high. We need  to make it lower and bring people (from both nations) together."  </P> <P> Committee member Anatoly A. Chizhov, also speaking through an interpreter,  said, "I'm impressed by the technical aspects, but the most important thing was  the attitude of the American people."  </P> <P> "They were very friendly, and we have to believe that Americans are exactly  like the Soviet people. That is not (just) pretty words but my sincere  impression of the trip," Chizhov said.  </P> <P> The members of the Soviet Union's leading legislative body will be touring U.S.  military installations for two weeks as guests of the U.S. House and Senate  armed services committees. Their visit, including the stop in San Diego on  Saturday, is to reciprocate for a tour of Soviet military bases last year by  U.S. congressmen.  </P> <P> The delegation, made up of diplomats, a scientist, journalists, interpreters  and others, began its tour on Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / New drive to save Eko Stahl as Riva pulls out The Treuhand privatisation agency last night launched a new effort to salvage eastern Germany's largest steel mill after the decision by Riva, the private Italian steel company, to pull out from buying the plant at the 11th hour. The Treuhand said it had appointed Mr Hans Apel, a former Bonn cabinet minister, to find a new investor for the Eko Stahl mill. The steel plant, once a pillar of communist industry, has been drastically scaled down but is still vital to the town of Eisenhuttenstadt, near the Polish border, a region of high unemployment. Mr Apel's appointment was announced after the Treuhand held emergency talks with management, trade union and state and local government officials. Treuhand president Ms Birgit Breuel said all parties supported Mr Apel's nomination as a mediator to solve the latest crisis over Eko Stahl's fate. Mr Manfred Stolpe, premier of Brandenburg state, said tentative talks had been started with the west German steel industry. Some parties had already expressed interest, he said. Earlier, the people of Eisenhuttenstadt displayed little confidence a buyer would be found. 'It is now pretty hopeless,' said Mr Wolfgang Hirsch, a 38-year-old who used to work at the Eko Stahl steel mill. 'If the mill closes, Eisenhuttenstadt has nothing else to offer its 50,000 people. The town was built in 1951 around the new steel mill which the communists located here.' Before German unification in 1990, the mill produced an annual 2.5m tonnes and employed 12,000 workers. Today, it produces 900,000 tonnes and has 3,000 full-time workers on the payroll. 'Many of the unemployed from the mill just sit at home,' said Ms Birgit Henschl, a nurse at the local hospital. 'They drink more and more. They have no perspective. Many young people have already quit and gone to west Germany. We thought the Italians would save the plant.' Riva withdrew at the weekend despite the go-ahead by the European Commission for the Treuhand to earmark DM813m (Pounds 325m) for the plant. The capital would be used to modernise the cold rolling mill and invest in equipment for manufacturing hot-rolled flat products, both aimed at converting the loss-making Eko Stahl into an integrated and competitive mill. Riva's decision to pull out was apparently precipitated by a row with IG Metall, the engineering union. Riva had wanted to reduce the workforce by 700 to 2,300 as soon as possible, while the union wanted the jobs to be slowly phased out up to the end of the year. Both sides also failed to agree on the composition of the supervisory board. The collapse of the Riva deal will be greeted with relief by west Germany's steel manufacturers, who opposed the modernisation plan. They had argued that construction of a modern hot rolling mill would pose a threat to the industry. As a compromise, a consortium, led by Thyssen and Preussag, the steel manufacturers, proposed buying 50 per cent of Eko Stahl's cold rolling mill, closing down the hot-blast furnaces, and securing 1,000 jobs for the mill's subsidiaries. The Treuhand rejected the plan. The Treuhand's insistence on creating an integrated steel mill at Eisenhuttenstadt, at considerable expense to the taxpayer, reveals a shift in its own philosophy. In 1990 and early 1991, the agency rushed to close enterprises - such as Interflug, East Germany's airline, on grounds it was making losses and not worth restructuring. In that period, the number of jobs in eastern Germany fell from 9.3m to 6.2m. Since then, the Treuhand has increasingly anchored its economic/ideological philosophy in social and political considerations. An official of the West German Steel Federation agrees. 'Eko Stahl is a political issue. The Treuhand and the government cannot afford to close it down because there's nothing else in the region,' he said. The Treuhand goes one stage further in justifying its attempts to save Eko Stahl. 'We will try to find another buyer for Eko Stahl because, eventually, a modern, integrated steel mill on the borders with eastern Europe has a great chance,' an agency official said. 'We have to restructure and look to the long term because we have to turn some of these regions of eastern Germany into highly competitive industries. Otherwise there will be a desert. That is what Eko Stahl means.'</p>

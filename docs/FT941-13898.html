			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and his companion Lucy Dicker are finding their trip round world is hardly one long holiday: they have been hit by illness, injuries and theft. They are still on course to ski every day in 1994 but events have made the extra challenge of skiing 5,000 miles during the year a very tough one. Arnie reports from North America: 'After a hacking cough, I lost my voice and then the use of my left arm after falling twice on my shoulder. We later lost our video camera, stills camera and credit cards. 'But we've been given such a warm welcome everywhere that our spirits have not been damped. We have already driven more than 4,000 miles and skied in a score of US resorts - but if this is Saturday it must be Canada . . .' Full reports on the expedition will appear each month in Weekend FT. There is still time to win a skiing holiday for two in Zermatt or runner-up prizes of champagne by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on January 1 (copies available from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).</p>

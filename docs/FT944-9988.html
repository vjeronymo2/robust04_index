			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): TeleWest tries again - New issues / Christopher Price analyses the week's flotations Flotation plans announced this week by TeleWest, the largest UK cable operator, have provoked a mixed reaction from industry analysts and commentators. They have also provided more fuel to the debate over the multi-media revolution and the valuation investors should attach to it. The move is TeleWest's second attempt to gain a listing; the group postponed its original attempt in the summer, blaming poor market conditions. There is little doubt that the market has improved since then, and the evidence from recent issues such as Filtronic Comtek and Calluna is that investors are willing to back new technology issues which rely more on future growth than past performance. But the fate of New Look, the fashion retailer, which postponed its float last week due to lack of institutional investor demand, also showed that the reaction to the high-profile disasters which have affected several new issues in the market this year continues to sully sentiment. TeleWest, a joint venture between US television and telecom groups TCI and US West, will be the first UK cable company to be listed on the London market. The company, which carries satellite television signals to around 133,000 homes and telephone services to more than half of these, intends to encourage subscribers to take other services, such as fax and video. Kleinwort Benson, TeleWest's broker, forecasts that the group's UK coverage will rise from the present 613,000 homes to 2.4m in the year 2004, and that its penetration rate will leap from 21 per cent to 47 per cent. This would equate to more than 1m subscribers. The broker anticipates that revenues will grow from Pounds 70m to Pounds 1.1bn in the same period and that the company will break even in 1998. It is envisaged that the group becomes heavily cash-generative from the year 2000, from which time a dividend could be paid. Critics disagree and point to several potential clouds on TeleWest's horizon. Prominent among these, they argue, is the so-called 'churn rate' - the number of homes which have tried the cable service and not re-enlisted. At 48.5 per cent during the year to end-September, some sceptics say this proportion is too high. There are also concerns about the valuation. Kleinwort says the rating is undemanding when compared with the three other cable companies with UK interests, which are listed in the US. By using the level of capital spending, the number of connections and the ratings applied to the US-listed companies, the broker has come up with a value for TeleWest of Pounds 1.51bn before the money to be raised from the offering. At the suggested share price of between 165p and 190p, the implied value is between Pounds 1.25bn and Pounds 1.45bn. TeleWest supporters believe the company deserves an even higher rating because it has more control over its assets than some of the other cable groups and because of the pedigree and resources of the parent companies. The valuation figure is also reached by projecting the company's cash flows in future years and calculating their net present value. This is done by discounting the cash flows by the time value of money and adjusting for risks specific to the company. For the year 2005, Kleinwort has chosen a level of 10 times operating cash flow. This is too high, say critics, who point to the large assumptions made in the model. 'It is too sensitive to the discount rate, the multiple is too demanding for a new issue, and there are too many 'ifs',' one analyst said yesterday. The aim of the float is to raise between Pounds 330m and Pounds 380m in new money with the sale of 216m ordinary shares in London and the Nasdaq market in New York. This represents 26 per cent of the enlarged issued ordinary share capital - 22 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The share price will be announced on November 22, with the company coming to market on November 30. The global offer is being aimed largely at institutional shareholders, although there is an intermediaries offer where up to a quarter of the 50 per cent of the offer reserved for non-US investors is being ear-marked for London firms. Interested private investors must go through a broker. For further details, ring the information line on 071-490 5200. With BSkyB due to unveil its flotation plans early next week, small investors looking for a multi-media stake will await the details with interest. Two other new issues of interest this week were Ashbourne Holdings, the nursing home operator, and shellfish producer SeaPerfect. Ashbourne shares, priced at 150p, values the group at Pounds 80.5m. This will raise Pounds 48m after expenses through a placing and public offer to pay off debt. SeaPerfect shares have been priced at 120p. It is coming to market through a placing and intermediaries offer of 20.8m shares and the issue will raise Pounds 25m.</p>

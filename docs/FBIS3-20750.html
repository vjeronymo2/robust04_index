			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The development of a new Polish  encryption system for military communications that is compatible  with NATO secure communications systems was reported in a 28  February Polish television news broadcast. According to TV  Polonia's "Wiadomosci" program, the new digital system will  permit the transmission of encoded messages by telephone and  radio within the Polish military and government, as well as to  compatible foreign systems. The development of the encryption  system was financed by the Ministry of National Defense and the  Committee for Scientific Research. Deputy Communications  Minister Marek Rusin told "Wiadomosci" that "this system is  three times cheaper than similar ones used in the West, and its  quality is competitive with NATO standards."</p>

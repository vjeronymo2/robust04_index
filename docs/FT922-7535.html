			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: US lenders loom as immediate O&amp;Y challenge Among Olympia &amp; York's most immediate challenges is to mollify lenders to its US operations. O&amp;Y maintains that its US business - comprising buildings mostly in New York, but also in numerous other cities around the country - is relatively healthy. These operations have been left outside the court protection granted to O&amp;Y late last week under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code and Canada's Companies Creditors Arrangements Act. Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, declined to say on Friday whether the company will meet interest payments on its US properties, now that a standstill is in place on debt payments in Canada. While the company has managed to keep debt-service payments current on some US loans, it has failed to make payments on others since its liquidity crisis surfaced two months ago. In at least one case, involving Dollars 62m in interest on a Eurobond issued to finance a building at the World Financial Centre, O&amp;Y has funnelled rental income to its cash-starved Canadian operations. Failure to pay interest on this bond led to a cross-default on another USDollars 160m loan, prompting JP Morgan to foreclose last week on an interest-rate swap held as collateral. O&amp;Y is due to meet this week with holders of bonds secured by 55 Water Street, an office building in lower Manhattan. The building appears to generate sufficient rental income to meet debt-service payments, and the next interest payment is due on June 30. O&amp;Y has taken a number of steps in recent months to deal with the handful of US buildings which are not paying their way. Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong magnate, took an equity interest last autumn in the building formerly occupied by Drexel Burnham Lambert, the failed investment bank. In addition, O&amp;Y says that it has deferred a USDollars 100m refinancing due this year on 320 Park Avenue, the former ITT head office in midtown Manhattan, which is now standing virtually empty.</p>

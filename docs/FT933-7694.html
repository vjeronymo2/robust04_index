			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Last strike ends at Hyundai A 10-WEEK round of strikes at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, finally ended yesterday when 52 per cent of the workers at its shipbuilding subsidiary agreed a pay pact. Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) was the last of nine Hyundai companies to resolve the labour strife that first began on June 5. Hyundai is estimated to have lost Won900bn (Pounds 760m) in sales as a result of the industrial action, which involved 60,000 workers. The action has affected the Korean economy. When the central bank recently reduced its 1993 GNP growth forecast from 6 per cent to 5.7 per cent, it largely blamed the Hyundai strikes for the revision. The Hyundai workers were mostly unsuccessful in achieving their demands during wage negotiations. They struck for an average pay increase of 16 per cent, although most finally settled for the 4.7 per cent wage raise offered by management, in addition to production bonuses and fringe benefits. Workers were also forced to abandon their demands for a working week of 40 hours instead of 44 hours and a say in management and personnel decisions. HHI workers agreed to end their strike, which began on July 5, after the government threatened to intervene tomorrow and impose a 20-day cooling-off period.</p>

Our people reached the point where  they could stand the dictatorship of the shah's puppet  government no longer and rose up and succeeded in toppling it  with their magnificent revolution of 11 February 1979. The  objective was to establish freedom, independence, and the  peoples' sovereignty over the country's capital and national  resources so they would be used for the prosperity and happiness  of the people of Iran. They also wanted equal opportunity for  Iranian youth so they would grow in a society based on justice  and the rule of law. [passage omitted]    In truth, how many ordeals we have endured! There is no  doubt that regardless of how much we speak of the cruelty and  crimes of Khomeyni, his treachery and destruction, it still does  not do it justice. The destruction of the social structure, and  of institutions of economic development can be appraised on the  basis of statistics regarding the Khomeyni era. We have  regressed by 50 years and perhaps we have lost the opportunity  for growth and development to the same extent. Can we even  truthfully know at what juncture Iran and its people stand?  Certainly not. Khomeyni's crimes and treachery are, of course,  limitless. [words indistinct]    For all these 15 years, the conditions in Iran have been  like  the two sides of a coin. We have always been and still are in  the crucible of a test--a contest for the existence or  destruction of a nation, one historic for our great nation. In  this turbulent era of upheaval, [words indistinct]. On the one  side of the coin is the reality of the tyranny and devastation  inflicted by the Khomeyni regime. On the other side of the coin  is the sacrificial resistance of a wounded nation, unprecedented  in today's world, without any exaggeration. The passage of time  will highlight both sides of the coin clearly and more precisely  and will continue to do so. [passage omitted]    Compatriots, if we view in retrospect the dimensions of the  treachery and destruction of the Khomeyni regime, we were the  ones in the past, the Iranian resistance who [words indistinct].  The performance of the clerics is so black and disgraceful that  they are forced to admit it themselves or to complain about  domestic shortages which in some way come about during the  course of their domestic strife and tussling. In any case, the  regime has itself divulged the extent of the devastation it has  caused.    The dimensions of the economic bankruptcy of the regime is  such that they themselves state openly that all the oil income  for the next year will be less than the amount of the arrears on  foreign debts. The estimated income from oil sales is less than  or [words indistinct] the calculated foreign debts of the regime  is approximately (?$50) billion. [passage omitted]    Details of the tortures inflicted by the Khomeyni regime  cannot be covered in this brief speech. Only after these filthy  fiends are toppled will the goings on in their torture chambers  be revealed. Hands amputated, eyes gouged out, stonings to  death, people hurled from heights -- these are only a few  (?examples) of the 15 years of heinous atrocities perpetrated by  the Khomeyni regime. As regards thievery, pillage,  misappropriating public property, depositing oil income in  private accounts, the clerics have (?surpassed) criminals.  [passage omitted]    The people of Zahedan, Mashhad, and Arak [words indistinct]  rose up against the brutal clerics, demanding the freedom of the  people. The regime's agents are becoming helpless in the face  of these cities and their residents. At the same time the axis  of the sources of emulation and the leadership of the regime is  atrophying and presents a decrepit and tattered (?image) more  than ever before and is becoming weaker and weaker. According  to Khomeyni, the Velayat-e Faqih should be a source of emulation  before anything else.    We heard that the head of the regime's judiciary and its  executions, the cleric Yazdi, announced that [words indistinct]  and they can express support but not intervene in judicial  affairs. The sources of emulation can speak on the (?minor  points) of how to offer prayers, but they should not enter  politics. How strange that the fate of the Khomeyni regime is  such that God has inflicted his curse on them and each one says  something different and thus appears more and more ludicrous.  One day Khomeyni said that we would fight the war for 20 years,  until victory; Jerusalem through Karbala'! What spurious  slogans! Later he said: I made a mistake and I have taken the  chalice of poison! [passage indistinct]    The people and the popular forces should know that [words  indistinct] that the elite of Iran's offspring are in the ranks  of the National Liberation Army and are endowed with the essence  of heroism and combat capabilities. They have always said that  this regime must be toppled. God willing, it will be, under the  aegis of (?their efforts).</p>

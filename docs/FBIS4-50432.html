			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Minister Vows Aid to Poor Will Rise"] </F>   [Text] Social relief payments and provisions of food and  clothing to the poor will be gradually increased in response to  the rising prices in various areas, pledged Doje Cering,  Minister of Civil Affairs.    "This will be one of the ministry's major objectives in  civil  affairs work for the following five years," he said addressing  the 10th National Conference on Civil Affairs, which opened in  Beijing on Thursday.    In China, about 200 million people receive government  assistance.    The recipients comprise three major groups: families of  martyrs and servicemen, disabled and demobilized servicemen,  retired army officers, and veterans of the Red Army; childless  elders, the disabled, orphans and poverty-stricken families; and  victims of natural disasters.    The rural and urban poor lived on just 400 yuan ($46) last  year, while the average annual per capita in come of rural  residents and city dwellers was 921 yuan ($105) and 1,400 yuan  ($161) respectively.    "The living conditions of the poor may be worsening for a  time due to inflation, which will also make the government's  social relief more difficult, the minister said.    Meanwhile, the government anticipates problems in finding  jobs for the tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers and large  numbers of the disabled in the years ahead, due to the labour  reforms and the intensified market competition among enterprises.    One major way to ease the funding shortage and help the  poor,  the minister said, is to mobilize various forces to accelerate  the development of public welfare projects.    There are 43,681 public welfare institutions caring for some  724,000 individuals in China's urban and rural areas, but only  about 2,000 of them are run by the civil affairs departments;  the rest are financed by social organizations or individuals.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Paying a high price for Being in Control - Robert Corzine on the costly demise of the old regional structure in favour of five new businesses / Way forward after pounds 1.65bn restructuring No one familiar with the UK gas industry ever expected that the task of unravelling the largest integrated gas business in the West would come cheaply. But the Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge and 5,000 additional job losses announced yesterday by British Gas was the 'mother of all restructuring charges,' according to one City analyst. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said accounting practices prevented British Gas from phasing in the costs of restructuring over a prolonged period. 'We had to do it in the year in which the decision was taken,' he said. But some analysts suspect that the dramatic announcement may also have been a reminder to the government and to Ofgas, the industry regulator, of the practical implications of the decision last December to abolish, beginning in 1996, British Gas's monopoly on supplying 18m of Britain's 24m households. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided against breaking up the company, and decreed that only the gas transportation and storage business had to be separated by Chinese walls from the trading business. But senior executives decided that five separate business streams were needed to cope with increased competition. Some analysts also detected the influence of Mr Richard Giordano, the new executive chairman, in yesterday's announcement. Although he has assumed a low profile since taking over at the beginning of January and did not attend yesterday's presentation, his appointment was intended to be a catalyst for the radical change of British Gas' corporate culture as well as its cost base. In his written statement Mr Giordano conceded that 'a restructuring of this magnitude will be painful for some,' but ' . . . we will do our best to be fair and generous to those who leave.' The latest announcement brings to 25,000 the total number of job cuts to be made over five years, although most will disappear over the next three years, the company says. There has been scepticism among analysts that the company could actually meet previously-announced cost-cutting targets. But Mr Rogerson and Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, pointed to a fall in employee numbers at the end of 1993 to 76,453, from 82,146 previously, as proof that British Gas is actually implementing its plans. The demise of its old regional structure in favour of the five new national businesses should also help the company to meet cost-cutting targets, according to analysts. The regional structure was well suited to the last 25 years or so, during which British Gas expanded its share of the UK non-transportation energy market from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. But managers of the 12 regions resisted moves which would have eroded their power bases. 'The regions were run like little empires,' according to Mr Simon Flowers, analyst at Natwest Securities in Edinburgh. Severance and pension costs totalling Pounds 1.31bn form the bulk of the restructuring charge, virtually all of which will require cash expenditure, according to Mr Rogerson. The cost per head will be about Pounds 52,000, with pension provisions a quarter of that figure. Other redundancy-related costs include re-training and counselling. Some Pounds 50m has been allocated for training of staff who are staying but who will need to assume additional tasks. The personnel cuts will be made across the new business divisions, say officials. The physical division of the business units will cost Pounds 100m, with an additional Pounds 60m needed to cover payments for leased buildings which will no longer be needed. A total of 2,900 employees will need to relocate. Mr Brown dismissed criticism that action could have been taken much earlier to reduce British Gas's cost base, which will be cut by more than Pounds 600m a year as a result of the restructuring. He said radical action would have been taken much sooner had it not been for the prolonged period of uncertainty while the government decided on the future structure of the gas industry. 'We began looking at restructuring two-and-a-half years ago,' he said, 'but it would have been stupid if we had embarked on it without the clarity of the MMC and DTI decisions.' Mr Brown said it was still not possible to say how much emphasis the company would place on its non-regulated businesses, such as exploration and production and activities outside the UK. Ironically, whatever international strategy emerges is likely to stress British Gas's expertise as an integrated gas company, able to apply its various skills in all segments of the 'gas chain' from exploration and production to processing, distribution and marketing. But Mr Brown said: 'We need to know what the shipping charges and rate of return will be on our UK gas transport business before a clear international strategy can be determined.' Ofgas is to issue a consultation document on the subject in April, with a decision expected by October. The other big uncertainty facing the company is the way in which Ofgas intends to open the residential market to competition. One positive development noted by Mr Brown yesterday was an end to the animosity which marked British Gas's relations with its regulator over the past few years. It coincided with the appointment last November of Ms Clare Spottiswoode as the new Ofgas director general. 'Both parties are now listening to each other', said Mr Brown, who stressed that British Gas was only seeking 'a level playing field' with potential competitors. A consultation document giving detailed options for introducing full-scale competition in the residential market will be published within the next few weeks, with a firm decision on the way forward expected before the summer, when government lawyers will begin drafting a new Gas bill for parliament to consider. Only then will it become clear whether yesterday's action will be sufficient to put British Gas in control of its corporate destiny.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         REFIT FOR THE GAS MEN                         The new structure ....  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            BRITISH GAS PLC                              HQ: LONDON Sir Richard Giordano                                    Cedric Brown      Chairman                                          Chief executive  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Transport and storage MD: Mr Harry Moulson HQ: Solihull Gas transmission, distribution and storage for other units of British Gas and third party competitors on a fee basis.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Public gas supply MD: Michael Alexander HQ: Staines Supplying domestic and small commercial and industrial customers using under 2,500 therms a year.

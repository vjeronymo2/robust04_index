			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> &blank;401&blank;Computer Software Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Computer software consists of programs and routines (sets of computer instructions) which direct the operation of the computer. Software may refer to generalized routines useful in computer operations or to programs for specific applications such as payroll.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The distinction between generalized software and application software is important. Generalized software provides operating support for individual applications. This would include programs for such tasks as making printouts of machine-readable records, sorting records, organizing and maintaining files, translating programs written in a symbolic language into machine-language instructions, and scheduling jobs through the computer. These programs are generally furnished by the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application software consists of a set of instructions for performing a particular data processing task. Application programs are generally written by the user installation, but are frequently obtained as prewritten packages from software vendors. Application software includes programs such as payroll, billing, general ledger, as well as engineering or managerial applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Costs incurred with the purchase or development of computer software shall be accounted for as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Capitalize in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment, all costs for generalized software. Depreciate the cost over the service life (or remaining life) of the main hardware (i.e., containing central processor). If the purchase invoice does not break out or assign a cost to the ``generalized software,'' it is appropriate to include the full amount in hardware costs. Defer in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, the cost of all applications software determined to have a service life of over one year. Amortize this cost to Account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, over the estimated useful life of the program. This amortization period shall not exceed five (5) years. We realize, however, that there may be circumstances that justify a useful life longer than 5 years. When this is the case and it is management's intent to utilize these programs over an extended period, written justification shall be submitted to REA for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Expense in Account 921, Office Supplies and Expenses, in the period incurred, all costs associated with the maintenance, updating, and conversion of files or revision of all software, and all costs for software with a useful life of less than 1 year. Also, expense the unamortized cost of all software determined, during year, to be no longer used by or useful to the cooperative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the total cost of purchased or internally developed software, the following items shall be included:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Costs incurred for feasibility studies if they result in the purchase or development of software;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. All costs related to the actual purchase or development of the software. These costs must be specifically identifiable with the software and properly supported by time cards, invoices, or other documents; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. All costs incurred in ``testing and debugging'' the software. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Computer software costs are properly chargeable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress, provided that the following criteria are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. The computer program is specifically dedicated to performing a construction related activity, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The cost of the software is itemized separate and apart from other hardware and software costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

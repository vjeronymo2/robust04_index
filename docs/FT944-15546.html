			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / People: BZW's new deputy chief executive The heir appparent to David Band at the helm of BZW, Barclays' investment banking arm, emerged yesterday with the appointment of Donald Brydon, chairman and chief executive of BZW Asset Management, as BZW deputy chief executive. Brydon, right, who has been responsible for growing funds under management at BZW Asset Management to Pounds 50bn and spreading its international activities, takes over from John Spencer, who will be leaving BZW at the end of the year. Although Band is expected to remain chief executive for at least two years, Brydon's appointment completes the reshuffle of senior management at BZW intended to prepare for a new generation of leadership in the second half of the decade. Unlike Spencer, who combined the role of deputy chief executive with being head of BZW's markets division, Brydon will give up his line management responsibilities to work alongside Band heading BZW's management committee. He will be succeeded as BZWAM chief executive by Lindsay Tomlinson, the current deputy chief executive. Brydon will be non-executive chairman of BZWAM, and will also join the group executive committee which runs the Barclays group. Band, who has been chief executive of BZW since 1988 and has been at the helm during a period of rapid growth and diversificaction, may succeed Sir Peter Middleton as chairman of BZW when he gives up the chief executive post. Brydon, who is 49, said that the firm's growth meant that 'a more complex style of management' was required. Brydon took over at BZAM in 1991. He has a mathematics degree and helped to introduce quantitative techniques there, but is modest about his skills. 'I wouldn't describe myself as a mathematician. I am numerate maybe,' he says.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jobs to go at London Fox THE LONDON Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) is to decide by the end of this week on a number of redundancies needed if it is to break even in 1992-93, a memorandum by the exchange's chief executive said, reports Reuter. 'In order to achieve break-even for the exchange, the executive director decided it was necessary to examine every item of projected expenditure and decide whether or not it was vital to the functioning of the exchange,' said the memorandum, sent out yesterday. 'Regrettably. . . it is necessary to eliminate some jobs from the exchange and to combine others,' the memorandum said. An executive group meeting will be held tomorrow, when a final decision will be made on redundancies, which traders suggest could affect 15 to 20 people. The drafting of the 1992-93 budget proved time-consuming and difficult, with previous drafts rejected by the board of directors as it would not agree to London Fox budgeting at a loss, the memorandum said. 'We came to the conclusion the exchange must move from its current structure and operating approach to a maintenance-only basis,' it added. The exchange will in future provide only those services absolutely necessary for the safe operation of its markets, which include coffee, cocoa, sugar and other agricultural products.</p>

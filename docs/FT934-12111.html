			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Warnings on credit adverts attacked COMPULSORY 'health warnings' at the bottom of financial advertisements for credit should be abolished or at least simplified, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers told an Office of Fair Trading inquiry yesterday. Consumers are confused and put off by the pedantic wording of the warnings, the advertisers' body told the inquiry into the working and enforcement of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The investigation forms part of the government's drive to reduce unnecessary regulation. The warnings on the possible consequences of defaulting on secured loans, and information on, for example, how interest rates are calculated, must by law appear at the end of all advertisements that involve credit arrangements. The rules cover advertisements for, among others, car loans, mortgages and credit cards, and apply to radio and television as well as print advertising. Mr Kenneth Miles, director-general of the society, said there were 'no grounds for regarding most financial advertising as deserving of suspicion'. Consumers were in danger of suffering from 'information overload'. The society is arguing for self-regulation and for the Advertising Standards Authority, which is financed by an industry levy, to oversee credit advertisements. The authority performed this function before 1980, when regulations under the 1974 act came into effect. The authority said yesterday that it would be prepared to take the job again provided it had adequate resources. It said that complaints about consumer credit could total 5,000 a year, on top of the 11,000 complaints about other areas of advertising already handled. The society's evidence was given on the first day of a two-day public hearing in London.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Main parties neck and neck in poll of polls - Public opinion IF THE opinion polls are to be believed, the voters have made up their minds already. With Mr John Major now virtually committed to an April 9 general election, the latest batch confirms that the time, money and energy expended by the two main parties since the new year has been largely wasted. Rather like the opposing sides in the First World War both Labour and Conservatives have fired huge amounts of ammunition to little effect. The FT's weighted average of the last seven opinion polls shows them firmly stuck in trenches giving each a fraction less than 40 per cent the vote. Neither side has budged since the autumn. Only the Liberal Democrats, apparently benefiting rather than suffering from the publicity surrounding Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission that he had an affair with his former secretary, can claim a marginal improvement. There is potential, however, for both Mr John Major, the prime minister and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, to claim the initiative. The prime minister can set the agenda with a tax-cutting Budget. Mr Kinnock can claim that the voters have still to fully appreciate how deep the recession has become. The present deadlock has fuelled the growing feeling at Westminster that the most likely result of the election will be a hung parliament. On their present performance the FT's computer gives the Conservatives 317 seats (against 326 needed for an overall majority), Labour 298 and the Liberal Democrats 11. The Conservatives now have 367 seats, Labour 230 and the Liberal Democrats 22.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT POLL OF POLLS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Sample   Fieldwork   Con    Lab    Lib    Con                    size      dates                  Dems   margin  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1) Gallup/DT      1,119     Jan 29     42.5   37.5  14.0    5.0                             to Feb 3 2) Harris/Expr    1,097     Feb 5,6    39.0   40.0  17.0   -1.0 3) Ind (S)/NOP    1,084     Feb 7      38.0   42.0  15.0   -4.0 4) ICM/Gdn        1,462     Feb 7,8    40.0   40.0  16.0    0.0 5) Gallup    Countdown      2,012     Feb 5-11   40.0   37.5  17.5    2.5 6) ICM/S Expr     1,098     Feb 14     40.0   39.0  16.0    1.0 7) Harris/Obs     1,066     Feb 12,13  39.0   40.0  15.0   -1.0 Average           1,277                40.0   39.0  16.0    0.0 Weighted avg                          39.83  39.24 15.97   0.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Publication dates: (1) (2) Feb 7 (3) Feb 9 (4) Feb 12 (5) Feb 15 (6) (7) Feb 16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Restored to health with new ambition: David Simon and John Browne describe BP's business strategy to Robert Corzine and David Lascelles Healing can be a slow process in the business world. It has taken British Petroleum two-and-a-half years to recover from the crisis of mid-1992 that led to the dramatic ousting of its former chairman Mr Robert Horton. Then, the UK's leading oil company cut its dividend as it struggled to reduce a Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.6bn) debt mountain and saw its share price plummet. This year, BP's shares have soared to record highs as the company paid its first dividend increase since 1992. Much of the credit for the turnround goes to Mr David Simon, the chief executive, who took over from Mr Horton after the boardroom coup. He describes the company as fully restored to health, but one with new ambitions. Since 1992, Mr Simon and his colleagues have kept a deliberately low profile while they worked to rebuild profits, repay billions of dollars of debt, sell off non-core businesses and refurbish the group's tarnished reputation. In contrast to the expansiveness of the Horton era, he prefers to use words such as discipline, teamwork - and even boring - to describe his style. Two weeks ago, BP announced a top-level reshuffle in which Mr Simon will become non-executive chairman, replacing Lord Ashburton who retires from the board. The new chief executive will be Mr John Browne, head of the company's exploration and production division who is credited with orchestrating a marked improvement in the division's results. The changeover marks a new phase in BP's recovery strategy in which the group will set itself more demanding performance targets, including higher earnings, more debt reduction and modest growth in capital spending. The targets are indications of BP's renewed self-confidence - 'the gateway to further disciplined growth', as Mr Simon describes it. These financial targets will be achieved through increases in oil and gas volumes, continued cost-cutting, and improvements in internal organisation to break down barriers between the company's divisions. The company is also committed to further changes in its corporate culture to enhance its competitiveness. This is driven by BP's belief that it will get little help from changes in the external business environment such as higher crude oil prices or wider refining margins, at least in the near future. The company assumes, for example, that oil prices are likely to remain in the Dollars 16-Dollars 18 a barrel range, around current levels. To be on the safe side, it uses a much lower figure, Dollars 14, when testing the economics of new oil fields. 'We have to build in performance under all market conditions,' says Mr Simon. BP also acknowledges that any technological lead it might have in certain areas, such as operating in the deep water west of the Shetland Islands or developing new fuel specifications, is likely to be short-lived in an industry where partnerships and the sharing of information is the rule. The company's competitiveness rests on its ability to get greater efficiencies from its operations. 'Anybody can copy a formulation or your technology,' says Mr Simon. 'But your competitors cannot ape your process.' One of biggest changes that both men want to see is closer co-operation between the exploration, refining and marketing sides of the business. BPX, the exploration unit, 'was in a world of its own five years ago,' says Mr Simon. Its focus was on a 'series of massive projects consuming huge amounts of capital,' with no direct linkage to market concerns. 'Now they are fully integrated into BP.' But the aim is to push the integration even further, especially in the fast-developing international markets in Asia and Latin America that BP is keen to enter. Mr Simon says 'the old mind-set among the explorers was to find the oil and build a pipeline'. But the new emphasis in selected countries will be on whether BP can 'feed in other businesses behind the upstream operation'. Mr Browne says such a strategy also fits in with changes in the way developing countries view international oil companies. 'Governments don't look to us just to drill holes but to help them grow their economies. Now we ask ourselves whether BP can become a part of the countries in which it operates.' One of Mr Browne's main tasks will be to oversee the diversification of BP's production base away from its current US/UK bias. BP's production is overwhelmingly based on giant fields such as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and Forties in the UK's North Sea. Its most publicised recent forays have been in politically risky areas such as Azerbaijan, Colombia and Vietnam. Mr Browne, however, rejects the argument that growing involvement in such countries will increase the risk of supply disruptions: any shift away from politically stable countries will be 'very slow', he stresses. There is considerable scope for BP to 'strengthen and deepen' its involvement in existing areas, he says. 'Ten years from now, two-thirds of our production will still come from existing members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.' BP is also keen to build up its production in the fast-growing natural gas market, a business in which the company has lagged behind many competitors. The company has experimented with gas trading in the US and become involved in the emerging spot market for liquefied natural gas by shipping LNG from Australia to Spain. Mr Browne says the company is also thinking about entering the gas-fuelled power generation business in developing countries, although any move would be in co-operation with a partner experienced in the sector. Existing partnerships include a long-standing exploration venture with Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. BP's fastest-growing exploration partnership is with Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group. The selection of partners is a priority for Mr Browne, who says the company spends as much time assessing future partners as it does selecting senior executives. 'We keep an eye on the list of competitors to make sure the balance is right,' he says. Acquisitions of assets will continue under Mr Browne's leadership, but there are unlikely to be big structural changes to the company. The divestment of non-oil and gas assets is virtually completed, and he is content that the portfolio of potential oil and gas fields contains a good mix of opportunities. As for investments in other oil companies, Mr Browne has ruled out the possibility that BP will cement its preferred partnerships by taking equity stakes. 'We're not interested in collecting investments,' he says. 'We would rather do the business directly.' Creating a harmonious relationship between Mr Simon and Mr Browne will be vital in making a success of BP's growth strategy. The two men's experience appears to be complementary: Mr Simon's strength is in marketing, while Mr Browne made his reputation as first BP's treasurer and then the widely-respected head of exploration and production. Those familiar with the company say they also complement each other on a more subtle level. Mr Browne has a reputation for experimentation, a tendency that can create breakthroughs in such a technologically-driven business. It can, however, create tensions among more traditional executives in an organisation that is still in the midst of a bruising restructuring. Analysts say Mr Simon represents that more traditional BP culture, which may reassure those who have to be persuaded of the need for change. He is also the one person at BP whom Mr Browne defers to. While Mr Simon will be a part-time, non-executive chairman, he concedes he is unlikely to give up a lifetime habit of 'thinking about BP seven days a week'. That is likely to suit the other BP board members, who are reluctant after the Horton years to put all the responsibility in the hands of one man. There should, in any case, be plenty of work for both men. BP may be restored to health, but it will require continuing efforts for the company to succeed in a business where the global competition is unremitting.</p>

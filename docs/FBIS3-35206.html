			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed station commentary] </F>   [Text] In the wake of release of the report of Mr Reynaldo  Galindo Pohl, the UN Human Rights Commission's special  representative for probing into the so-called human right's  violations in Iran, yesterday a spokesman of Iran's Foreign  Ministry denied the contention of the representative of the UN  Human Rights Commission.    The spokesman described the contention as baseless and  fabricated.    In a report released by the special representative of the  human rights commission at the UN last Friday, the Islamic  Republic of Iran was again declared as the violater of human  rights due to such cases as execution and crushing of drug  smugglers and launching a drive against social evils.    It is also been claimed in the report that there exists a  large number of political prisoners in Iran and religious  minorities are harassed.    Since 1948 when the principles on observance of human right  were formulated at the UN there has now elapsed nearly half a  century.    During these years fervent efforts have been made so that  the  world nations may have access to some broad based principles  devoid of political discrimination and observations.    This was aimed at making them check any infringement of  their  rights.    Hence today nearly all the world states duly accept the  principles in observing the human rights and also respect them.    This acceptance is also for the reason that the UN as the  greatest world body is recognized as the only forum, which  basically should be the body for considering world issues  specially for defending the rights of human beings at global  level.    But in reality such attention to human rights has so far  been  payed in a different manner.    It is now for many years that western states and governments  which have risen to covertly or overtly confront the Islamic  revolution in Iran over the past fifteen years, have been using  human rights as a weapon against Islamic Iran.    At the onset of the Islamic revolution's victory, the  Islamic  republic of Iran viewed with respect international and human  rights organizations similar to other world bodies.    But acts of the UN human rights commission soon showed that  the term human rights is merely a forced motto in the  contemporary world.    Also the statements and reports of this commission, prior to  have been effected by domestic realities of world states, are  the outcome of the exigencies of domineering world policies.    This precisely points to the conditions which are now faced  by us. It is indisputable but any move in safeguarding  humanitarian criteria of human rights will be possible only when  those involved with human rights issues at the international  level approach the subject without considering political aspects  and conservative outlook, but they act in a totally impartial  manner without taking sides with their typical cultural values.    They should also refrain from using the issue of human  rights  as a political weapon.</p>

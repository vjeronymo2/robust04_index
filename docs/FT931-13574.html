			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US takes world lead in chip technology SEMATECH, the US government and industry backed semiconductor consortium, has demonstrated world-leading chip production technology using all-American process equipment. US semiconductor production equipment makers have increased their share of the world market from a low of 43.9 percent in 1990 to an estimated 53.4 percent in 1992, according to VLSI Research, a US market research firm. Sematech's 10 member companies as well as other US semiconductor manufacturers will now have access to the consortium's technology. The achievement represents the accomplishment of Sematech's primary goal, set when the consortium was formed five years ago. 'When Sematech was created in 1987, we made a commitment to re-establish the US semiconductor industry at the forefront of world manufacturing,' said Mr Bill George, chief operating officer for the consortium based in Austin, Texas. To do that, Sematech has produced demonstration chips with feature sizes of just 0.35 microns. Such chips contain electronic devices so small that 72,500 of them in a row would measure just one inch long. The most advanced chips currently in production have feature sizes of about 0.6 microns. 'By achieving this technology with all-US tools, we have enhanced America's ability to compete in world markets - with exciting prospects for increased US market share. . . ,' Mr George said. Chips with 0.35 micron device widths are seen as the foundation for a new generation of electronics products ranging from talking computers to pocket-sized personal communicators linked to global networks, desktop computers as powerful as today's multi-million dollar supercomputers and intelligent automobiles equipped with chips that monitor and control everything from fuel mixture to the suspension system.</p>

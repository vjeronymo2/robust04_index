A short time historically, but sufficient in order  to result in the coming together of a group of persons, which  has the same name as that of the poem (stress on the final  syllable), confronted by a situation that is an expression of  the disintegration of that movement, which had constituted the  basis for the realization of the Zionist dream--and its collapse.    The founding conference of the "Hatiqva" [the hope] movement  was held more than a month ago (6 December 1993) in the Writers'  House in Tel Aviv (the location, by the way, is not a casual or  incidental geographic detail). Representatives of tens of  movements, bodies, and circles that identify themselves as part  of the broad definition of the national camp arrived there.  Beginning with the "Sky Blue" circle that is at the left end of  the right-wing scale, through the youth of the Likud, to the  "Peace Guard," which calls for separation of the peoples. All of  them came out of a feeling of public abandonment of persons with  similar ideological structures, but lacking a unifying roof.  Representatives of the parties of the right also arrived, and  MKs [members of Knesset] Rafa'el Eytan and 'Uzi Landau even  spoke at that event, even though the need for a movement above  parties testifies, without doubt, that the institutionalized  parties that they represent do not answer the felt need for the  unification of the national camp and for much more substantial  activity for saving Eretz-Yisra'el than what is carried out  today by the parties.    The yearning for unification was expressed in the unclear to  murky wording of the principles of the movement (see the box),  in order to allow the members of the various movements,  including those with a narrow definition of affiliation (such as  the Circle of Professors for Political and Economic Strength,  and the "Follow Me" movement of reserve officers), to find a  place under the roof of Hatiqva. The failed attempt of the "One  Israel" movement, which was meant to unite the movements of the  right, led "Hatiqva" to abandon the idea of unification and to  prefer an unclear formula of cooperation, while maintaining the  uniqueness of each movement and party that would aid Hatiqva....    The founding conference was preceded by a process of about  half a year, which began with a modest meeting of the "Ohalo"  circle. The members of this circle come from the United Kibbutz  Movement kibbutzim in the Jezreel Valley, the Beyt She'an  Valley, and the Jordan Valley, and they regard themselves as the  remnants of the followers of Berl Katznelson and Yitzhak  Tabenkin, some of the ideological fathers of the Labor Movement.  Efrayim Ben-Hayyim, a member of Giv'at Hayyim (Me'uhad) and one  of the founders of the Greater Israel Movement and the Tehiya  movement, participated in the organization of the "Ohalo"  circle, and now in the founding of "Hatiqva." He does not see  any reason for amazement about such an initiative on the part of  members of the United Kibbutz Movement. Regarding this group of  persons he says that "it is not we who have changed our  opinions, the kibbutz movement is the one that has changed its  opinions."    He complains about the loss of activism in the kibbutz  movement, and of the backpedaling that borders on denial of the  ideas that Tabenkin expressed when he said that the Jordan River  is the central avenue of Eretz-Yisra'el.    The meetings on the banks of the Kinneret gained momentum.  The human circle widened and touched other social circles. In  the same period, Prof. Hillel Weiss published an article in  HATZOFEH, in which he analyzed the depth of the Zionist crisis  and offered ideas about the nature of the necessary solution. MK  Moshe Peled, of Tzomet, who is a member of the "Ohalo" circle,  made contact with Professor Weiss, a member of Elkanah. "A  common language was found immediately, and the natural  continuation of the meetings between us was the holding of a  meeting between "Ohalo" and the professor." Their meeting was  the first in a series of meetings, which were joined later by  other persons, such as the author Moshe Shamir, and Shlomo Baum,  the second-in-command of the mythological Unit 101, where  current problems and problems of the generation were discussed  and clarified; the political-diplomatic threat and the  spiritual-cultural crisis. The channeling of things to a  practical direction led to the recognition of the need for a  secular-national movement that would act and would activate this  significant segment of the population to thwart the government's  plans to give up the Golan and Judaea and Samaria. However, says  MK Moshe Peled, what makes the movement unique is not, at least  at this stage, the operational aspect, but mainly the  ideological aspect, which constitutes the basis for the tone of  the movement. Its roots are in the analysis of the  national-social crisis, which was defined precisely in the  article by Efrayim Reiner (HA'ARETZ, 15 November 1993): "Israel  was made into a post-Zionist society--that is, a civil society  without a mission, whose sole concern is the concerns of its  individuals." Prof. Hillel Weiss, who serves as chairman  (temporary, he emphasizes) of the "Hatiqva" movement, regards  Reiner's words as an extra-anthropological statement. "As far as  I know, there is no such state or society anywhere on the globe,  and there also will not be one." He sees in the concept of  Israel as a post-Zionist society the troubling spiritual  tendency to self-destruction, as it finds threatening expression  in the current antinational process, a process that parallels  the attempt to establish a different nation. Pathological  de-Judaization, which is intended to save the Jew from his  Jewishness. In "Hatiqva" they understand that if it is desired  to change fundamentally the process of de-Judaization, this  involves the creation of an educational and cultural system  different from the existing model. The very model whose products  the "Hatiqva" spokeswomen Ilana Adam (a teacher of civics,  history, and political science by profession, at the Ramat  Eph'al high school) encounters daily. Ilana feels the pain of  the indifference, the hostility, and the alienation of the youth  from the language, the culture, and Jewish sources. "An entire  generation has grown up without a mother tongue, without an  anthem," she says, bemoaning the failure of the second  generation of Israelis, of which she is a part, to pass on to  their children what she terms Yiddishkeit. In the secular  "Hatiqva," they implement three out of the four principles that  Rabbi Kook enumerates and defines in relation to  tradition--consciousness, esteem, love, and observance. For the  average observant Jew, this phenomenon is grasped at first as an  ideological dichotomy, perhaps even somewhat schizophrenic, but  as regards the secular Jew, it is understood as an existential  dialectic. Efrayim Ben-Hayyim, loosely paraphrasing the words of  Our Wise Ones of Blessed Memory About the Sabbath, says: "More  than the Jews observed tradition, the tradition preserved them."  There also is a bit of the declarative in the appointment of  Prof. Hillel Weiss, the only one of the leaders of "Hatiqva" who  wears a yarmulke, as chairman of a secular movement. The process  of the loss of Jewish identity, they fear, leads necessarily to  the loss of Jewish existence. They are interested in preventing  the realization and completion of this process. There is a plan  to establish an ideological forum and the forming of think-teams  that will be composed of intellectuals, professors, and  ideological leaders. They will draw up a long-term and  comprehensive plan, in several variations, that will include an  educational, cultural, and even a political system, which will  make possible attention to and deep grappling with the roots of  the cultural-spiritual-political crisis.    In the shorter term, the goals of "Hatiqva" are to create  cooperation between the various factors that are operating in  the field--both parties and extra-parliamentary movements--in  order to stop the process of making an agreement with the PLO of  murderers, to topple the government, and to bring about  elections. Even though these goals are clear to the point of  being well-worn, and are shared by everyone, the competition  between the political parties, and especially between the  leading persons in them, makes the matter complicated to the  point of paralysis. The need to manoeuver between personal and  party ego of the components of the various factions, says one of  the founders of the movement, demands a not inconsiderable  acrobatic ability in the political circus. On the right, there  is a worrying geological tendency to turn a point of  disagreement into an obstacle. In "Hatiqva," they hope to change  these natural relations and to turn a point of disagreement into  a cornerstone of creative competition. On the duality of the  potential, Saint Just said: "...you have the ability to build  with those very stones either a temple or a burial site." The  absoluteness of these alternatives was made concrete for the  national parties in the last elections. It is only to be hoped  that the process of mourning that was experienced by this public  and its elected representatives will lead to the necessary  drawing of conclusions, which will aid somewhat in the coming  into being of a different personal and political culture, as  occurred on the left on the eve of the last elections, when it  understood that the fragmentation would lead it to another term  in opposition.    [box, p 20]  <H3>  The Son of the Slave Woman Shall Not Share in the  Inheritance With My Son [first paragraph is editorial comment] </H3>   The following words were spoken by Miryam Lapid (in the  photograph [not reproduced]) at the founding conference of  Hatiqva in Tel Aviv, about half an hour before her husband and  her son, Mordecay and Shalom Lapid, may G-d avenge their blood,  were shot by terrorists at the Harsina intersection in  Hebron.    "For G-d's sake, for G-d's sake," cries Bialiq in his poem.  "About what?," he continues, "Do not ask, wherever it is! About  whom? Do not investigate. Whoever has been affected in his heart  by the trouble of the nation, the camp will gather him up, let  us not make differences!"    Words such as those have been spoken here at the conference.  But only now, when you heard prose, have I understood that it is  not enough to shout for help, not enough to describe the  trouble, rather it is necessary, and this is precisely the main  thing, to ask about what and about whom. What shall we save and  with whom shall we save. For unity alone is but nothing. With  the words "Each man shall help his comrade and will tell his  brother to be strong," the prophet describes a wonderful  unity...that exists among the builders of an idol to worship:  one brings the boards, another brings tools....    Should there be unity in order to bring down the government.  Is that the message? Is that the goal? Where will the government  fall? Into the arms of the movement that carried and gave birth  to the Camp David documents? To the movement that invented the  "autonomy for angels" (for they are supposed to hover with their  wings above the ground, as our genius patriots granted autonomy  "only" to them, and not to the ground under them)? For if with  G-d's help we topple the government into the hands of the  founders of the Palestinian state at Camp David (LEGITIMATE  RIGHTS) [peceding two words in English], there will be no  greater despair than that. Is it really more pleasant to be  uprooted by the Likud than by Labor???    Moreover, if it were envisaged that the talks were halted,  the agreement blew up, there is no autonomy, status quo, would  the bloodshed cease? Can our eyes not see that the situation  today is child's play in contrast to what awaits us tomorrow?  That we will never be able to match their rate of natural  increase, which is three times ours...even in the area within  the Green Line, they will be the majority. We can expect  strangulation from within and intolerable pressure from without.    If we are indeed coming to give hope, we must reveal what it  is. And if we show the people a path and a goal, then it will be  easier for us to call to the flag, then we will be able to  gather and to topple the government.    From every hill and under every blooming tree we must repeat  the words of the matriarch Sarah: "For the son of that slave  woman shall not share in the inheritance with my son, with  Yitzhaq." This is our peace plan, this is the political, moral,  humane solution for the two sides. It will bring us all life and  peace. True, it is not so simple, its implementation is not  imminent, but if you will it, if you indeed believe and will  it--it is no dream. [end box]    In the labor of translating the short-term goals that were  noted above--into action--works Moshe Leshem, a reserve colonel,  who was borrowed from the joint headquarters for the purpose of  strengthening the movement. He defines his role as  director-general as an attempt to bring the movement to rise  from an idea to a living and acting entity, and not to turn into  another passing episode. A short definition with broad  technical-organization significance, both from the office  viewpoint and from the viewpoint of activity in the field. Alon  Zuntz, a resident of Herzliya, "a quiet citizen who was pulled  out of his tranquility by the situation," as he puts it, is the  field person, or, more formally put--the chief of the operations  branch. Alon--as they say of him--has high operational and  organizational ability, spiced with a not inconsiderable  charisma. What guides the character of the action is the attempt  to activate everyone in the sphere where he wants to act and for  which he is suited and not to try to tie citizens to activity  beyond their abilities and their desires. "The average resident  of Herzliya will not participate in Operation Doubling, but will  definitely participate in a demonstration near his home, will  get people to sign, and will send postcards...." Alon began to  work on establishing a stratified apparatus (regions,  headquarters, branches, cells), with his activity mainly in the  center of the country, a population in which there is, as is  known, a considerable gap between the level of identification  (which is rather significant) and the level of action, which is  low. In "Hatiqva," they understand that it is not sufficient to  run around in the corridors of the Knesset. "It is necessary to  return to the effective method of Gush Emunim at its beginning,  and to flood the country with home meetings," recommends Efrayim  Ben-Hayyim. The realization of the program at the various levels  requires a technical and economic infrastructure that does not  yet exist in "Hatiqva."    [box, p 21]  <H5>  The Principles of the Movement </H5>   The Jewish Zionist movement is a super-party political  movement, that aspires to close cooperation between the public  bodies--organizations, parties, and movements--that accept the  following principles:    1. The Jewish people have the exclusive right of ownership  over Eretz-Yisra'el, which stems from its religion, its faith,  and from its historical movement.    2. The movement will insist on the extension of Israeli  sovereignty over all the territories of Eretz-Yisra'el that have  been in our hands since the Six Days' War--Western  Eretz-Yisra'el and the Golan.    3. The movement opposes vehemently an Arab state west of the  Jordan, any change in the status of Jerusalem, and the uprooting  or moving of settlements.    4. The movement calls for the unity of the existence of the  Jewish people, Eretz-Yisra'el, and the heritage of Israel, and  will act to instill the values of Judaism and Zionism in social  life, in culture, and in education in Israel.    5. The movement calls for the ingathering of the exiles by  Jewish immigration from all over the world.    6. The movement calls for mass settlement throughout  Eretz-Yisra'el. The movement regards immigration, settlement,  and loyalty to the Jewish heritage as the three pillars of  Zionism.    7. The movement regards national strength, security, and  economic independence as the main guarantees of the existence  and future of the State of Israel. [end box]    "Hatiqva"--a few weeks old today, a movement in its infancy,  with a not inconsiderable number of childhood diseases, an age  known to be critical. The problematic exists not only at the  technical-economic level, but, as expected, also at the aspect  of the human component. Shlomo Baum regards the matter not only  as expected, but also as necessary: "We are talking about  activists with a dominant personality, will, and ability to  influence. If they were lambs, they would go with the flock."  The heads of "Hatiqva" definitely are not lambs, and Baum finds  himself reminding them that their goal is to tear up the  opponents and not each other. He does this out of natural human  understanding and cumulative experience, both as a commander  (the reference is to human skill and not the technical ability  to hand down orders) and in the different organizations to which  he belonged over long years of activity. "Voluntary  organizations," he says, "do not fail due to arguments over the  path and how to follow it. The conditions of the path also are  not decisive, rather human problems." And with the skill of an  experienced sapper he deals with the human explosive material  that threatens more than once to explode.    Prof. Hillel Weiss does not see "Hatiqva" as a movement of a  restricted circle of initiators. "The public is the hope, in  more than one way, and it will determine the fate of the  movement. People are waiting for something to happen, that the  great message will be heard, but they must understand that it is  they who must sound it."    Along with the consciousness of the need for a movement of  this type, there is a lively awareness among the heads and  founders of "Hatiqva" of the impediments and the various factors  that can establish the reality of a gap between the need for a  movement and its existence. The discussion with those involved  on the various levels, all those who are trying to bring about  the narrowing of the abovementioned gap, was accompanied not by  a tone full of pathos, as might perhaps have been expected, but  by a somewhat doubtful hope, which perhaps defines the  difference between the concepts of hope and faith. There is more  than relevance in the sentence from the Jerusalem Talmud, in the  Tractate Berakhot: "Let our hope not be of destruction nor of  despair," or, alternately, it should be hoped that "Hatiqva" is  the hope.</p>

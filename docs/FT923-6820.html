			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome share issue expanded ROBERT FLEMING, the merchant bank which organised the global sale of shares in Wellcome, the drugs group, on behalf of the Wellcome Trust, last night decided to exercise part of its 'green shoe' option, effectively increasing the size of the issue. An extra 18m shares are expected to be sold by the Trust, a medical charity, taking the total sold to 288m. The extra shares, being sold at the 800p issue price, will raise another Pounds 144m for the Trust before expenses. The extra shares sold will cut the Trust's remaining stake in the company to 40 per cent. Before the sale in July it held 73.5 per cent. At the same time Fleming is stopping stabilisation of the Wellcome share price. In the sale, Fleming over-alloted 40.5m shares, 15 per cent of the shares sold. It could then buy shares up to this level, in order to create a stable share price in the after-market, without reducing the sale size. Fleming could then use the 'green shoe' option of buying extra shares from the Trust to satisfy any remaining over-allotment. For some time after the sale was concluded in late July Fleming supported the price at 800p. But falls in the stock market put pressure on the share price, and on August 10 and 11 Fleming was forced to buy back substantial amounts of shares. On August 12 it cut its stabilisation bid to 780p and to 777p on August 13. However, other buyers then appeared for Wellcome shares, and since then the share price has risen without Fleming buying shares in its capacity as stabilisation manager. Yesterday the Wellcome share price rose 10p to 802p.</p>

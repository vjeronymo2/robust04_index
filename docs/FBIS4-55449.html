			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 15 May--At the PSL [Polish Peasant Party]  National Self-Government Congress on Sunday, the leader of the  party, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, said that, at the end of  the second millennium, Poland had an open future.    The prime minister thought the domestic situation gave good  grounds for optimism. In the first quarter of this year,  inflation was the lowest for seven years. Unemployment is  falling and production is going up. "We are doing all of this  with our own, rather than borrowed, money," he added.    "We cannot turn away from either the East or the West. We  should be looking everywhere for partners who want to cooperate  with us in an equable manner," the prime minister said.    Emphasizing that self-government should liberate initiatives  and minds "directly on the ground," Pawlak urged the congress to  back bold, active, and young people, members and sympathizers of  the PSL.    "Today we need courage and resolute actions. I am counting  on your involvement and victory, on our winning together,"  emphasized the PSL chairman.    The party is going into the local government elections under  the slogan "Parishes need good masters." "The majority of the  parishes are rural parishes. I believe we will come out of the  elections as victors. And he who runs the parishes runs the  country," Senate Speaker Adam Struzik said at the end of the PSL  Self-Government Congress.</p>

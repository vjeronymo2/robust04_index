			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hesitant as jobs report is awaited Wall Street PROGRAM buying and strong financial stocks helped US share prices post modest gains across the board yesterday, but afternoon selling brought prices back down from their new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.73 at 3,598.99, short of its high for the day of 3,605.98. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.46 lower at 460.74, while the Amex composite ended up 1.68 at 463.36, and the Nasdaq composite 2.50 higher at 764.77, close to a new record. Trading volume on the NYSE was 276m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,105 to 858. Prices opened only slightly firmer, as traders and investors waited for a lead from the bond market. Although bond prices rose marginally in early trading, they failed to provide much impetus to equity prices. Participants in both markets seemed reluctant to trade actively ahead of tomorrow's important September employment report. Additionally, equity investors remained nervous about the approaching third quarter reporting season. Some are worried that the moderate rate of economic growth recorded over the summer will have hindered corporate profitability, and that third quarter earnings will come in below expectations. Stocks, however, picked up ground later in the morning, aided by sporadic computerised buy programs and firmer financial stocks, before easing back from their peaks in the afternoon. Among financials, banks were mostly higher in the wake of an announcement from Chemical Banking that it would report record net income for the third quarter. Chemical rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 45 3/8 , Citicorp added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 38 7/8 , Chase Manhattan put on Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 37 1/2 , NationsBank firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 53 and BankAmerica rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 . Semiconductor stocks, hit hard on Tuesday by poor earnings from Advanced Micro Devices, rebounded in early trading, but suffered in a late sell-off. Texas Instruments ended down Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , Motorola finished unchanged at Dollars 98 1/2 and Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market, fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 69 1/4 . Advanced Micro itself remained under heavy selling pressure, falling another Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 in volume of 4m shares. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 after the company said that it expects to report third quarter net income of between Dollars 130m and Dollars 135m, up from Dollars 91m a year ago. Nike fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 on the news that Michael Jordan, the basketball star and the most famous promoter of Nike goods, is to retire. Canada TORONTO prices posted strong gains in moderate trading, led by surging gold issues. The TSE-300 composite index rose 41.37 points, or 1.03 per cent to close at 4,055.48, according to preliminary data. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 444 to 281. The gold group jumped 4.1 per cent as the price of gold in New York rose. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it expects fiscal 1994 loan losses to decline slightly from the forecast fiscal 1993 level of CDollars 920m. It rose  3/8 to 30 5/8.</p>

Mulino explained that bilateral relations with Cuba "have  not  been broken or suspended," adding that contacts with the Cuban  Government are continuing even though Panama does not have an  ambassador in that country. Mulino said, "Relations are very  friendly, and there are no reasons for them to become marred."    Relations between Panama and Cuba cooled off because of  differences that emerged following the 20 December 1989 U.S.  invasion of Panama, an action that put an end to the military  government that had remained in power for 21 years.</p>

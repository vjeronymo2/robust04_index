			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Russia - The Future of Reform: Moscow to seek deal for Dollars 16bn of debt THE Paris Club of government creditors of the former Soviet Union is being asked this week to finalise a rescheduling agreement for more than Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) in outstanding sovereign debts now assumed by the Russian government. The deal, allowing for repayment over 10 years, with a five-year grace period on payments of principal, would open the way for a commercial rescheduling agreement of debts totalling more than Dollars 20bn by the so-called London Club of some 600 commercial bank creditors of the former Soviet Union. Both deals to reschedule payments falling due in 1993 will have to be put together before any agreement has been reached by the Russian government with the International Monetary Fund on a standby credit - the normal pre-condition for such debt rescheduling. The negotiations are also going ahead without any precise rescheduling programme of payments being proposed by the Russian government, in another clear departure from normal Paris Club rules. Preparatory talks open in Paris today for the full Paris Club meeting on Thursday and Friday, with indications that both sides are prepared to move from their previous positions. Much will depend on a successful outcome to the current bilateral summit in Moscow between Russia and Germany, by far the biggest creditor nation, and on reassurances by Russia that its economic reform programme will continue to be implemented in spite of the current political upheaval. Hitherto, Russia has called for debts totalling Dollars 16.1bn to be rescheduled in the agreement, while the Paris Club creditors have offered to include just Dollars 13.6bn. According to the Paris Club plan, debt servicing costs in 1993 would be Dollars 4.6bn, while the Russian side says it can only afford Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister heading the debt negotiations, has said that if the Paris Club insists on its figures, total debt servicing costs for his government next year would be more than Dollars 6bn, including commercial debt. He expects to have barely Dollars 3bn available. The Russian aim is to pay no more than Dollars 5bn for government and commercial creditors combined, and thus reduce the gap of Dollars 3bn between debt servicing needs, and available hard currency, to around Dollars 2bn. That sum would then by financed either by the planned IMF standby credit, or by drawing on the IMF stabilisation funds. Germany's position in the negotiations is critical, because it is by far the largest creditor government. It is also insisting that the cut-off date for the rescheduling - the date after which debts are supposed to be paid on time - should be January 1, 1991, and not January 1, 1992 as requested by the Russian government. If all goes well in the talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Boris Yeltsin overnight, at Mr Yeltsin's country dacha, then the German government will today express firm support for the rescheduling process, and the aim to get it completed before the end of the year. As for the commercial banks, formal negotiations on a long-term rescheduling have barely begun. In Frankfurt, on December 4, the co-ordinating committee, which is headed by Deutsche Bank, agreed on a series of broad principles for such a deal, without discussing any figures. Those principles are that any rescheduling should be realistic enough to be accepted by the markets; that the debt payments agreed must take into account the economic realities in Russia; and that the commercial banks will not necessarily agree on an identical deal to the Paris Club  - although they should not be contradictory, either. No firm date has been agreed for the next round of talks between the banks and the Russian government.</p>

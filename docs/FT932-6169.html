			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: New Devro chief to come from within DEVRO, the sausage casings producer which is shortly to be floated on the Stock Exchange, has changed its mind on who to appoint as its chief executive designate and is to pay Pounds 390,000 compensation to the man originally offered the post. Earlier this week, Devro's advisers confirmed that the company was to appoint Mr David Fyfe, 50, who resigned last week as managing director of a division of Hickson International, the specialty chemicals group. But yesterday Devro said that institutions to whom it had been making pre-flotation presentations had indicated a strong preference for an internal candidate. Accordingly, it has decided to appoint as chief executive Mr Graeme Alexander, 43, currently the company's technical director. Devro said that 'the process with Dr Fyfe has been discontinued by mutual consent and compensation of Pounds 390,000 has been agreed.' Mr Alexander will succeed Mr Frank De Angeli, 68, when he steps down later this year. Devro said that the change would 'maintain the continuity of the successful management team.' Devro's public relations advisers said yesterday that there had been no reassessment of Mr Fyfe's capabilities in the light of a statement last week by Mr Dennis Kerrison, chairman of Hickson, that Mr Fyfe was unlikely to reach board level at Hickson early. The advisers said the question of Mr Fyfe and the Hickson board was related to the way that board was structured, which is on the lines of a Continental supervisory board. Devro expects to produce the pathfinder prospectus for its listing in the next few days. The flotation is expected to value the company at about Pounds 170m. Devro is one of the world's leading makers of collagen sausage casings, with plants in Scotland, the US and Australia. It was acquired from Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US in a Pounds 108m management buy-out in 1991 and last year made an operating profit of Pounds 21.8m on turnover of Pounds 82.7m.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIEFS' THOMAS HOPES TO MAKE IMPACT SUNDAY AGAINST RAIDERS  </P> <P> Linebacker Derrick Thomas of the Kansas City Chiefs blasted into the Raider  backfield as soon as the ball was snapped, and quarterback Jay Schroeder never  had a chance, Thomas knocking him to the turf like a rag doll.  </P> <P> Thomas also sacked Schroeder once more during the Chiefs' 24-19 victory over  the Raiders last month in Kansas City, so the Raiders will be going all out to  stop Thomas when they play the Chiefs again Sunday at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> "Derrick Thomas is a big impact player," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "He's  such an impact player, it's scary. You watch him on film, and every week he's  doing something to somebody. Even (Cincinnati Bengal All-Pro tackle Anthony)  Munoz caught hell from him."  </P> <P> Thomas gave Munoz problems in the Chiefs' 21-17 loss to the Bengals two weeks  ago, beating Munoz to sack Boomer Esiason and force a fumble.  </P> <P> Thomas has helped rejuvenate the Chiefs' defense, which is ranked third in the  National Football League after being last against the rush last season.  </P> <P> The Chiefs used the No. 4 pick in this year's National Football League draft to  select Thomas, an All-American at Alabama, making him the first linebacker to  be selected in the first round in the team's 29-year history.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Thomas has adapted quickly to the NFL despite reporting  late after a 36-day holdout. He signed a reported $4.2-million, five-year  contract with the Chiefs, and Kansas City is already getting a good return on  its investment.  </P> <P> Thomas leads the Chiefs in tackles with 26 and in sacks with four. Last Sunday,  Kansas City held the Seattle Seahawks to 52 yards rushing in a 20-16 win.  Seahawk tailback Curt Warner gained just one yard in seven carries, and  fullback John L. Williams was held to 22 yards in nine carries.  </P> <P> Thomas has also made his mark on Kansas City's punt and kickoff teams.  </P> <P> Is he surprised by his sudden impact on the Chiefs?  </P> <P> "Nope," he said. "For me it doesn't take long to adjust. If you tell me to do  A, B and C, I might do B, C and A the first time, but the next time I'm going  to do A, B and C."  </P> <P> A tailback during his first two years in high school, Thomas was moved to  linebacker in his senior year.  </P> <P> He adjusted quickly to his new position, earning all-league honors at South  Miami High School.  </P> <P> "Derrick was probably the best athlete we had, but we never knew where to play  him," South Miami Coach Sam Harris said. "He decided he'd rather hit than be  hit, so we switched him to defense."  </P> <P> A good player on a mediocre team, Thomas was overshadowed by teammate Keith  Carter, an all-state linebacker who is a fifth-year senior at Florida State.  </P> <P> "Before he reported to Kansas City, we had a roast for him," Harris said, "and  one of the speakers said (in jest) that the reason we never put Derrick's  picture in the paper was because we didn't want the police to see it and  recognize him as the guy who was stealing all the mopeds at school."  </P> <P> Although he didn't receive much acclaim, Thomas attracted the attention of  college recruiters. He wanted to attend Louisiana State but didn't qualify for  admission because of poor grades, so he went to Alabama.  </P> <P> "He really wanted to go to LSU but he was a 'C' student, and the (LSU)  recruiter said he couldn't take any more borderline kids," Harris said. "Going  to Alabama may have been the best thing that ever happened to him."  </P> <P> After succeeding All-American linebacker Cornelius Bennett in the Crimson  Tide's starting lineup, Thomas flourished at Alabama, winning the Dick Butkus  Award last season.  </P> <P> It was no surprise that Thomas won the award, presented annually to the best  collegiate linebacker. It would have been surprising if he hadn't won it.  </P> <P> Thomas had a school-record 27 sacks and made 88 tackles for Alabama last  season. He also blocked four kicks.  </P> <P> "A lot of guys get called great these days when they really aren't," Alabama  Coach Bill Curry told the Kansas City Star. "A great player should be able to  dominate at his level. If a guy can't dominate, then I don't think he's a great  football player.  </P> <P> "Derrick Thomas is a great player. He was a dominant player in the Southeastern  Conference. He blocked kicks. He sacked quarterbacks. He knocked the ball  loose. He came up with the football. Virtually every time we needed a  monumental play last year, Derrick is the guy who came up with it. He is the  epitome of an impact player."  </P> <P> Although he had an outstanding college football career, Thomas had one regret:  His father never saw him play.  </P> <P> Thomas was 5 when his father was killed in a plane crash in Vietnam.  </P> <P> Robert Thomas, a B-52 co-pilot, was on a bombing mission when his plane was  shot down.  </P> <P> "I was told he waited until everyone else got out," Derrick Thomas said. "Then  he attempted to eject from the plane just before it exploded. Everybody else on  the plane came back."  </P> <P> After being listed as missing in action for six years, Robert Thomas was  declared dead in 1979.  </P> <P> Earlyne Thomas, his stepmother, said that she and her husband had planned to  adopt Derrick before her husband was killed. Derrick was born out of wedlock to  Edith Morgan when Robert Thomas was in high school. Robert Thomas later married  Earlyne.  </P> <P> "We wanted to adopt Derrick, and just before his dad was killed we were going  to be coming to Miami to visit at Christmas," Earlyne Thomas said. "We were  going to talk about adopting Derrick. His dad was crazy about him. And I always  thought of Derrick as a son."  </P> <P> After his father died, Thomas was raised by an aunt, Annie Adams, in South  Miami.  </P> <P> "She had a great deal of influence on me," Thomas said. "I think I owe  everything I have now to her. She taught me all the virtues and values of  life."  </P> <P> Lacking a strong male influence in his life, Thomas struggled to find himself  while growing up.  </P> <P> A juvenile delinquent, Thomas was sent to a school for troubled teen-agers  after several minor scrapes with the law. The school, designed to instill  discipline and self-esteem, helped to kindle Thomas' interest in sports.  </P> <P> Now, he would like to help other wayward youths.  </P> <P> A criminal justice major in college, Thomas has talked of opening a boys' home  after he retires from pro football.  </P> <P> "Derrick has had some big scars in his life," Earlyne Thomas said. "That's why  I'm so happy for Derrick. I want to be there for him when he's through playing  football and nobody else knows who he is."  </P> <P> Thomas and his stepmother have developed a close relationship in recent years.  A St. Louis-based attorney, she helped him select an agent and is trying to  shield him from the wolves who would fleece him of his new-found wealth.  </P> <P> "He's had long lost relatives coming out of the woodwork asking for handouts,"  she said. "I told him not to loan anybody a dime."  </P></p>

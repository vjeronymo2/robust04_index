			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE  </P> <P> Reporter William Trombley hit the target. The Golden State is losing its luster  -- freeways crumble, students sit two to a desk, our water and air are  polluted.  </P> <P> I know the problems well from my tenure on the Los Angeles Board of Education  and, more recently, on the Los Angeles Board of Public Works. As our population  grows beyond the available public facilities, our quality of life will continue  to deteriorate, unless we do something. First, we should conduct an inventory  of the state's needs for new highways, schools, pollution control systems, and  so forth. Setting up a comprehensive multi-year plan for addressing those needs  would follow.  </P> <P> Next, we must make better use of bond financing. According to the state's  independent Legislative Analyst's Office, California has considerable room to  authorize and issue more bonds without being financially imprudent. The voters  understand this since they have supported 38 out of 39 bond measures on the  state ballot.  </P> <P> However, Sacramento has not gotten the message! Nearly $7 billion in  voter-approved bonds, including those for clean water, school facilities, parks  and prisons, have not yet been issued.  </P> <P> But we should not rely on bond financing alone to pay for urgently needed  infrastructure improvement and repair; some projects should be financed by user  fees. This appears to be the fairest and surest way of guaranteeing safe  bridges and highways.  </P> <P> My father, former Gov. Pat Brown, envisioned California's future and  thoughtfully laid the foundation of public facilities that continues to provide  for our well-being 20 years later. But that foundation is showing signs of age.  It's time we renew the commitment that made California the Golden State.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN BROWN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Kathleen Brown is the Democratic candidate for state treasurer.  </P> <P> </P></p>

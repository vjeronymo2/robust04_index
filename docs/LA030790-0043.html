			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> 'Josephine Baker' Story: Fifteen years after her death, the story of Josephine  Baker is going to make it to film -- as a TV movie for HBO. "This is a project  that only pay-TV could do at this point," an HBO spokesman said, explaining  that it will faithfully re-create the nudity in her stage act.  </P> <P> Diana Ross had long been interested in a screen biography of the famed  performer, but the pay-TV channel said Tuesday that Lynn Whitfield will have  the title role. Whitfield -- whose credits include TV's "The Women of Brewster  Place" and the film "Silverado" -- will perform some of Baker's musical numbers  that made her famous in the music halls of Paris in the late '20s and '30s.

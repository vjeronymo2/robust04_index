			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CD PACKAGING AND PLANET EARTH  </P> <P> There is no question that excess packaging has to stop. It's absurd to say, as  did the owner of the Tower Records chain, that "there's less paper used in CD  packages than one Sunday issue of the L.A. Times."  </P> <P> Reading the Sunday Times can take a whole afternoon. I don't think the same can  be said for the packaging on a CD.  </P> <P> BARBARA GARTNER  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: EYEBROWS RAISE OVER PRICE AS PETERS' UNDERLING  </P> <P> BLOOD IN the streets? This is how Hollywood proper is characterizing the new  amalgamation of Frank Price with Jon Peters and Peter Guber at Columbia  Pictures. "Can you imagine a man like Price, already a success in his own right  as the one-time head of Columbia in the good old days -- can you imagine him  reporting to a volatile person like Jon Peters?"  </P> <P> On this, the day of the Academy Awards, Hollywood is talk, talk, talking.  Another exec says: "Let's see, this would make a marriage of arrogance -- the  arrogance of Frank Price matched with that of Jon Peters. They'll never get  along." (Peter Guber, we should add, seems to figure mostly behind the scenes  in these imagined conflicts, because he is considered such an extremely passive  person; one who uses Jon Peters as his top gun.)  </P> <P> I suppose Frank Price must surely be smart enough to have ironclad stuff in his  new contract with Guber and Peters assuring his being able to work with them  and not find them too onerous. "How?" asks one wise-acre. "They are still going  to be his bosses and and Frank Price isn't used to being bossed or  second-guessed."  </P> <P> And -- the latest hot skinny out of L.A. -- despite denials to the contrary --  is that Sony itself is now looking somewhat askance at this incredible deal  they have made with Guber and Peters. It cost Sony something like $700 million  right up front. It is estimated it could cost them billions more in the long  run, for no one has ever seen anything like the way Guber and Peters like to  spend other people's money. And now it is obvious that the unprecedented Guber  and Peters deal with Sony threw the entire Hollywood money factor out of sync.  </P> <P> Jealousy, envy, gnashing of teeth ensued, with subsequent misery for agents,  producers, studio executives. The deal ended with a fallout that has sent costs  soaring all down the movie world's line.  </P> <P> Question -- did Jon Peters really use a company plane to woo a new girlfriend  in London with $300,000 worth of fresh flowers? Oh, how can we even dignify  this one with a question mark. I hereby deny it. Jon Peters wouldn't do  anything like that. And to ask him would mean we'd have to climb all the way up  where he now dwells, like Jove, among his zaps and thunderbolts. That's not for  mere mortals.  </P> <P> TRUMP-MANIA, or nothing succeeds like excess! They say there are 2,400 members  of the press arriving for the Taj Mahal opening in Atlantic City on April 5.  </P> <P> One beautiful woman who happens to feel she just has to go down there for this  asked her designer, "What should I wear?"  </P> <P> Came the answer: "A suit of armor!"  </P> <P> MARY TYLER MOORE became the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's "Woman of the  Decade" the other night at the Waldorf in New York and the happiest thing was  that most of her co-stars from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" showed up and  burbled on happily about Mary. And wow -- do they all look good! I do mean Ed  Asner, Betty White, Nancy Walker, Eileen Heckert, Cloris Leachman, Gavin  MacLeod.  </P> <P> Only Valerie Harper and Georgia Engel were among the missing, both with  pressing commitments elsewhere.  </P> <P> Mary flew down from Canada for the night and she looked dazzling in a red,  off-the-shoulder Scaasi gown. She has been been filming "The Last Best Year of  My Life," an NBC-TV movie to be seen next fall, co-starring Bernadette Peters.  </P></p>

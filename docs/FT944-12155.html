			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / US schools grow more violent American schools are becoming more violent, not only in big cities but in smaller towns and surburbs, according to a 700-city survey to be published today by the National League of Cities. Only 11 per cent of the communities surveyed said violence was not a problem. The survey listed 44 per cent of suburban cities and towns, nearly two-thirds with populations under 50,000. One out of four reported incidents involving serious injuries or deaths in the past year and 40 per cent said gangs were a significant problem. Among other findings, 70 per cent said police were being assigned to patrol schools and 19 per cent said metal detectors were used to find weapons. Over the past five years, 38 per cent of the cities said the problem has risen noticeably, and 90 per cent of the cities send police to school athletic events. The study quoted Atlanta councilwoman Ms Carolyn Long as saying 'school is getting rougher in a dangerous way. The academic challenges are being made more difficult by the disturbing presence and growing fear of crime and violence in our schools.'</p>

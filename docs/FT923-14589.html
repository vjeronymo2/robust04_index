			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Germany confirms EFA pullout GERMANY yesterday rejected the idea of a cheap version of the European Fighter Aircraft as a compromise between Bonn and London and confirmed that it was pulling out of the Pounds 20bn project. Talks in London between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence minister, and Mr Volker Ruhe, his German counterpart, left both sides further apart than ever. Mr Ruhe called on the partners in the EFA consortium - the UK, Spain and Italy - to abandon the project and develop instead a smaller aircraft suited to post Cold war military needs. 'The tactical requirements of EFA were established in 1984. Everything has changed except the aircraft,' said Mr Ruhe. He said Spain had expressed sympathy with the German position and that France, which withdrew from the EFA project in the mid-1980s could be approached to rejoin. Mr Rifkind said that to start again with a new aircraft 'would be to throw away the Pounds 5bn of taxpayers' money already spent on the project.' Germany said last week it would not be involved in the production of the aircraft, which is designed to come into service around the turn of the century. Details of an alternative aircraft would emerge after discussions between the partners and with technical experts, Mr Ruhe said yesterday. The aircraft would not need to be as powerful as EFA because examination of Russian-built MiG-29s, once part of the East German airforce, had shown them to have been overrated by western military experts. The cash saved could also be diverted into land-based defence systems against long-range missiles, which Mr Ruhe's advisers had said would be an increasing threat. Disagreements also emerged on the actual cost of the aircraft. Mr Ruhe said that each EFA would cost up to DM200m (Pounds 69m) when delivered early next century. The UK has put a Pounds 45m price tag on each aircraft. Fighter tamed, Page 18</p>

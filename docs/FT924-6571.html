			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: AMD to build chip plant in Texas ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, is to build a Dollars 700m manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas. The plant will employ up to 1,000 people and produce AMD's next generations of microprocessors and highly integrated logic chips for applications, such as computer networking and multi-media computing. Scheduled for completion in 1994, it will initially be capable of producing integrated circuits on eight-inch diameter silicon wafers using the latest manufacturing technology to produce devices with half-micron features (approximately 1/200th of the diameter of a strand of human hair) and smaller. Chips and Technologies, another Silicon Valley chip maker, said it was restructuring to reduce expenses and increase its focus on key strategic products. Chips has reduced its workforce by 20 per cent since June. The company now expects a further reduction of about 20 per cent.</p>

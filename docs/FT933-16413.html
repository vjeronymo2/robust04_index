			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Gilts have the edge Those many City pundits who thought that equities would outperform gilts this year must be growing nervous. In the first half, long gilts offered a total return of some 10 per cent, the FT-A All-Share index little more than seven. There is not much sign there of the boost to equities from growth inspired by devaluation and low interest rates - or of the threat to gilts from the government's borrowing requirement. Indeed the two markets seem recently to have shown an even more diverging trend. One explanation is that growth around the world is turning out disappointing while the forces of disinflation are stronger than many earlier thought. It is not just that the OECD is now forecasting growth of only 1.2 per cent for the industrial world this year. Oil prices are falling, and yesterday's weak US employment figures point to a faltering recovery. Such an environment seems made for bond markets. Arguably, the UK ought to be an exception. Its growth rate will stand out among its European peers this year, but the OECD's expectation of 1.8 per cent is hardly that impressive. Some equity investors have evidently been prepared to bet on recovery. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index which is heavily weighted towards cyclical stocks has outperformed the FT-SE 100 by a striking margin so far in 1993. Arguably, too, the latter has been dragged down by special situations, notably the US-inspired worries on healthcare stocks. But even the most determined optimist will be hard put to discern the earnings recovery which should underpin UK equity valuations. Until it arrives equities will have little incentive to make up lost ground, especially now sterling is strong and the government has set its sights against a further cut in interest rates.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Charities given lottery pledge SAFEGUARDS will be built into the national lottery to protect charities' fundraising projects, the government said yesterday. Mr Robert Key, national heritage minister, said the government had explored ways of ensuring that charities did not suffer indirectly as a result of the planned lottery. These included relaxing laws on small charitable lotteries to make them more attractive, and the sensitive marketing of the lottery - which would deliver 'tremendous benefits' to charities nationwide. Charities have warned that their income may drop because of the lottery, which will have a weekly jackpot of Pounds 1m. At the same time they feared suffering if lottery adverts focused on other individual charities as the latest 'good cause'. Mr Key said the charities' concerns had been taken on board in drafting the Lottery Bill, and he told the National Council for Voluntary Organisations that there would be a separate mechanism for distributing lottery money to charities. He said: 'The onus will be on getting the product right - not on exploiting this month's good cause.' Art treasures could be loaned to regional museums if the government allocated a Pounds 1m annual grant, Sir David Wilson, former director of the British Museum, said. He said requests for temporary collections were becoming more frequent, but the costs of security, transport and care often made lending impossible. In an open letter to Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, Sir David suggests that if regional venues 'were allowed an annual sum of Pounds 1m, they would be able to provide access to treasures housed in national museums on a scale never previously realised'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary responsibilities of the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Describe and review current Federal efforts in biotechnology research; (ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify and define the priority areas for future Federal biotechnology research,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including areas needing greater emphasis, describing the role of each agency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those areas, and delineate where interagency cooperation would enhance progress in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the biotechnology sciences, with an emphasis on integrated research efforts, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate; (iii) assess major international efforts in the biotechnology sciences and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop mechanisms for international collaboration. For example, activities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.-European Community Task Force on Biotechnology have been coordinated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee; (iv) identify and review national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and international policy issues (such as public education) associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biotechnology; and (v) provide reviews, analyses, and recommendations to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chairs of the Committee on Fundamental Science on scientific issues related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and the applications of biotechnology research and biotechnology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies and issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990, the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee replaced the Biotechnology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sciences Coordinating Committee. Both the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Biotechnology Sciences Coordinating Committee previously functioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FCCSET). While regulatory issues became the primary focus of the Biotechnology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sciences Coordinating Committee, the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focuses on scientific issues, although it will still provide scientific support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K. Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K specifies physical containment guidelines for large scale (greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 liters of culture) research or production involving viable organisms containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA molecules. It shall apply to large scale research or production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities as specified in Section III-C&hyph;6. It is important to note that this appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addresses only the biological hazard associated with organisms containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA. Other hazards accompanying the large scale cultivation of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms (e.g., toxic properties of products; physical, mechanical, and chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of downstream processing) are not addressed and shall be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately, albeit in conjunction with this appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All provisions shall apply to large scale research or production activities with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following modifications: (i) Appendix K shall supersede Appendix G when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities in excess of 10 liters of culture are involved in research or production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K-II applies to Good Large Scale Practice; (ii) the institution shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appoint a Biological Safety Officer if it engages in large scale research or production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities involving viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duties of the Biological Safety Officer shall include those specified in Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV-B&hyph;3; (iii) the institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for personnel engaged in large scale research or production activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules which require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biosafety Level (BL) 3 containment at the laboratory scale. The program shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include: preassignment and periodic physical and medical examinations; collection,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance, and analysis of serum specimens for monitoring serologic changes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may result from the employee's work experience; and provisions for the investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any serious, unusual, or extended illnesses of employees to determine possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;I. Selection of Physical Containment Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The selection of the physical containment level required for recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research or production involving more than 10 liters of culture is based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment guidelines established in Section III. For purposes of large scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research or production, four physical containment levels are established. The four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels set containment conditions at those appropriate for the degree of hazard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health or the environment posed by the organism, judged by experience with similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms unmodified by recombinant DNA techniques and consistent with Good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Large Scale Practice. The four biosafety levels of large scale physical containment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are referred to as Good Large Scale Practice, BL1&hyph;Large Scale, BL2&hyph;Large Scale,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and BL3&hyph;Large Scale. Good Large Scale Practice is recommended for large scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research or production involving viable, non-pathogenic, and non-toxigenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant strains derived from host organisms that have an extended history of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe large scale use. Good Large Scale Practice is recommended for organisms such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as those included in Appendix C which have built-in environmental limitations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit optimum growth in the large scale setting but limited survival without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse consequences in the environment. BL1&hyph;Large Scale is recommended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large scale research or production of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules that require BL1 containment at the laboratory scale and that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for Good Large Scale Practice. BL2&hyph;Large Scale is recommended for large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale research or production of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules that require BL2 containment at the laboratory scale. BL3&hyph;Large Scale is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended for large scale research or production of viable organisms containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA molecules that require BL3 containment at the laboratory scale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No provisions are made for large scale research or production of viable organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA molecules that require BL4 containment at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory scale. If necessary, these requirements will be established by NIH on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;II. Good Large Scale Practice (GLSP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;II&hyph;A. Institutional codes of practice shall be formulated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented to assure adequate control of health and safety matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

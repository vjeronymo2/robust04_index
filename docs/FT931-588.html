The risk arises because of the region's significant reliance on capital inflows drawn by higher interest rates. 'The possibility for a reduction of external capital inflows in the near and medium term, brought on by the possibility of higher interest rates in industrialised countries, could have a destabilising effect on the economies of the region,' the bank says in its annual report.

Nonetheless, economic growth in Latin America slowed from 3.2 per cent in 1991 to 2.6 per cent in 1992, with the 1 per cent fall in Brazilian gross domestic product last year accounting for much of the slowdown. However, deteriorating trade pushed up the region's current account deficit to Dollars 26.5bn (Pounds 18.6bn) last year from Dollars 17bn in 1991. 'While a current account deficit of this magnitude is probably not sustainable over the long term, it is mainly the product of the region's economic recovery and increased capital inflows.' Foreign exchange reserves rose to cover six months of imports, with net transfers of funds into the region, which were negative from 1982 to 1990, rising from a positive Dollars 8bn in 1991 to Dollars 27bn last year.

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: European Motor plans takeover after rise to Pounds 5m European Motor Holdings, the motor retail and services group, revealed yesterday that it was in detailed discussions which could lead to 'a significant acquisition'. Mr Richard Palmer, chief executive of the group - which reported a 50 per cent increase in full year profits - added that if the acquisition proceeded the board planned to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m of new funds through a rights issue. Mr Palmer said an announcement could be made later this month and added that if the deal goes ahead it would not dilute earnings. Despite this assurance the shares closed 11p lower at 123p. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 5.15m in the year to March 31, up from Pounds 3.44m last time. Turnover expanded by 35 per cent to Pounds 157.5m (Pounds 117.1m). The motor retail division increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.1m. The motor services division boosted its pre-tax contribution to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 2.6m). Operating profits increased from Pounds 4.43m to Pounds 5.6m. Mr Palmer said used car trading was satisfactory, although difficult conditions were experienced in the second half of the year. After sales operations, including bodyshops, which accounted for 67 per cent of divisional profits, performed well. In the motor services division Wilcomatic, the vehicle washing equipment company, lifted operating profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.6m) on turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 15.3m. The improvement in margin reflected greater efficiencies. A final dividend of 2.525p is recommended, making a total for the year 21 per cent ahead at 4.25p (3.5p). Earnings per share increased by 32 per cent from 7.3p to 9.6p. COMMENT The announcement that European Motor is close to finalising another purchase should come as no surprise. The group's last acquisitions (Mill Garages and Wilcomatic) were made two years ago and the group now wants to mix organic growth with expansion through the acquisition of underperforming businesses in its core areas. As the latest results confirm, management has a solid track record for squeezing more profit out of its operations. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6m look possible this year, producing earnings of just under 11p. After yesterday's fall the shares are trading on a reasonable multiple of 11.2.</p>

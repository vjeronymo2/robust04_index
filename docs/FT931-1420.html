			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Gerstner emerges as a leading candidate for top job at IBM MR LOUIS Gerstner, chairman of RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco company, has emerged as a leading candidate for the top job at International Business Machines amid rising speculation that IBM could shortly name a new chief executive officer. RJR Nabisco declined to comment on reports of Mr Gerstner's impending departure yesterday. IBM also declined to comment on reports that have been circulating that Mr Gerstner has had several meetings with IBM's selection committee of non-executive directors. The committee was formed in January when Mr John Akers, IBM chairman and chief executive, said he would step aside from the chief executive post following IBM's announcement of Dollars 4.9bn losses for 1992, the company's second consecutive annual loss. As soon as IBM makes a final selection and reaches contractual agreements with a candidate, it will, under US securities laws, be required to make an immediate announcement. The lack of such an announcement suggests no final decision has been made. Other potential candidates, including Mr John Sculley of Apple Computer, Mr Larry Bossidy of Allied-Signal and Mr George Fisher of Motorola, have issued statements saying they would not take the job. The selection of Mr Gerstner would suggest that IBM's board has decided the company needs stronger financial controls rather than new technology leadership, since Mr Gerstner has no experience in the computer industry. He was named as chief executive of RJR Nabisco in March 1989, shortly after the record Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco giant. Then 47, he moved to the company from American Express, which he had joined in 1978 as president of the card division, and risen to become chairman of the executive committee of the parent company in 1983, and then president in 1985. Although Mr Gerstner has no direct prior ties to IBM, his brother, Mr Richard Gerstner, isa former IBM senior executive. He retired recently for health reasons. Mr Richard Gerstner was succeeded in his last post at IBM as head of the computer company's personal systems division by Mr James Cannavino. Mr Cannavino is now seen as a likely choice for president of IBM , succeeding Mr Jack Kuehler.</p>

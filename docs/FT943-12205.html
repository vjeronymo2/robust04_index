			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian growers get better bargain - Newly-authorised private auctions are flourishing The Indian government is progressively reducing the marketing role of the Coffee Board, which until a couple of years ago used to pool the country's entire production for auctioning. As part of a general economic liberalisation plan the Coffee Act of 1942 has been changed to allow growers to market half their production independent of the Board in either the domestic or foreign market. There is a consensus among all concerned that liberalisation - to start with, the growers were allowed to sell 30 per cent of their produce in the domestic market only - has done a world of good to the plantation industry. Even though the buyers of coffee for the domestic market are complaining loudly about 'runaway' inflation in coffee prices at the auction since January, they admit that the planters have started taking a lot more care about the quality of the crop. When the board was pooling the crop 'the estates did not have any individual identity', says an official of the Karnataka Planters Association. 'Moreover, the return from coffee was so low prior. . . that the growers had neither the money nor the incentive to care for quality.' But with the Indian Coffee Trade Association holding fortnightly auction at Bangalore, where returns depend on quality, the estate owners are giving a lot more attention to irrigation, use of nutrients and plucking and curing of berries. The success of the ICTA auction has encouraged producers and traders to organise monthly auction at Coorg in Karnataka and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. While the - a big incentive to producers being the prompt payment they receive - the board, which holds a weekly auction at Bangalore, is not getting enough coffee, although growers are required to surrender half their production to it. The Board takes an inordinately long time to pay for the pooled coffee and the premium for good quality is insufficient. According to the Board, India's 1993-94 (October to September) coffee crop will be 208,000 tonnes, comprising 119,500 tonnes of robusta and 88,500 tonnes of the milder arabica. The board should, therefore, be getting 104,000 tonnes of coffee from the growers. But the amount received so far is less than 50,000 tonnes. The growers think that India will finish the season with a crop of 180,000 tonnes, up from 169,395 tonnes in 1992-93. It is mainly the small growers with holdings of up to ten hectares - they own nearly 64 per cent of the 270,821 hectares under coffee - who are not surrendering the required quantity. And the board lacks the means of enforcing discipline. Mr Ashok Kuriyan, himself a big planter and president of ICTA, suggests that instead of 'encouraging corrupt practices, the government should exempt the small growers from pooling coffee with the board'. The plantation owners argue that as the private auctions are doing well with enthusiastic participation by the growers, traders and exporters, the government should now allow them to market the entire crop. But the authorities will have to take into account the growing discontent among the Indian consumers over the rising coffee prices and the demand for a separate coffee auction for the domestic market before it thinks of further liberalising the trade. The small growers' action committee does not believe that separate auction sales for the domestic market will give any relief to consumers 'since as long as the world coffee prices remain higher than the domestic prices, coffee will somehow be cornered by the exporters. The return to the dual auction system will only breed corruption'. The growers, irrespective of size, point out that for the first time in many years they are getting a good return from coffee. They say that the surpluses are being used to pay back loans, create irrigation facilities and start the process of replanting bushes, many of which are 50 to 60 years old. They realise that their present prosperity is a reflection of the world coffee situation. If the government wants to give relief to vulnerable sections of society, they argue, it should take some coffee from the board for distribution through ration shops. The elimination of middlemen would make such coffee cheaper by at least 20 per cent, they claim. With Indian coffee inviting strong export enquiries, the growers think that exports in this financial year (April to March) will be much higher than the 125,172 tonnes shipped in 1993-94.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] India would have to reappraise the country's  defense requirements and take adequate steps to safeguard its  security in view of Pakistan's acquisition of sophisticated  military equipment. The minister of state for external affairs,  Mr. Salman Khurshid, told the Lok Sabha during question hour  today that the government has conveyed that the U.S. proposal to  transfer F-16 aircraft and other military equipment to Pakistan  is a matter of deep concern for India. In a written reply, the  minister said the U.S. Government has not pressed for nuclear  capping by India as they have proposed to Pakistan as a  condition to supplying F-16 fighters.    In another written reply, Mr. Salman Khurshid informed the  house that the government has consistently maintained that it  will not sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] in its present  form because of its discriminatory nature. Referring to the  efforts by the U.S. administration to modify the Pressler  Amendment, the minister said latest reports indicate that these  efforts have not been successful.</p>

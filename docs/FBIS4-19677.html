			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton-Papandreou"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's official visit  to the United States is taking place at an unfavorable period  for our country. This is because Greek interest has unavoidably  focused on Washington's intervention to break Skopje's [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] intransigence. As  a result, all other issues that should have been at the top of  the agenda in Greek-U.S. summit talks (the Cyprus issue,  Greek-Turkish relations, upgrading of Greece's role in the  Balkans) are placed below.    We can see that the priorities of Athens and Washington in  the talks are not completely identical. Regarding the Balkans,  the U.S. Government is mainly interested in maintaining  stability in the southern region of the peninsula at any cost.  This means that the argument that Greece is the most stable and  the strongest-- politically and economically--country in the  region, has been working against us from the time that we had  bilateral problems with our northern "weak, unstable, and  insecure" neighbors. It is becoming more difficult to persuade  the Americans (as well as West Europe) that Greek reaction  against Skopjean provocations or violation of the Greek  minority's human rights by Tirana is correct. Equally without  impact is the argument that our country is facing mid-level  dangers from the stance of our neighbors because our allies and  partners are struggling to prevent immediate and destructive  developments in the Balkans.    Something similar is happening with Washington's current  stance toward Turkey. The U.S. Government seems to be concerned  about the strengthening of Islamism in our neighboring country,  the domestic unrest because of the Kurdish issue, and the  possibility of an unexpected and uncontrolled situation that  will destabilize Turkey. It is certain that these are the  "facts" that mainly formulate the U.S. policy in the  Greek-Turkish dispute and the Cyprus issue. Washington  accordingly divides its intervention interest in Athens and  Ankara for immediate resumption of Greek-Turkish dialogue and  the "mutual" concessions that must be made in the Cyprus issue  to resume the intercommunal dialogue.    All of the above concepts certainly do not aim to preordain  a  failure of the Greek-U.S. talks. They aim at exactly the  opposite: to make the political leadership the general public  understand all of the parameters that will formulate the  "outcome" and the "significance" of the summit meeting in  Washington. Because, most probably, nothing will be judged at  the Clinton-Papandreou talks that will be irrevocably against or  permanently for our national interests....</p>

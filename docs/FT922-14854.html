			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines as jobs data is awaited Wall Street TRADING on US stock markets remained subdued yesterday ahead of a key employment report, and share prices finished lower across the board following another big fall in Japanese equities overnight, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 15.21 down at 3,234.12, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 3.73 to 400.50. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks fell 8.27 to 593.82. Turnover on the New York SE totalled a modest 185m shares. US markets are concerned about the sharp falls on the Tokyo Stock Exchange because they fear this will force Japanese investors to repatriate funds, which could mean withdrawing money from US stock and bond markets. Domestic economic factors also weighed heavily on investors. Today's March jobs data should help clear some of the uncertainty surrounding the US economy, and analysts are forecasting a rise in those in work, which would confirm the recent trend of a gradual improvement in labour conditions. The big three motor stocks were in mixed form, in spite of hopes among some investors that car sales will rebound in line with the economic recovery. Ford put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 . Chrysler lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 1/2 and General Motors Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 . CMS Energy plunged Dollars 6 to Dollars 15 3/4 in turnover of 3.3m shares after the Michigan Public Service Commission turned down a proposal by the company to settle various rate issues that are pending. CUC International rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 after broking house Alex Brown raised its rating on the electronic shopping service group from 'hold' to 'buy'. On the over-the-counter market, Immunex plummeted Dollars 10 1/2 to Dollars 31 1/2 after the company said it expected to post a first-quarter loss. The market had been expecting profits of about 9 cents a share in the quarter. Goal Systems jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 18 3/4 in heavy trading after it was announced that the developer of IBM-compatible software will be bought by another software group, Legent, for Dollars 400m in stock. Under the deal, each share of Goal will be swapped for just over half a Legent share. Legent dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 . Canada TORONTO followed Wall Street's downtrend during fairly heavy trading, the composite index finishing 16.0 lower at 3,395.9. Falls outnumbered advances by 320 to 231 after volume of 33.2m shares. Corel Systems, off CDollars 1 7/8 at CDollars 17 1/8 , reported first-quarter earnings from continuing operations of CDollars 1.97m or 17 cents a share, down from CDollars 2.8m or 26 cents a year ago.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Patten faces surgery as HK reforms loom HONG KONG Governor Chris Patten has been taken into hospital for minor heart surgery just weeks before his controversial political proposals are due to pass before the colony's legislature. Hong Kong stock prices climbed on the news in London yesterday, as brokers speculated on the exceptionally remote possibility that the illness could prepare the way for Mr Patten stepping down from a reform programme that has attracted the ire of China and damaged investors' confidence. Mr Patten is to undergo angioplasty (the full term is 'percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty') treatment, after doctors identified a narrowing of two coronary arteries. A government spokesman suggested he would remain in hospital for four days and was expected to be back at work within a fortnight. Mr Patten chaired a meeting of the Executive Council (LegCo) - the governor's cabinet - during the morning, and the full reform package is still on track, to be presented to the legislature before the end of February. It is unlikely that his hospitalisation will delay this process. But the timing is awkward, as it coincides with a stepping-up of China's opposition to Mr Patten's plans to broaden democratic representation in the Legislative Council, following a brief lull in the verbal conflict. On Monday evening, China's most senior representative in Hong Kong, Mr Zhou Nan, reiterated China's stance that it would not 'barter on principles'. He also claimed that the British proposals were a serious stumbling block to Hong Kong's stable transition back to China in 1997. This was seen as a warning directed at executive councillors, and observers expect the criticism to intensify in the lead-up to the LegCo debate on the proposals.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Building societies unmoved by 'tiny change' Building societies were unmoved by yesterday's  1/4 -point cut in the base rate, although Citibank, the specialist mortgage provider, reduced its standard mortgage rate. The large societies took the view that the base rate cut was too small to be worth translating into a change to mortgage or savings rates. But they welcomed the reduction as a signal of the government's commitment to a low interest rate era and as encouragement to the recovery in the property market. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, described the base rate cut as 'a very tiny change which is unlikely to have any impact although it might reduce costs for centralised lenders'. Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Halifax, the largest society, said: 'This looks like a technical adjustment and is not at present sufficient to cause us to rethink our mortgage or savings rates.' It is unlikely that other building societies would act very differently from Halifax. The remaining nine of the largest 10 societies said they would not change their rates for the time being. Abbey National, the bank that is the UK's second-largest lender, said the cut was too small to justify the cost of changing mortgage rates, although the bank indicated that it would rethink if there was another 1/4 -point drop in base rates soon. Nationwide, the second-largest building society, said it would like to encourage continued recovery in the housing market, but 'we are conscious of the impact that a further mortgage rate cut would have on our savers'. Alliance &amp; Leicester said there were no plans to make any changes but it would be watching the money markets and its competitors. Centralised lenders such as Citibank do not share the same mortgage-funding constraints as building societies because, like the banks, they can obtain funding from the money markets. Citibank said yesterday that it had reduced its standard variable mortgage rate to 7.4 per cent from 7.6 per cent with immediate effect for new customers.</p>

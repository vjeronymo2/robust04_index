Pointing to the situation in former Yugoslavia  in an interview with the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Tuesday [11  January] edition), Kohl said peace and freedom could still not  be had free of charge. For him, it is still decisive "that our  armed forces are capable of meeting our alliance obligations,  prepared for action, and equipped to modern standards, and that  we retain conscription," Kohl said.    Kohl warned against setbacks to the process of reform in the  states of the former Warsaw Pact, above all in Russia. This  would have "unforeseeable consequences." So far, Germany has  provided the lion's share of aid --amounting to 80 billion  German marks -- to Russia and the states of the former Soviet  Union (The interview was prereleased to DPA in edited form).</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners return to South Africa Foreigners have been returning to South African equities: net sellers in 1992, last year they were net buyers of R2.8bn (Dollars 830m), R570m worth in December alone. Overall, investors bought and sold more than 690m shares in the month, compared with only 211m in December 1992. US-led foreign purchases took off early in 1993, but trade in blue chips accelerated in October after sanctions were lifted. That became a deluge in December, driving share prices to unheard of levels. On January 4 the JSE recorded one of its largest single day gains. The overall share index jumped 179 points to breach the 5,000 level for the first time. The market has settled in the past 10 days amid profit-taking and wobbly gold prices. The overall closed yesterday down 31 at 4,821, golds off 24 at 2,066 and industrials 6 down at 5,446. Still, the dividend yield on the industrial and overall indices remain at 25-year lows of 2.1 and 2.3 per cent respectively. What sets the JSE apart is the 'pressure-cooker' influence of exchange control regulations, re-imposed in 1985. The South African Reserve Bank requires overseas investors to buy shares, or gilts, using the financial rand, the foreign investment unit which has traded at a 14 to 30 per cent discount to the commercial rand in the past year. They have the bonus of being able to remit dividends at the commercial rate, automatically improving the dividend yield on a share portfolio. For years the finrand discount has made South African gilts particularly attractive for foreigners, but now equities are benefiting too. 'There is effectively a double market in equities,' says Mr Richard Jesse, a director at stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co. He says foreign investors calculate value at one level, and local investors at another. Exchange control also dams up domestic capital. Mr Rian le Roux, senior economist at insurance group Old Mutual - the JSE's biggest institutional investor - says it seems institutions, proscribed from investing abroad, found themselves relatively underweight in equities as the bull run began. Given that the JSE is so thinly traded - turnover rose to 7 per cent last year from 4 per cent in 1992 - share prices received a double whammy' thanks to new foreign and increased local institutional buying. Of some solace to local investors stunned by these share ratings is consensus that the economy is heading for slow but steady growth in 1994 after pulling out of recession in the third quarter last year. Leading industrial companies emerged from the four-year recession with strong cash balances, excess capacity, and costs trimmed in a period of relatively quiet labour relations. Stockbrokers predict earnings growth of at least 15 per cent in 1994. However, the slippage in share prices recently shows that sentiment remains edgy, with worries that US fund managers can withdraw what is for them relatively small investment in the JSE as quickly as they made it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES

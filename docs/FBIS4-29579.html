			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa at the House of </F> Councillors' Foreign Affairs Committee on 20 June -- recorded]    [Text] I believe it is quite impossible for the United  States to take the position of ignoring altogether what has  occurred in the past. On Japan's part, as members of this  committee just pointed out, since the production of nuclear  weapons on the Korean peninsula represents a direct threat, we  maintain that there is a need to continue efforts to verify even  the past operational records of nuclear reactors.</p>

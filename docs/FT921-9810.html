			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Rebel chief defiant as Serb resistance to peace plan crumbles THE LEADER of Krajina, the Serb enclave in Croatia, yesterday reaffirmed his resistance to the United Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, in the face of increased pressure from Serbia to accept the proposals. On the eve of a crucial session of the Serb enclave's parliament today, Mr Milan Babic, president of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Krajina, said: 'A step forward has been made in the plan.' But he continued to oppose a key element of the UN initiative to despatch 10,000 peacekeepers. He said Serb reservists could not be disbanded while Croatia maintained its army. Mr Lazar Macura, Krajina's information minister, added: 'The Yugoslav army no longer exists. There are many army officers who are ready to stay in Krajina, about 30,000 reservists are from the region. . . only the generals who are manipulated by Belgrade will leave.' At the same time, in a move directed by Serbia, a rival parliament in Glina, northern Krajina, unconditionally accepted the UN plan at an emergency session. Mr Babic dismissed the manoeuvres by Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, to marginalise the leadership in Knin, the capital of Krajina. He said: 'It (Glina) is not a legitimate session. It is simply a continuation of pressure from Belgrade.' The parliament in Knin is expected today to approve the holding of a referendum on the UN plan. Krajina's leaders say the referendum would be held as soon as possible. The referendum could break the deadlock between Krajina and Serbia, offering Mr Babic a way out of the impasse. He said: 'If the people approve the plan, I will bow to their will.' Despite Mr Babic's defiance, the inhabitants of Knin, tired of the economic deprivation brought on by the civil war, seem likely to approve the UN plan. 'We want peace. Any plan that will bring us peace,' one worker in Knin said yesterday. Krajina's leaders, say Mr Milosevic, have betrayed the region's 300,000 Serbs, stranding them in an independent, hostile Croatia. 'Mr Milosevic doesn't need us any more, so he is ready to sacrifice us,' said Mr Macura. Serbia has denounced Mr Babic as the main obstacle to bringing peace to Yugoslavia, torn by deep ethnic antagonism. In a further effort to undermine Mr Babic, Belgrade has economically isolated the poor mountainous region of Krajina. Serbia last month also cut off Krajina from the monetary system, when it issued new bank notes. The Yugoslav dinars currently circulating in Knin are practically worthless, valid only in the enclave. Mr Babic opposes the UN plan for Yugoslavia because he fears that replacing the federal army in Krajina with UN troops and disarming local Serbs would leave them at the mercy of Croatian forces. UN Security Council members urged all warring sides in a resolution passed on Friday to give their unqualified support to the UN peace proposals.</p>

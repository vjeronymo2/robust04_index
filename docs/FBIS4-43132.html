			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Erich Hauser report: "Belgians Give Neofascists Cold </F> Shoulder"]    [Text] Brussels, 9 June -- In the European Union (EU)  neofascist members of the new Italian Government are openly  slighted. Some EU politicians do not even want to shake hands  with them.    The nomination of Belgian head of government Jan-Luc Dehaene  as the successor of Brussels Commission President Jacques Delors  is looking increasingly unlikely. Since Belgian ministers  openly dissociate themselves from their Italian colleagues from  the neofascist National Alliance in EU Council of Ministers'  meetings, observers expect Italian Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi to reject the "favorite" of Chancellor Helmut Kohl  and President Francois Mitterrand out of consideration for the  Roman coalition.    Since Delors' successor has to be unanimously nominated in  the circle of the 12 heads of government, all the more respect  is paid to the attitude of the Belgian ministers. Citing the  EU's democratic bases, representatives of Belgium (which, with  Greece and Germany, is a member of the EU presidency troika)  have already expressed their protest twice. At the meeting of  the EU ministers responsible for telecommunications on 30 May,  Belgian Elio di Rupo, son of Italian immigrants, made a  statement and reportedly refused to shake hands with Giuseppe  Tatarella, Rome's minister for post and telecommunications. It  is his personal decision to refrain from any contact with his  Italian colleagues, Di Rupo said. In response, Tatarella  allegedly said that Benito Mussolini had abolished handshakes in  Italy and replaced them with the "Caesarian greeting" (of the  raised arm.)    During the second appearance of an Alliance minister -- at  the EU environment minister's meeting in Luxembourg on Wednesday  -- Belgian Minister Jacques Santkin, for his part, made a  statement: "Precisely after the D-Day celebrations, it has to  be clearly affirmed what the bases of democracy are." This  time, Italian Alliance Minister Altero Matteoli answered that  "the principles of freedom and democracy, which have been  addressed, will never again be doubted."    Well-informed circles in Brussels proceed on the assumption  that Belgium's protest attitude is determined by Dehaene's  socialist coalition partner and not due to a secret agreement in  the "troika" with Bonn and Athens.    In the Dutch Parliament, the parties said that an Alliance  candidate nominated by Italy for the future EU Commission would  be "boycotted." Before assuming office in January, the future  EU Commission will have to face a "vote of agreement" of the new  European Parliament. Even now, it is doubtful that a Commission  member from the Alliance will obtain the agreement of the  majority in Strasbourg.</p>

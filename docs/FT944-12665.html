			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Australian budget deficit Australia posted a budget deficit of ADollars 4.511bn (Pounds 2.05bn) for the first three months of the fiscal year to June 30, 1995, against ADollars 2.962bn for the same period a year ago, finance minister Kim Beazley said. 'The relatively high cumulative deficit to the September quarter of ADollars 4.511bn mainly reflects lower revenue collections, largely due to timing factors,' Mr Beazley said. Spending for the year to date was ADollars 31.619bn, up 4.5 per cent from a year ago. The May budget forecast of a full-year deficit of ADollars 11.7bn assumes full-year spending growth of 5.7 per cent. Three-month revenue to September was ADollars 27.108 bn, down 0.7 per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent budgeted growth.</p>

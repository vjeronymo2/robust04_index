			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [``gag''-signed report: ``Skoda Allegedly Does Not Export </F> Nuclear Technology'']    [Text] Prague/Plzen -- Skoda Plzen has never collaborated  with the U.S. Westinghouse firm on any nuclear power station  project, Jaroslav Hudec, press spokesman for the concern, has  told us. The only thing that it does for the overseas firm is  to manufacture components for the distribution of high voltage  power, and these components have nothing to do with the actual  nuclear operation.    The spokesman also mentioned a project in a preparatory  stage  of the [word illegible] of fuel rods for nuclear reactors. In  this instance, too, we deal purely with engineering production.  The talks with the German firm Siemens then pertain only to the  manufacture of turbines. The spokesman was responding in this  manner to speculation that these firms are trying through Skoda  to reach Iran with their nuclear technology, which laws in their  own countries do not facilitate.    Nevertheless, official circles in Israel have expressed  concern about such a danger. Jaroslav Hudec again recalled that  the discussion about nuclear power generation was also on the  agenda during the visit to Iran by Skoda Plzen Director General  Lubomir Soudek. The Czech Foreign Ministry was informed in  advance about these talks with the provision that all these  discussions are of a fact-finding nature only. Any steps in  this direction will be taken, according to the spokesman, in  accordance with the laws in effect.</p>

Applications for registration closed at midnight last night.  Details of the applications will be published in the government  gazette on Tuesday. Nineteen parties signed their applications.  Members of the Freedom alliance, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party], the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the  Conservative Party and Bophuthatswana did not register.    A senior spokesman for the Electoral Commission, Mr. Peter  Cronje, said the only condition under which late applicants will  be considered was if political parties involved in the  Transitional Executive Council reconvened a session of  Parliament to amend the act. Mr. Cronje said that between 7,000  and 10,000 polling booths were expected to be in place for the  election. He said the IEC would attempt to make ballot boxes  accessible to all areas. These included hostels in black  residential areas and other anticipated flash points.    Party-political broadcasts and advertisements were to be  banned from television between the fourth of next month and the  25th of April.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Declaration seeks 'a Community close to its citizens' The following is the text of the declaration from the Birmingham summit: 1. We reaffirm our commitment to the Maastricht Treaty: We need to ratify it to make progress towards European Union if the Community is to remain an anchor of stability in a rapidly changing continent, building on its success over the last quarter of a century. 2. As a Community of democracies, we can only move forward with the support of our citizens. We are determined to respond to the concerns raised in the recent public debate. We must: Demonstrate to our citizens the benefits of the Community and the Maastricht Treaty. Make the Community more open, to ensure a better informed public debate on its activities. Respect the history, culture and traditions of individual nations, with a clearer understanding of what member states should do and what needs to be done by the Community. Make clear that citizenship of the union brings our citizens additional rights and protection without in any way taking the place of their national citizenship. 3. Foreign ministers will suggest ways, before the Edinburgh European Council, of opening up the work of the Community's institutions, including the possibility of some open council discussion - for example on future work programmes. We welcome the Commission's offer to consult more widely before proposing legislation, which could include consultation with all the member states and a more systematic use of consultation documents (Green Papers). We ask the Commission to complete by early next year its work on improving public access to the information available to it and to other Community institutions. We want Community legislation to become simpler and clearer. 4. We stress the European Parliament's important role in the democratic life of the Community and we welcome the growing contacts between national parliaments and the European Parliament. We reaffirm that national parliaments should be more closely involved in the Community's activities. We shall discuss this with our parliaments. We welcome the Commission's readiness to respond positively to requests from national parliaments for explanations of its proposals. We underline the importance we attach to the Conference of Parliaments and to the Committee of the Regions. 5. We reaffirm that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the citizen. Greater unity can be achieved without excessive centralisation. It is for each member state to decide how its power should be exercised domestically. The Community can only act where member states have given it the power to do so in the treaties. Action at the Community level should happen only when proper and necessary: The Maastricht Treaty provides the right framework and objectives for this. Bringing to life this principle - 'subsidiarity', or 'nearness' - is essential if the Community is to develop with the support of its citizens. We look forward to decisions at Edinburgh on the basis of reports on: Adapting the Council's procedures and practices, as the Commission for its part has already done, so that the principle becomes an integral part of the Community's decision-making, as the Maastricht Treaty requires. Guidelines for applying the principle in practice, for instance by using the lightest form of legislation, with maximum freedom for member states on how best to achieve the objective in question. Community legislation must be implemented and enforced effectively, and without interfering unnecessarily in the daily life of our citizens. We shall also have a look at the first fruits of the Commission's review of past Community legislation with examples. 6. Making this principle work should be a priority for all the Community institutions without affecting the balance between them. We will seek an agreement about this with the European Parliament. 7. The Maastricht Treaty will bring direct benefits to individual citizens. All of us - Council, Commission and Parliament - must do more to make this clear. 8. The European Council, in conformity with the responsibilities given to it by the Treaty, will ensure that the fundamental principles of the European Union will be fully observed. Heads of state and government agreed that member states face common economic challenges, and were concerned at lower growth and increasing unemployment. Strong co-ordination at the Community level will help to ensure that the economy of each member state is strengthened by the success of other member states. It is important for member states to continue policies to reduce inflation; to carry through programmes for controlling budget deficits; and to improve the efficiency of their economies through open market policies. Firm and sustained implementation of these policies establishes the basis for recovery, for social and economic cohesion, and for the creation of the new and lasting jobs that are needed. The European Council underlined the importance in this context of reinforcing the convergence process among the member states' economies, which is crucial for maintaining monetary stability and for creating the framework for sustainable growth and rising employment. Strict adherence to the principles of sound economic management, as set out in convergence programmes, formulated by member states so as to fulfil the criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty in order to realise the movement towards economic and monetary union, would enable the Community to meet its objective of proceeding together in its development. The European Council reiterated too its commitment to the European Monetary System as a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe. The European Council endorsed the view of economic and finance ministers that the recent financial turbulence calls for reflection and analysis in the light of developments in capital markets and in the European and world monetary systems. They invited economic and finance ministers, assisted by the Monetary Committee, with the involvement of the Commission to carry this work forward, with the central bank governors. It should cover recent economic and financial developments within Europe and in the major industrialised countries as well as the implications of changes in the general economic and financial environment in recent years, notably the impact of the increasing size and sophistication of financial markets and greater capital liberalisation.</p>

But Stams, who hurt  the knee in the first half of Monday night's loss to the San Francisco 49ers,  appears to have escaped serious injury, Coach John Robinson said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Robinson said Bruce Klostermann will play at Stams' spot.  </P> <P> Tight end Damone Johnson, who reinjured his hamstring, and guard Tom Newberry,  who sprained his left ankle. Robinson said both look doubtful for Sunday's game  at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Robinson said that he plans to play both Gaston Green and Cleveland Gary at  tailback in the remaining two games of 1990, but that he wasn't sure who would  be the starter. Robinson also said that No. 1 pick Bern Brostek, who played  left guard after Newberry went down, did an adequate job. TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

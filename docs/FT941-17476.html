			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Investors find fresh hope after digging deep - Trafalgar House Shares in Trafalgar House have risen sharply since the troubled conglomerate announced a Pounds 404m rights issue while posting a Pounds 347.2m annual pre-tax loss. The huge deficit followed a review of the balance sheet which led to write-downs and other charges totalling Pounds 467.7m. However the share price gain since mid-December appears to reflect greater shareholder confidence in the group, now firmly under the sway of Hongkong Land Holdings, Trafalgar's 25.3 per cent stakeholder. This new-found optimism will be tested again on Friday when shareholders will be asked to approve the one-for-three convertible preference share issue and placing described by Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar and Hongkong Land, as providing a 'fresh start'. Hongkong Land, which has invested about Pounds 200m in building up its equity stake over the past year, has said it will take up its full rights entitlement at a cost of about Pounds 90m, as well as applying for shares under the placing. Its grip on Trafalgar's management will be further strengthened by the appointment of Mr Nigel Rich as chief executive from next August. Mr Rich is currently Hongkong Land's managing director and a key member of the Jardine Matheson team. Without Hongkong Land's support there is little doubt that Trafalgar would have been subject to a painful debt rescheduling. Nevertheless shareholders  -who have been asked to reach into their pockets on three occasions over the past three years for a total of Pounds 964m - have little to look forward to in the short term. The Trafalgar board has already forecast a much reduced 1p (3.5p) dividend this year and analysts believe it will be several years before the group is able to achieve a barely-respectable 5 per cent pre-tax margin on its Pounds 4bn in annual turnover.</p>

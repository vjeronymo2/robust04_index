			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to comments, the Board has also substantially revised the other elements of proposed Section 704.12(a). The Board agrees that proposed Section 704.12(a) went beyond preventing trade association control and in fact prevented individuals who serve on the corporate credit union board from serving in other capacities in the credit union system and, in addition, prevented other individuals from their credit unions from serving in the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since corporate credit unions should exist to serve the interests of natural person credit unions and their members, Section 704.12(a)(1) of the final rule retains the requirement that a majority of corporate credit union board members, including the chair, must be representatives of member credit unions. Section 704.12(a)(2) of the final rule, however, only prohibits the board chair from serving in a trade association, on the theory that the chair should be an individual whose loyalty is in no way divided between the corporate credit union and a trade association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather than prohibiting the majority of board members who represent member credit unions from any service in the credit union system, Section 704.12(a)(3) of the final rule simply prohibits a majority of board members from serving with a given credit union trade association or its affiliates, excluding chapters. The Board believes that a corporate credit union's board should not be controlled or overly influenced by individuals who represent a particular trade association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> League chapters were excluded from the restriction because individuals serving as officers of such chapters generally are not involved in setting policy or making decisions for the league. Individuals who serve on league committees are likewise excluded because the regulation only applies to officers, directors, and employees of a trade association. The proposed prohibition against a majority of board members serving as ``agents'' of a trade association has been deleted. The provision was unclear in its meaning and unnecessary, given the rule against a majority serving as officers, directors, or employees of the same or affiliated trade associations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State leagues that are members of the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) are considered to be affiliated with CUNA and with each other. Thus, for example, a five-member corporate credit union board could not have two members who serve on the boards of different state leagues and one member who serves on the board of CUNA. A five-member board could, however, have two members who serve on the boards of different state leagues, and one member who serves on the board of another, unaffiliated trade association. Thus, individual leaders in the credit union system would retain the ability to serve in various capacities, but a corporate credit union could not be dominated by a given trade group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 704.12(a)(4) of the final rule operates to prevent the limitations of paragraphs (2) and (3) from being circumvented by placing a senior employee of a credit union on a trade association board and a subordinate employee of the same credit union on a corporate credit union board. For example, again in the case of a corporate credit union with a five-member board, it would not be permissible to have the following combination of board members: one corporate board member who also serves on the board of CUNA, one board member who also serves on the board of a state league, and one corporate board member who is an employee of a credit union whose CEO serves on the board of a state league. This same example would become permissible, however, if the credit union CEO were on the corporate credit union board and the vice president were on the league board, or if either or both of the two individuals were board members at their natural person credit union instead of employees. This distinction is based on the belief that only superior to subordinate employee relationships result in the kind of domination that would subvert the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 704.12(a)(5) of the final rule is a new requirement which provides that in the case of any corporate credit union whose membership is comprised of more than 25% non credit unions, the majority of directors representing member credit unions must be elected only by those member credit unions. At least 80% of the membership of all corporate credit unions but U.S. Central consists of credit unions. Approximately 60% of U.S. Central's membership, however, consists of individuals or organizations that are not credit unions and that, for the most part, are officials or affiliates of CUNA, CUNA Mutual, the World Council of Credit Unions, and the leagues. In the absence of some special rule for U.S. Central, this majority would be able to elect, to the majority of board seats that must be held by representatives of member credit unions, representatives of their choosing, thus removing control from U.S. Central's member credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other than requiring the use of the bylaw provisions regarding mail ballots and nomination by petition, the Board will not prescribe specific procedures for achieving the requirements of Section 704.12(a). Each corporate credit union has the freedom to develop its own election procedures, subject to the requirements of the rule and the bylaws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 704.12(b)&blank;Representatives of Organizational Members <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Section 704.12(b) has been carried through to the final rule with the addition of a sentence clarifying that an organizational member of a corporate credit union is a member that is not a natural person. In response to comments, proposed Section 704.12(b)(2) has been amended to make it clear that in filling vacancies, the board of a state chartered corporate credit union is free to use the credit union's own bylaws, as long as the substantive requirements of the rule are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 704.12(c)&blank;Recusal Provision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Again, most commenters who supported regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance agreed with the proposal to require recusal for all matters involving the pecuniary interest of an organization in which a corporate official is interested, rather than just matters where the amount in question exceeds 5% of the corporate's capital. The final rule makes this change. As noted in the supplementary information section of the proposed rule, a healthy and independent credit union movement depends, in part, on preventing even the appearance of conflicts of interest. A strong recusal provision is necessary to achieve this goal. Under the recusal provision, an individual who is interested in a matter may not deliberate or vote on the matter, or otherwise attempt to influence its outcome. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule has been amended to clarify that the recusal provision does not apply when the matter involves general policy applicable to all members, rather than a specific action regarding one member. In addition, the word ``agent'' has been deleted as being vague and potentially overly broad. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed definition of ``interested'' has been made final, with the clarification that recusal is only required when a director, committee member, officer, or employee of a corporate credit union has a relationship with someone and knows that that person has in interest in an entity whose interest will be affected by an action of the corporate credit union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 704.12(d)&blank;Administration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 704.12(d) of the proposed rule required the management official of the corporate credit union to report solely to the board and prohibited any management official, officer, agent, or employee of the corporate credit union from being a management official, officer, agent, or employee of a trade association. In response to comments, the final rule prohibits only the chief executive officer of a corporate credit union from serving as an employee of a trade association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

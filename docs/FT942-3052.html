			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Placing at 150p for CPL Aromas CPL Aromas, the fragrance and flavour manufacturing company, yesterday announced a placing price of 150p to raise Pounds 4m net from its flotation in a week's time. The float, sponsored by Credit Lyonnais Laing, involves the placing and employee offer of 4.18m shares which will bring the total number of shares in issue to 10.88m. The family of Mr Terry Pickthall, founder and chairman, will hold 36.4 per cent of the shares, down from 57 per cent prior to the flotation. Ensign Trust, wholly owned by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund, will own a further 17 per cent. CPL's market capitalisation at the placing price will be Pounds 16.3m. A month ago the company predicted its value would be up to Pounds 20m. The historic p/e multiple at the placing price was 12.2 based on earnings per share for the year to March of 12.3p. The notional gross dividend yield is 2.5 per cent. Mr Pickthall said Pounds 2m of the money raised would be used to develop a new plant on Teesside to manufacture aroma chemicals. He said aromatic ingredients were an important growth area and the plant would develop the company's capacity. Aromatic ingredients account for 40 per cent of group turnover, compared to 60 per cent from fragrance and flavours. In the year to March, pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.1m) on turnover of Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 14.8m). The balance of the proceeds will be used for working capital. Mr Pickthall said priorities include developing the company's position in the own-brand market.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: French monopolies in insemination approved - European Court The European Court has ruled that regulations governing bovine insemination centres in France do not infringe Treaty of Rome competition or free movement of goods rules. The Court said that rules applicable to monopolies permit approved insemination centres to be granted certain exclusive rights within a defined geographical area. Charging customers for the additional costs actually incurred when insemination centres were requested to supply semen from other member countries did not constitute abuse of their dominant position. Moreover, the free movement rules and stock-breeding directives did not preclude national rules requiring EC semen importers to deliver imports to an approved centre. The rulings were given in response to two questions referred by the French Court of Cassation in proceedings between the Crespelle insemination centre and the Mayenne production and insemination co-operative. The Crespelle centre had operated bovine semen storage units and carried out insemination in part of the Mayenne Department since 1961. The Mayenne co-operative, which had exclusive rights under French rules since 1970 in the Mayenne Department, brought proceedings to enforce its exclusive rights against Crespelle. Artificial insemination in France is regulated by a 1966 law on stock breeding which requires insemination centres to be authorised and to operate in a defined area with a local geographical monopoly. Any breeder within the area may request the local insemination centre to supply semen from production centres of their choice, but must pay the additional costs thereby incurred. French rules require an importer from another EC country to deliver the semen to an approved centre, but he may build up a stock in a centre of his choice. EC directives cover insemination regulation but not yet the storage or use of semen in the country of import. The ECJ first referred to the treaty rule which subjects businesses granted exclusive rights by member countries to the Rome treaty rules, including the competition rules. The Court said that the French rules granted exclusive rights to the insemination centres and created a dominant position by establishing a contiguous series of local monopolies covering France. However, the Court confirmed that such national rules are prohibited only if, in merely exercising the exclusive right granted, the insemination centre cannot avoid abusing its dominant position. Since the alleged abuse in the present case was the charging of exorbitant prices by the centres, and that was not the direct consequence of national law, the law alone did not lead the centres to charge disproportionate costs and abuse their dominant position. Where a business has an administrative monopoly, it will abuse its dominant position itself if it charges for its services fees which are disproportionate to the economic value of the service provided. According to the ECJ, there was no abuse provided the additional costs charged by the centres were actually incurred in meeting their customers' requests to supply imported semen. The ECJ went on to find that the French storage rules for imported semen were a barrier to imports. The treaty, however, allows restrictions if justified on grounds of protection of the health and life of humans and animals. Although EC directives cover certain aspects of insemination regulation, France argued that its rules were justified on public health grounds relating to the need to improve bovine stock geneticity. The Court found that the storage or use of semen in the country of import was not covered by the directives. Member countries, therefore, could rely on health grounds to restrict the free movement of bovine semen, provided the restrictive effects on intra-Community trade did not exceed what was necessary to achieve the aim in view. The obligation to store semen in approved centres was found to apply without distinction to domestic and imported goods. However, the ECJ said it could not be ruled out that the restrictive effects on imports impeded the marketing of imported semen more than national products. Since there were no provisions preventing the centres applying unreasonable conditions or prices for storage, it was a question of fact for the national court to decide whether the operation of the approved centres amounted in practice to discrimination against imports.

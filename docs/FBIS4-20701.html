Introduction </H5>   Advanced technology has played a central role in bringing  about the dramatic technological innovations witnessed in recent  years. Technologies introduced into Japan from the United States  and Europe clearly played a major role in Japan's economic  development following World War II. Japan could never have  attained its current level of prosperity without that  technology. However, we are now being pressed to come up with  ways of dealing with new issues such as technology-based  frictions between the United States and Japan, and problems  related to labor shortages, an aging society and environmental  protection on a global scale. And to overcome these problems, it  is vital that we not simply rely on the full mobilization of  existing advanced technologies, but rather make technological  breakthroughs, cultivate these new technologies and put them to  the widest possible use.    In this vein, the database constructed under the auspices of  the Social Applications of Nuclear Technology Accumulation  (SANTA) project, called the SANTA database, provides technology  information services aimed at transferring nuclear technology to  the private sector. This database was put together and is  maintained by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute  (JAERI), and contains advanced technological information on that  portion of the results of JAERI's overall nuclear research and  development efforts considered most likely to benefit society as  a whole, and particularly, that information on those advanced  nuclear technologies that could be utilized or applied in  non-nuclear power industrial fields.    Up until now, considerable technology developed by JAERI has  been transferred to private firms operating in nuclear-related  fields, but with the exception of radiation and RI technologies,  very little of JAERI's advanced nuclear technologies have been  put to use in non-nuclear power fields. But nuclear technologies  comprise comprehensive science and technology systems that stand  at the pinnacle of all science and technology fields, from the  basic fields of physics and chemistry to electrical engineering,  mechanical engineering and so on. And since nuclear technology  is the systematic accumulation of many years of scientific and  technological research, it can be put to use in a variety of  different fields, and has value as a kind of quasi-public  property that could not possibly be maintained by any individual  private firm.    Based on this kind of thinking, JAERI felt compelled to  promote the use by the private sector of technologies that it  has produced, and as one means of achieving this, constructed  the SANTA database and is using this database to make its  technology information widely available online. JAERI  commissioned the Nuclear Data Center (NDC) to develop the SANTA  database, construction of which was completed at the end of  fiscal year 1992. JAERI began providing SANTA database services  in April 1993 as one of the menu selections available with  G-Search, an integrated database service offered via Fujitsu's  nationwide network FENICS. In addition to the SANTA database,  G-Search also offers newspaper/news article information, and has  been providing Nuclear Code Information Service (NUCIS) database  services for some time now. At the behest of JAERI, the SANTA  database is currently being operated and managed by NDC, but  inquiries concerning the technology information contained  therein and/or requests for detailed documents and other  materials related to that database should be directed to JAERI's  Planning Office.  <H5>  2. Database Contents </H5>   Before explaining the contents of the SANTA database, I  would  like to discuss JAERI's ``Technology Catalog'' and the sources  of the information contained in the SANTA database. The  ``Technology Catalog'' was produced prior to the development and  operation of the SANTA database, for use as both a PR  publication designed to transfer advanced nuclear technology  held by JAERI to the private sector and as a medium for  introducing the various technologies available. This catalog is  put together in an easy-to-understand fashion, and makes use of  one A4 size page, complete with color graphics, for each and  every technology introduced therein. Each such page contains the  name of the technology, an approximately 400-word descriptive  outline of the kind of technology it is and the special  characteristics it possesses, plus anywhere from 2 to 5  photographs, graphs and/or drawings that visually portray that  technology (Figure 1 shows one of the pages that comprise the  ``Technology Catalog.''), and is compiled with other similarly  configured pages to produce this technology-information catalog.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-21A>      Figure 1. A Sample Page from the ``Technology </FIG>      JAERI first began gathering together the data for producing  this catalog in November 1990. JAERI made its Planning Office  the secretariat for the data collection effort, and this office  solicited pertinent technological data from research institutes  and then sorted and arranged the data it received. Naturally,  the technology data collected in this way was not limited to  just that information that would be incorporated into the  catalog, but rather included numerous other bibliographic data  as well. This additional information comprised rather detailed  data elements that supplemented and explained the contents of  the catalog, as well as codes selected from among a list of  classification codes that had previously been assigned to the  various technology application fields to make it easier to  retrieve related data. The SANTA database was constructed by  arranging data elements comprised of the data gathered from  various research institutes for incorporation into JAERI's  original ``Technology Catalog,'' the rather detailed  supplementary data and the retrieval codes. In the future, JAERI  plans to solicit registered data twice a year -- once every six  months -- and use this newly solicited data to keep the SANTA  database updated.    In addition to the titles, technology explanations and  related graphics (drawings, graphs and photograph) titles and  explanatory descriptions (photographs, drawings and other image  data per se are not incorporated into the database) taken from  the ``Technology Catalog'' discussed above, the data elements  contained in the SANTA database consist of explanatory remarks  that provide all-inclusive detailed explanations of the  technologies, names of principal materials and devices, software  titles, free terms, the existence of domestic patents and/or  patent application numbers, the existence of foreign patents,  the names of companies, universities and other related parties  and their classifications for that technology developed jointly,  plus the names and codes of JAERI divisions/departments/offices  in charge of developing JAERI technologies, the names of the  individuals in charge of that development, the year/month  development was completed, and retrieval-facilitating codes  specifying the technological fields, and old and new  applications for the technologies.    As technology codes, the SANTA database uses International  Patent Classification (IPC) codes, which are internationally  unified classification codes for patent materials. As  application codes, the database makes use of Koiki Patent  Classification (KPC) codes (``Koiki'' is Japanese for ``wide  area'' or ``broad range''). These KPC codes focus on  high-interest themes, and are used to supplement the IPC codes.  And as codes for specifying new application fields, topical  technology themes coded into fixed keyword formats are used to  specify new technology fields that are difficult to retrieve  using patent classifications, such as optical IC's,  microcomputers, etc. KPC and fixed keyword codes are both being  used as retrieval words in the Patent Online Information System  (PATOLIS) provided by the Japan Patent Information Organization  (JAPIO).    In addition to the above items, the SANTA database also  contains codes for services that JAERI can provide in order to  transfer those technologies to the private sector, database  management information known as ID numbers, and the date the  data was registered and/or revised.    The principal technology fields covered by the SANTA  database  include nuclear fusion, radiation measurements/control,  operation and management of accelerators and nuclear reactors,  nuclear reactor fuel and materials, radiation applications,  nuclear reactor safety and environmental safety. These  technologies can be put to use in a diverse number of fields  such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals/foodstuffs, aircraft/railway  car/automobile parts, chemical plants/electronic  equipment/vacuum equipment and environmental fields such as  water processing and emissions control. The database currently  contains roughly 50 data elements on technologies such as  silicon carbide-based ultra heat resistant ceramic fibers,  biodegradable polymers and high resolution quadrupole mass  spectrometer.    The silicon carbide-based ultra heat resistant ceramic fiber  discussed in Figure 1 above as a sample page of the Technology  Catalog is a material with heat resistant and high strength  functions produced as a result of research on radiation uses.  The Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) is  continuing to test this technology and has plans for  commercializing it in the near future. The next challenge for  this technology will be to use the new fiber to develop a  composite material of ceramic and a heat resistant alloy with  enhanced heat resistant properties. If this can be achieved,  then possible applications of this type of ultra heat resistant  material are numerous, in everything from space planes and  Japan's own space shuttle (HOPE) to nuclear fusion reactors, gas  turbines for use in thermal power plants and jet engines. And  once processing technologies are improved, this new material  might also be applied to the construction of automobile engines,  enabling the realization of ultra low fuel consumption  automobiles, and thus contributing tremendously to protecting  the global environment.  <H5>  3. Retrieval Operations </H5>   Retrieval operations for the SANTA database are menu driven,  which means the user specified the type of data he wants to  retrieve by selecting the appropriate retrieval item(s) from  among a list of such items that is displayed on the menu screen  and then selecting the output function to output the results of  that retrieval operation. Two retrieval methods are available,  one that uses free term searches and another that employs  classification code searches. Free term searches enable the user  to input words of his choosing to search through articles and  indices contained in the database to retrieve data from six  locations providing him with technology summaries, descriptions  of Technology Catalog entries, graphics titles, principal  devices names, principal material names and other keywords.  Classification code searches are targeted at data elements  stored as classification codes in database records, and require  the user to input known codes and symbols to extract codes  incorporating the matching data he is seeking and enable him to  retrieve seven types of data including information on the  existence of domestic (Japan) patents and technology codes, etc.    Classification code searches require that the user know the  classification codes beforehand. These classification codes  include retrieval system menu-driven codes for carrying out  searches to determine the existence or non-existence of domestic  patents, to search related categories and to search for data on  service provision methods. And for users who are not familiar  with the contents of codes used to search for JAERI  organizational codes and technology field codes there is a code  reference function included on the HELP menu.    The following is a typical example of a SANTA database free  term retrieval operation that uses words taken from articles  contained in the Technology Catalog to search out information on  ceramic fibers.  <H5>  (1) Retrieval System Inputs (Figure 2) </H5>   [1] Input menu item 2, ``Search for keyword under `catalog  entry descriptions''' from the search item and process selection  screen.    [2] First, input the search word ``ceramics'' in full-size  katakana in accordance with instructions given following the  star symbol on the menu.    [3] Inputting ``ceramics'' will initiate the search, and the  number 8 will be displayed at the bottom of the screen,  indicating that there are a total of eight data elements related  to ceramics contained in the database.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-22A>      Figure 2. Retrieval System Input Example </FIG>   <H5>  (2) Attaching Conditions to Searches (Figure 3) </H5>   [1] Input 1 for ``Attach further conditions and search  (AND).''    [2] Input 2 once again for ``Search for keyword under  `catalog entry descriptions'.''    [3] When you input the search word ``fiber'' in kanji  characters, the retrieval system searches for records related to  both ``ceramics'' and ``fiber,'' and displays a ``1'' at the  bottom of the screen, indicating that one data element was found.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-23A>      Figure 3. Retrieval System Input With Conditions </FIG>   <H5>   (3) Outputting the Full Text of the Technical Information </H5> (Figure 4)    [1] The above operations have made it possible to retrieve  technical information related to ``ceramics'' and ``fiber,'' and  now it is time to output that information in full-text format.  Using the same menu screen that was used to attach conditions,  input ``P'' for ``Output search results.''    [2] A menu will be displayed asking you whether you want to  ``Display title only'' or ``Display full text.'' At this time,  input 2 for ``Display full text.''    [3] The next menu screen will ask you to specify the level  of  the output. At this point, simply hit RETURN, and the full text  of the record retrieved via the above operations will be output  and displayed on the screen.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-24A>      Figure 4. Specifying Full Text Output </FIG>   <H5>  (4) Outputting Titles </H5>   When you wish to output just the titles of the data you  initially retrieved or of the data you retrieved after attaching  conditions to your search operation, after inputting ``P'' for  ``Output search results,'' input 1 for ``Display titles only.''  Next, specify the desired output level. If you wish to output  all the titles contained in the data you have retrieved, simply  hit RETURN. This will display all the titles.  <H5>  (5) Ending Retrieval Processing </H5>   Pressing RETURN will return you to the output format  selection menu screen. Next, input ``OFF'' to end database  operations. This will return you to the previous screen, at  which time you can continue to input ``E'' until you return to  the G-Search top menu, or you can input ``T'' to return directly  to the top menu.  <H5>  (6) Using the HELP Function </H5>   The HELP function comprises seven menu screens. Four of  these  menu screens function to display lists of codes which serve as  references for the codes used in classification code retrieval  operations, such as technology field classification codes. Other  HELP functions include those for menu-driven retrieval methods,  a function for explaining output methods, a function for  displaying the process involved in retrieval operations and a  function for deleting temporarily maintained search result data.  All these functions can be used as required.    At present, SANTA database services do not include selective  data provision services (SDI) nor services for distributing data  via means other than online. However, for the time being, all  costs related to utilizing SANTA database services are being  born by JAERI. This means that users can avail themselves of  SANTA database services, i.e. access and retrieve data,  absolutely free of charge (but this does not include the charges  for membership in the G-Search system). JAERI hopes that this  will help promote the transfer of nuclear technology to the  private sector by encouraging users to take advantage of SANTA  database services.  <H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>   SANTA database online information provision services have  really just gotten underway. Briefly put, the special  characteristics of this database are the fact that it was  clearly designed to provide technological information services  aimed at transferring to the private sector JAERI-maintained  advanced technology produced as the result of nuclear  power-related research and development, and that it does so via  simple, easy-to-use, small-scale retrieval operations that  display full text data in Japanese, and all this free of charge  to the user.    Two technical tasks remain for the SANTA database. These  are:    1) equipping the database with the capabilities of storing  and providing online image data such as photographs and graphs  designed to make the technological information being provided  easier to visualize and understand, and;    2) enabling the SANTA database to link up with an  as-yet-unfinished JAERI patent information database in order to  better explain the contents of foreign and domestic patents  covering the technologies registered in the SANTA database.    However, even more important than tackling these tasks is  the  need to raise the recognition level of the SANTA database and  get more users, both private individuals and corporate  representatives, to utilize its services more often. And to  accomplish this, it is vital to make the data contained in this  database as complete as possible. That is, JAERI must promote  its research and development efforts with renewed vigor so that  more numerous technological data can be registered in the SANTA  database, thereby making it a more complete database in terms of  both quality and quantity.    The point of contact for inquiries related to G-Search is  Fujitsu F.I.P. (Tel: 03-3433-2251), and for inquiries concerning  the contents and/or utilization procedures for the SANTA  database is the section in charge of promoting nuclear power  technology applications, Planning Office, JAERI (Tel:  03-3592-2102).</p>

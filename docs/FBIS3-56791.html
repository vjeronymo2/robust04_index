In an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine, Steinberg pointed out  that "there exists a coherent international system for the  notification of the nuclear situation in the world, under which  all members of the European Nuclear Society inform the  headquarters of this organization based in Switzerland of  accidents at their nuclear power stations, which distributes the  information among the other member-states."    Meanwhile, the head of the press service of the Russian  Gosatomnadzor, Yuriy Rogozhin, told INTERFAX yesterday that  failures to inform the Russian Gosatomnadzor by former Soviet  republics violate the official agreement between the nuclear  supervising organizations reached shortly after the break-up of  the Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Regulation of MMI defended THE Department of Trade and Industry last night rejected criticism of its regulatory role in respect of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurance company. The DTI said that, based on the information available, it had acted appropriately as soon as difficulties became apparent at the company. It began holding talks over the future of MMI in March, after the company approached it to discuss a possible recapitalisation. It said it had been involved in the appointment of Mr Brian Wright as group chief executive and had continued to monitor the company closely since then. The company and the DTI had reached a provisional agreement on its future in July, and accounts were produced including a heavily qualified audit report. The DTI uses the guidelines in the 1982 Insurance Act, which specifies that insurance companies must maintain a certain margin of solvency - or ratio of assets to liabilities. Below the set level, a company must supply an action plan indicating measures it will take to convince the DTI of its ability to continue trading. There are no specific guidelines on what that margin should be. It depends on the level of premiums, income, claims and type of insurance business being written. EC regulations suggest a minimum acceptable solvency margin of 16 per cent. The DTI says that generally it might be content with a company that has a margin at twice that level, but it takes a number of other factors into account when considering the health of a company, including profitability, liquidity and strength of reserving for future claims. If it decides to act, the secretary of state can ask the court to place the company in liquidation. Directors also have that power. The local authorities have called for a scheme of arrangement under company legislation - a court-supervised procedure requiring approval by 75 per cent of the creditors.</p>

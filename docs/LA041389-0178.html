			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: EXHIBITIONISTS HAVE BISTRO'S OPENING NIGHT COVERED  </P> <P> "I could just plaster myself against the wall and fit right in," said a  colorfully dressed Debi Bremner, eyeing an equally colorful painting by Ellen  Schriebman Salk on Monday night.  </P> <P> Spoken like a true Exhibitionist. Bremner, a sartorial standout in a dress  dappled in deep purples and reds, is president of the Exhibitionists, a new  women's council of the Laguna Art Museum.  </P> <P> Monday night marked the coming out party for the new group and for Santa Ana's  newest upscale bistro -- Gustaf Anders, formerly of La Jolla.  </P> <P> "We're in tears -- devastated that Anders has gone," groaned Jeanne Jones, a La  Jollan whose syndicated column "Cook It Light" is devoured by 15 million  readers. (Jones' son, David Beek, is the manager of the sleek new hot spot.)  "But then we decided that Orange County isn't that far away, so get ready to  see a lot of San Diegans and La Jollans up here."  </P> <P> That'll be just fine with Wilhelm Gustaf Magnuson, co-owner (with Ulf Anders  Strandberg) of the Scandinavia-flavored restaurant. "It's strange to have such  a big party and not recognize anyone," said Magnuson, eyes taking in the lively  gathering of about 120 guests. "I'm used to knowing everybody." Well, if Monday  night's fare is any indication, it'll take about one week for Magnuson to be on  an air-kiss basis with locals.  </P> <P> For starters, the affable Magnuson stood behind the zinc-topped bar and helped  guests heap creme fraiche onto golden caviar heaped upon crunchy unleavened  Swedish rye bread.  </P> <P> Then came the bistro's signature gravad lax -- literally, "buried salmon" --  served up with a mustard sauce so tangy it made you wish you had toted along  some Tupperware. Not to mention the complementary wines provided by Robert  Mondavi, a near-and-dear of the owners.  </P> <P> And the dinner. On the please-keep-it-coming menu: cured beef sprinkled with  truffle oil (ooh) and Parmesan cheese; red bell pepper soup with basil  croutons; parsley salad; and Anders' famous fillet of beef in Stilton red wine  sauce with creamed morels.  </P> <P> On the scene: Don and Claudette Shaw (she's museum board president); Kitty and  museum director Charles Desmarais; Anton Segerstom, with his stylish grandmum,  Ruth Segerstrom; Elizabeth and Tom Tierney; Claire and Mac Burt; Marla Bird;  Howard and Anne Cusic (who came up with the name Exhibitionists: "I was being a  wise guy when I mentioned it," she said, "and darned if the board didn't decide  it was a great name. I couldn't talk anybody out of it!"), and Teri and Dr.  John Kennady.  </P> <P> Hat's On to Olive Crest: What a madcap idea! The fine print on the invitation  to Olive Crest Women's Guild's "April in Paris" benefit read: "Please wear a  hat to the fashion event, as a donation will be made for every lady wearing a  chapeau."  </P> <P> Well, you would have thought the Royal Family was holding court at the  Disneyland Hotel on Saturday. Hats -- 300 of them -- in every shape and color  drifted into the ballroom on the perfectly coiffed heads of their chic wearers.  There were black hats sprouting rose gardens. Blue hats sprouting ruffles.  Yellow hats sprouting feathers. Even a rakish beret or two.  </P> <P> "We're getting $9 per hat," said Jodi Ferragamo, guild board member, attending  with husband Vince, the former Los Angeles Rams quarterback. Nordstrom donated  $3 per hat, an anonymous donor threw in another $5, and a Mrs. T. Duncan  Stewart donated $1, said event chairwoman Judi Allen.  </P> <P> Ferragamo, a blond dynamo with a heart-stopping smile, said the women's guild  tapped her on the shoulder 2 years ago, asking her to become involved in the  fight against child abuse via fund-raising for the Olive Crest Treatment  Centers in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> "I have three daughters," she said. "And I can't think of a thing they need.  But on a visit to an Olive Crest home, I met a child who said he just wanted  his 'own pillow.' Can you believe it? Just a pillow. I'm so glad I became  involved. I can't think of a better way to help children."  </P> <P> After a cocktail crush, the 525 guests enjoyed a luncheon and fashion show that  featured summer togs and furs -- an unusual combo, but this was a delightfully  unusual crowd.  </P> <P> Proceeds were $45,000. Also on the committee: Peggy Mandarino, Shirlee Heidler,  Colleen Casciari, Tami Hay, Jill Bull, Sally Rothbart, Kathi Davis, Linda  Hearn, Sylvia Burnett and Carie Mourey. Vince Ferragamo was co-host of the  event with actress Morgan Brittany, who arrived fashionably late with Alana  Stewart.  </P> <P> High Tea and High Hopes: Consider the Latina. "Culturally, she's taught to be  more involved with her role in the family than discovering her potential," said  Irene Martinez during a benefit at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa. "In the  Hispanic culture, the woman is the nucleus of the family."  </P> <P> But if she is helped to discover her talents, if she is encouraged to become  more upwardly mobile, "the whole community benefits," said Martinez, who is  president of the Orange County chapter of the Mexican-American Women's National  Assn. Members met on Sunday for "High Tea and High Fashion."  </P> <P> "For example, 40% of Hispanics drop out of high school," Martinez said, "and  unless we help turn that around, those young people, rather than being  contributors, will take poor-paying jobs and create a whole cycle of concerns  and issues."  </P> <P> The organization was founded in Washington in 1974 to represent the concerns of  Mexican-American women, its mission being to advance their educational, social  and economic standing. The local chapter was established in 1982.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to develop the Hispanic woman's leadership ability so that,  eventually, we can afford to hire an executive director and have office space,"  said Martinez, who added that the local staff is now composed solely of  volunteers.  </P> <P> Proceeds -- $10,000 is hoped for -- will be used for scholarship funds and to  defray costs of running the operation. Clothing designer Angela Palomina was  chairwoman.  </P></p>

He said that Walesa had not the slightest, reservations  towards the Czech republic in connection with its individual  approach towards NATO and the U.S. Partnership programme.    Dobrovsky said that it would depend on the course of  discussion at the working dinner, given by U.S. President Bill  Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's residence, whether or not there  would be a joint statement from talks between the leaders of the  Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and  Poland) and Clinton. He said he expected at least one of the  presidents to make a statement that there is agreement between  all of them as regards fundamental approaches towards the  project.    Dobrovsky declined to answer a question about whether or not  the Czech Republic agrees with a joint standpoint or approach.    He told journalists that, prior to Clinton's departure from  Brussels to Prague, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner had  informed Clinton of his order to NATO staff that its military  representatives immediately begin talks with their Central  European Countries' counterparts on the specification of a  future Partnership For Peace agreement.    Dobrovsky said that it would be up to the Visegrad countries  how quickly they would start fulfilling their ideas of the  Partnership Project. The Czech Republic's idea in this respect  is quite clear, he said, but did not elaborate.    At a press conference after the NATO summit in Brussels on  Tuesday [11 January], Clinton said he would intend to convey to  the leaders of the Visegrad countries in Prague that the  Partnership Project was opening up the possibility for their  becoming NATO members. Clinton said this was a very serious  proposal.</p>

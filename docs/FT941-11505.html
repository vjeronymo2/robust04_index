			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Intelligence official faces Mafia charge The Palermo public prosecutor has asked for Mr Bruno Contrada, the former number three in Italy's domestic intelligence service, to be sent for trial on charges of having links with the Mafia. Mr Contrada, in charge of all intelligence matters relating to the Mafia, was arrested on December 24 1992. Since then the Palermo authorities have turned down all requests for him to be released on bail. Mr Contrada is the most senior public official to be arrested on charges of working with Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia. His arrest was a direct result of information provided by four of the top former members of Cosa Nostra who agreed to co-operate with the authorities  -so-called pentiti. Palermo magistrates regard a successful prosecution of the Contrada case as central to the credibility of the pentiti. The latter have become a key instrument in the Italian state's fight against organised crime and almost 500 are now giving evidence under witness protection programmes. Their evidence has played an important part in the move by Palermo magistrates to incriminate former premier Mr Giulio Andreotti over alleged links with the Mafia. Mr Contrada is alleged to have passed on sensitive information to Cosa Nostra. In particular, he is said to have aided Mr Toto Riina, the boss of Cosa Nostra, captured in January 1993, to avoid arrest. Throughout his detention Mr Contrada has protested his innocence. The request to send him for trial came a day after Palermo magistrates issued 76 arrest warrants in an operation aimed at breaking up the links between Cosa Nostra and their civilian support networks. The arrests, based on information supplied by pentiti, included doctors, lawyers and bank employees. In neighbouring Calabria, the first of a 1,350 military contingent arrived yesterday to boost the security forces in their fight against the local mafia, the 'ndrangheta. On Monday two oficers in the Carabinieri para-military police were seriously injured in Reggio Calabria in what the authorities claim was an assassination attempt by 'ndrangheta gunmen. The weapon used was yesterday identified as the same employed against two Carabinieri who were killed two weeks ago near Reggio Calabria by the 'ndrangheta. These attacks are seen as a violent reply by the 'ndrangheta to increasing police successes against organised crime in the region. But the timing appears linked to the approaching campaign for general elections.</p>

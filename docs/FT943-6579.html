			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Viacom to sell Madison Square Garden for Dollars 1.1bn Viacom, the US entertainment group, has agreed to sell its Madison Square Garden unit to ITT and Cablevision for Dollars 1.075bn (Pounds 690m). The deal, announced yesterday, will provide Viacom with much-needed cash to repay debt acquired earlier this year in its Dollars 10bn takeover of Paramount Communications, the New York-based entertainment group which owned MSG. Since completing the Paramount acquisition, Viacom has been looking for a buyer for MSG, whose operations include the famous Manhattan arena, a cable television sports channel and two professional sports franchises - the New York Knicks basketball franchise and New York Rangers ice hockey. Last year, the unit reported revenues of Dollars 330m, and although Wall Street analysts had valued its operations at about Dollars 700m, Viacom's chairman, Mr Sumner Redstone, would not accept less than Dollars 1bn. ITT, a financial services, product manufacturing and hotels conglomerate, and Cablevision, a Long Island-based cable company, originally bid Dollars 1bn. They later increased their offer by Dollars 75m and the deal was clinched early on Saturday morning. Mr Rank Araskog, chairman of ITT, said yesterday: 'The opportunity to acquire a world class property like Madison Square Garden comes along once in a lifetime, and we were determined it would be ours.' Viacom's acceptance of the ITT and Cablevision bid for MSG ends a protracted auction that at one stage involved several rival bidders, among them Liberty Media, the cable group controlled by cable giant Tele-Communications, Nike, the sports shoe retailer, and the Canadian brewer Labatt. Viacom had hoped to sell the unit to Liberty Media as part of a complicated transaction which would also settle an anti-trust action Viacom filed against Liberty Media's parent, Tele-Communications, during the heated battle for Paramount. However, the companies could not agree terms. Although ITT and Cablevision said that they would each eventually own 50 per cent of MSG, ITT will initially put up Dollars 600m in cash for the deal. Cablevision will contribute Dollars 100m, and the remaining Dollars 375m will be raised from borrowings. ITT has been looking for opportunities to expand further into the leisure and entertainment businesses, while Cablevision already runs one of the country's biggest cable networks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Norman report: "Bank Warns on Interest Rates and </F> Inflation"]    [Text] The Bank of England warned yesterday that it would  increase interest rates if expectations of higher inflation led  to a quickening in the pace of wage and price rises.    In its latest quarterly inflation report, however, it said  the most likely outcome, assuming bank base rates stay at 5.25  percent, would be for underlying inflation to be between 3 and  3.5 percent in two years' time, within the government's target  range of 1-4 percent.    The bank believes underlying inflation, which is measured by  excluding mortgage interest payments from the retail prices  index, will be slightly higher in April, May and June than the  2.4 percent rate in March.    Inflation fell in the first three months of this year  because  of a squeeze on retail margins but is set to rise because of  council tax changes and the imposition of value-added tax on  fuel, both of which took effect in April    Over 1994 as a whole, the bank expects inflation to be  slightly lower than projected in its February inflation report.  But the bank revised upwards its forecast of inflation next  year. It now expects the rate to be flat rather than move  gently downwards.    The bank has revised its expectations of inflation because  of  two factors: February's quarterpoint cut in bank base rates and  a faster than expected increase in average earnings.    "If these (labour cost) pressures are maintained, this could  translate into higher inflation next year," the bank warned.    The bank pinpoints three "small early warning  signs":     -  Rates of monetary growth have continued to  increase. Although this is not a threat to the inflation target  at the moment, a continued increase in the months ahead would  have "more disturbing" implications.    -  Inflation expectations have  risen and are no longer coming down into line with the  target.    -  Average earnings growth accelerated to 3.5 percent in  February from 3 percent in November and may have been higher in  March.    The bank is worried that higher inflation expectations will  trigger higher wage settlements. It said pay developments "will  need to be monitored closely" and urged "adherence to a firm  monetary stance" to reinforce the "fragile" credibility of  Britain's inflation target.    The bank's report leaves the clear impression that it  regards  the February cut in base rates as a mistake. "The rise in gilt  yields after that announcement suggested that the market was  revising its view of the authorities' commitment to monetary  stability," it said.    Responding to the bank's report, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the  chancellor of the exchequer, last night told Channel 4 News he  was "determined to hit the inflation target" and have economic  growth that lasts.</p>

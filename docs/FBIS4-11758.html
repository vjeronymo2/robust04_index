			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Lebanon and the Israeli Traps,"  the newspaper TISHRIN today writes on Israel's continuous  attempts to exacerbate the situation in Lebanon.    TISHRIN says: The Lebanese judiciary investigations have  revealed that Israel was the party responsible for planning the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre with the objective of covering  its continuous crimes and brutal massacres in the occupied Arab  territories, particularly the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    TISHRIN touches on Israel's attempts to restore its  subversive and conspiratorial role in Lebanon by moving the  remnants of its agents to infiltrate into the Lebanese arena and  to storm the march of security and accord.    TISHRIN says: The Lebanon of today is not that of yesterday,  when Israel used to wreak havoc in it, and when Israel used to  believe that by moving its tools in Lebanon, it could guarantee  its free presence in southern Lebanon, dictate its conditions,  and evade the peace requirements and the implementation of UN  Security Council Resolution No. 425, which calls for a full  [Israeli] withdrawal from southern Lebanon.    TISHRIN says: Through its attempts to ignite the situation  in Lebanon, Israel has proven anew that it does not at all like  seeing Lebanon enjoying security and stability. When it plans  to strike at the march of accord in Lebanon by perpetrating  crimes and carrying out aggressions against Lebanese territory,  Israel clearly shows that it is completely hostile to peace and  stability in the region, and that it only seeks to achieve its  hostile and expansionist objectives and to continue its  occupation of southern Lebanon and the other Arab territories.    TISHRIN adds: This is clearly shown by the fact that the  occupation troops are in a continuous state of alert in southern  Lebanon, and by Israel's ceaseless threats to Lebanon to expand  aggressions on its territory, perpetrate massacres against its  citizens, and endanger its sovereignty.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Undoubtedly, the Lebanese  government's determination to impose the supremacy of law on all  sides was received with satisfaction and positive response by  the sons of the Lebanese people, especially since attempts to  involve Lebanon in crimes and bloodshed have been checked once  and for all, and since it has become clear that Lebanon, which  confronted and foiled previous Israeli challenges and plots  resolutely and strongly, is now able to resume the march of  security and peace and to strengthen its internal front.  Lebanon will not go back on its plans to achieve accord, and  the Lebanese people will not allow its enemies, the Israelis,  its agents, or the remnants of militias, to disrupt its  stability or to undermine its national and pan-Arab aspirations.</p>

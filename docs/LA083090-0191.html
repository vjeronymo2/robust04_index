			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NAVY RESERVISTS CHECK IN, BEGIN ADJUSTMENTS  </P> <P> Kimberly Graftenreed, 23, was forced to give up her Hermosa Beach apartment to  cope with the pay cut. San Diego anesthesiologist Winnie Varley-Maneclang, 49,  moved in with her daughter in Orange County to lighten the daily commute. And  Mohan Vallabhapurapu, 35, missed his chance to serve as a line judge in the  U.S. Open tennis tournament, now under way in New York.  </P> <P> They were but three of the 80 Navy reservists who streamed into the Long Beach  Naval Hospital Wednesday morning, duffel bags dangling from their shoulders and  uncertainty etched on their faces. Dressed in gleaming white uniforms, they had  assembled in orderly fashion to help replace 150 doctors, nurses and  technicians who have been deployed in the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> It was a scene that is being repeated in communities across the nation this  week as thousands trade civilian lives for active duty in the largest  mobilization of the selective reserve since the 1961 Berlin crisis. Almost  50,000 military reservists could be called up by Oct. 1, putting their everyday  lives on hold for at least 90 days as the Persian Gulf crisis plays itself out.  </P> <P> The Long Beach reservists, like those elsewhere in the nation, are a diverse  lot. Some will earn as little as $895-a-month base pay; a handful will get more  than $4,000 a month. They range in age from 19 to 55 and come from all walks of  life: a Los Angeles police officer, a real estate agent, a housewife, a nursing  college student, a mail carrier, even an embalming assistant from the Los  Angeles County coroner's office.  </P> <P> "To say that your appearance here this morning has been greatly anticipated and  much appreciated is the height of understatement," said the hospital's  commanding officer, Capt. F.G. Sanford, as he greeted the erstwhile "weekend  warriors" who assembled in an auditorium at 7:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Most agree that the mobilization will have a dramatic impact on their lives,  forcing them to make sacrifices in finances, short-term goals, and in some  cases, housing or hairstyles. But they add that these are adjustments that they  are prepared -- in most cases, quite willingly -- to make.  </P> <P> Graftenreed, a pharmaceuticals buyer for the Thrifty Corp., said she had been  planning to spend last weekend watching a pro volleyball championship on the  shores of the Pacific, within walking distance of her apartment. After  receiving a 4 a.m. call-up telephone call last Saturday, she spent her time  scurrying for cheaper housing, settling finally for an inland apartment that  she will share with a fellow reservist.  </P> <P> "The base pay doesn't even cover my rent in Hermosa," explained Graftenreed,  who flipped through a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine during slow moments of the  orientation. "But patriotically speaking, I feel real good."  </P> <P> Wednesday's session began with a long round of bureaucratic form-filling.  Laughter permeated the auditorium only once -- when a young ensign asked the  new charges to check off a box indicating whether they had been activated for  duty or shown up on their own.  </P> <P> Next, the reservists received mixed news from Master Chief Phillip Dozier,  whose responsibilities include morale and welfare.  </P> <P> Addressing "the quality of life issue," Dozier announced that tickets will be  made available to Disneyland and Dodgers games. But, he added, "eccentric  haircuts" are out.  </P> <P> Brian Stringer, 23, a Cal State Long Beach nursing student with a modified  pompadour, cringed at the latter announcement. "I guess that means I am going  to be going to the barber," he said later. "It's just one of those things."  </P> <P> In the modern day, equal-opportunity Navy, Kellie Hosch was facing a similar  problem. Last week, she had gone to a Beverly Hills salon for a spiky hairdo.  "I have a faddish hairstyle. Now I'll have to comb it out like a geek," she  laughed.  </P> <P> Other concerns centered on substance rather than style.  </P> <P> During a brief question-and-answer session, Los Angeles Police Officer Lanita  Elias, 23, asked Navy officials whether she can temporarily defer paying bills  because of the large pay cut she is facing. "That, unfortunately, will be the  lending institutions' call," came the unsettling reply.  </P> <P> For the next three months, the reservists, most of whom are members of the Long  Beach-based Navy Hospital Reserve Unit 119, will assist in the hospital's  operating room, orthopedics unit and outpatient clinics, Sanford said. In  recent days, non-emergency services have been scaled back as seven physicians  and more than 140 nurses and technicians have departed to participate in  Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> Thus far, Varley-Maneclang is the only doctor among those activated to serve at  the Long Beach hospital.  </P> <P> "This creates a lot of disturbance and disruption of your regular life," she  said. "But this is what we're trained for."  </P> <P> A former Navy officer, the Filipino-born physician is currently a staff  anesthesiologist at Kaiser Medical Center in San Diego, where she says she  earns $10,000 a month. As a reservist, she will earn less than half that  amount.  </P> <P> But Varley-Maneclang seemed less concerned Wednesday about her pay cut than  about her new living arrangements -- having temporarily traded life with her  husband in San Diego for life with her 23-year-old daughter, who lives in La  Palma.  </P> <P> "My daughter doesn't like the idea of my being her roommate," Varley-Maneclang  smiled. "That's because I have rules."  </P> <P> A handful of reservists who are reporting to Long Beach from Sacramento, Dallas  and Memphis will need temporary housing in barracks, Sanford said. But members  of the Long Beach unit -- at least those who can afford to -- will continue  living in their homes, and in certain cases may even receive permission to  moonlight to help make ends meet.  </P> <P> For a lucky few, including David Bookrum, the call-up will result in little  disruption.  </P> <P> Bookrum, the senior enlisted adviser of Reserve Unit 119, already works at Long  Beach Naval Hospital as a civilian risk manager.  </P> <P> "It will be pretty much the same," he said. "Except now when I get up, I will  be putting on a uniform rather than a shirt and tie."  </P></p>

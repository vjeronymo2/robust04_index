			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from roundup of ITAR-TASS reports: "Navigation </F> Opened on Volga"]    [Text] The opening of navigation for 1994 has taken place  in Nizhniy Novgorod.    After a band had played marches and welcoming speeches had  been delivered the first diesel ship, the Dobrynya Nikitich, set  off for Astrakhan with fleet veterans on board. Specialists  predict that this year's navigation will be difficult:  Inflation is growing and the number of those who want to sail  along the Volga is declining. To make ends meet the sailors  intend as before to rent out some of the ships as floating  hotels.    Will this affect livestock raising? Most probably not. If  only because the livestock population in Russia has been reduced  by approximately 25 percent and in some places by even 30  percent.    This year there is no need to be worried about seed. There  is plenty, and in some places there is even a surplus. This is  largely explained by the high cost of seed -- many farms and  private farmers simply cannot afford them which, of course, will  also entail a reduction in sown areas.    As a whole there is no problem with fuel and lubricants  either, although in individual oblasts, for instance Novosibirsk  Oblast, drivers are refueling direct from the tanker trucks.  And that is impermissible.    It cannot be said that the farms and private farmers have  money to carry out the spring field work. Although credits for  April were issued in full, in the opinion of the Ministry of  Agriculture they are blatantly inadequate. So the question of  the issue of May credits is on the agenda.</p>

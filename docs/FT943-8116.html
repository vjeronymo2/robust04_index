			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Russian brokers fight to fend off tax police Russian stockbrokers yesterday were engaged in a fierce battle to block a draft law which would give the tax police regulatory control over the stock market and give the government the right to discriminate against foreign investment banks. The draft legislation, prepared by the Finance Ministry, is part of the state's broader inclination to react to the pyramid schemes spreading throughout Russia with strong-arm tactics which brokers fear 'won't kill the market but could seriously jeopardise its development'. The struggle over stock market regulation is one battle in the war between free market proponents of greater economic liberalisation and those forces in the government which still back strong central control. Russia's immature but increasingly robust stock market is straining to absorb a sharp increase in foreign and domestic investment which began earlier this year and saw trading worth Rbs1,000 billion (Pounds 310m at the market rate) in July. Growing investor interest is a hopeful sign that Russia's massive privatisation drive is beginning to pay rich dividends but it is a development with which the fledgling stock market, currently regulated by four separate government institutions and a contradictory thicket of legislation, is ill-equipped to cope. Brokers say the Finance Ministry's draft law, which they describe as a 'hasty and ill-prepared' reaction to mounting problems most vividly exemplified by the MMM investment fund crisis, would make matters worse. The draft law would give the tax police, the branch of the ministry which orchestrated the dramatic armed raid on the president of the MMM pyramid scheme earlier this month, a direct role in regulating the stock market. It would also open the door to explicit government discrimination against foreign investment institutions. However, in a sign that Russia's emerging capitalists are beginning to play an effective role in shaping public policy, Moscow brokers this week have been waging a fierce but covert battle to prevent the draft legislation becoming law. They have quietly lobbied officials from the cabinet, president's office and state privatisation agency and have written a letter to Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister, which is scheduled to be published in a leading Russian business newspaper over the weekend. 'This is an effort by the government to turn off the taps of commerce and to control the financial markets,' Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy chairman of the state privatisation committee said. 'It is very dangerous.' For stockbrokers, the draft law embodies their worst fears about the possible government reaction to the collapse of MMM, which became a cause celebre in Russia earlier this month. When the pyramid began to crumble, brokers, who have formed self-regulatory associations throughout Russia, urged the government not react to the crisis by tightening government control. Instead, they are lobbying the Kremlin to introduce a US-style self-regulatory system and to recognise that over-the-counter trading, already the dominant form in Russia, is increasingly becoming the norm in the west and should be accepted here as well.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Abbey National buys HMC for Pounds 56.3m Abbey National, the banking group, has bought Household Mortgage Corporation, the UK's largest centralised mortgage lender, in an agreed cash offer of Pounds 56.3m. The move gives Abbey a new method of distributing mortgages to set alongside the sales it makes through its branch network, while its credit rating should give HMC access to funds more cheaply. HMC has outstanding mortgages of about Pounds 1.6bn, giving it about 0.4 per cent of the total outstanding UK mortgage market. Like other centralised lenders, HMC has no branches, and business is passed to it through independent professional advisers such as lawyers and accountants. It has 28,000 customers and has developed some complex and sophisticated home loans. It will continue to operate in this way as part of the Abbey National group, and will maintain a separate brand name as an ongoing business. This makes yesterday's agreement different from other recent deals in which mainstream mortgage lenders have bought loan books from lenders who entered the UK housing market in the 1980s and no longer see it as central to their business. Abbey's purchase in February of the Pounds 900m mortgage book of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, is among the most conspicuous examples of that trend. Mr Maxwell Packe, HMC managing director, insisted that Abbey's bid was 'the best offer, taking all factors into account'. All the shareholders had approved its acceptance, he said. Mr Packe and a few other senior colleagues will receive bonuses for staying with the organisation for a few years after the sale. HMC made profits of Pounds 4m in the four months to July, but like other centralised lenders has suffered in the UK housing recession. Last year it reported a profit of just Pounds 700,000. Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said the margins in this specialised area of mortgage business were wider than in the very competitive mass market for home loans. Abbey's strong credit position would also enable it to generate funds more cheaply and so run the business more profitably, he said. Holders of HMC's 3.1m former preference shares will receive 535p in cash for each share - more than the 398p price for each of the 10.8m ordinary shares, to reflect the value of preference dividends which were not paid. The deal should be completed before the end of this month.</p>

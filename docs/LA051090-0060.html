			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS BALLOT MEASURES;  </P> <P> LONELY PROP. 120 FOES SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO NEW PRISONS  </P> <P> In this busy primary election season, Emma Childers, a lobbyist for the Friends  Committee on Legislation, has to be one of the loneliest people around.  </P> <P> She has some allies, to be sure, in her fight to defeat Proposition 120, the  $450-million prison bond issue on the June 5 ballot. But her phone isn't  exactly ringing off the hook.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Gov. George Deukmejian and members of the Legislature who  put Proposition 120 on the ballot have history and what seems like the  unshakeable support of California voters on their side.  </P> <P> Speaking last week to 1,100 people attending a luncheon of the California  Federation of Republican Women, Deukmejian ran down a list of propositions he  wanted GOP women to vote for and failed to mention the prison bond measure.  Probably because he knew he didn't have to.  </P> <P> Voters have never rejected a prison bond issue. The last one, an $817-million  bond issue in the November, 1988, election, passed with 60% of the vote.  </P> <P> Mervin Field, who runs the California Poll, said, "We haven't seen any  weakening in the public's desire to put 'em away, or, if they are guilty of  brutal, heinous crimes, to execute them. The public is in a very punitive mood.  They are for more and more incarceration. Those are very strong feelings."  </P> <P> But that does not deter Childers, whose Quaker group has opposed other prison  construction bond issues.  </P> <P> She and other opponents of Proposition 120 are firmly convinced that the money  being used to build more prisons could be better spent on rehabilitation and  drug treatment.  </P> <P> To the degree that there is any kind of debate over Proposition 120, it centers  on the question of whether alternatives to incarceration should be pursued, an  issue that takes on a measure of urgency because of the huge numbers of  prisoners entering the state penal system.  </P> <P> When the primary ballot was put together earlier this year, there were 88,000  prisoners in the state's 19 correctional facilities. By April, the number of  inmates had grown to 90,813. And the state Department of Corrections estimates  that by 1995 there will be 153,370 adults in California's prisons.  </P> <P> All those prisoners will need to be housed somewhere, and that is what  Proposition 120 is all about. Of the $450 million it is designed to raise, $194  million will go for a 2,200-bed prison being built in north Imperial County.  The rest will go to buy land and construct, remodel or maintain various other  youth and adult correctional facilities.  </P> <P> Most of the increased prison population has come since Deukmejian, one of the  sponsors of Proposition 120, took office in 1983. When he was sworn in, there  were 34,640 prisoners.  </P> <P> Under Deukmejian -- the father of the state's death penalty law and supporter  of the numerous new laws to stiffen sentences that are said to have triggered  the huge jump in the prison population -- construction of six prisons has been  completed, major expansions were undertaken on six others, and ground has been  broken or plans drawn up for nine more.  </P> <P> Still on tap, for future bond issues, are two prisons in Los Angeles County,  others in Wasco and Delano, a women's prison in Madera County near Chowchilla,  a second prison in Imperial County and one in Coalinga.  </P> <P> State officials figure that even if Proposition 120 is approved, the prison  system will need at least $4 billion more over the next five years to keep up  with increases in inmate populations. Since 1980, the Legislature has asked  voters to approve $3 billion in prison construction bonds.  </P> <P> The most recent figures show that most of the growth in inmate populations has  been in the area of nonviolent crimes, such as theft of property and  drug-related offenses.  </P> <P> As of the end of 1989, 41.8% of those in state prisons were there for violent  crimes; 28% for crimes against property, such as burglary or car theft; 25.6%  for drug-related offenses, such as possession for sale, and the remaining 4.5%  for such things as parole violation, arson or driving under the influence.  </P> <P> The characteristics of the prison population have changed substantially since  Deukmejian took office. At that time, 61.7% of all prisoners were there for  violent crimes and only 6.2% were doing time for drug-related offenses. The  other categories were about the same as they are now.  </P> <P> Childers points to the figures and says: "We oppose more prison construction as  long as we have more than half of the people in prison today there for  nonviolent offenses. They could be in community correction centers that would  cost less money."  </P> <P> She argues that whether the prisoners are violent or nonviolent, most suffer  from alcohol or drug addiction and that the drugs played some role in their  crimes. "All these drug addicts should be treated. It doesn't make sense to put  them in prison and then let them come right out with their same addictions.  They only end up right back in prison. There are numerous alternatives to  prisons that are less costly and more effective to reducing recidivism," she  said.  </P> <P> Supporting one of her arguments is a study by the state legislative analyst  published in February that found that "76% of state prison inmates have a  history of substance abuse." The analyst quoted a U.S. Department of Justice  study of county prisons that produced estimates that 48% of convicted persons  had used alcohol before committing their crimes.  </P> <P> During the 1989-90 state budget year, the analyst estimated that the state  spent $500 million, or about one-quarter of the Department of Corrections'  budget of $2 billion, incarcerating drug offenders in state prisons. In  contrast, the state spent only $1.5 million on treatment programs for inmates.  </P> <P> There are signs that lawmakers are listening to such arguments, although the  trend toward building more prisons is expected to continue in the near future.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), the chief legislative sponsor of Proposition  120, said, "We are trying to figure out ways to put more nonviolent offenders  in community-based programs. I agree that we don't have to house some of these  people in expensive state prison cells. On the other hand, as the population of  California keeps growing -- some estimates are that we will be growing by  700,000 to 750,000 persons a year -- we know that a large number of those  people are going to be involved in criminal activity."  </P> <P> In the November general election, Presley, the governor and others are going to  ask voters to approve a second $450-million prison construction bond measure.  </P></p>

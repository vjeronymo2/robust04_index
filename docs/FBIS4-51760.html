			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have narrowed their  differences enough to allow an inspection team to arrive in  Pyongyang as early as this week, sources here said.    A letter sent by the agency Monday is expected to be their  last communication, and the IAEA inspectors should be able to  fly to North Korea as soon as Pyongyang responds, they said.    The two sides have been wrangling over the scope of the  inspection of North Korea's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor.  Scrutinizing the reactor's fuel rods would allow the U.N.  nuclear watchdog to trace Pyongyang's secretive nuclear weapons  program and estimate how much plutonium it has.    The sources said the IAEA is unlikely to conduct the  inspections required to trace the program's history. However,  the agency has compromised by agreeing to let North Korea seal  the materials under IAEA monitoring for future inspection and  analysis.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 SEEK 3 SEATS IN CULVER CITY SCHOOLS RACE;  </P> <P> LACK OF OPPONENTS PRECLUDES ELECTION IN BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> Culver City voters are likely to see a low-key school board campaign this fall,  and, for the first time in many years, Beverly Hills voters will see none at  all.  </P> <P> Because Beverly Hills school board incumbents Fred Stern and Dana Tomarken face  no opponents, the Los Angeles County registrar will issue letters stating that  there is no need to hold an election, officials said Thursday. The deadline for  filing was Friday.  </P> <P> Stern, an investment banker who was first elected in 1981, said he was somewhat  surprised at the lack of competition.  </P> <P> "I just assumed there were a number of people in the community who identify  with a quality school system and would like to be a part" of setting school  policy, he said. Stern speculated that the lack of challengers might be because  there is "possibly no boiling issue upon which to differentiate themselves from  board members that are running. The board members pretty much reflect the  feeling in the community."  </P> <P> Tomarken said she was thrilled to automatically get another four-year term.  "Campaigning is a tedious process, a tedious task," she said. "It's tedious to  get to the end. . . . I'm indeed pleased I don't have to go through that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Save $26,000  </P> <P> District officials said it is the first time there won't be an election in  recent history. Mary Ellen Figueroa, director of fiscal services, said the  district will save $26,000 by not having to hold an election.  </P> <P> Mark Egerman, a former board member, agreed that the situation was unusual, but  added: "If either (incumbent had) decided not to run, I think you would see  quite a few people (running)." Egerman, chairman of the nonprofit Beverly Hills  Education Foundation, which raises money for the district, said Stern and  Tomarken are "well respected in the community."  </P> <P> In Culver City, board incumbents Bob Knopf and Julie Lugo Cerra and challengers  Jim Quirarte and Thomas J. Supple are running for three seats to be filled by  the top vote-getters in the Nov. 7 election. Two-term member Kay Lyou decided  not to seek reelection, mainly because her house near Elenda Street is to be  moved this fall so that the city can widen the street.  </P> <P> "Campaigning under those circumstances, I thought, would be a little  difficult," said Lyou, 59, a free-lance editor of dissertations. She said she  also needed a "breather. . . . I need to read a book that's not necessarily on  education."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Accomplishments  </P> <P> Looking back on her accomplishments on the board, Lyou said she was proud of  helping to establish a health center that serves Culver City Middle and High  schools, and of a J. Paul Getty Museum program that teaches art to elementary  school students. She said she will continue to work with the district to start  a program to help teen-age mothers stay in school.  </P> <P> Cerra, elected in 1985, and Knopf, elected in 1981, both said they would run on  their records of being accessible.  </P> <P> Cerra, a consultant, said the district has to continue planning for the future  and renovating the schools. She said the curricula must arm students with  skills in English, reading, math, problem-solving and critical thinking so that  they can be adaptable.  </P> <P> "Society is changing so much," she said. "Kids today will not go into an  occupation . . . and stay there throughout their work life. They'll need to  change their occupations."  </P> <P> Cerra, who belongs to the booster club of Culver City High School and the  Culver City Historical Society, said she plans to run a low-key campaign.  </P> <P> Knopf pointed to the district's technology training center and before-school  and after-school child care as the top accomplishments of the board during his  two terms. He said the district has to concentrate more on the "top 10% and  bottom 10%" students, not just the average ones.  </P> <P> The Hughes Aircraft Corp. engineer said he hopes to run his campaign on less  than $1,000. "I plan on doing a lot of walking," Knopf said.  </P> <P> Quirarte, who ran unsuccessfully for the board in 1987, is on the district's  strategic planning committee. His priorities include increased communication  with the community and a back-to-basics curricula. "This school generation is  going to be the generation that takes care of me," Quirarte said. "I want them  to be prepared to work in the global economy."  </P> <P> He said that when employees at a bank recently misfiled some of his documents,  they told him: "What do you expect? We're Culver High grads."  </P> <P> "So they're not proud of it," Quirarte said.  </P> <P> Quirarte, 44, who is in the jukebox and vending machine leasing business, is a  former director of Culver City High School's booster club and a former  president of the Culver City Jaycees. He said he had no criticisms of the  school board, calling it "cohesive."  </P> <P> Supple, a software engineer, has been on an advisory committee to the student  health clinic. He could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

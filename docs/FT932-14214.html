			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK water group in deal with Malaysia MALAYSIA has reached preliminary agreement with a consortium of local businesses and Britain's North West Water to build and operate a national sewerage scheme costing between MDollars 5bn (Pounds 1.27bn) and MDollars 6.3bn. Malaysia's cabinet is understood to have approved the project in principal in mid-February and the two sides are now negotiating terms and conditions. Mr Bob Thian, North West Water's chief executive, said he hoped final agreement would be reached by the end of the year. The consortium plans to build, upgrade and operate sewerage systems in more than 40 cities and towns throughout Malaysia. The agreement covers a 28-year period and involves modernising existing waste water systems and building new facilities. North West Water said it will take a 25 per cent stake in the consortium. If the contract is approved, North West will manage the project and operate the sewerage systems. Berjaya, one of Malaysia's leading conglomerates, will hold a 20 per cent stake while Aims Worldwide, another Malaysian company, will take a 15 per cent stake. Malaysia's armed forces retirement fund and police force investment co-operative will each hold 20 per cent. North West has won a string of similar deals in recent months, including a Pounds 160m waste water contract in Bangkok, Thailand. However, some observers said they were surprised North West's partners had no track record in water projects. Berjaya is controlled by Mr Vincent Tan, one of the country's most controversial businessmen, while Aims Worldwide is controlled by Mr Ghazi Ramli, an executive director of the Berjaya group. Both men are believed to have close connections with Malaysia's political leaders but analysts say Mr Tan's company has no proven experience of handling such a large and complex project. Most of the financing for the project will come from syndicated loans, while the consortium will also negotiate for a MDollars 500m low-interest loan from the government. The consortium's total equity investment is not likely to exceed Pounds 40m. Mr Thian said North West would not guarantee any of the debt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hideaki Kumano, administrative vice minister of  international trade and industry, expressed deep concern 14  February about the recent steep rise in the yen's value. He  said: "I am greatly concerned about the impact of the yen's  appreciation on the economy. The economic recession has lasted  for four years. However, the economy -- far from being  revitalized for the first time in four years -- will be cooled  down by the recent strong yen."    Vice Minister Kumano pointed out: "The yen's appreciation  will largely worsen profits of export-oriented companies. In  the short-term the exchange rate will have a negative impact on  people's incomes rather than a favorable effect on commodity  prices."    He stressed that if economic conditions in Japan  deteriorated  further due to growing pressure for the yen to appreciate, it  would have an unfavorable effect on the world economy as well as  on the Japanese economy.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Counting on the only sure poll winner: There's money in supplying voting equipment THERE is one safe bet in the US presidential election today, but his name appears on no ballot paper. Mr PE 'Bill' Esping will be a winner, no matter who wins the White House. This Dallas businessman is chairman of Business Records Corporation Holdings, the largest supplier of voting equipment and services in the US. Others may be complaining about the weakness of the US economy but, for Mr Esping, 1992 is a boom year. 'If anybody makes money out of this election, I will,' he says, while acknowledging that the election business is 'very cyclical'. About half of the millions of US citizens who go to the polls today will cast their votes via equipment supplied by Business Records, Mr Esping estimates. Only about 7 per cent of US voters still put a cross by the name of their chosen candidate in the traditional way, according to the Federal Elections Commission in Washington. The vast majority uses some form of automated voting system. This explains how votes are counted so rapidly. 'In the US we have been driven to automation by the huge numbers of voters. There is no way that we could count them all by hand,' says an FEC official. 'And, unlike other countries, we announce results without delay or ceremony.' Counting votes is a new venture for Mr Esping. In 1970 he founded First Data Resources which grew to become the largest US processor of credit card accounts before being acquired, in 1985, by American Express. Three years later he invested Dollars 10m in Business Records, then called Cronus Industries, when it was close to bankruptcy. This year, he says, the company will record revenues of about Dollars 85m, its highest. Yet the voting equipment used in some parts of the US is far from high-tech. About one third of US voters, most of them in the south and mid-west, still cast their votes on antiquated machines that date back to the 1950s, pulling levers to register their choice. Speedometer-style dials keep running totals of votes throughout polling day. But, if one of these machines breaks down  -as several did at Durham, North Carolina, two years ago  - there is no way to determine how many votes have been lost or miscounted. If the voter turn-out today is unusually high, as has been predicted, there may well be problems in regions that still use ageing systems. To replace these mechanical monsters is bread and butter business to Business Records. In San Mateo County, California, for example, today voters will vote electronically for the first time, using optical scan equipment from the Dallas company. Like close to 20 per cent of voters throughout the US, San Mateo's electorate will receive ballots that look like multiple-choice exam papers, with the instruction to pencil in the dot next to the candidates of their choice. Voters simply feed their completed ballots into an optical scan reader - one per polling station  - to record their votes. The ballot papers provide an audit trail in case of any hitches. Votes are tallied throughout the day and recorded on a computer tape. When the polls close the tapes are transported to a central computer facility where they are totalled. San Mateo is, however, the last Californian county to convert to computerised voting methods. Elsewhere in the state, and in many other parts of the US, the most commonly used voting method is the Votomatic computer punch card. This was invented in 1962 by a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley. The Votomatic records votes by punching holes in a computer card. The cards are then transported from polling stations to a computer card reader for counting. In the 1960s, punch cards were the standard method to record computer data. They have long since been replaced by magnetic media and now few companies can service the equipment or supply the computer cards. One of them, though, is Business Records, which acquired the original Californian manufacturer of the Votomatic machine. Only about 3 per cent of US voters now use 'direct recording' computerised voting systems, in which they press buttons to record votes electronically. Fears that computer programmes might be rigged or that the computers might malfunction have limited their use, despite manufacturers' claims that it is easier to bribe an electoral official than to tamper with a computer. The state of New Mexico, however, is experimenting with a 'vote by phone' system, devised by Octel Communications, a Californian voice mail systems manufacturer. Rather than travel to polling stations, voters can record their votes by phone. Some see this as the future direction of voting technology in the US. Mr Esping maintains, however, that Business Records' optical scanning systems represent the predominant trend in such technology for the next 10 years. There's another way he will be saying it's not 'time for a change'  - Mr Esping's vote will go to President George Bush.</p>

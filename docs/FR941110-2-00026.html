			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with NSK. We verified that NSK had no loans for the period 1980 through 1982 and agree that NSK's credit costs are the opportunity costs of late payment, and therefore, properly captured using the average interest rates on short-term deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 20: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Timken maintains that Koyo's conclusion that 50 percent of its inland freight costs are direct and 50 percent are indirect is an unsupported estimate of pre-sale and post-sale inland freight expense and, therefore, should be rejected in its entirety, or, at a minimum, all of Koyo's inland freight expenses should be considered as indirect selling expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo counters that there is no evidence that its reported freight expenses are inaccurate or unreliable. Koyo states that the Department verified the accuracy of its freight expense amount, and that the Department's practice of treating pre-sale and post-sale inland freight as direct selling expenses renders the amount of the allocation between the two types of expenses immaterial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although Koyo requested that we deduct pre-sale inland freight as direct selling expenses from FMV, it allocated total freight expenses into direct and indirect categories in its submission. Koyo contends that it did not distinguish post-sale and pre-sale freight expenses in its records at that time and, therefore, allocated half of the expenses to warehouse transfers and half to direct inland freight. We verified the accuracy of Koyo's total freight expenses and accept Koyo's allocation of these expenses as the best estimate possible given the lack of specificity of Koyo's records at the time. Therefore, we have continued to accept Koyo's allocation of direct and indirect home-market freight expenses in these final results, treating 50 percent of total freight expenses as pre-sale freight (an indirect selling expense) and 50 percent as post-sale freight (a direct selling expense deduction from FMV).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 21: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Timken contends that the Department should deduct a reasonable profit amount from ESP. Timken concedes that the statute is silent on this question, but states that there is broad international understanding that reseller profits should be deducted in ESP-type situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK argues that the Department has consistently rejected Timken's argument, and has been sustained by the CIT. Therefore, the Department's treatment of profit is in accordance with the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo believes that Timken's argument should be rejected not only because there is no statutory basis for deducting profit from ESP, but Timken's interpretation of the statute would require a fundamental change in a well-established Department practice. According to Koyo, section 772(e) of the Tariff Act directs that, for purposes of calculating ESP, the price shall be reduced by the amount of ``commissions for selling in the United States the particular merchandise under consideration.'' Koyo asserts that the Department (and, prior to 1980, the Department of the Treasury), interprets this provision literally ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that ``commission'' does not include ``profit''), citing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timken II <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timken Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 630 F.Supp. 1327, 17783&hyph;44 (CIT 1986). Koyo concludes that there is no basis upon which to overturn the Department's decision not to deduct profits from ESP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with Koyo and NSK. Sections 772(d) and (e) of the Tariff Act do not include resale profits among the detailed list of adjustments that the Department is authorized to make to USP in ESP situations. Thus, there is no provision in the statute by which we can make the adjustment that Timken requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 22: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Timken points out that the Department, in several recent administrative reviews, rejected Koyo's U.S. discount data because they were aggregated, rather than transaction-specific. Timken states that aggregated discounts or price adjustments are unreliable for purposes of antidumping analysis. Timken cites  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AFBs III <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , wherein the Department rejected Koyo's U.S. discounts and sales allowances because Koyo did not report them on a transaction-specific basis. In that review, Timken asserts that the Department assigned to Koyo, as BIA, the highest percentage discount or sales allowance of any U.S. sale to all sales that received a discount or sales allowance. Timken believes the Department should be consistent with its approach in AFBs III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, Timken maintains that the Department should not grant any adjustment for upward PSPAs to USP given that Koyo's claim is based on averages of price adjustments and discounts on in-scope and out-of-scope merchandise rather than transaction-specific price adjustments and discounts on in-scope merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo contends that the application of BIA for U.S. discounts would be inappropriate for these reviews because BIA is normally reserved for situations in which a respondent fails to comply with an information request from the Department. Koyo cites  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Olympic Adhesives <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 899 F.2d 1565, 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990), in support of its contention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this instance, according to Koyo, the Department never informed Koyo that the methodology Koyo used in 1991 for reporting U.S. discounts and sales allowances would no longer satisfy the Department's new standard in the more recent final results of review the Department published for TRBs and AFBs in 1993. Thus, Koyo concludes that it would be extremely unfair for the Department to reject Koyo's claimed U.S. discounts at this late stage of these long-delayed reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

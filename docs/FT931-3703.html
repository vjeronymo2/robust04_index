			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: IRI in L340bn funding deal with telecoms unit AN INCREASINGLY serious financial crisis is forcing IRI, the principal Italian state holding company, to squeeze funds for the second time in five months from Stet, the cash-rich subsidiary controlling its telecommunications holdings. In an unprecedented move, IRI has reached provisional agreement to cede to Stet for three years the dividend on 440m shares held in Comit, the commercial bank. Stet would in turn pay L340bn (Dollars 215m) in advance to IRI at the rate of an average annual return of 23 per cent from the Comit shares. The return on income has been computed to include a complex system of tax breaks. The deal has yet to be formally approved by both parties but leaked details were later confirmed by IRI. Indeed, Stet management has already begun to defend what promises to be a controversial arrangement at a time when the group needs heavy investment, and is due to see IRI's 53 per cent controlling stake privatised. IRI was already criticised last October for selling off to Stet for L671bn control of Finsiel, its main software company. Despite both sides claiming the sale represented a match of synergies, analysts believed it was a means of IRI obtaining cash through the sale of Finsiel shares at an advantageous price. This reasoning led to an immediate 23 per cent fall in Stet shares which only recovered after an extensive damage limitation exercise by the management. The latest arrangement bears all the hallmarks of dire necessity. IRI management has suffered two major setbacks recently. The privatisation process has proved slower than expected with deals such as the sale of its foodstuffs and supermarket group, Sme, and its banking assets being behind schedule. More important, estimates of 1992 losses in Ilva, its steel arm, and in Iritecna, civil engineering, have increased almost five times to total L3,900bn. While these losses need to be covered, IRI is also having to meet obligations on its consolidated debt totalling L70,000bn. The combination of these two elements is putting enormous strain on IRI's financial resources, producing expedients like the proposal to cede dividends rights in Comit to Stet. Over the weekend critics argued that the Stet deal would not even ease the problems of Ilva and Iritecna losses. Stet itself has to demonstrate its investments plans will not be affected by the cash hand-out to IRI. The Stet case appears to rest largely on being able to take advantage of take breaks on the deal. In 1991 ENI, the state oil concern, a little noticed move ceded to a value of lire 475bn dividend rights in its subsidiary Snam, to Agip its exploration and production arm.</p>

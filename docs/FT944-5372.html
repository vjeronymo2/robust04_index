			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (19): Quicker deals will help to reduce risk Brokers used to do it at the end of every two or three weeks. Since the summer, they have needed to do it after spells of 10 days. In a few months they will be required to do it every five days. They now are governed by rolling settlement on the stock market. It began in July, and means that shares have to he delivered and paid for 10 days after the original deal is struck. This is the first phase of London's part in an international drive for the reduction of settlement times, and therefore risk, in equity markets. Its next move, in June, will be to a five-day settlement period. This will prove far more of a leap than the 10-day move from the old account system, and is already viewed with some caution in the market. Ten-day settlement replaces two- and three-week trading accounts with settlement taking place seven days after the end of those accounts. On a typical two-week account, if a deal was struck on the first day of the account, there would be three weeks before settlement had to be made. Conversely, if a deal was struck on the last day of the account, then there would be just a week until settlement. The Stock Exchange says that the 10-day stage was chosen as a mean average of the possibilities under the previous accounts. Rolling settlement means that every day is a settlement day for someone in the market, unlike the old system of 24 days on which everyone made their settlements. Some investors have found that the generally speedier execution - and penalties incurred from late action - has increased the attractions of conducting investments via nominee accounts held at stockbrokers. In such accounts, shares are registered in the name of the broker's nominee company rather than the investor, thus enabling faster transactions. Under 10-day settlement, it is not too difficult for a client to post share certificates to his broker for delivery. It will not be as easy to do this under five-day settlement. A five-day time-frame, however, runs hard up against three-day cheque-clearance periods and possible postal delays. Rolling settlement may now be well on course to roll faster, but it is not unavoidable. As with anything in the market, investors can call their own tunes if they are prepared to pay. At present, settlement may be made later than 10 days, but the marketmakers do widen their price spreads to reflect increased risk, and later settlement is a more costly exercise. Risk reduction was one of the prime reasons for the introduction of rolling settlement, with the possibility of failed trades lessened by a shorter transaction time. The other main impetus was the internationalisation of securities dealing. The UK agreed in 1989 to introducerolling settlement, and so put in place a similar framework to that in other leading financial centres. It was responding to a call for swifter settlement in equity trading by the G30, the Washington-based study group. Although the mechanics of settlement vary between countries, the US operates rolling settlement on a five-day basis; Japan on three days; France on three days; and Germany on two days. The UK is aiming eventually for three-day settlement, but that is dependent on the operation of paperless share-trading, which is some way off.</p>

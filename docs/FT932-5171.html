			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Major seeks to placate right: PM aims to avoid tax rises and vows - 'I am here and I am staying' MR JOHN MAJOR signalled yesterday that the government would aim for spending cuts rather than tax increases in the November Budget in an effort to placate the disgruntled right of the Conservative party. He scorned suggestions that his premiership was threatened with a crisis of confidence, but acknowledged that the government faced tougher times ahead. Dismissing reports that a collapse in the government's support had left him tired and depressed, he told the Conservative Women's conference in London: 'I am fit, I am well. I am here and I am staying.' Mr Major's insistence that he would not quit followed a Gallup survey showing him to be the most unpopular British prime minister since polling began more than 50 years ago. But he launched a broadside against the criticism he has faced in the press: 'What I am tired and weary of is gossip dressed up as news, malice dressed up as comment and fiction reported as fact.' His speech drew a warm, if less than ecstatic, reception. But the unpopularity of some of the government's policies, even among its own supporters, was underlined later by the rough ride given to Mr John Patten, education secretary. Mr Patten - jeered earlier this week at a conference of head teachers - was sharply criticised by representatives over his confrontation with teachers on school tests. Mr Major's comments were calculated to calm criticism from his party's right wing since he made Mr Kenneth Clarke chancellor of the exchequer in place of Mr Norman Lamont. Dropping his more customary 'heart of Europe' rhetoric, Mr Major took a swipe at Brussels. He said Britain would continue the political and legal fight against the directive passed this week stipulating a 48-hour working week. Mr Major warned that the government would veto another European Commission proposal to introduce compulsory works councils in all businesses with more than 1,000 employees. Amid fears on the right that the centrist Mr Clarke may be ready to raise income taxes to curb the government's huge borrowing requirement, Mr Major gave a clear signal that the new chancellor would instead focus on cutting public spending. In the March Budget, the government had set out a clear strategy covering the next three years to increase revenue. Mr Major went on: 'The main task now is to keep a firm grip on public spending to help bring the books towards balance.' He went out of his way to reaffirm the government's medium to long-term aim of further income tax cuts. Pinning his political future on hopes that economic recovery is gathering pace, Mr Major committed the government to 'policies that will sustain the recovery - low taxes on larger profits and more incomes with more people in work'. In spite of threats from the anti-Maastricht right of the Tory party that a defeat in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election might prompt an autumn challenge to his leadership, Mr Major said there was no short cut to increased popularity. Acknowledging that attempts to contain public spending would provide fertile ground for opposition 'scare' stories, he insisted that the government would stick to its principles whatever the short-term cost: 'We have persistence. What we start out we complete - however tough the prospects may be.' Referring to the forecasts of doom that had preceded last year's general election victory, he added: 'It would have been easy to give up then but we didn't. We didn't do it then. We haven't done it since. And we are not going to do it now.' Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, described the speech as the 'same tired old dirge - no changes on policy despite the mishandled changes in his government'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'He is pursuing policies which are deeply unpopular in the country, with the Tory party desperately - some say terminally - divided.'

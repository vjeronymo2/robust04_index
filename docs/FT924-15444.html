			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Madrid considers interest rate rise SPAIN may be forced to raise its official interest rate from 13 per cent this week to match demand for higher yields on the public debt it needs to issue to raise by the end of the year about Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in new deficit financing. The Treasury failed to attract buyers at its auction of debt last week, and both the government and the Bank of Spain appear disposed to use an interest rate increase - possibly today - to offset a relaxation of a series of unpopular capital controls it imposed nearly two weeks ago to stabilise the peseta. It is still possible that Madrid will wait to see whether the bond markets continue to insist on higher yields, but Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, conceded in an interview on Friday that the need to finance Spain's deficits could drive up official interest rates. 'We are prepared to accept (an increase) if that is what the market dictates,' he said. Foreign investors reacted to the imposition of exchange controls by staging a massive exodus from the Spanish debt and equity markets. The general index at the Madrid stock market ended last week at its lowest level in six years. Both Mr Solchaga and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insisted in interviews last week that the controls were temporary. Other senior officials were suggesting on Friday that they would be relaxed 'in a matter of days'. Madrid, though, will not lift the controls completely. It would want any rate rise to be seen as a response to bond market pressure and not an attempt to defend the peseta. If the latter were the case, the Spanish authorities fear being drawn into a speculative spiral similar to the one which forced sterling out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Nevertheless, it might use a 'technical' interest rate rise to test market reaction, while holding a minimum of capital controls in reserve in case downward pressure on the peseta continues.

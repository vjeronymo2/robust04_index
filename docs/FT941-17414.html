			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Danes clean up at home with state subsidy Denmark is to subsidise businesses supplying domestic staff by about Pounds 6 an hour, in a radical effort to reactivate a labour market hit by high taxes. Danish consumers of personal services, such as domestic cleaning, cooking and gardening, have largely turned to the black market, because of high income taxes and a 25 per cent value added tax, the highest in the European Union. Income taxes are due to fall this year, but only from 68 to 62 per cent at the top end, and from 53 to 44 per cent for the lowest bracket. Such rates have put domestic services, on which VAT is charged, out of the reach of most families, with an hour of domestic cleaning costing the equivalent of three hours of net pay for an average wage earner. At the same time, the Danish government - battling with a 12.4 per cent unemployment rate - believes consumer services is one of the main areas in which jobs could be created. If every household bought two hours of domestic services a week, the government says, this would produce 10,000 full-time jobs. This would be a small dent in Denmark's 350,000-strong dole queue, but a start. The subsidy, to be paid to businesses supplying domestic services, will amount to DKr65 an hour. This compares with black-market rates for domestic services of DKr50-60 an hour and legal rates ranging from DKr90 to two or three times that figure. So far about 1,600 companies, mostly one or two-person businesses, have registered for the scheme. It will run for an initial three years, with a budget of DKr1bn for 1994. The government hopes that the real cost to the exchequer will be relatively small, however, as tax-paying service staff replace their black market counterparts. Businesses are complaining the subsidy is not big enough. 'The idea is great, but we cannot supply a service of the standard we aim to supply with a subsidy of only DKr65', said Mr Knud Reckweg of ISS, the Danish international cleaning group.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Souvenir hunters lift Nadir sale SOUVENIR hunters were out in force yesterday as the personal belongings of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, were auctioned. The sale of contents of Mr Nadir's London home in Eaton Place, Belgravia, brought in a total of Pounds 73,309 - three times more than the bankruptcy trustees had expected. Christies, the London auction house, had predicted that the sale would realise up to Pounds 30,000 with its combination of 19th-century fine art and 1990s kitchenware. The highest price was paid for a set of eight Turkish military portraits. An anonymous buyer from Istanbul bid Pounds 9,900. Most lots were more modest. Four scatter cushions embroidered AN were purchased for Pounds 38.50. Also for sale were two washing machines, a hair dryer and an electric kettle. A selection of video tapes which sold for Pounds 77 included the titles The Wrong Arm of the Law, and Lock Up, Sylvestor Stallone's prison film. Mr Mark Simmons, an advertising executive, said he had come to the sale out of curiosity and because he needed a television. Mr Nadir's home contained several televisions, three of them bought by Mr Simmons for Pounds 83. There was fiercer competition for Mr Nadir's hi-fi system, which finally sold for Pounds 935. The last item of the sale was a gold watch, the confiscation of which prompted MP Mr Michael Mates to send a replacement, famously inscribed: 'Don't let the buggers get you down'. Mr Mates's watch cost Pounds 20. The original sold yesterday for Pounds 1,540. Mr Michael Bowkett, a City scaffolding contractor, paid Pounds 418 for Mr Nadir's gold Jean D'Eve 'Sectora' dress watch with a dedication from his son Birol: 'To Dad, happy birthday, time flies, always use it to the full. Love you very much.' Mr Bowkett said: 'I thought it would be nice to have something of Nadir's' Mr Kareem Osmani, a private investigator, paid Pounds 88 for one lot which included an engraved hip flask, ash trays and cigars. He described the hip flask as 'a nice novelty'. Mr Ramadan Shekerzade, of Haringey, north London, became the proud owner of Mr Nadir's books, which included Asil Nadir and the Rise and Fall of Polly Peck. He said: 'My relatives worked for him in Cyprus. My parents have land next to him.' Mr Nadir's bankruptcy trustees said they were very pleased with the sale. The auctioneer, Mr Jim Collingridge, deputy chairman at Christies, said afterwards: 'There were a lot of strange bids, a lot of people not used to salerooms, but the prices were tremendous. Some things were silly money compared to what you can normally buy on these occasions.'</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Canary Wharf faces TV claim Residents of London's Docklands have been given leave to take court action against the owners of Canary Wharf on the grounds that the capital's tallest office block interfered with their reception of television pictures for more than two years. Judge Richard Havery QC, a High Court official referee, ruled yesterday that the Pounds 1.5m damages claim could go ahead. He said individuals were entitled to have their rights to interference-free viewing protected by the courts. But he ordered that the full hearing of the residents' case be stayed to give Canary Wharf Ltd the opportunity to appeal against yesterday's decision. The residents claim that the building of the 790ft tower caused the loss of their television programmes between 1989 and 1992. Ms Sally Moore, solicitor for the 680 residents who launched the action, said the ruling superseded a 1965 court decision that television interference was not an actionable nuisance because television was purely for recreational purposes and was not important enough to have the protection of the courts. The court rejected an argument by Canary Wharf that the government's scheme to encourage redevelopment in Docklands had provided a defence to the residents' action.</p>

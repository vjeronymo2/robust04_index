			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Granada and LWT may meet this week London Weekend Television and Granada may meet this week to see if agreement can be reached to end the hostile takeover confrontation between the two. On Saturday Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman of Granada which has made a hostile bid worth around Pounds 650m for LWT, telephoned Sir Christopher Bland, LWT chairman, proposing weekend talks. The LWT executive suggested talks would be better after publication of LWT's final defence document, due after Friday's clearance of the Granada bid by the Department of Trade and Industry. In a circular to shareholders LWT said January advertising revenue reached Pounds 14.8m, a rise of 10 per cent on last year, viewing figures rose by 5 per cent and GMTV, the commercial breakfast station in which LWT has a 20 per cent stake, was expected to move into profit this year. 'LWT has made an impressive start to the year and we believe the group's prospects remain excellent,' Sir Christopher said. Granada chief executive Mr Gerry Robinson replied that all of ITV had a good month in January. It is unclear how much room there is for talks. LWT would see a 200p a share improvement in the Granada offer, at present worth around 700p, as a minimum for recommending a deal. Granada would regard that as wildly unrealistic although it is considering sweetening its offer.</p>

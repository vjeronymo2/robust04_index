			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Hanson to attend Labour seminar The Hanson conglomerate, Marks and Spencer and National Westminster Bank are among scores of blue-chip companies and trade associations that will attend a ground-breaking Labour seminar in Brussels that is likely to make a sizeable contribution to the party's fighting fund for the next general election. Conference organisers said almost 100 organisations had booked places at the event, entitled Labour Working in Europe, which will be held on January 10. Other organisations that will be at the seminar include media group News International and the Chemical Industries Association trade body. The extent of corporate interest in the Pounds 500-a-head event is being seen as a further boost to Labour's attempts to be taken seriously by the business community. The Chemical Industries Association said yesterday: 'We are interested in meeting leading figures in all political parties. We are looking forward to an interesting and useful seminar.' One conference organiser said Labour's profit from the event - to be attended by more than half the party's 62 MEPs - was likely to be tens of thousands of pounds. Labour claims the seminar will be the biggest event yet organised by a British political party in Brussels. Mr Wayne David, leader of Labour's MEPs, said the conference was designed to establish 'close working links' between business and the party at a European level. Labour plans to follow up the seminar with regional events in the spring in Scotland, Wales and England.</p>

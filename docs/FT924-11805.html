			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Anglo American lifts quarterly gold earnings by 10.3% ANGLO American, the world's largest gold producer, lifted attributable profits at its gold operations by 10.3 per cent to R152.8m (Dollars 52.5m) in the September quarter, from R138.5m in the three months to June. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division, attributed the improved performance to 'good production results and some savvy hedging'. Gold production at the five mines in the group rose to 65,105kg from 63,590kg, and the average revenue per kg of gold during the quarter was 0.7 per cent higher at R33,031 per kg compared with R32,786 per kg - well above the spot price for bullion, which was closer to R30,000 per kg. Commenting on the performance of Freegold, Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director of the division, said that, although gold produced rose slightly to 28,257kg from 28,059kg, the mine remained marginal: a 1 per cent increase in revenues and a 3 per cent increase in costs produced a 9 per cent fall in working profit. Attributable profit fell slightly to R60m from R61.8m. He stressed, though, that the mine was in much better shape than 18 months ago, when more than 50 per cent of its 24 shafts were not covering costs. Vaal Reefs had a steady quarter, with production constant at 18,870kg. Attributable profits rose to R53.5m from R48.6m. Mr Hewitt said the mine was well placed to increase future production capacity. Earlier in the week, shaft sinking started at the new R1.7bn Moab project, an extension to the Vaal Reefs lease area. Western Deep Levels recovered partially from its recent difficulties to push production up by 10 per cent to 9,985kg from 9,096kg, but Anglo said the mine had further to go before it regained the 1991 annualised production level of 41 tonnes. Attributable profits rose to R18.6m from R10.9m. Elandsrand benefited from improved grades to produce a record 4,832kg against 4,582kg and attributable profits rose to R15.7m from R12.1m.</p>

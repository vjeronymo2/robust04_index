			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Steps on road to openness OPEN government proposals are likely to add to the list of recent landmark legislation which opens up new categories of records - in this case health and safety records - to individual scrutiny. Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, said that the document was 'another step along the road giving new statutory rights of access to personal records held by public authorities'. The starting point in civil liberty legislation is the Data Protection Act 1984, which gives people the right to see the records held about them on computer in both public and private sector institutions. This was followed by the Access to Personal Files Act 1987 which opens the files held by local authorities relating to social services and housing tenancies. The next step forward was the Access to Medical Records Act 1988, which provides access to medical reports written for insurance and employment purposes. The Official Secrets Act 1989 then repealed some of the catch-all provisions preventing civil servants revealing public information. Shortly after, the Access to Personal Files Act 1990 gave access to selected records held by housing and social services authorities. In the same year, the Access to Health Records Act provided access to manual health records in addition to the automated ones opened up previously by the DPA. On top of this, individual government departments are expected under the Citizen's Charter to give the public the information they need. In most cases they discharge this duty by publishing explanatory leaflets and newsletters for public consumption. Other parts of the public sector publish fuller annual reports, setting out performance against commitments or bulletins on efficiency and punctuality.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> ARAB SHOOTS ISRAELI OFFICER  </P> <P> An Israeli army officer in the occupied Gaza Strip was shot and wounded when an  Arab gunman opened fire from a passing car. An Arab newspaper vendor was killed  in the gunfire, an army spokesman said. The attack marked a rare use of  firearms against the Israeli army in the 18-month-old Arab uprising. In the  West Bank, Israeli troops shot and killed two Arab youths in separate  incidents, and an Israeli from the settlement of Ariel was found stabbed to  death. The Israeli Cabinet, meanwhile, outlawed three fundamentalist Muslim  groups -- the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hezbollah (Party of God) and Islamic  Jihad.  </P></p>

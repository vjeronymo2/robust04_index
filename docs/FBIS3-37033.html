A  meeting between Viktor Chernomyrdin and the leaders of the trade  union is planned for the next few days.    Understanding how difficult the situation is, the chairman  of  the government appeals to the heads and workforces of oblast  radio and TV relay centers to continue work in accordance with  the radio and TV broadcasting schedules.    Nevertheless, we continue receiving reports from the regions  on TV and radio broadcasting being cut. In Murmansk,  Kandalaksha, Zapolyarnyy, and Kirovsk only Russian Television  programs will be broadcast. On the instruction of the head of  the Tomsk Radio and TV Center, broadcasting of the All-Russian  TV and Radio Company has been halted and only news bulletins go  on the air. The situation in Buryatia is similar. More than  one-third of Russia's transmitters are not operating at all or  are operating only partially. Such major TV and radio centers  like the Chita, Novosibirsk, Yuzhnosakhalinsk, and Kamchatka  ones are not operating at all.    Volgograd's communication workers have reported that only  because of severe frost has broadcasting not been switched there.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLEGED ALIEN SMUGGLERS KIDNAP 2 CHILDREN  </P> <P> A couple allegedly kidnaped two children on a Los Angeles street corner Sunday  when their mother failed to come up with the money she owed them for smuggling  the two across the Mexican border, police said.  </P> <P> Officers said the unidentified man and woman snatched 9-year-old Nasario  Morales and his 11-year-old sister, Maria, at about 10:30 a.m. from the corner  of 23rd and Los Angeles streets.  </P> <P> "This is basically a coyote caper," Officer Richard Monfils said, referring to  the term often used to describe alien smugglers. "They brought the kids in from  Mexico, they didn't get paid, and so they snatched the kids."  </P> <P> Monfils said advisories have been issued to the Border Patrol, the Immigration  and Naturalization Service and to law enforcement officials throughout Los  Angeles and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> The children's mother, Ernestina Cruz Bautista, apparently owed the couple  about $500 for smuggling the children into the country two days ago, Monfils  said.  </P> <P> She went to the street corner Sunday morning to meet with the couple, who upon  learning that she did not have the payment, snatched the children when she was  not looking.  </P> <P> The kidnapers fled with the children in an older model orange Chevrolet van,  Monfils said. The officer said the van is windowless on its right side and has  a green primer spot near its rear license plate. A possible plate number is 448  DJR.  </P> <P> The children, who have brown hair and eyes, were both wearing jeans and black  slip-on shoes, Monfils said.  </P> <P> Nasario, described as 3 feet, 11 inches tall and weighing 90 pounds, was  wearing a a blue pullover shirt, while his sister, who is 4 feet, 6 inches and  weighs 100 pounds, had on a blue and orange print, short-sleeved flowered  shirt. She wears her hair in a ponytail.  </P></p>

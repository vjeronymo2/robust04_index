			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Ten years on, the fallout from Bhopal remains: Gordon Cramb returns to the site in India of the world's worst industrial disaster People are our most important assets - their safety and health our greatest responsibility. Occupational injuries and illnesses and accidental property losses are preventable. It is the primary responsibility of line management to define, initiate and maintain actions to prevent such injuries, illnesses and property losses. Good safety and accident prevention practices are good business. It seemed the very model of a modern multinational. In 1984, releasing that statement of safety principles, Union Carbide of the US was celebrating its golden jubilee in India, where it produced pesticides and Eveready batteries. But 10 years ago tonight a tank ruptured, and with it the faith of hundreds of millions of Indians in the superiority of western technology. From its facility in the central city Bhopal, a cloud of poison gas enveloped citizens asleep in the surrounding slums, killing thousands in the world's worst industrial disaster. A decade on, with the flow of foreign direct investment into the country doubling year by year, that faith is being rebuilt. The mothballed Union Carbide pesticide plant is meanwhile being dismantled. After years of wrangling, progress is starting to be made in compensating the victims. Special courts are hearing applications from those injured and who now suffer lung, eye or nerve disorders or a form of cancer, and from families who lost their breadwinner. Union Carbide's sequestered 51 per cent stake in its local offshoot, which has continued to operate from its other Indian sites, was last month sold to a local business house, and from the funds a hospital is to be built in Bhopal. But few are happy. Campaigning groups argue among themselves for the right to represent the afflicted. Allegations abound of corruption among medical and legal workers, who are said routinely to charge a percentage of any award for processing the documents which claimants need. Research to monitor patients with long-term ailments has been neither systematic nor co-ordinated. In the absence of postmortem examination reports, the death toll for the disaster remains in dispute, with estimates ranging from 1,800 in its earliest days to one unofficial total of 25,000. Mr Alok Pratap Singh of the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front, who was a volunteer relief worker that night, says 7,000 coffins were supplied by Bhopal businesses, with more bodies cremated in shrouds or cast into the river. He says the effects of the leak of methyl isocyanate, an intermediate product which erupted when it came into contact with water, were 'like Hiroshima'. 'But that was war, not an economic interest. Here a multinational corporation was involved. Now many multinationals are seeking a future in India.' The private sector is too protected against actions in the Indian courts, he maintains. In 1989 Carbide paid Dollars 470m, (Pounds 287m) less than expected, to settle all the civil suits it faced. Criminal proceedings remain in abeyance. Mr Justice A G Qureshi, the high court judge who is overseeing the 600,000 compensation hearings which started three years later and are taking place at more than 30 courts, says he proposes to finish in another three years, although he adds: 'Nobody believes it.' About 150 people a day form a huddle outside his windowless office to stake their claim. Women in faded floral saris help grizzled old men down the steps after police with rifles turn them away. Campaigners say the judge has established a needlessly legalistic and adversarial procedure; inside, he counters that 'it's a messy job' with many spurious applications. He has already approved more than 110,000 awards totalling Rs3bn-plus (Pounds 60m). Compensation ranges from Rs25,000 to Rs400,000 per case - large sums for those who until now have been receiving just Rs200 a month in government allowances. The sale of the shareholding in Union Carbide India to McLeod Russel, part of a Calcutta tea empire, will raise Rs2.9bn. Among a small number of other potential buyers was thought to have been Ralston Purina, the US food-based group which in 1986 took over Union Carbide's battery operations elsewhere in the world. What went wrong that night has never been established. The Connecticut-based company still maintains that the cause was sabotage by a disgruntled employee who put water in the tank unaware of what the full consequences would be, but it stops short of naming him. Many Bhopal residents allege that Carbide cut corners, storing an unstable compound rather than converting it directly into a less toxic final product. Similar plants elsewhere in the world have been adapted to minimise the risk of exposure to water. India has meanwhile enacted an environmental protection law, but concerns remain that it is inadequately enforced. New sites, particularly investments from abroad, receive close scrutiny, but older domestic plants release waste daily into the Ganges. Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh state, is itself now a relatively prosperous city by Indian standards, in part because of compensation payments but also because the state government has for the past few years striven to attract inward investment. Mr Digvijay Singh, chief minister, says money can never fully recompense lost lives but adds: 'Union Carbide is a multinational operating all over the world. One shouldn't judge its performance because of one accident.' That degree of magnanimity will go down well among potential investors as well as at Union Carbide's Danbury headquarters, which will fly its flags at half mast tomorrow. Mr Robert Berzok, a Carbide director, says the tragedy 'served as a catalyst for enormous change' at the company, which no longer makes agrichemicals. The main lessons he offers for the chemicals industry worldwide: better dialogue with local communities, and continued improvements to operational procedures. If nothing else, Bhopal showed that a safety manifesto, however nobly phrased, is not enough.</p>

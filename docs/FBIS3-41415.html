The coordinating committee will meet regularly to develop a  national strategy to maintain biodiversity domestically and  overseas.    It will also discuss proposals to take to the first  conference of countries which are parties to the treaty  scheduled for November.    That conference will consider ways to fund developing  countries' efforts to maintain biodiversity as well as consider  policy on the transfer of biotechnology.    The treaty, which came into effect last year, was drawn up  at  the United Nations-sponsored earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in  June, 1992. Forty-nine countries have signed the treaty.    Policy measures developed by the committee will be combined  with measures adopted at the November conference for  incorporation in an overall national strategy by the end of the  year.    The treaty covers the protection of endangered species,  access to biological resources for commercial use, and the  maintenance of the world's species' genetic pool.</p>

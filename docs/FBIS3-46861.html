"Now that the European Community has formed the single  market, Thailand considers Morocco as the gateway to the EC  market," the new Ambassador Narong Khemayothin said.    "It will also be the springboard to African countries," he  told reporters yesterday.    Morocco and Thailand established diplomatic ties in 1985.  Narong said establishing the embassy in Rabat would help  tighten bilateral relations and later help to increase economic  cooperation. Thailand currently has a trade surplus with the  North African kingdom. In 1992, Morocco bought Bt [baht] 213  million worth of Thai rubber, textiles, equipment parts and  thread for fishing nets, while its exports of canned fish and  anchovy, as well as cotton, to Thailand was valued at Bt79  million.    "The trade value is not yet high but we see Morocco as a  potential production base for fisheries, textiles, as well as  tourism," the ambassador said. He said Thai investors should  consider investing in Morocco as there was little foreign  investment there now.    "There will not be fierce competition as there was only  US$500 million worth of foreign investment in Morocco in 1992,"  he said. Most of that came from Spain, South Korea and China.    According to Narong, Morocco has an unlimited quota for its  textiles from the EU [European Union] market, which could  benefit Thai businesses if their products were manufactured  there.    Narong said the embassy was expected to be operating next  month as soon as Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan is  available to officially host the opening ceremony.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Equality scheme stuck at the top OPPORTUNITY 2000, the business-led campaign to improve the position of women at work, has gained the backing of chief executives but is often failing to get through to lower levels of the workforce, it was disclosed yesterday The initiative, launched a year ago by Mr John Major, the prime minister, covers nearly a quarter of the workforce and involves 141 companies, most of them household names. Members set their own goals for the recruitment and advancement of women but have to agree to them being independently monitored. Research into progress by the companies over the first 12 months was unveiled yesterday. The research was carried out by Ashridge Management College and Business in the Community, the business-led umbrella organisation responsible for Opportunity 2000. It found that nearly 80 per cent of chief executives of participating companies had taken an active and public role in sponsoring the initiative within their organisations. Line managers were often ill-informed, however, and fewer than half had specific targets for their sections of the business. Lady Howe, who chairs Opportunity 2000, said there was evidence that 'the messages are not getting down the line'. She said renewed efforts should be made to involve divisions, departments and line managers in setting goals. Lady Howe said about a third of campaign members had included numerical goals for the employment and promotion of women in their action plans. Companies reporting back on the previous 12 months included London Weekend Television, which said it had increased the proportion of women it employed from 36 per cent to 39 per cent and those in management jobs from 40 per cent to 45 per cent. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said Opportunity 2000 had caught 'the tide of public opinion' but that celebrations should be tempered with realism. 'Women are faced not just with glass ceilings but glass walls, too,' she said. She announced a series of 'opportunity shops', starting with a pilot scheme in Manchester, which would tour the country next year. They would provide a showcase of 'opportunities available to women, spanning the whole range from career options to . . . voluntary work'. Management, Page 14</p>

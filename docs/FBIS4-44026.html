			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vittoria Sivo: "Ovation for Cofferati: CGIL Has </F> Its New Leader"]    [Text] The CGIL's Chianciano assembly has chosen a new  secretary. The minister of finance previewed for the assembly  the contents of the tax reform bill.    Chianciano--Sergio Cofferati will be the new general  secretary of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor].  The applause he received at the end of his long speech, at eight  o'clock in the evening, was worth more than a simple investiture  to the man who, at the end of the month, will now clearly take  Bruno Trentin's place. It was a spontaneous election that  reduces to a pure formality the official election that, within  approximately one week, will involve the 200 members of the CGIL  leadership. Defeated at the very outset, therefore, although  without dishonor, was Alfiero Grandi, who represents the more  leftward-leaning wing of the Confederation. The brief and rather  cold clapping of hands he received from the thousand-plus  leaders and delegates of the CGIL conveyed not even a passing  grade to Grandi and to his speech of yesterday, laced as it was  with belligerence. There can be no doubt that the CGIL assembly  prefers to be represented by Cofferati, a prudent and pragmatic  negotiator with a reputation as a moderate, rather than by the  more impetuous and inflexible Grandi.    Thus, by the end of its second day, the major Italian labor  confederation's platform conference had changed into certainties  the vague suppositions that had been floating in the air. All  that remain for today are Bruno Trentin's concluding remarks--a  true-to-form farewell waltz after six years spent as the CGIL's  leader--to bring to a close a chapter of union history.  <H5>  First Steps Toward Employment </H5>   If the conference's evening session was enlivened by the  Grandi-Cofferati "tournament" (with the reporters furious at the  organizers' sadism), the morning meeting was energized by the  presence of Giulio Tremonti, the Berlusconi government's finance  minister, who was the sole representative of the government to  accept Trentin's invitation. Labor Minister Mastella preferred  to decline.    Although the applause that followed Tremonti's remarks was  barely within the bounds of politeness, there were no hisses.  Incidentally, while Tremonti patiently awaited his turn, Claudio  Sabatini, leader of the metalworkers union, thundered against  Berlusconi, referring to him as a "ham actor."    Despite even Tremonti's explicit assurances that he intended  to structure the tax reform bill with the participation and  cooperation of the opposition and the unions, the hostility of  the CGIL rank and file toward the government as its "enemy" did  not abate.    The minister provided no advance information on the  mechanisms that will be used to bring about "a new system that  is simpler and less unfair than the present one" in Italy. He  touched briefly on the possibility that the next Council of  Ministers will launch the first measures designed to favor  businesses that increase the number of employees, then gave a  lecture on the philosophy that will inspire the reform. "It will  be a constitutional change," said the minister, "one that will  involve parliament, and that therefore cannot but involve the  opposition and the social partners." After all, in tax matters,  many elements that are "identical in substance" can be found in  the platforms of the various parties. In brief, as in all the  Western democracies, the Berlusconi government is determined to  not proceed, in tax matters, on the basis of forcing the will of  the majority upon the minority.    The cornerstones of the reform are those for which Tremonti  has long been pressing: a gradual shifting of taxation from the  central government to the regions, from direct to indirect  taxes, from the complex to the simple. "There is no hope of  restructuring the system--he stressed--if the circuitousness of  itemized taxation is not broken. The issue is finding a balance  between benefits and sacrifices. Meanwhile, the national  taxation system will have to remain in place to enable the state  to continue functioning."    The issues of the CGIL leadership succession and of its  relations with the new government turned out to be tightly  interwoven. One after the other, Grandi and Cofferati outlined  diametrically opposed approaches with respect to the new team at  Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister].    Not by happenstance did Grandi advocate a profound future  distrust of any agreement modeled on the 23 July 1993 accord  signed with the Ciampi administration. Grandi expressed the hope  that this agreement, the fruit of a compromise dictated by  emergency, "should it collapse, will collapse to the left and  not to the right." Cofferati, on the other hand, pressed the  view that the famous entente of a year ago is vital to labor:  "It is a guarantee of our right to negotiate."    The two contenders argued on different wavelengths. Alfiero  Grandi defined the present government as a "videocracy" with  which labor cannot but clash: "Let us gird for battle. Without a  shift in policy we will not make it"; and "Any thought of fair  play is unrealistic." And to those who might argue that his is a  prejudicial attitude, he would reply that "The first measures  instituted by Berlusconi immediately dashed what frankly had  been unfounded hopes to begin with"; and that "it is impossible  not to be concerned when the budget minister is the likes of  Pagliarini."    Without directly challenging Grandi by name at any time,  Sergio Cofferati rebutted his antagonist's speech point by  point. And as his own speech progressed, the audience--or at  least the majority of the listeners--seemed increasingly  relieved at the grit their favorite candidate was displaying.  This time there was no self-consciousness on his part, but a  pressing delivery with clear proposals, even at the risk of  arousing a measure of unpopularity.    "We can envision a clash with the government, but not on  abstract demands. It must be on the issue of a policy consistent  with the need to restore public finances on a sound footing." In  Cofferati's opinion austerity must not be abandoned, even with  respect to the reduction in working hours.    Cofferati deemed the policy on working hours to be crucial,  but he very decidedly opposed a demand that "would presume to  dump the entire cost of this operation on the state." "We would  not be credible," he repeated.  <H5>  Labor Unity Relaunched </H5>   In his view, the model to be followed is that of the  Volkswagen union agreement, "based on a pact that, in a moment  of crisis, management makes with labor organizations." In order  to avoid thousands of layoffs, the labor unions had the courage  to accept a reduction in wages. Similarly, in Italy, according  to Cofferati, to avoid a break in the pact between generations,  future productivity dividends must not be converted in their  entirety into wage increases--the maintaining of real wages is  sufficient--but rather channeled into the creation of new jobs.    Appreciable differences between the two participants in this  duel were noted with respect to another important issue, namely,  labor unity. A debate on "when" is reductive; it is better by  far, according to Cofferati, to begin immediately the process of  unifying the CGIL with the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade  Unions], and the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions]  because "no single confederation, alone, can succeed in  attaining the objectives set forth by Bruno Trentin."    Concluding his remarks, Cofferati turned to Trentin with an  appeal, that he continue making his "irreplaceable contribution"  to the CGIL in whatever manner he thinks best. And of his  internal opponents he asked that they not allow their right of  dissent to compromise "the transparency, the respect, and the  solidarity of the leadership group."</p>

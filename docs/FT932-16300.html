			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium industry warned of smelter shortage WARNINGS THAT a lack of new primary aluminium smelting capacity will leave the aluminium supply-demand balance extremely tight by 1996, forcing prices up to unusually high levels, have come from two experienced industry observers. Both suggest that the industry and its financial backers will want to see aluminium prices at about 75 cents a lb (USDollars 1,653 a tonne) for a sustained period before giving the go-ahead for any big expansion in capacity. It would then take about three years to get a smelter into full production. Three-month aluminium closed yesterday on the London Metal Exchange off Dollars 6.25 at Dollars 1,141 per tonne, a 14 1/2 month low. Mr Stewart Spector, of the New York-based Spector Report consultancy organisation, points out that the industry plans no new primary smelting capacity before 1996. At the end of 1992 western world capacity was 16m tonnes, up nearly 4 per cent from the 15.3m tonnes at the end of the previous year. Planned modernisation of existing smelters, offset to some extent by scheduled closures, could boost capacity to 16.1m tonnes by 1995 - an increase of only 0.6 per cent in two years. Mr Spector says 1.8m tonnes of new capacity is planned for completion between 1996 and 1998. 'However, until the supply-demand, pricing and profit outlook improves, only South Africa's new 466,000-tonne smelter (Alusaf's at Richards Bay) is likely to be built.' China has several new projects under various stages of construction but many are behind schedule and, 'as the Chinese economy expands and integrates itself with the rest of the world, they could close many of their smaller, inefficient smelters. These small smelters currently account for about one-third of China's installed capacity of 1m tonnes,' says Mr Spector in his annual survey of aluminium capacity and expansion plans. The industry's present problems stem from very low prices caused by a sudden surge in imports from the former Soviet Union and the failure of the western producers to cut output quickly enough, the two observers point out. Mr Tony Bird of the UK-based Anthony Bird Associates consultancy organisation, suggests that the flow from Russia will dry up eventually. He estimates that Russian costs at present average only 24.5 cents a lb compared with the western average of 54 cents. 'But this will change dramatically when Russian plants pay true economic prices for their inputs and their natural inefficiency shows through,' he adds. 'In time Russian costs will rise to 82 cents in constant 1992 money and all but one or two smelters will be uncompetitive on western markets.' Mr Bird estimates aluminium consumption during the 1990-2003 period will grow at an average 3.2 per cent a year, in line with industrial production growth. But 'growth will come in bursts, rather than in a steady stream, thanks to the fluctuations in prices which lie ahead.' He suggests, in Bird's latest aluminium annual review, that consumption growth will be rapid in 1995-1996 and then be checked for a time by rising aluminium prices before moving ahead faster again from 1999 onwards. In contrast, aluminium companies at present plan increases in primary smelter capacity of only 1.2 per cent a year - 'quite inadequate to provide for likely growth in demand, the need to retire more uneconomic plants and the coming collapse in net exports from the former Soviet Union.' Mr Bird adds: 'The rate of new smelter construction will have to be revised upwards sharply. And that will not of course happen unless prices recover substantially.'

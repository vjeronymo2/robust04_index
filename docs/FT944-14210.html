			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Zurich - Other Markets Sandoz rounds off the big three pharmaceutical stocks' nine-month reporting season tomorrow when it is expected to report consolidated sales increasing to SFr11.7bn from SFr11.5bn a year earlier. Turnover is expected to rise by about 7 per cent in local currency terms, with the strength of the Swiss franc cutting the advance in francs. Shares in Ciba and Roche have both been under pressure after their nine-month figures, with the strong franc depressing Ciba's outcome rather more than had been expected and restructuring costs at Roche leading to some earnings downgrades.

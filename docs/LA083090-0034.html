			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> EFFORT TO BAR POKER CASINO  </P> <P> A broad coalition of civic leaders in West Hollywood has formed a campaign  committee to defeat Proposition AA on the November ballot -- the measure that  would allow a large card casino to be built in the city.  </P> <P> The committee, Residents Against the West Hollywood Poker Casino, includes all  five City Council members, gay community activists, homeowners association  officials and business leaders.  </P> <P> The proposition is the only ballot measure in West Hollywood on the November  ballot.  </P> <P> Proponents of the gambling club contend that it could generate between $5  million and $10 million annually for the city, roughly 10% of the club's  estimated gross revenues.  </P> <P> To make the measure more appealing to the city's 20,000 registered voter, the  initiative requires the city to earmark three-fourths of its revenues for the  elderly, increased law enforcement, gay and lesbian services and the  revitalization of the city's east end, where the club would be located.  </P> <P> Opponents of the measure say the casino is out of place and far out of scale  for West Hollywood.  </P> <P> "Our primary concern is preserving our special quality of life," Mayor John  Heilman said in a prepared statement. "No matter where a 200-table casino would  be built, the impact would be felt throughout our tiny community."  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Technology: Consultant's critique The software industry has only recently moved towards the formalisation of testing and, more importantly, the automation of test procedures. Standard Chartered Bank has recognised that thorough testing is essential in any financial institution. The cost of errors can be astronomical. The bank's approach is heartening to the professional developer. It has recognised that testing is a valuable asset. The past performance of a program is a useful yardstick to compare with the current behaviour. It has also made a clear decision to 'stick with the knitting'. Since Standard Chartered is not a software house it wisely devolves the risks and costs of software development to the vendors. In doing so, it gives up some level of customisation and tailoring. On the other hand, it is free to change suppliers if service is not acceptable. Phil Reed, IT manager, concentrates on ensuring that the packages fit the business. Interestingly, he states categorically that operational methods must be changed to fit the software. I would only agree up to a point. Much software is poorly designed - especially on mainframe systems. It is often written by programmers who have no understanding of the business. To let them dictate the day-to-day running of a multi-million pound business seems a little risky. The bundling of IT with strategic planning and personnel is unusual. Hopefully it reflects that recognition of the links rather than a rag-bag of jobs that no one else on the board wanted. Reed has wisely avoided the snare of all-in-one systems and has looked at the best way of achieving the goals by integrating multiple packages.

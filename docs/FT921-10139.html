			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Howard faces EC row on maternity benefits MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the employment secretary, looks set for a battle with the European Commission and other member states over EC plans to improve minimum standards for maternity benefits. A delicate compromise, pushed through by the Dutch and the British at the end of last year, looks likely to unravel when it goes before the European parliament next month. Under that compromise women would be entitled to a minimum of 14 weeks' pay at the same level as staff unable to work for health reasons. That is considered inadequate by the Commission, the European parliament and several member states. The proposal will probably be amended by the parliament, at the prompting of the Commission, to 75 per cent of average earnings for 14 weeks. This new deal will have to be unanimously rejected by employment ministers for the original British and Dutch compromise to prevail. For the new deal to be accepted, however, it will still need to be approved by a qualified majority of employment ministers. 'There is a possibility that neither proposal will prevail and the whole issue will be deadlocked,' said a British official. This could further isolate the UK in employment matters just before it is due to take over the EC presidency in July. A recent House of Lords report on the EC's maternity proposals gives some support to the UK government by criticising the Commission's 'inadequate' analysis of the economic implications of its proposals. Britain may be challenged under EC competition rules for having lower social standards than other members states, according to an analysis of the Maastricht treaty, due to be signed today. In a report for US companies Mr Bill Brock, the former US trade representative, said that in the short term it would be 'business as usual' in the social and employment field in spite of the UK's 'opt-out' from extending EC powers in this area. Mr Brock warns that if the 11 EC member states, excluding the UK, do introduce extensive new social legislation 'Europe's attraction as a location for investment will be substantially damaged'. A separate report from Incomes Data Services, the research group, on the effects of the 'opt-out' stresses that the UK will not be able to opt-out from very much. It says: 'All the indications are that the Commission will continue to introduce proposals under the exist-ing machinery as far as possible.'</p>

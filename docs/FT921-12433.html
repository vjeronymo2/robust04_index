			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Grattan purchase causes problems for Otto Versand OTTO Versand, the German mail order group which last spring bought the Grattan mail order business from Next for Pounds 165m, is struggling to make the acquisition work in the face of the recession. Mail order industry sources suggest the Bradford-based company has been losing agents and market share and is heading for a loss of more than Pounds 30m in the current financial year. At the beginning of the year, Grattan caused ructions with some of its UK suppliers by adopting a far more aggressive approach and unilaterally imposing harsher terms of credit. Otto is believed to be sourcing an increasing proportion of goods for Grattan from its existing supplier base in Germany. Grattan also provoked discontent among its workforce this month when it announced that it intended to change bonus payments for 600 of its 4,000 workforce, thereby reducing their weekly income by an average of Pounds 20. This led to a dispute with Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, which will be referred to Acas today. Grattan will not comment on its trading performance now it forms part of a private international group. But Mr Norman Finnigan, Grattan personnel director, said: 'Like the rest of the mail order and high street retailing markets we are finding trading very much more difficult than in previous years.' In the half-year to July 31 1990, Grattan made operating profits of Pounds 5.7m. Mr Finnigan added that Otto Versand was operating Grattan on a 'very decentralised basis'. 'Grattan is making these changes in response to the very difficult trading conditions. It has nothing to do with being owned by Otto Versand,' he said. Otto's rivals in the UK believe that although there may be a period of hiatus while it gets to grip with Grattan the German company will emerge as a formidable competitor in the UK market. Otto is a highly sophisticated operator and runs the biggest group of mail order companies in the world. Its preference for direct marketing techniques in contrast to the traditional agency approach is seen by many as being the way forward for the UK mail order industry.</p>

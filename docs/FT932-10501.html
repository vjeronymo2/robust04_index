			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Further delays to pension changes emerge FURTHER DELAYS emerged yesterday in the implementation of new rules requiring companies to increase pensions in line with inflation. Ms Ann Widdecombe, social security minister, said limited price indexation (LPI) rules under the 1990 Social Security Act would not be implemented until the European Court of Justice decided on equalisation of pension ages. The rules require company pension schemes to use any surplus to increase pensions annually by either 5 per cent or the retail price index, whichever is lower. Speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Harrogate, Ms Widdecombe admitted that even after the European Court decision the rules would be further delayed pending a 'period of consultation'. The Confederation of British Industry has called on government to abandon LPI, arguing that it will cost too much. Acknowledging the concerns of employers, Ms Widdecombe said that while the government was committed to LPI, 'We are prepared to listen to people's concerns.' If necessary, the government would introduce new legislation to amend the act, she added. Ms Widdecombe also told delegates to the conference that the government was highly unlikely to introduce flexibility into the state pension age, the option most favoured by the association. 'The cost to the state of flexibility is high,' she warned. The Department of Social Security had been studying the experience of European states which have equalised mens' and womens' pension ages through flexibility. 'Some rather nasty snakes in the grass have come out. If you look across Europe, flexibility is not the flavour of the month,' she said.</p>

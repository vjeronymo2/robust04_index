According  to the agreement, the so-called Quad countries (the EU, the  United States, Canada, and Japan) will eliminate duties on paper  and wood products within 10 years.    According to the preliminary reports, the sector solution  includes the elimination of tariffs on paper products over a  transitional period of 10 years. Tariffs will be reduced 50  percent during the first five years. The parties to the  agreement can, however, separately decide on a timetable for the  first phase.    Claes von Ungern-Sternberg, the manager of Forest Industry,  Ltd., thinks that the elimination of tariffs will stiffen the  competition in Europe, but that changes in currency exchange  rates are at the present time of considerably greater importance  to Finnish firms' competitiveness than how high tariffs are.  Finland's paper exports to the EU countries have been duty free  since the quota period that ended in 1984. The big paper  producers, the United States and Canada, pay from 4 to 9 percent  in tariffs on their exports to the EU.    The elimination of tariffs will automatically raise an  exporter's coverages by about 1 clearance percent. Von  Ungern-Sternberg does not think that this will trigger price  competition, "although that would be possible in principle."    From the standpoint of Finland's forest industry, North  American producers' competitiveness will improve primarily as  concerns newsprint. The latter accounts for nearly 80 percent of  Canada's paper exports to the EU countries. Within 10 years the  elimination of tariffs will mean a saving in costs of over 300  million markkas to these producers.  <H5>  United Will Lose Its Relative Advantage </H5>   As for us Finns, over a 10-year period we will benefit to  the  tune of about 50 million markkas from our exports to North  America and Japan. Chiefly magazine paper is exported from  Finland. The new, duty-free importing into Europe's markets will  primarily affect those Finnish manufacturers who are big  producers of newsprint in Finland and in Europe. Typical of  these is United Paper Mills.    So far, European publishers have had their way in that North  American producers have had a 600,000-ton, duty-free quota on EU  markets, a quota that they have been able to increase through  individual decisions. According to manager von Ungern-Sternberg,  this quota will evidently be eliminated and that will, as far as  they are concerned, make it easier for the Canadians to gain  access to Europe. "From the industry's standpoint, the creation  of an integrated GATT is more important than tariffs, which have  already been substantially lowered for years now. Nowadays those  competitive factors involving environmental issues or monetary  policy are more essential than tariffs," he said.    "For the EU countries, the paper industry has always meant  cheap trade goods since there are no European forest nations at  the negotiating table. Autos, electronics, textiles, wines, and  agricultural products carry substantially more weight in the  EU's trade policy," von Ungern-Sternberg said.</p>

Takemura said the cabinet  will make a final decision on the dispatch after receiving  formal request from the United Nations.    A peace accord was signed in January last year after a  decade-long "proxy war" in El Salvador between the government,  backed by the United States, and rebel troops, backed by the  former Soviet Union.    A Foreign Ministry source said the government is planning to  send a team of between 10 and 15 people and is trying to enlist  Spanish-speaking members, some of them from universities.    A statement released by the secretariat of the international  peace cooperation headquarters within the prime minister's  office said the secretariat is preparing for the dispatch before  receiving a formal request because of the estimated time needed  to put equipment and personnel together to meet the departure  deadline.    Elsewhere, Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae  Kubota told reporters "it's all right sending personnel to El  Salvador, but we should think very carefully about sending (any)  to the former Yugoslavia."    El Salvador's President Alfredo Felix Christiani, in a  meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo on  November 4, asked Japan to send election monitors for the March  poll. Japan previously sent election monitors to Angola,  Cambodia and Mozambique, officials said.</p>

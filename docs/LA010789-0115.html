			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> JALEWALIA SCORES 45 POINTS AS LA QUINTA WINS EASILY AGAIN  </P> <P> The La Quinta High School girls' basketball team swept past its second big  Garden Grove League rival this week with a 66-28 victory over Kennedy on Friday  at Kennedy.  </P> <P> La Quinta had beaten Rancho Alamitos, the other challenger for the league  championship, 67-48, Wednesday.  </P> <P> And for that the Aztecs can thank Amy Jalewalia, their 6-foot 1-inch  do-everything junior.  </P> <P> Jalewalia, who primarily plays center but occasionally plays guard and forward,  had 45 points, 21 rebounds and 14 steals against Kennedy.  </P> <P> She was only 3 points short of tying the school record of 48 points she set  against El Modena earlier this season.  </P> <P> Wednesday against Rancho Alamitos, Jalewalia scored a game-high 25 points.  </P> <P> Friday night again provided Jalewalia ample opportunity to show off her  considerable athletic skills. She showed a soft touch on her outside shots,  making long jumpers. She also worked free for easy shots close in.  </P> <P> Most of all, though, she led the way on the Aztecs' swarming full-court press.  And that led to a number of easy layups for her and teammate Tanya Krill, who  had 14 points and 9 rebounds.  </P> <P> "I expect 20 to 30 points out of (Jalewalia), but not 40," said Kevin Kiernan,  La Quinta coach. Jalewalia came into the game averaging 26.5 points a game.  </P> <P> "All we really wanted this week was a split," Kiernan said.  </P> <P> Instead, La Quinta improved its record to 9-3 overall and 2-0 in league play.  Kennedy is 2-6, 1-1.  </P> <P> La Quinta let Kennedy stay close for a few moments early in the game but broke  the game open with a 19-2 run that gave the Aztecs a 25-6 lead with 4:54 left  in the half.  </P> <P> By halftime, La Quinta a 35-14 lead and Jalewalia had 23 points.  </P> <P> Valerie Ruiz had 10 points for Kennedy.

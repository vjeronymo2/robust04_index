			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph IX. requires various certifications of the defendants. Paragraph IX.A. requires each defendant to certify to plaintiff within 75 days after entry of the Final Judgment that defendant has made the distribution and notification required by Paragraph VIII. of the Final Judgment. Paragraph IX. B. requires each defendant to certify to plaintiff annually for five (5) years after the entry of the Final Judgment whether defendant has complied with the provisions of Paragraph VIII. C.,D.,E.,F. and G. above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph X. provides that nothing in the Final Judgment shall bar the United States from seeking, or the Court from imposing, against defendants or any person any other relief available under any applicable provision of law for violation of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph XI. provides that an authorized representative of the Department of Justice may visit defendants' offices, after providing reasonable notice, to review their records and to conduct interviews regarding any matter contained in the Final Judgment.

Scope of the Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph III. of the Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment shall apply to each defendant and to each of its officers, administrators, servants, representatives, agents employees, successors, and assigns and to all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who receive actual notice of the Final Judgment by personal notice or otherwise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph XIV. of the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment shall remain in effect for 5 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Effect of the Proposed Judgment on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The relief in the proposed Final Judgment is designed to ensure that each defendant hospital, using its independent judgment, acts unilaterally with respect to: (1) any decision by that hospital to enter into a contract with a third-party payer for the delivery of hospital services; (2) the terms or amounts of any fee; or the utilization of per diem-based fees in any agreement with any third-party payer. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment enjoins each defendant hospital from communicating any negotiated fee, including any actual or possible discount to any other hospital, or from utilizing the defendant Classic Care or any other agent to set, maintain or determine any fee of any hospital in the Long Island area. The Defendant Classic Care is specifically enjoined and restrained from: (1) Entering into any agreement with any hospital in the Long Island area concerning the terms or amounts of any fee charged to a third-party payer; (2) entering into any agreement with any hospital in the Long Island area to hold itself out as an exclusive negotiating agent with any third-party payer; (3) developing or distributing any fee schedule for use with any third-party payer; and (4) recommending that any hospital withdraw from or refuse to enter into any agreement with a third-party payer. Finally, the proposed Final Judgment requires that each defendant terminate any agreement or portion thereof entered into with any other defendant that conditions any actual or possible agreement between a hospital and a third-party payer on the formal or informal approval or acquiescence of any other defendant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the proposed Final Judgment is intended to ensure that third-party payers, including HMOs and other firms that deliver managed health care to their subscribers and patients, can obtain the benefits of competitive prices and price terms in connection with the negotiation of contracts with the defendants for the delivery of hospital services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice believes that the proposed Final Judgment contains adequate provisions to prevent further violations of the type upon which the Complaint is based and to remedy the effects of the alleged conspiracy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered as well as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of such actions. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the judgment has no prima facie effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against defendants in this matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures Available for the Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in Section 2(d) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(d), any person believing that the proposed Final Judgment should be modified may submit written comments to Ralph T. Giordano, Chief, New York Field Office, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 3630, New York, N.Y. 10278, within the 60 day period provided by the Act. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent to the proposed Final Judgment at any time prior to entry. Paragraph XII. of the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for the modification, interpretation, or enforcement of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

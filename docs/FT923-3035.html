			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Mitterrand ally charged over funding MR Henri Emmanuelli, president of the French national assembly, was yesterday charged with complicity in illicit trafficking of influence. The move was expected, but is likely to embarrass the Socialist party in the run-up to next Sunday's finely balanced referendum on European union. It is the latest twist in a long-running judicial campaign against political corruption which has focused on the Socialists and contributed to the decline of their popularity. Ironically, this comes just a week after the government tabled its own proposals to curb corruption, including a ban on business donations to party funds. Mr Emmanuelli, former Socialist party treasurer, denied the charges, which he described as 'artificial' and claimed yesterday that they were politically motivated. President Francois Mitterrand has repeatedly defended Mr Emmanuelli's honesty.</p>

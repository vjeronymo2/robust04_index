			<p>CSO     [Text] Bull's Distributed Computing Model has been provided  with a first group of five reengineering software programs named  Information Brockage Services. Their objective is to build  dynamic management personalized systems of information flow  inside enterprises and administrations, by making their  applications, until now independent, communicate.    These programs, which operate through DPX/20 (machines),  have been accessible since the existence of UNIX platforms,  G-COS 7 and 8 servers and IBM/MVS machines.    To operate them Bull had set up a partnership program to  which Syseca and Ibsi are already subscribers.    For the industrial users and distributors Bull has  officially  launched PDM (Product Data Management)--the SGTD (Data  Transmission Management System) result of its agreement with  Metaphase--and Aris, an analysis, conception and planning tool  for information systems restructuration. PDM and Aris are  integral parts of the DCM model. Finally, the constructor has  added the new electronic signature safety services to ISM  (Integrated System Management).</p>

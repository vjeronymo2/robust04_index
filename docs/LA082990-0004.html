			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN AID FOR SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> Your editorial "Hunger Pangs in Soviet Future" (Aug. 1) emphasizes an important  point. However, there are several considerations not mentioned.  </P> <P> If the West does not offer the Soviet Union help, it may not only be the end of  President Mikhail Gorbachev but also the end of Communism in Russia itself.  </P> <P> Some of the consequences of withholding help would be:  </P> <P> 1. The end of the Soviets' $3 billion per year assistance to Castro.  </P> <P> 2. The billions of dollars of Soviet military aid to the Afghan government  since the Russian withdrawal would have to stop.  </P> <P> 3. Their billions to aid client states, like Vietnam, Ethiopia, Angola and  North Korea and to support domestic and worldwide KGB activities, would have to  be greatly curtailed.  </P> <P> 4. The 25% of the Russian annual budget (Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's  figures) for military expenditures would have to be drastically cut. The  British defense secretary, Tom King, said last month that the Russian  production of new submarines was one every six weeks, while every day two  aircraft, six tanks and one missile were being made.  </P> <P> It is appalling to think of what would happen to the efforts for world peace if  the things above were to come to pass. Before withholding credits or actual  monetary aid, we must carefully consider the actions our Russian friends would  be forced to take.  </P> <P> RICHARD R. BOBB  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

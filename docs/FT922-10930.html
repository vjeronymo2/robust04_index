			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Poverty brings Tajikistan's political tension to the fore BIBI PARVINA, a stout, middle-aged Tajik woman, tied her head-scarf, shook her placard and shouted angrily: 'This is what we want: Islam, bread, and democracy]' Her words sum up a set of political demands that are pushing Tajikistan, one of the poorest of the former Soviet republics, into a bitter political confrontation between communists and Islamic political factions. Tension is rising, with the doubling yesterday of the thousands of demonstrators, both for and against the government, who have taken to the streets of Dushanbe, the Tajik capital. With about 10,000 anti-government protesters camped out in the newly named Martyrs Square, and another 10,000 pro-government demonstrators half a kilometre away in Freedom (formerly Lenin) Square, a long struggle may be under way. Government-sponsored negotiations, begun on Sunday, collapsed yesterday. This latest round of political conflict in Tajikistan was prompted by the arrest last month of Mr Mahsud Ikramov, Dushanbe's democratic-leaning mayor. The opposition Islamic and Democratic Party demonstrated to demand the release of Mr Ikramov, suspension of the communist-dominated parliament and resignation of Mr Safarli Kendjayev, the key government figure. The opposition then took hostage 20 parliamentary deputies, later released them, and forced a compromise: Mr Kendjayev resigned and the government promised multi-party parliamentary elections in December. Mr Kendjayev was then appointed head of the republic's KGB and thousands of his supporters thronged into the capital; this triggered renewed opposition demonstrations. However, the root cause of the confrontation lies not so much with Mr Kendjayev himself, but in the republic's bitter religious and regional conflicts. His well-organised supporters were brought by bus into the capital. They are bitterly opposed to the republic's powerful religious leader, Kazi Akbar Turanjonzoda, and support Mullah Haidaar Sharis, who is sympathetic to the government. Moreover, they believe that the opposition plans to create an Islamic government. The opposition, which denies wanting to impose an Islamic government, is a fragile alliance of the Democratic party, supported by many Tajik intellectuals, and the larger, more-organised, rural-based Islamic party. The latter is co-operating with Mr Turanjonzoda and so far has been relatively moderate in its aims. Its leader, Mr Mohammed Sharif, says: 'We do not want to create an Islamic state by force. We want an Islamic democracy.' Meanwhile the government's attitude is unclear. Mr Nasrullo Dustuv, the vice-president, says the government wants a peaceful solution but is prepared to use force if necessary. However, the government would have to rely on its own forces, since even Mr Dustuv admits the former Soviet army, now under the control of the new Commonwealth of Independence States, was unlikely to get involved. Moreover, a power vacuum appears to be opening up in the government. Most government officials insist that the real problem is economic. Mr Latim Kayumov, the foreign minister, believes that when the economic situation improves, the threat of Islamic militancy will vanish. At the moment, this seems unlikely. Mr Edmund McWilliams, the US charge d'affaires, admits that the transition to a market economy is likely to be painful in Tajikistan, with its impoverished population, lack of hard currency and grinding budget deficit. 'They have a lot to do, and not very much time. The social and political pressures are rising,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] This year, Four Japanese companies have marketed a  high frequency HEMT (high electron mobility transistor) having a  low noise factor (NF) of 0.45dB. Of the four companies, Toshiba  has produced a lower-cost resin sealed version. The HEMT is used  in the front end of tuners in broadcasting and communications  satellite tuners. A lower noise factor means that the diameter  of parabolic antennas can be reduced.    Broadcasting satellite tuners receive microwaves (selected  stations) in the 12GHz band, amplify the signal, and convert it  to intermediate frequencies (IF) of about 1GHz. The HEMT is  often used in the high-speed amplifiers in the front end of  broadcasting satellite tuners. This transistor must not only  operate at high frequency (12GHz), but must also have a low  noise factor. The noise factor is expressed as a quotient of the  signal-to-noise ratio of the input signal and the  signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal. The lower the noise  factor is, the higher the output signal-to-noise ratio will be.  Therefore, demodulation can be performed even with small  diameter parabolic antennas.    Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, and Sharp are the four companies  which  have begun shipping samples of the HEMT, which has a noise  factor of 0.45dB in the 12GHz band (this is the standard value  at 25&deg;C). (See Table 1) Of these companies, Toshiba has  developed a low cost resin-sealed version. Toshiba also claims:  ``When reflow soldering is performed, there is less conductivity  between pins than in the ceramic sealed type.'' When the noise  factor is reduced to 0.45dB or lower, antenna diameter can be  decreased to 30-40cm. With a noise factor of 0.6dB, antenna  diameter exceeds 40cm.  <H5>  InGaAs Used Most Frequently in Electron Transit Layer </H5>   The reason that the noise factor is lower in HEMT  transistors  is because both the electron mobility and electron density are  high. The noise factor is inversely proportional to the electron  mobility and electron density, and directly proportional to the  gate length. Impurities such as silicon are not added to  generate electrons in the electron transit layer (composed of  GaAs) in HEMT transistors. There is a separate electron supply  layer (AlGaAs, etc.) which supplies the electrons. Since there  are almost no impurities to disturb the mobility of electrons in  the electron transit layer, electron mobility is high even for  high electron densities. To increase the electron density in the  electron transit layer, Fujitsu developed a product with an  InGaP electron supply layer.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Except for NEC, all companies use GaAs for the substrate and  InGaAs in the electron transit layer. For the electron supply  layer, Fujitsu uses InGaP, and Toshiba and Sharp use AlGaAs. NEC  has not announced the material used. In addition to these  manufacturers, the following companies have also announced  low-noise, high-frequency transistors such as the HEMT:  Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. (NF reference is 0.5dB at  12GHz), Oki Electric Industrial Co. (0.55dB), Mitsubishi  Electric (0.55dB), Hitachi Ltd. (0.6dB), and Sony (0.7dB). Rolm  began marketing a product with 0.7dB noise factor, but this  product has been discontinued. Sanyo Electric is developing a  high-frequency transistor called TMT (two-mode channel FET),  which has a noise factor of 1.6dB (25&deg;C, 60GHz). Samples of  this product will begin shipment in 1994, but no product will be  for the 12GHz band.</p>

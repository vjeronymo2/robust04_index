			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Turkey to press for early EC entry TURKEY remains determined to push for early EC membership and to trade on its growing importance as a regional power to do so. Mr Erdal Inonu, Turkey's prime minister, made clear yesterday Ankara was looking beyond its recently-enhanced political relationship with the EC to firm commitments that it will get membership. 'We are sticking to the aim of becoming members in the near future,' he said in an interview with the FT. 'We are not looking for definite dates but for support, so that Turkey is not left in limbo.' Mr Inonu is the leader of the Social Democratic Populist party, junior partner in Mr Suleyman Demirel's conservative-led coalition. He stressed the benefit to Europe of Turkey's strategic role as a stabilising force on the Turkic nations of central Asia, and a bulwark against Iranian influence in these former Soviet republics. 'To get that assurance' of EC membership 'would guarantee the benefit of the role Turkey can play in that part of the world,' Mr Inonu said. 'If not, the EC won't get the benefit of that role.' Mr Inonu was in Brussels for talks with the European Commission, including with its president, Mr Jacques Delors, as part of a European tour taking in five EC member states. Top-level ministerial contact with the EC was institutionalised last November as part of an upgrading of the 29-year-old association agreement Turkey has with the European Community. Turkey's 1987 membership application was turned down in 1989 because of doubts about its democratic credentials and human rights record, and because its economy and per capita income lagged far behind average EC development levels. Mr Inonu said his government's 'aims of democratisation and stable growth had been taken up convincingly'. They had prompted changes in the attitude of the EC, he declared.</p>

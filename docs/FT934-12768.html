			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Unilever closer to Bertolli acquisition UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch group, has reached an advanced stage in negotiations to buy Bertolli, the edible oils side of the Italian foodstuffs group Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica (Cbd). This follows the privatisation two weeks ago of Cbd, controlled 62 per cent by SME, the state-run agri-business group. The stake was bought for L307bn (Dollars 190.5m) by Fisvi, an agri-industrial holding company with extensive interests in southern Italy. Fisvi is pressing ahead with the sale of the well-known Bertolli brands to help fund its purchase of Cbd. According to trades unions monitoring the negotiations, Unilever is likely to be asked to pay about L150bn. This would give the Anglo-Dutch multinational access to a further 9 per cent of the lucrative Italian olive oil market. Through Italian subsidiaries, Unilever already has some 15 per cent of the market. Unilever's bid for the whole of Cbd was turned down two months ago as being too low. IRI, the state holding company which owns SME, also felt the offer did not contain sufficient guarantees about the future of Cbd's operations in southern Italy. IRI, thus, was prepared to let Fisvi win on a revised bid despite the holding having a mere L53bn in capital. Fisvi is 60 per cent-owned by co-operatives in the Basilicata region; 20 per cent by state-controlled financial institutions, including Banco di Napoli with 10 per cent; and the remainder split between private shareholders dominated by the Tanzi family, owners of the Parmalat dairy group. Fisvi is in the process of raising a further L200bn in capital. However it will also have to find another L190bn to buy Cbd's outstanding non-SME-held shares as it is obliged by law. This, coupled with some L60bn needed for investments, will bring the total of Fisvi's Cbd purchase close to L600bn.</p>

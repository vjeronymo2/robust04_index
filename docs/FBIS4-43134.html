			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erich Hoorn: "Exports to West Europe Recovering </F> Strongly This Year"]    [Text] Vienna -- From 1990-93, Austrian exports to West  Europe (excluding Germany) declined by 12 percent to 158.5  billion schillings. Only this year, a strong revival can be  registered. The development in Germany, Austria's largest sales  market, was completely different because of the boom in the wake  of German unification.    In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Jan Stankovsky, foreign  trade expert of the Economic Research Institute, says that the  decline in exports to West Europe (without the FRG) was due to  the recession on the Old Continent. In addition, in 1993 the  devaluation that took place in many West European countries in  autumn 1992 had a very negative effect. In particular, the  deliveries to the devaluating countries Scandinavia, Great  Britain, and Italy, registered a strong slump in 1993. On the  other hand, the decline in exports to France, which hardly  changed the exchange rate of the franc, was limited.  <H5>  Good Economic Development </H5>   Stankovsky thinks that the upswing in exports to West Europe  this year is due to a general revival of the economic  development. However, the disadvantages arising from the  currencies continue to have an effect because, this time,  inflation did not skyrocket so much in the devaluating countries  as was the case when the currencies were devalued in the past.  "This is a new challenge to the Austrian export industry,"  Stankovsky says.    Therefore, Austria must keep a close watch on its  competitiveness. One must observe cost discipline. In  addition, one must try to eliminate the existing discriminations  on the West European markets by, for instance, joining the  European Union.  <H5>  Shifts to the East </H5>   Cooperation with the young countries in East Europe also  offers itself as an opportunity. Domestic companies could shift  their wage-cost-intensive productions there and buy cheap  subcontractor parts from there to be competitive in West Europe,  Stankovsky says.    In view of the boom in the wake of German unification,  Austrian exports to Germany also developed well in 1991 and  1992. Only in 1993 did the economic situation in the FRG  deteriorate all at once, which entailed a decline in Austrian  exports. In 1993, Germany had a share of 39 percent of all  Austrian exports. West Europe's share of overall exports was  72.9 percent.    In the 1990-93 period, imports from West Europe went down  only by 1 percent. In 1993, West Europe's share in Austria's  overall imports was 74.2 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 16 May (PAP)--An intergovernmental agreement  on "cooperation and exchange of information on some issues  concerning defense" was signed today by Swedish Defense Minister  Anders Bjorck and Poland's National Defense Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk.    Poland is the first country of the East bloc with which  Sweden has signed such an agreement. Minister Bjorck pointed  out that this transpires from the fact that Poland stands "in  the forefront of the states of this part of Europe that have  carried out democratic changes."    So far, Poland has signed 21 agreements on military  cooperation, among others, with all of its neighbors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Pierre Prouteau, chairman of the </F> Committee of French Investors in Black Africa and former  minister, by Cristophe Urbanowicz; place and date not given:  "Jean Pierre Prouteau: `It Will Cost 10 Billion Francs to  French Companies'"]    [Text] The devaluation of the CFA franc could lead to the  bankruptcy of 200 ailing French companies operating in Africa.  At a minimum, it will cost all French companies operating in  black Africa 10 billion French francs [Fr]. These are the  estimates Jean-Pierre Prouteau put forward in an interview with  LE QUOTIDIEN.    [Urbanowicz] Were you surprised by the devaluation of the  CFA  franc? Do you think it constitutes a turning point in  French-African relations?    [Prouteau] It is a turning point, because it puts an end to  the dogma of fixed monetary parity with the CFA zone. We have  to accept this, but we are not pleased with the way it was  implemented as it was ordered by the IMF and the World Bank.  The IMF director is not the governor of the 15 African heads of  state. I would call him an "off-shore [preceding word in  English] governor:" He gives orders that have financial  implications, but does not assume any political responsibility.    The role of the IMF and the World Bank cannot be assumed by  anybody else, however, because there is nobody to do so and  Europe is sleeping on both ears. The devaluation of the CFA  franc is a bet on the future, and the CFA zone is being played  heads or tails. Even with a 50-percent devaluation, can one be  sure that inflation will not reach the same level within two  years? The bet has not yet been won.    [Urbanowicz] What problems will arise from the devaluation?    [Prouteau] Let us begin with the positive effects: If the  World Bank allocates $1 million to an African country today,  this is the equivalent of CFA 580 million. Thus, the public  accounts of these countries will be swamped.    Second, exports will bring in more in terms of CFA francs.  However, the devaluation will make imports 50 percent more  expensive; it will increase inflation; and it will be a burden  on debt servicing. But I do not think that the IMF will  compensaye for the effects of this devaluation on debts.    [Urbanowicz] What will be the financial consequences of the  devaluation for French companies? How much will it cost French  investors in Africa?    [Prouteau] France accounts for 60 to 75 percent of foreign  investments in the CFA zone, and 70 percent of transactions  (declared, paying customs duties, and taxes). Some 1,200 French  groups and subsidiaries and 1,000 small companies operate in  this area, representing sales of Fr100 billion.    According to our estimates, the devaluation will cost at  least Fr10 billion to the companies of the Committee of French  Investors in Black Africa (CIAN) alone, which for 70 years has  been the employers' committee specializing in this area. The  CIAN represents 80 groups and 1,200 subsidiaries. We have  calculated that corporate assets depreciations will equal 50  percent of the abovementioned Fr10 billion. I have to remind  you that their headquarters are located there.    The second type of problem concerns linkage accounts  [comptes  de liaison] or current accounts, i.e., all outstanding orders  abroad. For instance, if yesterday one of our [expatriate]  companies placed an order worth Fr100 million, today it will  have to pay double that amount [in CFA francs].    In addition, African states often are one or two months  behind on current orders; thus, companies which ordered products  in French francs abroad will lose 50 percent. According to our  estimates, these losses will amount to Fr5 billion at least.    Another problem concerns the 6,000 expatriates employed by  CIAN companies. The French-franc value of their salaries will  halve, which is quite serious considering that part of their  salaries are spent in France, namely on house rents. French  companies will have to make up for these wage losses.    I want to point out that these estimates do not involve the  oil sector, which is far more important and constitutes a  special case.    [Urbanowicz] What is your analysis with regard to the  disinvestment process, primarily by French investors, which has  been affecting the CFA zone for several years?    [Prouteau] In 1985, large French groups had 1,500  subsidiaries in this area. Between 1985 and 1988, 15 percent,  or 200 of these were closed. Since 1989, the wave of closures  has stopped; 1,300 subsidiaries remain, including 1,200 in the  CFA zone.    At present, 65 percent of these make profits while 10  percent  are in serious trouble. The devaluation of the CFA franc might  lead to the closure of the latter 10 percent within one or two  years. I want to insist, however, that there is no risk of all  French interests deserting the area. We will have to digest  this devaluation, which, in our opinion, is much too brutal.</p>

This section, although generally more stringent than the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, is compatible with those guidelines. Furthermore, this section is consistent with standards referenced by HUD's regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) which reference UFAS (24 CFR 8.32). A discussion of the relationships between these regulations and their applicable standards is contained in the NPRM. (See 57 FR 60633).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM asked if an exception should be included similar to that in UFAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for elevators in low-rise structures. The NPRM did not include such an exception. UFAS 4.1.3(1) provides that all the accessible dwelling units may be located on one accessible level if at least one of each type of common area and amenity provided for use of residents and visitors is available on the accessible level. Most commenters supported such an exception. They noted that certain model building codes require elevators in multifamily structures that are four stories or more. These commenters also cited cost and maintenance factors as reasons for supporting an exception. The Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association noted that the cost of each elevator provided in a three story walk-up apartment would approximate the cost of one dwelling unit, potentially resulting in the construction of fewer units. If elevators are required in low-rise residential facilities, the National Association of State Facilities Administrators expressed concern that ``*&blank;*&blank;* public sector housing could lose much of its cost advantage over exempt private sector housing, driving designs back to high density, high rise dwellings.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters objected to an elevator exception on the basis of ensuring integration, security, and choice for people with disabilities. One commenter strongly urged that smaller facilities be required to have an elevator since the trend in development of publicly owned housing is toward smaller facilities. Otherwise, the commenter reasoned, accessible units will be provided only on the ground floor in smaller facilities. Ground floor units, according to several other commenters are more susceptible to burglary and other criminal activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the commenters who favored an elevator exception suggested that it should be narrowly drawn so as not to include larger buildings. In the interest of integration, the City of New York offered a compromise provision under which buildings with less than twenty-five dwelling units would not be required to have an elevator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the concerns for greater choice and integration are very important, requiring elevators in low-rise residential facilities is likely to result in fewer affordable dwelling units due to the added cost. The Board is well aware of the problems of all homeless persons, including those with disabilities. While elevators facilitate integration, there are associated costs. Requiring elevators in smaller buildings will force redesign of the typical walk-up garden apartment building, and the capital cost for each elevator is roughly equivalent to one dwelling unit. Balancing social goals and economic realities benefits all homeless people. Therefore, a provision has been added to ADAAG 13.1(2) exempting residential facilities that are less than four stories from the requirement for an elevator, provided that the requirements of ADAAG 13.1(2) (Public and Common Use), 13.2 (Minimum Number and Dispersion) and 13.3 (Requirements for Accessible Dwelling Units) are satisfied. An elevator may be required if the requirements of ADAAG 13.1(2), 13.2 and 13.3 cannot be met without providing vertical access. For example, in a facility having only one building, a designer may elect to locate all one bedroom units on the first floor and all two bedroom units on the second floor. In this case, if more than one accessible dwelling unit is required, an elevator may be necessary to meet the dispersion requirements in ADAAG 13.2.2. This exception does not decrease the minimum number of dwelling units that must be accessible in a facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPVA recommended inclusion of the 1993 BOCA National Building Code requirement that where there are multiple facilities of one type, 25 percent, but at least one, must be accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule has been revised by deleting the term ``public use'' so that all newly constructed and altered recreational facilities for use by the general public must comply with ADAAG 4. In addition, at least one of each type of common use recreational facility provided must be accessible. This provision is written to be consistent with the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines which state: ``Where multiple recreational facilities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  tennis courts) are provided, sufficient accessible facilities of each type to assure equitable opportunity for use by persons with handicaps is required''. See 24 CFR Ch. 1, App. II, sec. 5, req. 2. An appendix note indicates that one accessible recreational facility may be insufficient to ensure equitable opportunity by persons with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.2&blank;Minimum Number and Dispersion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.2.1&blank;Minimum Number <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section outlines minimum scoping guidelines for accessible residential dwelling units. Five percent of the total number of dwelling units in a facility ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on a common site) shall comply with ADAAG 13.3 and 13.4. In a facility with more than two dwelling units, 25 percent, but not less than one of the accessible units complying with ADAAG 13.3 and 13.4, shall have a roll-in shower. In addition, where special purpose residences are provided for specific employee positions and are not interchangeable ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Governor's mansions and university President's residences) each shall comply with 13.2.1(1). Where special purpose residences are interchangeable, five percent, or at least one shall be accessible. Examples of special purpose residences that are interchangeable include, but are not limited to, housing set aside for university faculty having similar rank and live-in residences for museum curators and other professional staff. In addition to these units, two percent of the total number of dwelling units in a facility shall comply with ADAAG 13.4. This section also provides that, when the total number of dwelling units is one, that dwelling unit shall meet the requirements of ADAAG 13.2.1(1). An appendix note clarifies that at least one of each type of unit size, according to the number of bedrooms provided must be accessible according to 13.2.2(2). Even when the minimum number requirements of 13.2.1 must be exceeded, access to all types of units, particularly according to the number of bedrooms provided, will ensure a minimum level of program access and may reduce future costs associated with accommodating individuals with varying needs. Because existing units can be made accessible to persons with hearing impairments with little or no structural alteration, a similar provision is not included for those units required to be accessible by 13.2.1(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

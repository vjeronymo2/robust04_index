			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Western cash fuels Chinese growth 0 New fund targets China's auto parts industry Mr Tim Clissold and his colleagues at Pacific Alliance Group, a Hong Kong merchant bank, have spent months travelling around China with one purpose: to examine motor components factories needing money and technology for expansion. Within the next few months, his trips to nearly 100 factories, many in remote areas, should start to bear fruit. Pacific Alliance is a sponsor of a fund, launched recently, which will invest solely and directly in production of Chinese auto parts. China Automotive Components Group, also sponsored by Trust Company of the West, a US asset management concern, and Dean Witter Capital Corporation, the New York brokerage, is a limited partnership which is being privately placed mainly in the US. The aim is to raise Dollars 150m in minimum amounts of Dollars 1m. The partnership is domiciled in the Cayman Islands. If successful, the investment vehicle will be unusual among the 40 or so funds which profess to invest in China. Since opportunities for direct participation in China by portfolio investors are limited, most funds direct a significant proportion of investors' money into the Hong Kong stock market. Some funds do target unlisted Chinese companies with the aim that the companies obtain stockmarket listings as they (and the Chinese markets) develop. Investors in China Automotive Components Group will, however, be tied directly to unquoted companies in one sector of one industry. Moreover, they will be tied specifically to three Chinese entities in an elaborate form of joint venture. The aim is not simply to use the knowledge of the sponsors to pick investments, but to help build a group within China with a critical mass sufficient to have a strong impact on the market. The sponsors have already identified 25 components factories, making such items as pistons, clutches and spark plugs, at which they would form joint ventures and inject capital and technology. The Chinese partners are China National Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC), the government body which co-ordinates the Chinese motor industry; China North Industries Corporation, generally known as Norinco, the leading arms producer which has turned increasingly to civilian products and is China's largest integrated automotive manufacturer, with 70 components factories; and the municipal government of Changchun, a north-eastern city which is China's equivalent of Detroit. The rationale for investing in the motor industry is clear, with China's economic boom raising incomes and creating enormous demand. As Mr Clissold, managing director of Pacific Alliance, says: '700m Chinese have bicycles and would prefer to have motorcycles.' Norinco factories already have 40 per cent of the motorcycle market and are looking to expand their output both of parts and the finished product. China has carefully controlled the expansion of the motor vehicle industry, and car production remains low: only 164,300 passenger cars were built last year. However, according to Pacific Alliance Group, CNAIC expects production to grow at about 30 per cent a year to reach 1.53m in 2000. The main assemblers of cars and light trucks, which are joint ventures with foreign manufacturers or have other types of foreign involvement, are under pressure to increase local content. However, foreign investment in the Chinese component industry has been relatively slight. 'What we're looking for are factories which want to increase their production and need the money to expand,' says Mr Clissold. In some ventures, there is also a need to inject new technology. Where a projected investment is large enough to justify it, the bank's team is followed to a factory by a team from A. T. Kearney, the US consultants, who develop an operating plan. A separate team with experience of the US car industry also visits factories. The aim is that the ventures in which the partnership invest should be ready to be listed publicly within three to five years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHINESE VEHICLE PRODUCTION (000s)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             1983  1984  1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks/cars/   minibuses  240   316   443   373   473   647   587   509   714 1,080 Motorcycles  287   528 1,045   635   743 1,171 1,032   966 1,317 1,982  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Pacific Alliance Group from official figures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

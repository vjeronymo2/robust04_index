			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: BT talks on share stake in EDS are called off BRITISH Telecom and Electronic Data Systems, America's largest computing services company, are understood to have called off discussions which could have meant BT buying a large stake in EDS, a subsidiary of General Motors. The two companies declined to comment but they are believed to have been unable to agree on the financial terms of a deal, and particularly on the degree of control to be wielded by BT. The British company does not want to take stakes in businesses where it does not have control, while neither GM nor EDS appear to have been happy to yield much power to BT. The discussions are said to have included the possibility of BT purchasing a 25 per cent stake in GM's class E shares, which are linked to the profitability of EDS. This would have cost BT around Dollars 4bn at current market prices. However, the class E shares do not give the holder a stake in EDS's assets, which remain 100 per cent owned by GM, and this appears to have been a significant stumbling block to any deal. The termination of talks poses a substantial strategic challenge for BT, which is anxious to expand its presence in the North American telecoms market, the world's largest, to support its drive to be a leading global business. It has a fledgling network management business, called Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, but a tie-up with EDS would have given it much more clout in the US market and potential access to customers. EDS, for its part, could have bolstered its European presence through a link with BT. The Dallas-based company, which operates in more than 30 countries, sees Europe as a key area of growth over the coming decade. Some 25 per cent of its revenues currently come from international markets. It is keen to strike up alliances with one or more international telecommunications groups to exploit the convergence of the computing and telecommunications sectors in a much larger information technology industry.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 6 Jun (INA) -- Yemeni aircraft yesterday  bombarded two Ilyushin cargo planes which were unloading  military cargoes at the separatists' al-Riyan airport in the  Hadhramaut Governorate, eastern Yemen.    In statements broadcast in Sanaa last night, an authorized  Yemeni source said that Yemeni aircraft blasted the two planes  while in pursuit of separatist aircraft which were carrying out  aggressive raids against citizens and vital and economic  installations in the Ma'rib and Shabwah governorates.    The source said that the aircraft affiliated with the  command  of the Yemeni forces chased the separatists' planes to their  landing positions at al-Riyan airport in the Hadramaut  governorate, hitting many of them.    In a separate development, informed Yemeni sources said that  the legitimate Yemeni forces yesterday took control of vital  areas and inflicted big losses on fortifications inside Aden.    In statements to the Yemeni television last night, the  sources revealed that the personnel of the Aden garrison--the  Salah al-Din camp--have surrendered to the legitimate forces  along with their weapons, including armored vehicles, artillery,  and anti-aircraft guns.    Yemeni military sources did not mention the positions near  Aden where the legitimate Yemeni forces are stationed.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Policemen guilty of mass killing A SOUTH AFRICAN court yesterday convicted five policemen of murdering 11 black funeral mourners in 1988 - the first time security force members have been found guilty in a mass killing, writes Patti Waldmeir. The judgment is likely to embarrass the government of President F W de Klerk, who has long denied claims that police have been involved in violence that has left 11,000 people dead since 1984. In the court judgment, Mr Justice Andrew Wilson accepted prosecution evidence that policemen killed 11 people, many of them women and children, at a funeral vigil after an official of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the conservative Zulu group, asked police to help eliminate political rivals in the area.</p>

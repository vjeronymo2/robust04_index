			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Homeless youths to get help in 'foyers' YOUTH homelessness should be tackled in centres that offer young people accommodation and training, according to the Foyer Federation, which was launched yesterday, John Willman writes. The body - backed by Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, and Shelter, the charity for the homeless - aims to create a network of 'foyers'. They would provide young people with a place to live, train and get help with finding a job. Young people moving to a new area would be able to reserve low-cost accommodation in advance if they agreed to undergo training or participate in job-search schemes. The federation will co-ordinate the development of foyers. GrandMet is providing office space in its former brewery in Brick Lane, east London, and putting up Pounds 300,000 over three years.

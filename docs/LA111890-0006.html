			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, YOSEMITE!  </P> <P> I first camped in the Valley in 1936, learned to ski at Badger Pass and spent  many family vacations in Toulumne Meadows.  </P> <P> I never thought of Yosemite as a destination resort. This MCA concept, in my  opinion, is alien to the Yosemite I know and treasure. I agree with Ansel Adams  about visiting "one of the greatest shrines of the world," but would one want  motel rooms, tennis courts and swimming pools in other great shrines such as  the Lincoln Memorial or Westminster Abbey?  </P> <P> RICHARD FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

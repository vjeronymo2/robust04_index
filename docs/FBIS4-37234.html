			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA) -- Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN  secretary general's envoy investigating the Yemeni crisis, has  said that the southern and northern Yemeni delegations told him  that they are committed to the cease-fire and are aware of the  importance of creating a mechanism to supervise it.    Speaking following separate meetings with a delegation of  the  Republic of Yemen, led by 'Ali Mansur Rashid, and a delegation  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which recently proclaimed  independence, Ibrahimi said that the aim of his talks with the  two delegations was to establish a cease-fire in Yemen and  devise a mechanism to monitor it.    Ibrahimi said that he will submit a full report on his  mission to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali, who will in  his turn present a report to the UN Security Council proposing a  course of action on the crisis. [passage indistinct]    The UN secretary general's envoy said that he will continue  to seek a stable cease-fire in Yemen, reiterating that both  sides are aware that continued shelling is against their  interests.    Ibrahimi said that continued fighting is neither acceptable  or sensible, expressing hope that the cease-fire will be upheld  as soon as possible.    Meanwhile, 'Abdallah Muhsin al-'Ikwah, spokesman for the  northern Yemeni delegation, described as good the delegation's  talks with Ibrahimi, which focused on ways to stabilize the  cease-fire. Al-'Ikwah told journalists that the delegation is  in Cairo "to meet with the brothers of the Yemeni Socialist  Party, our partners in the coalition." Asked about the creation  of borders splitting the countries in half, al-'Ikwah said that  this is an inappropriate development.    For his part, Muhsin Bin-Farid, head of the southern Yemeni  delegation, said that the delegation seeks the implementation of  Resolution 924 as a first step that could lead to the discussion  of other matters.    Concerning the need for a peace-keeping force to support the  resolution, Bin-Farid said that such a force is needed;  otherwise, UN resolutions will not be respected by any side.    Bin-Farid said that the southern delegation conveyed to  Ibrahimi a call on the UN Security Council to take deterrent  action against any side violating its resolutions.</p>

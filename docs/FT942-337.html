			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court blocks Gantry document move The federal court in Sydney has blocked the sending-out of formal 'part A' offer documents by Gantry, one of the two US bidders for Australia's Bridge Oil. Lawyers for Parker &amp; Parsley, the rival bidder, said the interim injunction had been granted on grounds that the documents were flawed in the disclosure of Gantry's intentions for Bridge once a takeover was completed. But Gantry, which is the bid vehicle for Enron, the US gas company, and the California Public Employees Retirement System, said that it would appeal the decision, and was seeking an expedited hearing. The injunction comes one day after P&amp;P raised its offer to 90 cents a share, outbidding Gantry's 85 cents a share terms.</p>

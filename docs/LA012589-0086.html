			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson gave his long-awaited endorsement to black Acting Mayor  Eugene Sawyer in the Feb. 28 Chicago primary and urged voters to defeat a  challenge from the son of the "Boss" who ran Chicago for two decades. "I choose  to stand with this rainbow coalition of political and community leaders and  endorse Mayor Eugene Sawyer for reelection," Jackson said as the South Side  crowd chanted "Sawyer! Sawyer! Sawyer!" The former Democratic presidential  candidate said Cook County State's Atty. Richard M. Daley -- son of legendary  Mayor Richard J. Daley, who became known as the "Boss" of Chicago politics --  must be defeated at all cost. Jackson stopped short of saying whether he would  continue to support Sawyer in the general election on April 4, should Sawyer  defeat Daley and face another black, Alderman Timothy Evans.  </P></p>

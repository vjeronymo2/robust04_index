			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN THE GARDEN OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MARTYRS BY TOBIAS WOLF  (ECCO PRESS: $8.95)  </P> <P> Although many of the stories in this anthology are set in the Pacific  Northwest, Tobias Wolff's talent transcends regional boundaries. In crisp,  hard-edged prose, he delineates bleak miniature worlds that encompass the  disillusionment of contemporary life.  </P> <P> The reader watches with impotent alarm as a botched practical joke releases the  hatred and fear needed to commit murder in "Hunters in the Snow." In the title  story, the smug hypocrisy of a faculty search committee forces a shy professor  to speak the truth in her lecture. Citing the example of the Iroquois, she  admonishes her dumbfounded students to "Be kind. Do justice. Walk humbly." On a  lighter note, in "The Liar," a young man discovers that falsehood can become so  gloriously entertaining that it appears more vivid than the truth. An  exceptional collection of short fiction.  </P></p>

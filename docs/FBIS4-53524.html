			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By editorial writer Ataru Odagawa] </F>   [Text] The following is the summary of remarks by DPRK's  (North Korean) President Kim Il-song in the 21 April interview  given to Ms. Mun Myong-cha:    We have never dreamt of a war. (Regarding North Korean  delegate's threat to turn Seoul into a "sea of flames") I was  surprised at the remark when I heard it. Later, I received a  formal report that the words had been blurted out in  counterarguments to South Korean delegates who had gotten on our  delegates' nerves.    South Korea and the United States once said we already have  nuclear bombs without any proof, and now they say we have the  capability to produce them. They are just trying to corner us  with their groundless claims.    If we have such a capability, we would not bother to hold a  dialogue with the United States. At the negotiations with the  United States last year, our delegate proposed: "If you have  suspicions against us, please help us shift all nuclear reactors  to light-water reactors. Since we do not have funds to carry  out the plan, we need financial aid or loans." In response, the  U.S. delegate agreed to do that. Although we both are supposed  to implement the agreement, the suspicion is becoming an  obstacle to the fulfillment of the agreement.    If we really have nuclear weapons, we would have to conduct  nuclear experiments; however, we have no place to test a nuclear  weapon. Also, we do not have any target against which to use  such a weapon. They probably believe we are developing the  weapon to confront our compatriots, but that would never happen.  Why do we have to have a nuclear weapon while we have no place  to use it?    If we show the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  everything they want to see, they will say they have doubts  about other places that they want to see, and more places, and  this attitude will continue. While the IAEA says they have  doubts about our military facilities, inspections of military  bases are beyond its authority. North and South Korea have a  bilateral arms reduction accord. If mutual arms reduction is  carried out in line with the accord, we can show everything,  including military facilities, to each other.    Since the truce (of the Korean war), we have been under what  are actually comprehensive economic sanctions by the economic  sphere of the United States. What further sanctions can be  imposed beyond those we have been subjected to? I feel like  saying once, go ahead and try.    China has never tried to apply pressures on us. We are not a  vassal state of China.    I was deeply impressed with (ROK) President Kim Yong-sam's  inauguration address in February 1993. He stated "even the best  friendly nation cannot stand closer than compatriots," and this  is my longstanding opinion, too. In response to his address, I  hammered out a 10-point guideline (for Korea's reunification).  However, President Kim recently said we would be isolated unless  the nuclear issue is resolved. I just do not understand why he  made such a remark.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Dec (MENA)--An informed Palestinian source  in Cairo has said that the Palestinian leadership introduced  some slight amendments to minutes of an agreement with Israel  recently worked out in Cairo by the Palestinian and Israeli  delegations discussing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  Declaration of Principles.    In an exclusive statement to MENA, the source said most of  the amendments concern the area of Jericho. The source said  that the Israelis are sticking to their offer of 54 square km  covering the Palestinian camps and some lands around Jericho  city.    The source said the Palestinian amendments include the  following:    First, al-Nabi Musa area should be under the supervision of  the Palestinian authority.    Second, the al-Maghtis. The Israelis believe the area should  not be part of the Jericho region during the interim stage, but  the Palestinians want it to be under the Palestinian authority.  The Israelis say the Palestinian flag cannot be raised over  that area without annexing it.    Third, the Palestinians demanded the Musa al-'Alami area;  the  Israelis accepted this during the discussions.    Fourth, as regards al-Qurunful mountain, the Palestinians  demand the right to approve joint Palestinian-Israeli projects  there, and to approve projects with Jordan later.    Sixth [as received] The Palestinians demand that the  international and foreign presence mentioned in the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles be extended to the  border crossings.    The Palestinian source stressed that the amendments did not  affect the essence of the agreement laid out through the joint  working minutes.    The draft working paper reached between the Palestinian and  Israeli delegations in Cairo included several issues on foreign  security and arrangements relevant to the border crossings.    According to the border crossings arrangements, there will  be  one terminal for arrivals and departures with two doors, one  Palestinian and one Israeli, separated by a glass barrier.  Palestinians residing in the West Bank and Gaza will pass  through the Palestinian door and then move to the Israeli door.  Electronic inspection will be used in a manner respecting the  dignity of those who pass through.    The Palestinian-Israeli draft on the crossings also says  that  each side has a right to see the identity cards of any traveler  and veto the entry of any person. Each side will also report  anything suspicious to the other.    The draft exempts public Palestinian figures from crossings  procedures and stresses that when there is a need for personal  inspection of Palestinians, the Palestinian side will do the  inspection in the presence of an Israeli observer.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Travel (The Caribbean): Face to face with the chop in Jamaica - James Henderson feels the fever and intensity There is something theatrical about the streets of Jamaica. Much of Caribbean life takes place outdoors anyway, and all West Indians are demonstrative and lively, but in Jamaica things are more feverish and intense. The shouting and quipping and carrying on, and the timing of course, can seem almost like drama. The scene was the Parade in downtown Kingston, where I was heading to catch a bus. I was weaving through the stalls of Ben Dung Plaza (so called because you literally do have to 'ben dung' to select your purchase from the piles neatly laid out on the ground). Vendors were shouting: 'Nuts] Wrigleys] Nuts]'; and they soon picked up on me: 'Hey white man] Come] Come]' said a huge brown woman with a head-tie and her skirts rolled up above her knees. Like all the stalls, hers was laid out with meticulous care, almost colour co-ordinated, the red and green of cut water-melon and little pyramids of limes. Once she had my attention, and that of all the people around, she said: 'Come daalin'. Come squeeze me mangos . . .' But if I had momentarily forgotten that I was catching a bus, the busmen had not, and as soon as I strayed on to their turf the barrage began: 'Yes man, this way man.' Three of them vied for my custom. Before I knew it, I had been hustled on board the nearest minibus, to a chorus of mock outrage from the other conductors. My intended destination seemed only a secondary consideration. The victorious busman seemed almost disappointed when I explained that I did not want to go uptown after all, but across to the north coast. I needed a different bus station altogether. Three hours later I was in Ocho Rios, cosseted in old-colonial luxury in the Jamaica Inn, which is a far cry from downtown Kingston. It is an enclave of manicured calm, purposely old-fashioned, one of a number of places in Jamaica that appeal to an era now largely passed. The grounds, complete with a sumptuous croquet lawn, are worthy of an English country garden, though of course the image is instantly spiked by the palm trees. You can begin to feel the romance of the West Indies here. A famed devotee of Jamaica was Noel Coward, who kept a house called Firefly just outside Ocho Rios for many years until his death in 1973. It was chosen with customary discernment because it has one of the Caribbean's finest views. Looking from the open-fronted drawing room, you see the Blue Mountains recede in their camel-back ridges for 30 miles to one side and on the shoreline beneath them the headlands outreach one another into the distance. It is essential to travel around the island to get the best of Jamaica, and it was soon time to set out again. Suddenly, outside the hotel grounds, the harsh voices of everyday Jamaican life re-appeared. People were talking to each other with the excitability and volume of football fans whose team has just won an important match. Through a car window they had all the gestures of pantomime. In the mayhem of the market, people nosed their handcarts through the crowds, goats dragged their tethers oblivious, conductors leant out of their buses, fistfuls of notes folded between their fingers, shouting their destinations: 'Brongstong] Brongstong]' (Browns Town), 'Maubyer] Maubyer]' (Mo Bay - short for Montego Bay in patois). I found a seat on the bus and the vendors walked up and down: 'Box drink, box drink, bag juice, bag juice.' The aisle steadily filled up with people standing. It is normal practice to hand your shopping to someone sitting if you have to stand. I was given a satchel of books, my next door neighbour got a baby. I enjoy riding the buses, unlike many Jamaicans, who think of them as an unreliable necessity rather than an adventure. Outside, the world flashed by: groups of schoolchildren darted here and there, shorts and pinafore dresses colour-coded according to their school; a small house stood between two vast stacks of speakers, music audible even above the bus's stereo, a single man danced; a woman walked with a single hand of bananas on her head; a boy rode his bicycle at an impossibly uncomfortable angle, poised as though he were about to perform some complicated BMX trick - but no, he just switched to the other side in some odd expression of symmetry. Of course Jamaica is well known for hustling and there's no doubt that it can be hard on an unwary newcomer. Some lock themselves away in hotels and do not step outside the compound except in a taxi, but if you do, sooner or later (usually sooner because they will pick you out if you have no tan) you will have a run-in with a hustler. It starts with a question impossible to answer: 'So wha' 'appenin?' and a hand upturned in question. Once they have you there they talk you through it, running down their inventory of desirable and less desirable goods and services, anything from primitive art, or yet another African carving, to an aloe massage. They are persuasive, there is no doubt, and some make a good living: 'if you have de lyric . . .' I stepped out of the bus in Montego Bay and it began at once: everywhere there was a chorus of 'So, whacannadoferyer?' 'Wha' 'appenin?' and of course the eternal: 'Wanna taxi buddy?' A man approached flourishing a machete and said, 'So, white man, I chop you a nut, right,' (double take). He deftly topped a coconut and handed it to me. 'Just 50 Jamaican.' After about 10 minutes of talk I handed over 20 Jamaican dollars. One of my favourite Caribbean towns, Negril, lies at the western limit of Jamaica. It was well known in the 1960s when the hippies washed up here and admired the sunset a lot. With all the recent building it has become a little gentrified (it even has a golf course now) but it still has a laid-back air. And here things took a turn for the absurd. Flushed, I saw a hustler arrive by canoe, briefcase in hand and dressed in a suit, trousers rolled up against the waves. He struck a pose on the shore and stumbled through the sand on his business. By all accounts not many Jamaicans go out jogging: 'Well man, you know, it a long way . . . an' it HOT]' And so as I was stretching my legs, heading out of Negril at a jog, people stopped and stared, or looked up from their dominoes, bemused. One man shouted after me with unlikely urgency as I left the town limits: 'You cyaan go out there, man, you are go get chop' (momentary thoughts of a coconut). A six year-old squeaked with excitement at the sight of me: 'Look, look, white man runnin]' and followed on for 100 yards. Further on, an old man summed it up with a dismissive wave and just three words: 'Get a taxi.' As the largest and most vibrant of the British Caribbean islands, Jamaica has the greatest romantic allure. Local life is that much more pressurised, but the calm is correspondingly more of a relief. It is easy to feel the love affair beginning.</p>

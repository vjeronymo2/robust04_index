			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS' QUINN MIGHT ADD COACHING DUTIES  </P> <P> Socker midfielder Brian Quinn likely will have something over his teammates  when the Major Soccer League season begins Oct. 19 -- a job as one of their  coaches.  </P> <P> A contract has not been signed, but Quinn and Coach Ron Newman confirmed the  team has offered Quinn, considered one of the MSL's best players, an  opportunity to become an assistant coach as well.  </P> <P> The arrangement would not only add to Quinn's responsibilities, it would add to  his paycheck, which would have been drastically cut under the league's new  salary cap of $630,000 per team.  </P> <P> Quinn, 30, earned $60,000 last season and, along with defender Kevin Crow, had  the team's third-highest salary behind forward Branko Segota ($102,000) and  goalie Zoltan Toth ($68,000). Quinn wouldn't give specifics but said this  year's player/coach salary will "be very close" to what he earned last year.  </P> <P> There is a sticking point. Owners have yet to agree on parameters regarding  player/coach salaries under the new cap.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Commissioner Earl Foreman faxed a ballot to each league member to  decide whether such a loophole should be created, according to John Griffin,  MSL director of communications.  </P> <P> A final count is not expected until next week, but other teams have already  taken the same detour around the cap. In Cleveland, midfielder Kai Haaskivi  also serves as head coach. Goalkeeper Chris Sobieski of Dallas and defender Joe  Waters of Tacoma are entering their second years as assistants.  </P> <P> Also, Griffin said, St. Louis is trying to work a similar deal with defender  Fernando Clavijo, and Kansas City is toying with the idea of creating a  player/coach position.  </P> <P> That's six teams, a sound majority in an eight-team league.  </P> <P> Quinn, known for a tenacious style of play, said he didn't want his new title  to be a misnomer.  </P> <P> "I don't want to take a coaching position just to be a figurehead," he said. "I  would like to be involved."  </P> <P> Newman said he looked forward to such an arrangement.  </P> <P> "I respect his views," Newman said. "He has got the makeup to become an  excellent coach when he decides to hang up his boots."  </P> <P> Newman went on to say that as team captain, Quinn already serves in a role  similar to that of a coach.  </P> <P> "I would always confer with Brian," Newman said. "But now I'll definitely  discuss things with Brian more than before. In the past I didn't want to put  too much pressure on him as a player."  </P> <P> Newman said Quinn's appointment will not affect Erich Geyer, who will continue  as an assistant.  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Brussels wins backing for seat on energy agency THE European Community should have a full seat at the International Energy Agency (IEA), one of the agency's directors said yesterday. The European Commission is attempting to persuade the 12 EC member states that it should be allowed to speak for them at the IEA, the Paris-based agency co-ordinating energy crisis management policy for OECD countries. Mr Quincey Lumsden, IEA director responsible for oil market developments, told an oil and gas conference in Luanda, capital of Angola, he hoped the Community would have a seat in its own right, stressing this was a personal view. Commission officials said his comments would strengthen its hand in talks with EC members. If the 12 agree, accession to the IEA should be a formality.</p>

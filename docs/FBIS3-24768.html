			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report from Lusaka by correspondent Joao Ligio] </F>   [Text] The second round of Angolan peace talks in Lusaka  has for the last three days been stuck on the modalities for  implementing the protocol concerning an understanding on the  future national police force. The mediators have not yet found  the magic word that will clear the reasoning of the Black  Cockerel negotiators. It was necessary for UN Special  Representative Alioune Blondin Beye to resort to his rudest  vocabulary to get the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA] to behave in a manner more compatible with the  spirit and letter of the aims of peace--particularly because  there is also an urgent need for this great undertaking to  succeed.    The UN special representative managed to get UNITA to reduce  its demands for participation in the future national police from  45 to 25 percent. He also managed to get UNITA to lower its  demands for participation in the Riot Police from 50 to 30  percent. Nonetheless, those figures are still much higher than  the 5 to 10 percent proposals put forth by the mediator and the  government. It is for this reason that, over the last three  days, the pressing [preceding word in English] has been applied  and will continue to be applied unilaterally on the UNITA side.</p>

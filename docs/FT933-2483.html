			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Poor asset managers: Poland's mainstream party has not exploited the prime minister's popularity Grubbing for votes is what election campaigns are all about. But this basic rule seems to have been forgotten by many of the Polish politicians with roots in the former anti-communist Solidarity movement, who face defeat in tomorrow's general elections. Unable to agree on pre-electoral alliances which would have guaranteed them a place in the new parliament, the smaller ex-Solidarity factions have spent more energy squabbling among themselves than trying to persuade a confused and sometimes exasperated electorate to vote for them. The main gainers have been left-wing parties with roots in the communist past and a history of disciplined voting. They have promised to continue the market reforms which have brought the first taste of prosperity to many Poles, but with a human touch which would ease the pain of change. Yet the prospects of an electoral victory for parties with their roots in the old regime has been greeted with calm bordering on indifference. The zloty, the Polish currency, even gained marginally against the dollar yesterday on the foreign exchange markets, and there has been no sign of panic among investors, who have pushed shares on Warsaw's budding stock exchange to record heights in recent weeks. The collapse of the Soviet empire, symbolised by today's withdrawal of the last Russian soldier from Polish soil, coupled with a broad consensus on the continuation of market reforms and parliamentary democracy, seem to have taken the heat out of Poland's political life. Solidarity leaders are no longer heroes, but the former communists are no longer devils either. The Democratic Union (UD), the mainstream successor to Solidarity, has suffered most from highly pesonalised attacks against party leaders and against President Lech Walesa by breakaway Solidarity faction leaders like Mr Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who accuse President Walesa of becoming a communist tool. But Mr Walesa also increased the disarray in Solidarity ranks himself when he first encouraged the formation of a new political grouping, the so-called Non-Party Movement for Reform (BBWR), and then distance himself from it as the movement lost support. The president's steadily declining prestige suffered another blow after he castigated a former communist secret policeman, who acted as a double agent for the Solidarity underground in the Baltic port city of Gdansk, as a traitor. Mr Walesa's critics claim that the only crime of Mr Adam Hodysz, the policeman, was to fail to destroy evidence of Mr Walesa's alleged involvement with the secret police in the early 1970s. It is not just a question of personalities. The Poles are also suffering from electoral weariness. They have voted in more elections over the past four years than any other post-communist electorate. Sunday's nationwide poll will be the fifth since the semi-free elections of June 1989 when the then Solidarity alliance of workers and intellectuals, backed by the powerful Catholic church, won the moral victory which led to the domino-like collapse of communist rule throughout the region. But after four coalition governments in as many years the Solidarity parties are looking tired and are suffering from the inevitable dissipation of the once euphoric hopes invested in them when communism collapsed. The Catholic church, meanwhile, has driven many into left-wing groups like the Union of Labour (UP) by its steamroller tactics over abortion, religious instruction in state schools and its insistence on the return of church property. Even so, the mainstream Democratic Union could have made a much greater impact on the electorate had it decided to make better use of its best political asset, the popularity of Mrs Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime minister. The elegant, no-nonsense lawyer from western Poland was plucked from relative obscurity in July last year and managed to pick up the pieces left behind by the ineffectual right-wing government led by Mr Jan Olszewski, a former Solidarity lawyer. She quietly established a clear set of priorities for the new government and managed to keep together the extraordinary coalition of seven parties ranging from free-market liberals to protectionist peasant farmers and Catholic traditionalists. The government was eventually toppled by one vote at the end of May by the trade union wing of Solidarity, whose demands for higher pay for teachers and other public service workers would have overburdened the budget and put at risk Poland's close relations with the IMF and the World Bank. The defeat was unexpected and unwanted. The Liberal and UD ministers at the core of the government had managed to keep government spending under control and were presiding over an economic recovery which could have transformed the government's chances of re-election in a year or so. Once the government fell, however, it would have been logical for the UD's campaign managers to send Mrs Suchocka around the country, tirelessly trawling for votes as the symbol of good governance. It did not happen. Mrs Suchocka's good-natured face graces a thousand billboards around the country but her electoral appearances have been few and she has spent most of her time in Warsaw quietly and competently running the caretaker government. This may have been good for Poland. But without her the UD has run a defensive, lacklustre campaign, fending off attacks from right and left but unable to counter the rising self-confidence of the former communist, now avowedly social democratic, left. As Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Poland's last communist prime minister, summed up yesterday: 'The left has not won this election campaign, the Solidarity parties have lost it.' But there was no triumphalism in his voice. The new rules, under which parties which win less than 5 per cent of the vote fail to enter the new parliament, plus the likelihood that nearly half the electorate will not turn out to vote, raise a worrying possibility. Monday morning could see a new parliament heavily tilted towards the left but excluding many smaller parties including the Liberal free-market and right-wing nationalist parties. That could shift the focus of Polish politics out of parliament and on to the streets once more. For it would create a 'silent majority' of those not represented in parliament who could be tempted to declare open season on whatever centre-left or left-of-centre coalition emerges from the political horsetrading that will start once the results are known.</p>

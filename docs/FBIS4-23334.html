			<p>BFN     [Text] The government and three public service unions today  signed an agreement to review workers' salaries and conditions  of service with effect from 1 April 1994. The chairman of the  joint negotiating team, Mr. Namukolo Mukutu, declined to give  the percentages of the increases. Speaking at a joint signing  ceremony at Dalvadia Hostel in Lusaka this afternoon, Mr. Mukutu  said it is important for Zambians to realize that negotiations  for salaries and conditions of service are private matters  between employers and employees. Mr. Mukutu explained that the  negotiations are based on ensuring the wellbeing of the workers  and ensuring the negotiations do not create undue pressure on  the national economy. The public service unions had earlier  declined an offer by government of a 30 percent increase  calculated on the amount of 12 billion kwacha set aside for the  negotiations by the state.</p>

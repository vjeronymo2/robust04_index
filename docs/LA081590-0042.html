			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY SAYS L.A. FACES FINANCIAL CRISIS  </P> <P> Already financially strapped, Los Angeles is heading for a severe economic  crisis because of problems in the Middle East and an unanticipated downturn in  the local economy, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Only six weeks into the new fiscal year, the city's reserve fund already is  down to $10 million, substantially lower than the $45 million available at the  same time last year, the councilman said.  </P> <P> As chairman of the council's Budget and Finance Committee, Yaroslavsky has  asked city administrators to come up with a contingency plan to address the  shortfalls. A continued city hiring freeze is certain, he said, and layoffs are  possible.  </P> <P> "We need to cut back now," Yaroslavsky said. "We're still spending more than  we're taking in."  </P> <P> At Yaroslavsky's insistence, the City Council already has forced city  department heads to drastically cut back their requests for money for the  1990-91 fiscal year, which began July 1.  </P> <P> But the city's financial position has deteriorated further in the three months  since that budget was approved, Yaroslavsky said, and further cuts will be  necessary to head off a budget deficit that could reach $100 million.  </P> <P> As an initial measure, Yaroslavsky said, he will ask the City Council to delay  indefinitely the proposed purchase of $27 million in equipment that is to be  considered at today's council meeting. The money had been earmarked for the  Fire and Police departments as well as the Department of General Services.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley agrees with Yaroslavsky's proposal to delay the equipment  purchases, but issued no statement Tuesday about the city's overall budget  outlook, said Vallee Bunting, a spokeswoman.  </P> <P> When Bradley first proposed the current $3.6-billion budget last April, he said  the city was on a financial tightrope that made necessary an array of new and  increased taxes.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, in a letter to City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie, said this  week that that budget was adopted "with the expectation that our national and  regional economies would continue to grow at a modest rate." The budget now  appears optimistic, he said.  </P> <P> City tax revenues have been declining because of continuing layoffs and plant  closures in the aerospace industry, lagging retail sales and decreased tourism.  </P> <P> The crisis in the Middle East has driven up gasoline prices and greatly  increased costs to the city, which is a major purchaser of fuel, he said.  </P> <P> Further, officials have been slow to begin collecting a new 10% city parking  tax, which was to have brought in $22.5 million this year, he said. The actual  revenue from the tax will be far lower, he said.  </P> <P> "We are faced with a situation where our revenue prospects are shrinking, our  expenses are growing and our reserve fund is inadequate," he said.  </P> <P> The settlement of just three or four substantial lawsuits against the city  could wipe out the fund entirely, he added.  </P></p>

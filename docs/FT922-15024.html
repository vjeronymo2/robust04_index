			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Trans World loss reduced to Pounds 1.15m TRANS WORLD Communic-ations, the commercial radio group which used to own Miss World, cut pre-tax losses to Pounds 1.15m last year compared with Pounds 1.84m in 1990. The group, which runs stations such as Piccadilly Radio in Manchester and Red Rose in Preston, hopes to return to profit this year and begin paying dividends again in 1993. Mr John Whitney, recently appointed chairman of Trans World, said yesterday that as a result of a successful Pounds 12m rights issue and a new management structure he was confident 'the group is now on a firm base from which steady progress will be made.' Mr Whitney, a former director general of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, believes that the creation of a Radio Advertising Bureau and the arrival of new national commercial stations will raise radio's profile and increase its share of national advertising. Turnover fell by 12 per cent to Pounds 11.38m although the fall was only 8 per cent when the disposal of Miss World in December 1990 is taken into account. Market share for the company's four stations, broadcasting 8 services, increased in the final quarter of 1991 by nearly 4 per cent to 25.9 per cent. Trans World also said that the first quarter this year showed an upward trend in revenue with January and February sales up 46 per cent on the same period in 1991.</p>

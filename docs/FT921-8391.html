			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Reece issues profits warning Reece, the machine tools, brick making and nursing homes group, yesterday issued a profits warning following recent weakness in its share price. Directors anticipate a pre-tax loss in the second half but expect the group to show a profit for the full year. Indications were that the figure would be similar to the Pounds 415,000 pre-tax returned for the 15 months to December 31 1990.</p>

In 1993, the handling capacity of Tianjin port topped 37  million tons, up 27 percent over the previous year, or eight  million tons more than in 1992.    More than 22 million tons of it, or some 60 percent, was for  imports and exports, a rise of 15 percent from a year earlier,  the highest increase rate among the country's large ports.    Latest statistics show that foreign trade through Tianjin  port were worth 12.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, and about  70 percent of the trade volume resulted from imports and exports  via the port by other parts of the country. [sentence as  received]    The port now has business ties with all the provinces and  regions of the country, as well as more than 160 countries and  regions across the world.    Situated on Bohai Bay, Tianjin is economically important to  north China, whose imports and exports are conducted mainly  through the port. But the port's annual volume of two-way trade  remained at around seven million tons before the country's drive  of reform and opening-up was launched 15 years ago, owing to the  lack of berths and limited storage capacity.    This year, Tianjin port became one of the first in China to  exercise autonomy in collecting funds and expanding cooperation  with overseas. The port's infrastructure has consequently much  improved.    The port has built the country's largest wharf for  containers, with annual handling capacity reaching 700,000  standard containers.    Tianjin port has also introduced advanced loading and  unloading equipment to enable it to handle 3.5 million and 3.2  million tons of bulk grain and salt a year, respectively.    Meanwhile, the installation of some modern packing equipment  has helped Tianjin port become one of China's three largest  centres for packing bulk fertilizers.    Tianjin port is also home to the country's first 10,000-ton  three-sided freight berth and the first oil berth exclusively  for shipping oil from southern Xinjiang, a remote region in  northwest China.    Tianjin port now has more than 130 berths, 44 of which are  10,000-ton ones.    Tianjin has now ten ports engaged in foreign trade.    The expanded Tianjin airport has an apron of 155,000 square  meters, capable of accommodating the parking of 17 large and  medium-sized planes at the same time. The 3,200-meter-long and  50-meter-wide runway allows landing and taking-off of all sorts  of planes below 300 tons.    Designed to allow 90,000 landings and take-offs a year, the  airport is among China's six largest. It saw a throughput of  380,000 passengers and 270,000 tons of cargo in 1993.    Tianjin has also built China's first port for the shipment  of  liquefied sulphur and set up the country's first cross-border  truck transportation corps.    Sources said that the annual handling capacity of Tianjin  has  increased by 30 million tons in the past 15 years. During that  period, the port city handled a total of 290 million tons of  cargo, worth more than 100 billion U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barlows passes dividend PRE-TAX losses almost doubled to Pounds 654,000 at Barlows in 1992 and the property company decided to omit its final dividend. The company attributed the further decline from 1991's Pounds 339,000 deficit to the disposal of its interest in Trinity Court, Manchester, to its joint partner, the Church Commissioners; the cost of delay in letting two other joint ventures, together with reductions in their asset values; and a reduction in the value of the rest of the portfolio. Net asset value per share at December 31 stood at 69.8p, down from 85.2p. Losses per share rose to 2.65p (0.77p). The interim dividend of 0.825p was the sole payment - in 1991 the total was 2.475p. The shares fell 3p to 43p. The directors said that following the sale of Trinity Court, the value of the remaining property portfolio amounted to Pounds 28m.</p>

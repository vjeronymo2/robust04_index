			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Fewer bangs for less bucks: The US defence industry is restructuring in response to deep cuts in weapons procurement After a 'bottom up review' of US defence requirements last year, Mr Les Aspin, the then secretary of defence, invited industry bosses to the Pentagon. He explained that, despite the recent slimming by defence companies, the industry was still too big for Pentagon orders to prop up. Defence companies would have no choice but to retrench and consolidate further. As the industry chief executives headed for the door, they turned to each other and said with one voice: 'Well, I guess you guys really have a problem.' There is no doubt that the US defence industry faces a testing time. In the past decade the defence budget has been cut by a third in real terms from Dollars 401bn to Dollars 269bn, and the number of military personnel will have fallen from 2m in 1985 to 1.5m by 1997. But the cut in weapons procurement, and hence the impact on companies, has been even more significant. From the peak of the Reagan arms build-up in 1985, the US budget for weapons purchases is almost two-thirds lower in real terms, down from Dollars 132bn to Dollars 48bn. In 1985, the US bought more than 31,000 new missiles, this year it will buy fewer than 2,500. The continually rising price of military technology has added an extra turn of the screw. In 1975, a slack period of defence spending following the end of the Vietnam war, the Pentagon could still afford to buy 293 fixed-wing combat aircraft. Next year it will get just 28. Companies have had to respond rapidly to the constraints. At McDonnell Douglas, the company which makes the F/A-18 and F-15 fighters as well as the C-17 transport aircraft and commercial airliners, the workforce has almost halved in four years from 133,000 to 66,000. Most other large defence companies have made similar cuts. According to Bankers Trust, a US bank, employment in the industry has fallen from 1.35m in 1990 to 800,000 now and may hit 600,000 within three years. To combat the squeeze, companies have also been buying and selling subsidiaries in an effort to cut the number of aircraft, electronics and missile manufacturers. Yet as the meeting at the Pentagon suggested, most chief executives think their companies will survive, and most want to increase their presence rather than shrink it. This bias is reflected in the pattern of transactions since the end of the cold war in 1989. Several of the deals, such as IBM's sale of its defence computing business to Loral, and General Electric's sale of its aerospace division to Martin Marietta, have been of predominantly non-defence companies deciding to leave a difficult market to the specialists. Of those running companies predominantly in defence, only Mr William Anders, chairman of General Dynamics between 1991 and 1993, has so far taken the strategic decision to quit the field. He sold his F-16 fighter plant to aerospace company Lockheed, his missile business to missile specialists Hughes Aircraft, his space launch business to Martin Marietta, and his non-military aircraft business to Textron. General Dynamics is left with only its tanks and submarines operations, where it is the sole US manufacturer, and which Mr Anders said last year he 'probably could not sell even if I wanted to'. Other large defence companies, most notably Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and Martin Marietta, are probably big enough and have a sufficient backlog of orders to be sure of remaining in the defence business. They can afford to wait for the right buying opportunities. Mr Daniel Tellup, chairman of Lockheed, says: 'There is much more consolidation ahead. Everyone is looking at everyone else, and we will have to be opportunistic.' Pressure is most acute for small and medium-sized companies with weak finances and products that are nearing the end of their production runs. Northrop has made the B-2 stealth bomber since the late 1980s, but as each aircraft cost more than Dollars 850m, production was stopped at 20 last year, though efforts are being made to restart the programme. Aircraft maker Grumman was also short of current products and the two merged earlier this year. Mr Kent Kresa, chairman of Northrop Grumman, says: 'Most people have so far perceived themselves as buyers, yet as the options narrow some will be forced to become sellers.' His merged company hopes to mitigate the misery by reducing central overhead costs, and draw on its stealth technology - which makes aircraft hard to see with radar - for the next generation of weapons. Mr Tellup thinks that over the next 10 years the US will be down to two military aircraft manufacturers, two space and missiles companies and two big electronics groups with a smaller number of component suppliers. Since, for example, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, Boeing and Northrop Grumman all still make aircraft, that implies some painful decisions to come. Such a radical concentration has also raised fears that the US Federal Trade Commission or Justice Department may try to block mergers on antitrust grounds. Many in the industry think that the idea of a fully competitive market in weapons procurement is alien when there is only one buyer, the US government, and a couple of sellers, locked together in 30-year projects. Most regard fully competitive tendering for large weapons systems as a luxury the US can no longer afford. Mr Wolfgang Demisch, defence expert with Bankers Trust, says: 'The US has already taken the emotional decision that it is prepared to accept monopolies. We have a monopoly in tanks, in submarines and in strategic bombers. Now the combat aircraft business is imploding rapidly. We are simply not prepared to carry the cost of propping up artificial competition.' Fortunately, however, boiling down the bones of defence contracts is not the only option open to the industry, and many hard-pressed companies are hoping for overseas sales to maintain production. Yet here too defence budgets are being cut, and the international market is becoming increasingly competitive. Buying effective weapons from strong political allies may still be a priority for purchasing governments such as Gulf states, but value for money now counts too. That can leave US companies at a disadvantage. Their equipment often incorporates the highest technology and is correspondingly expensive. The US industry is also tooled up for long production runs, so as volumes have shrunk in recent years its huge research and development costs have had to be spread over smaller numbers. As a result, unit prices for US equipment have risen compared with their competitors. Rising prices not only hurt potential sales abroad, at home they threaten to price the most sophisticated weapons out of existence - as they have with the B-2 bomber. 'We have to learn to cut fixed costs and do research more economically,' says a defence executive. 'The escalating price of the B-2 marked the point where the US could no longer afford to buy bombers, and we cannot let that happen to other weapons systems.' The industry is making an effort to cut fixed costs, as the heavy redundancies show. Yet some companies are reaching the point where they cannot cut further and still retain the capability to build complex systems such as fighters or nuclear submarines. In certain cases, the US government has accepted the strategic case for retaining some central technologies. It will almost certainly order a Dollars 2bn Seawolf submarine from General Dynamics which the navy neither wants nor needs, simply to keep the Groton, Connecticut, yard going into the next century. More innovative ideas are also being tried. McDonnell Douglas has established a 'Phantom Works' advanced engineering laboratory, along the lines of Lockheed's longstanding 'Skunk Works'. The Phantom Works is experimenting with production techniques which could revolutionise aircraft manufacture and cut the tooling cost of setting up a production line. The aim is to cut the fixed cost of any operation so that high-tech systems can be manufactured economically in small numbers. Computer-controlled high-speed cutting, for example, allows complex parts to be machined from a single piece of metal at a quarter of the cost of traditional methods. Cheap, disposable moulds for composite materials can be aligned using lasers and 'software tools' to do away with the expensive metal tooling which the industry usually relies on to assemble aircraft. Lockheed too has proved the worth of advanced engineering in small production runs. The company made the F-117 stealth fighter at its Skunk Works in conditions of great secrecy during the early 1980s. Despite the fact that only 59 were built, Lockheed managed to keep the cost below Dollars 45m per aircraft. 'Some overseas companies are gambling that the US will not become a cost-effective manufacturer for export,' says one insider. 'I wouldn't bet my business on that.' While the F-117 project gained from advanced techniques, it also had the huge advantage of a trouble-free (and secret) passage through the congressional procurement mill. As companies are cutting costs to help themselves, and getting some orders from the government to ease the contraction pains, they still have to navigate the cumbersome US budget process each year. This is the single biggest factor limiting the competitiveness of the US defence industry. Since procurement works on a system of annual budgets, every development or manufacturing programme is up for debate every year, regardless of how far it has progressed. As a result, the development or manufacture of any system can be stopped or started at any time, and often for political reasons, such as protecting jobs, which have little to do with military need. Companies do not help their case, however, by lobbying congressmen to support their programmes and undermine those of rivals. Horror stories about the budget process and procurement abound. Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, tells one about an incident where 30 companies working in three teams had responded to a government invitation to bid on a contract, only to be told 24 hours before the bids were due that the government had changed its mind and no bids would be accepted. The companies had spent more than two years and Dollars 100m on their proposals and had to drop them. The current secretary of defence, Mr William Perry, is committed to reforming procurement. However, his efforts are mainly aimed at simplifying the labyrinthine contracts between the Pentagon and defence groups. Most industrialists think this is a useful reform, but that it does not attack the worst problem: congressional interference. Some projects - notably the controversially expensive C-17 transport aircraft - have been stopped for years in the development phase and then restarted. Others, such as the F-22 fighter aircraft, have slipped behind their original development and production schedules. Both cause huge disruption to the companies and, because the Pentagon requires detailed budgets at all times, involve large amounts of management time. 'What the Congress does not seen to realise,' says one exasperated executive, 'is that you are not simply altering one thing by stretching a programme out. Thousands of other decisions are dependent on timing and we have to rework all of them. In the end that just adds to the cost which the US government has to pay.' With Congress determined not to limit its freedom of action to decide federal spending, the horse trading at the annual budget is unlikely to change. Congress seems prepared to accept that some weapons systems, such as the B-2 bomber and potentially the C-17 transport aircraft, can be priced out of production by a mix of botched development at the companies involved and politics. As the economic pressure for consolidation into a few global defence companies increases, the US is still best placed to lead. US companies operate in a unified defence market twice the size of that in Europe. They can consolidate more easily than their European counterparts. They have the technological edge. Yet unless the industry can engineer more consistency and less political manoeuvring into its planning, it may not be able to take full advantage of its strong position. As Mr Demisch of Bankers Trust puts it: 'Overseas arms manufacturers are fortunate indeed that the US procurement process is not yet as well organised as it should be.'</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / German growth rate beaten Britain's manufacturing productivity growth was 'superior' to that of Germany during the period 1979-1989, claims a study of productivity in the two countries over the past 30 years. The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It found that 'at the level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979. 'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity growth performance over the entire three decades to 1989,' it added. The report said that in 1989, 23 industries had higher productivity levels in Germany than in Britain, whereas in 1960 Germany had an advantage in only 17 industries. German manufacturing productivity peaked in superiority in 1979, when only three industries performed better in Britain - leather and footwear; drink and tobacco production. In 1960 labour productivity was only 4 percentage points higher in Germany than in Britain; by 1973 the gap had widened to 19.4 and six years later to 40 per cent. But by 1989 the difference had narrowed to 16.5 percentage points. The study calculates that aggregate labour productivity growth in Germany from 1960 to 1989 was 'a little less than half a percentage point higher per year than in Britain'. However, only six out of the 30 industries covered had a lower productivity performance in Germany than in Britain in 1989. These were mineral products; iron and steel; office machinery; electrical engineering; drink and tobacco production. In 1960, 13 out of the 30 industries had a better level of labour productivity in Britain. The largest productivity gap in 1989 was in the printing, publishing and paper industries where Germany was more than 50 per cent more productive. German dominance was also clear in ceramic goods manufacture; mechanical engineering; vehicle production and instrument engineering. The report attributes the better UK performance in the 1980s to the labour market freeing itself 'from the worst forms of restrictive practices'. The report adds that Britain still lags in the number of manufacturing workers with skills; in the volume of resources devoted to research and development; and in investment in new plant and machinery. The study found that in 1989 Germany had 30 per cent more physical capital per worker-hour in manufacturing than Britain. Changing Fortunes. NIESR No7. Pounds 11.50.</p>

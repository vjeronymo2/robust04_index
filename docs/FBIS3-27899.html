			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hong Kong-based correspondent Kim Song-yong] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that North Korea recently sent  a large-scale survey team to the Shenzhen and Zuhai special  economic zones in Guangdong Province to conduct an intensive  study of Chinese reform and openness. The North Korean move  seems to be in preparation for the partial opening it is  reported to be considering for the first half of this year,  North Korean sources in Hong Kong said on 30 January.    According to the sources, North Korea on 20 December  dispatched to Shenzhen--China's first special economic zone--a  survey team consisting of some 20 members of section chief-level  officials from major organizations such as the Ministry of  Foreign Trade, the External Economic Committee, and the Academy  of Sciences. Since then, the survey team has been conducting a  survey on the background of the establishment of the special  economic zone, layout of land, the way of controlling residents  between the special economic zone and the ordinary areas, the  foreign capital introduction policy and laws and regulations  thereof, and the activities of the trading firms in the special  economic zone. It has been learned that the survey team has  been keeping its government in Pyongyang informed of its  findings through the North Korean trade missions in Guangzhou,  Beijing, and Shenyang. North Korea increased the personnel of  its trade mission in Guangzhou by five persons last August, and  this is taken to have a bearing on its survey of the special  economic zone.    Since last December, North Korea has also been dispatching a  number of senior officials from the Light Industry Ministry, the  External Economic Committee, the Nungna Trade General Bureau,  and the Unha Trade General Corporation to the southern district  of China, including Zuhai.    The North Korean survey team, which is expected to stay in  China until February, thinks the Shenzhen model is suitable for  North Korea in that Shenzhen is independently managed in the  manner of being cut off from other areas, therefore, North Korea  is very likely to apply the Shenzhen model to the prospective  North Korean areas for the introduction of openness, such as the  Najin-Sonbong area, Chongjin, Haeju, Nampo, and Sinuiju, the  sources said.</p>

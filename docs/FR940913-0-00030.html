			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considerable discussion, the Committee unanimously recommended amending paragraph (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Seed peanuts <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of &sect;998.100 to clarify that Segregation 2 seed peanuts meeting certain quality requirements may be stored and shelled with Segregation 1 seed peanut lots. Currently, paragraph (e) specifies that Segregation 3 seed peanut lots with visible  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aspergillus flavus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mold must be stored and shelled separate and apart from other peanuts. The regulation does not specifically state that Segregation 2 seed peanuts containing up to three percent damaged kernels and no visible  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aspergillus flavus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> mold can be stored and shelled with Segregation 1 seed lots if the seed peanuts were produced under the auspices of a State agency. The Committee believes that the current provisions authorize such commingling but believe that the authority should be expressly stated to avoid confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee noted that requiring Segregation 2 seed peanuts to be stored separately from Segregration 1 seed peanuts would increase the number of storage bins handlers needed to maintain separation. This would increase handler costs. It also noted that requiring the Segregation 2 seed peanuts to be shelled separate and apart from Segregation 1 seed peanuts would increase handler shelling costs with no apparent benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Committee recommended adding a sentence to paragraph (e) clarifying that seed peanut lots may be stored and shelled with Segregation 1 lots if: (1) The seed peanuts do not exceed 3 percent total damage and have no visible  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aspergillus flavus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> mold; and (2) both the Segregation 2 seed peanut lot and the Segregation 1 seed peanut lot are produced under the auspices of a State agency which regulates or controls the production of seed peanuts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also provides that the unchanged portions of the incoming, outgoing, and indemnification regulations currently in effect under the agreement for 1993 crop peanuts be established for 1994 and subsequent crop peanuts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 18, 1994, [59 FR 36353] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through August 17, 1994. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (5 U.S.C. 553) because: (1) This action clarifies requirements currently in effect for peanut handlers who are signatory to the agreement; and (2) the interim final rule provided that interested persons could file comments through August 17, 1994. No comments were received and the Department is adopting a final rule, without change, the provisions of the interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 998  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Peanuts, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 998 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 998_MARKETING AGREEMENT REGULATING THE QUALITY OF DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED PEANUTS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR part 998 which was published at 59 FR 36353 on July 18, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Eric M.

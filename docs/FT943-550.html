			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Rulings today on sex equality in pensions: A look at what will be the definitive word from the European Court of Justice The European Court of Justice takes the unprecedented step today of ruling simultaneously on six cases, each involving sex equality in pensions schemes. The rulings are expected to provide the definitive word on how employers and scheme trustees are expected to provide equal pensions for men and women - an issue which has been before the court since the end of the 1980s. In May 1990 it ruled that because pension benefits are in effect a form of deferred pay, the European employers' tradition of offering more generous pension terms to women violated sex equality laws. But having made its ruling, the court found it was flooded with cases asking how the ruling is to be applied. Last October, it settled what was probably the most contentious of those questions before it, ruling that no employer could retrospectively be required to provide equal pensions for men and women for periods of employment before May 1990. But numerous issues remain outstanding and they are not simply academic. Billions of pounds of expenditure by employers or billions of pounds of benefits to scheme members throughout Europe hang in the balance. One of the cases, Vroege v NCV Institut, asks the court whether employers who do not allow part-timers, mostly women, to obtain pension benefits are discriminating on the basis of sex. If so, actuaries at UK-based consultants R Watson calculate that part-timers could claim retrospective benefits as far back as 1976, which would cost UK employers alone some Pounds 10bn. Employers in other European states, notably the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and Belgium could face similar bills. Particularly hard hit will be employers who did not require their employees to contribute any portion of their pay to the pension scheme. While women in contributory schemes may be deterred from claiming retrospective benefits if they have to make retrospective contributions, women in non-contributory schemes are unlikely to have such inhibitions. However, other pension experts note that the court has taken a tough stand on retrospective rights and consistently agreed that employers did not need to provide them before May 1990. Moreover, the court is expected to confirm an opinion last year of its Advocate General that although employers may equalise pension benefits by worsening conditions for women, they will have to improve what they offer men for employment service between May 1990 and whatever date the scheme instituted equal pension rights. The outcome of the ruling could have significant implications for the European insurance industry which sells annuities to those on the brink of retirement. The lead case before the court is that of Coloroll, a UK home furnishings and fabrics company which became insolvent in 1989, leaving independent trustees in charge of maintaining numerous employee pension schemes. Among the questions the court must resolve is whether it is the trustees of the scheme or the employer itself which has the obligation to equalise benefits. For an insolvent employer such as Coloroll, improving benefits for men means penalising female members of a scheme. The question is particularly thorny for UK, Irish and Dutch pension schemes. In the UK, hundreds of employers had become insolvent in the recession of the early 1990s and their pension schemes have been unable to be wound up until this issue is resolved. Another issue arising from the Coloroll case is whether so-called defined contribution schemes - those in which final pension benefits are based on the investment returns of contributions - require employers to make equal contributions for men and women. Because women typically live longer than men, a woman will need a larger lump sum to purchase an annuity from an insurance company which will provide income until she dies. For the UK, the judgment will allow hundreds of pension schemes of insolvent employers such as Coloroll to be formally wound up. Legal and General, the UK life insurer, estimates that these schemes hold assets of Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m which are likely to be invested in so-called deferred annuities to pay pensions for thousands of workers. Other questions before the court are whether employers can 'red circle' existing female scheme members to protect their benefits, whether married women can be barred from participating in occupational pension schemes and whether the occupational scheme for Dutch civil servants is a social security scheme.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro, Statoil in swap NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest listed company, and Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, have agreed to swap shareholdings in a planned pipeline and two oil and gas fields which are under development. The terms of the deal call for Statoil to receive from Norsk Hydro a cash payment of between NKr150m (Dollars 20.8m) and NKr170m (Dollars 23.5m), a 1.25 per cent stake in the Heidrun oil and gas field, and a 1.25 per cent stake in the planned Haltenpipe pipeline. In exchange, Norsk Hydro will receive from Statoil a 10 per cent shareholding - half of which is owned by the state - in the Brage oil and gas field, which Hydro operates. The deal boosts Hydro's stake in the Brage field to 23.2 per cent from 13.2 per cent. Statoil's stake in the Heidrun field will be lifted to 11.25 per cent from 10 per cent as will its shareholding in the Haltenpipe pipeline. The exchange of assets will have to be approved by the industry and energy ministry. The state owns a 65 per cent stake in both the Heidrun field and in Haltenpipe and 33.4 per cent of Brage. Statoil's share in the Brage field is reduced to 12.6 per cent, while Norsk Hydro will relinquish to Statoil its shareholdings in both Heidrun and Haltenpipe, according to the terms of the deal. The NKr10.5bn Brage field is due to come on stream on November 15, earlier than planned originally. It contains an estimated 38.5m cubic metres of oil and 2.8bn cubic metres of natural gas. The NKr25bn Heidrun field is due to come on stream in the third quarter of 1995, when Statoil will take over its operation from Conoco Norway. The Haltenpipe pipeline, operated by Statoil, is designed to handle a minimum throughput of 2.2bn cubic metres of gas a year.</p>

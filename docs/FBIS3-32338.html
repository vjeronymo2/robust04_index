			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has asked Mexican  nongovernmental organizations to create a "peace cordon  [cinturon de paz] to avoid pressure, intimidation, or even  attacks" by the parties involved in conflict.    In a communique dated 1 February and released in this  southeastern Mexican city on Saturday [5 February], it was noted  that the request was made in view of the imminent start of peace  talks between Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel  Camacho Solis and the EZLN. The fact that the dialogue could be  held within a conflict zone would entail risks of provocation  that could obstruct or bog down the dialogue.    "With the goal of reducing undesirable tensions to a minimum  between the parties involved, a security or peace cordon should  be formed around the dialogue site to avoid pressure,  intimidation, or even attacks by one of the parties involved in  the conflict against the other."    Meanwhile, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said here  today that the direct talks with the EZLN "will be held very  soon," and he added that "everything is set and there are no  problems in holding the meeting."    After meeting with Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de  Las Casas -- the link between the armed group and the  commissioner -- Camacho said "we will come out ahead" in efforts  to find a peaceful solution in Chiapas. Buffer zones were  created to hold the meetings in the area of Los Altos de Chiapas  at the request of Camacho Solis. This request was accepted by  the armed group on Thursday. The towns of San Miguel and  Guadalupe Tepeyac, in north central and southeastern Chiapas,  respectively, were proposed as the two areas that will remain  free of any armed presence and where the International Red Cross  would provide assistance to the civilian population.    Camacho Solis explained this idea is intended "to create  areas of detente" to support the population that has been  adversely affected by the conflict. The armed group added that  it would withdraw its men from San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac  when the International Red Cross installs its camps to provide  the humanitarian aid.    On Saturday, the International Red Cross Committee announced  it would restore medical services in certain areas of Chiapas  and would organize a program to supervise the health centers run  by Mexican personnel. According to the plan, the International  Red Cross will only provide humanitarian aid to the civilian  population and medical treatment to all, including the  transportation of patients to hospitals in Chiapas or anywhere  else in the country as required.    Another action that contributed to the progress of the peace  process was the EZLN's sending of a communique to Bishop Ruiz.  In the communique, the rebels announced they would "shortly"  release former Chiapas State Governor Absalon Castellanos  Dominguez, who was kidnapped on 2 January.    In another communique addressed to the Executive  Coordinating  Commission of the State Council of Indian and Peasant  Organizations, the EZLN said those Zapatists who "had verbally  assaulted local residents who did not support our struggle have  been reprimanded." This communique added: "Neither physical nor  verbal threats to force anyone to join our struggle will be  tolerated from our troops and supporters. Our war laws are very  clear in this regard, and we have already taken action to  correct the damage done and to prevent the problem from  recurring."</p>

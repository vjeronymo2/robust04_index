			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Low demand for Lilliput Retail investors and employees have taken up only 24.7 per cent of the shares available to them in Lilliput Group, the Cumbria-based manufacturer of hand-painted miniature china cottages. The company earlier this month placed a total of 12.04m ordinary shares, priced at 135p, with institutional and other investors. Of the total, 4.2m were subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Just over 1m have been recalled, of which 35,000 will go to eligible employees. The flotation is raising Pounds 16.3m for existing shareholders and Pounds 2.43m net of expenses for the company, of which Pounds 1.47m will be used to redeem preference and deferred shares. Dealings begin tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program  Network in Persian at 1530 GMT carries its regular "Political  Roundtable" program. The guest in the 50-minute program is  Hojjat ol-Eslam Mostafa Ha'eri-Fumani, director general of the  Persian Gulf desk of the Iranian Foreign Ministry. He is  interviewed by an unidentified correspondent on the topic of the  stance of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] following the  recent foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, and the hajj issue.  The program follows its usual format of approximately  five-minute video reports interspersed with questions and  answers.    The first report repeats a Foreign Ministry statement in  response to the final communique of the GCC summit in Riyadh,  after which the correspondent asks:    "Mr. Fumani, although it was expected of the members of the  Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [PGCC] to stress, in their  final statement, the agreeable and positive aspects of relations  between members and regional countries, we see the final  statement causing greater tension among regional countries.  What is your evaluation of this sessions's final statement?"    Fumani replies: "In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. As you pointed out, it is a source of astonishment.  In a situation where the Islamic world, international society,  and in particular our region -- which is very sensitive -- need  tranquility and where Islamic countries need cooperative  thinking, a united vision, and cooperation, we witness meetings  which are producing results that contradict the needs of Muslim  people and nations, are more likely to create divisions and  tensions among nations, and issue statements and acts in line  with this.    "It seems to me that the final statement of the 50th session  of the foreign ministers of the PGCC cannot be evaluated  separately. These days we are witnessing acts that tend to  intensify divisions inside and outside the region. For example,  PGCC members have had differences and contradictions in the  past. But their differences have intensified these days. You  must have witnessed this; it was also in the international  media. For instance, divisions which erupted between Kuwait  and Qatar. Or previous differences between Qatar and Saudi  Arabia which have been again intensified and are well on the  agenda. In the session of the member countries of the PGCC, a  significant part of the discussions were on differences among  themselves. Furthermore, news available here and there and in  the media indicates that some member countries intensified  contradictions with their neighbors, such as what we are  witnessing in Yemen. Well, after a long separation and  following a desire by the nations of the former South and North  Yemen as well as the peoples of the region, the two Yemens  united and moved on the path of unity. But we are now  witnessing intense differences between the north and the south,  and we see some regional countries and even some members of the  PGCC aggravating the difficulties and contradictions between  these countries. Or things that we possibly see in the  intensification of domestic differences in Afghanistan -- where  a selfless and struggling nation managed to bring down its enemy  and take over the management of the country's affairs. But now  they are suffering from differences. Some Islamic countries, in  the region, instead of helping, are intensifying the  differences. There are the things that we see in the statement  of the 50th session regarding the Islamic Republic. Issues  regarding the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf and the  baseless claims made by one of these countries, the United Arab  Emirates. Of course this is not the first time that the claims  have been made, for the case has a 20-year history. It has been  made four or five times. But it has intensified recently.  Taking into account the international situation and the  situation in the Middle East, taking into account the fact that  some persons outside the region wish to impose a prepared and  predetermined plan on regional countries; taking into account  the long struggle against the Zionist enemy in some countries;  and taking into account the fact that the Islamic world needs  cooperation and unity; and taking into account the crafty acts  of the Zionist regime and the killing of Muslims -- the killing  of innocents at a time of prayer and fasting -- it is necessary  for Muslims to unite in order to attain their ideals and goals."    These remarks are followed by a report on background to the  GCC and a repeat of a commentary on the GCC's stance toward the  issue of the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser  Tunbs.    Asked to assess Iran's relations with the PGCC member  countries, Fumani replies: "Our neighboring countries,  particularly the states that are situated in the southern  section of the Persian Gulf, or in other words, members of the  PGCC, had previously also made wrong a analysis and this is not  the first time they have fallen for a wrong analysis. During  the Iraqi war against Iran they made a wrong analysis, thinking  that Iran was their enemy. I remember that case from the time  when I was the ambassador to the region, in the United Arab  Emirates; when we held meetings with them they would say, in a  friendly way, that we are afraid of Iran and that if Iran  becomes a powerful regional country it may pose a threat against  us or our interests." He goes on to say that during the past 15  years Iran has always supported its neighbors and its foreign  policy gives priority to its ties with other neighboring and  Muslims countries.    Fumani continues: "During the war that Saddam Husayn waged  against Iran all of those countries, in one way or the other,  supported the Ba'thist regime of Saddam, making him powerful in  order to avert a situation created by their wrong analysis,  thinking that a powerful Islamic Republic would pose a threat  against them." He then says that the Persian Gulf littoral  states realized their mistake when Saddam invaded Kuwait.    He continues: Since the second Persian Gulf war we have  witnessed some changes in the judgement and thinking of those  countries and in the way they have opted for appropriate  stances, but at a very slow-moving pace. If we wanted to give  an assessment of the trend of our ties with the regional  countries during the last 15 years, we could describe it as a  developing process and an expanding process. That is the  expansion of relations. But we have never been satisfied with  the slow-moving expansion of ties. We believe that regional  countries, as neighbors of the Islamic Republic, should be able  to live side by side the Islamic Republic, have a peaceful life,  live in an atmosphere of understanding and a healthy climate,  and work alongside each other in a healthy and peaceful  situation, particularly when it comes to the safeguarding of the  sensitive waterway of the Persian Gulf, which can serve all  regional interests.    "During the last 15 years the process of our relations with  those countries has varied. Our relations are better with some  of those countries. Our relations with some of those countries  have reached a level where many agreements and memorandums are  forged and are developing in a satisfactory manner. In future  we should witness the presence of high-ranking officials from a  number of those countries in the Islamic Republic. Of course  Qatar is currently leading the way and its highest official,  even higher than its Foreign Ministry officials -- the crown  prince -- has already been to Iran. In future we shall see the  highest ranking officials of Kuwait and Qatar in the Islamic  Republic. We shall, God willing, hold meetings with them in a  friendly and sincere atmosphere which should present a supreme  model of neighborly and peaceful life to the people of the  region."    The correspondent says: "Mr. Fumani, the majority of the  PGCC  members adopt a united stance. But when they meet separately  with Islamic Republic officials they adopt stances different  from those taken at the PGCC. What is the reason for that?"    Fumani replies: "That is right. That is an issue which we  also raise with them. Some of those countries, in separate and  private talks with us, say that we should not attribute the PGCC  actions to them and that, in fact, their relationship with us is  a special one. Of course during the 11th and 12th PGCC sessions,  and particularly the 12th session which was held in Kuwait,  they reviewed the issue more precisely. A number of those  countries mentioned that they wanted to have special relations  with the Islamic Republic and the Council, as a whole, sometimes  acts in a way which is disturbing to bilateral moves. It was in  that session that they made the decision to allow every  individual member to establish separate ties with the Islamic  Republic, and a number of those countries took further steps in  that context. Obviously the role of a number of those countries  -- that play a more influential role in the adoption of their  collective stances, as you know -- is very effective, and we are  aware of them."    The program is interrupted at 1600 GMt for a seven-minute  newscast. The program resumes with a report on the dispute with  Saudi Arabia on the issue of the hajj. An announcer reads the  following commentary. After the news bulletin, the final report  repeated Iran's accusation that Saudi Arabia had broken the deal  with Iran on the number of pilgrim's for this year's hajj, see  IRTV1 021644, but added that the Saudi authorities had taken the  decision under pressure from Washington. Fumani's comments on  the subject were mild compared to previous Iranian  pronouncements, saying that Iran understood that Saudi Arabia  could not cope with a massive influx of pilgrims every year.  [passage omitted]    "This year, the Saudi regime -- in violation of previous  agreements and the results of negotiations between Tehran and  Riyadh -- has announced that, because of particular  difficulties, it will accept only 60,000 Iranian pilgrims.  Therefore, the Saudi regime has once again started to put a  spanner in the works of the great gathering of the world's  Muslims. Arabia took this stance at a time when a number of  events during recent months had strengthened the idea that  Riyadh, taking into account regional and global realities, had  reexamined its policies and discovered that an improvement in  relations with Tehran was an objective and tangible necessity.    "A number of political experts, considering these  developments, believed that Arabian authorities had apparently  found out that the efforts of Western powers, especially  America, to prevent an improvement of relations of other  countries with the Islamic Republic of Iran was only in the  interest of Washington and would, in practice, be to the  detriment of regional countries. These experts emphasized that  Riyadh did not see its anti-Islamic Iran policies to be in its  interest, and viewed efforts to exclude the most powerful  country of the region from regional developments as a useless  effort.    "Although a number of events had pointed to the correctness  of this analysis and the pragmatism of the Saudi rulers in  certain situations, the recent policies of Arabia show that  because of certain reasons, including renewed pressure from the  White House, the Riyadh authorities have not yet reached a clear  understanding of future regional relations." The announcer goes  on to state that participation presence in the hajj is the right  of Iranian Muslims.    The announcer then asks Fumani to comment on the hajj issue.  After discussing the importance of the hajj for Muslims, Fumani  says: "We have had difficulties over the past 15 years  concerning the hajj. Considering the large number of people in  our country who enthusiastically wish to be honored by visiting  the house of God...[pauses] On the other hand, Saudi Arabian  officials have always said that the holy places do not have the  capacity for a large number of pilgrims. Of course, whenever  there was tension in our relations with Saudi Arabia, it would  affect the hajj; or vice versa: whenever there was a problem  over the hajj, it would affect bilateral relations. We have  always told Saudi Arabia that bilateral relations should be  separate from the issues of hajj; and that hajj is an  international Islamic issue, it does not concern one or two  countries alone."    He then says: "Saudi Government officials have always said  that the house of God does not have the capacity for a flood,  for a large influx of people. This is, of course,  understandable." He then reviews the history of the hajj quota  system, and says that the Saudi authorities are not observing an  agreement made between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi  Arabia in Muscat, Oman, in 1993. He says: "The Saudi authorities  are not abiding by this agreement. Of course, this is still  unacceptable for the Islamic Republic. At the same time, we do  understand what Saudi government officials are saying when they  announce that the holy places do not have the capacity. Of  course, they in turn must understand the situation of the  Islamic Republic and abide by their promises and signatures. We  have announced to the Saudi Government that we are ready to hold  negotiations." The program ends at 1620 GMT.</p>

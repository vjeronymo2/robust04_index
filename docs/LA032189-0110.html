			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Polaroid Developments: A Delaware judge granted an injunction sought by  Shamrock Holdings Inc. to keep Polaroid from completing its share repurchase  program, one of the key elements in the instant camera firm's fight against  Shamrock's $45-a-share takeover bid. Shamrock, a radio and television concern  owned by the Roy E. Disney family, owns about 4.8 million shares of Polaroid  and is waging a proxy fight for control of the board. Polaroid has been  resisting Burbank-based Shamrock's bid since July. Shamrock had said that if  the injunction was not granted, it would tender its 4.9 million Polaroid  shares. The injunction was granted for one week while Shamrock appeals the  judge's rulings of last week to the Delaware Supreme Court.  </P></p>

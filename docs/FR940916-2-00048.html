The proposed effective date of the revised tariff sheets is October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that is filing proposes the recovery of certain stranded costs by means of Reservation Surcharges applicable to service under Rate Schedule FT, EFT and SCT and Volumetric Surcharges applicable to interruptible rates under Rate Schedules IT and EIT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that the revised tariff sheets filed herewith currently reflect the recovery of stranded costs removed from Panhandle's filing in Docket No. RP94&hyph;325&hyph;000 as a result of the Commission's August 19, 1994, Order in that docket. In the August 19, 1994, Order, certain Order No. 636 stranded costs were excluded from the Gas Supply Realignment (GSR) Surcharge that relate to Acount No. 165 recoupable take-or-pay and the unrecovered balance of a take-or-pay settlement agreement with a former affiliate. These two categories of costs became stranded upon the termination of Panhandle's merchant function and thus are recoverable costs. The Commission stated that Panhandle is not precluded from making a separate filing to recover these costs as stranded costs, although they were not considered by the Commission to be GSR costs. Accordingly, including in the instant filing are tariff sheets to establish such a mechanism that will commence the recovery of these stranded costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that copies of its filing have been served on all affected customers, and applicable state regulatory commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with &sect;&sect;385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

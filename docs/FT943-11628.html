			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Ford launches used-car factory Ford yesterday opened what it said was the world's first used-car factory, employing more than 200 on a 15-acre facility at Tilbury, Essex. The 'Ford Direct' plant, a joint venture between Ford, Silcock Express, the logistics group, and the Royal Automobile Club, has the capacity to recondition and prepare as many as 1,500 used cars a week for resale by Ford's network of franchised dealers. The venture is believed to be the first used-car retailing scheme in which the manufacturer takes direct responsibility for preparing vehicles for sale and providing warranties for them. The decision to go ahead with the project was taken in response to research by Ford over nearly two years which showed motorists to be 'deeply cynical' about the integrity of the retail motor trade. More than 13,000 Ford cars up to a year old and with a total showroom value of Pounds 105m have been refurbished and sold since the Ford Direct scheme, selling used cars with essentially new-car warranties and with a 30-day exchange option, started earlier this year. The cars have until now been prepared at four small regional centres. Ford is starting a pilot project in Scotland under which cars up to three years old will be brought within the scheme. In the Scottish scheme, the cars will be refurbished by dealers and passed to RAC engineers for independent assessment. About Pounds 5m has been spent on the Tilbury plant, which is being operated by Silcock Express on Ford's behalf, using Ford-trained personnel. Cars less than a year old are collected from Ford and its main fleet customers and taken to one of five Silcock regional distribution centres for shipment to Tilbury. At the plant cars are labelled with a bar code allowing them to be tracked through all stages of preparation. They then transfer to an inspection bay, where 20 RAC engineers assess the vehicles and list refurbishment requirements. Silcock Express, a subsidiary of the Tibbett and Britten logistics group, is the UK's biggest new-car distribution contractor, handling about 1.5m cars last year. Most of Ford's rivals run their own dealer-based 'manufacturer-approved' used-car retailing schemes, such as Vauxhall's Network Q operation, and dismissed Ford's initiative as a 'hyped-up' variation of their own schemes. Ford insisted, however, that its scheme eliminates the three most serious concerns voiced by consumers about other operations: that dealer-based 'independent' pre-sale checks and tests are neither properly independent nor rigorous; that warranties offered are not comprehensive enough; and that too often dealers try not to honour them.</p>

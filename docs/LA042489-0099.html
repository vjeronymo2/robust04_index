			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> RECORD OF COLLEGE GRAD, 11, STUDIED  </P> <P> Adragon De Mello made headlines last year by graduating from college at age 11,  but now his university is examining his high-pressure academic career, which  featured double course loads and frequent waivers and grade changes.  </P> <P> Adragon, who received a degree in computational mathematics from the University  of California at Santa Cruz, did well in some classes but in others struggled  to pass or failed to complete course work by the end of the term, according to  a published report.  </P> <P> UC's advising system seems to have "let him down," said Vice Chancellor Isebill  V. Gruhn. Adragon's counselors should have been alarmed by the pressures on the  boy and his often mediocre work, Gruhn told the Santa Cruz Sentinel.  </P> <P> UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Robert B. Stevens said his office will investigate the  charges.  </P> <P> Adragon gained widespread attention and became an entry in the Guinness Book of  World Records as the youngest college graduate.  </P> <P> According to university records, Adragon took a double load of classes and  often used petitions and waivers to win exceptions from UC's usual  requirements.  </P> <P> But Adragon's father, Agustin De Mello, defended his son, claiming that any  negative evaluations were written by people who were prejudiced against the  boy. De Mello had drawn up plans for raising a genius -- including advanced  degrees and a Nobel Prize by age 16 -- even before Adragon was conceived.  </P></p>

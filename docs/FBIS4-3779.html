			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Glen Perkinson] </F>   [Text] The academic, writer and political commentator Tsim  Tak-lung says disenchantment with Hong Kong's future under  Chinese rule is the main reason behind his departure for North  America. Although Mr Tsim, 47, had pledged to leave the  territory as soon as the Daya Bay nuclear plant was completed,  he said political uncertainties now topped his list of fears.    The controversial director of the Chinese University Press  said he had no confidence in China's promise to run Hong Kong on  a onecountry-two-systems basis. These fears were compounded by  the location of a Chinese-operated nuclear reactor on his  doorstep. Mr Tsim declared when the plant was planned that he  would not stomach its presence and that he would quit Hong Kong  when the station became fully operational.    He revealed he will be writing and doing consultancy work in  New York -- a city he has always wanted to live in. Having  lived in Britain for some time he was now "excited" about  relocating to North America.    Born in China, Mr Tsim has studied in both Hong Kong and  Britain, gaining a postgraduate diploma in advanced government  studies from Manchester University. He first joined the staff  of the Chinese University in 1977 for a two-year stint before  rejoining as the press director in 1983. He is a past winner of  the award for Hong Kong's most outstanding young person.</p>

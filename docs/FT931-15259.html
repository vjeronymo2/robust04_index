			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / EBRD may help Russia with 'rouble funds' THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is drawing up plans for one or more 'rouble funds' to help modernise Russia's agriculture and to restructure its military industries. Mr Ronald Freeman, the bank's first vice-president responsible for investment banking, said bank staff were working on the project intensively and hoped to present it to the EBRD board for approval before the middle of this year. If approved, the plan could be operating by the end of this year. According to Mr Freeman, there will probably be separate rouble funds to harness western investment capital and Russian domestic savings for agriculture investment and military conversion. They will be similar in concept to sector funds in the US. The EBRD will identify promising projects in the privatised Russian industrial and farm sectors. It will invite western investors, such as pension funds, to subscribe hard currency equity capital to the funds to finance the western imports needed for the projects. At the same time, Russian investors will be offered holdings in the funds that would be subscribed in roubles. The idea is that western investors could look forward to a potentially large return on their investments if the projects prosper, while the equity nature of the funds would also offer Russian investors a chance to protect their rouble savings from inflation. The EBRD itself would take a significant initial stake of perhaps a quarter to a third of the funds, but would expect this share to fall as the investments become established. Mr Freeman cautiously estimated the funds could total between some tens of millions of dollars to Dollars 100m (Pounds 65.7m). The EBRD, which was set up two years ago by western and former communist states to help the former communist states develop market based economies, has drawn up its plans following a request from President Boris Yeltsin for the bank to become more involved in modernising Russian agriculture and in the conversion of military industries to peaceful ends. News of the initiative came to light in the making of a television programme about the EBRD, called Capitalism goes East, which will be broadcast in Britain on Channel Four next Sunday. Private sector companies have set up similar funds in developing countries and former communist states. But Russia presents some difficult problems. The biggest immediate problem will be to find an appropriate exchange rate for converting the western capital to roubles. In spite of hyper-inflation in Russia, the bank believes that the rouble is badly undervalued against the dollar and other western currencies. It will have to persuade western investors to share this view. The availability of suitable projects will also depend on how quickly privatisation proceeds in Russia, although here Mr Freeman and his colleagues are encouraged by the support being given to the idea of privately owned business by Russia's politicians. Although Russia proposed the funds as a way of bringing together western capital and domestic savings, legal and valuation problems also have to be overcome. At the present rouble-dollar exchange rate, Kirovsky Zavod, a huge industrial complex in the port area of St Petersburg, employing 30,000 people, has a book value of just Dollars 800,000. Mr Freeman believes that the EBRD will be able to reach fair solutions that will win EBRD board approval and appeal to investors and the potential recipients of the capital in Russia. He has already sounded out equity investing institutions in the US, Canada, France and London about the idea. They have indicated interest in committing what he calls 'brave money' to the funds.</p>

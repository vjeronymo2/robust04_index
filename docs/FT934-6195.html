			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Oil prices hit five-year low as Opec fails to agree output cuts Oil prices dropped to their lowest point in five years yesterday as the markets reacted with disappointment to Opec's failure to reach agreement on production cuts. The benchmark Brent crude price fell nearly Dollars 1 in early trading to Dollars 14.18 on the overnight news from the oil cartel's headquarters in Vienna, although it recovered slightly to close at Dollars 14.56. The Dollars 14.18 price was its lowest point since autumn 1988 when Opec overproduction sent prices into decline. Opec members dispersed yesterday after failing late the previous evening to agree on a new production ceiling. This was despite the steady fall in the oil price since the last Opec ministerial meeting in September. A communique said that the September output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day was 'reasonable and objective' and should be given time to work. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at stockbrokers Smith Barney in London, described the market reaction as 'a vehement backlash to Opec's indecision', which raised questions as to whether Opec wished to remain a cartel. Mr Mehdi Varzi, research director at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, called the Opec decision a 'disaster' and said it could lead to a price collapse similar to one in 1986, when prices fell below Dollars 10 a barrel. He said Opec was 'suffering from an absence of leadership' and persistently low prices would force ministers to return to an emergency session well before their next scheduled conference at the end of March. Most ministers who left the Vienna conference refused to be drawn on what they might do if faced with a prolonged period of low oil prices. Mr Ali Ahmad Al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti minister, said he 'hoped the fundamentals would rectify the situation', although he suggested that some Opec producers which are close to their capacity might make voluntary production cuts. He did not name specific countries. Not so slick, Page 16 Lex, Page 18 London stocks, Page 38</p>

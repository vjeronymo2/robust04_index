			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / US Money and Credit: Inflation genie refuses to stay in its bottle THE inflation genie refuses to stay in its bottle. The US bond market's remarkable seven-week rally went into reverse last week as a fresh round of inflation worries hit traders. The benchmark 30-year issue, which had dropped from a yield of 6.7 per cent in late July to 5.87 at the end of the week before last, backed up again and closed on Friday night at 6.04 per cent. The 10-year note yielded 5.37 per cent, up from 5.28 per cent. The initial cause was statistics released on Tuesday showing a larger than expected rise in the consumer price index, which rose 0.3 per cent in August, compared to analysts' expectations of around 0.1 per cent. That was followed on Thursday by stronger than expected weekly money supply figures, showing M2 rising by a sharp Dollars 12.7bn in the week of September 6, putting the M2 growth rate up 1.2 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was just inside the Federal Reserve's target range of between 1 per cent and 5 per cent, and pushed the closing yield on the long bond above the psychologically significant 6 per cent barrier for the first time since September 2. The anxiety was compounded by remarks during the week by Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the Fed, and separately by a group of US monetarist economists, about the dangers of a 'bubble' of rising share and bond prices similar to that which destabilised Japan in the late 1980s. The monetarists, who belong to the shadow open market committee, a group which challenges conventional wisdom on monetary policy, said the Fed was pursuing an irresponsibly expansive monetary policy and the economy was awash with liquidity. Most of this liquidity had found its way into financial markets and this, rather than confidence in low inflation, accounted for the sharp fall in long bond yields. This assessment runs counter to the views of most economists, who argue that the US's sluggish growth rate is in danger of even greater weakness as the federal government's new taxes take effect. Some argue the Fed should be considering more cuts in short term interest rates. That, however, seems unlikely in the light of an interview Mr Mullins gave to the New York Times last week. Referring to concerns about a bubble, he declared: 'That's one reason to be wary of being more accommodative.' The Fed's policy-making open market committee is due to meet on Tuesday and is generally expected to leave monetary policy unchanged. The economy is still expanding, albeit at a sluggish 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent a year, and despite the market's reaction, the August consumer price index was not too awful. The index was distorted by sharp rise in clothing prices and leaves consumer inflation running at an annual rate of only 2.9 per cent, compared with 3 per cent last year. As for the 'bubble' theory, many economists point out that the relationship between the growth of the monetary base and nominal income has been weak in the past, and that a yield of 6 per cent is not surprising, given the level of inflation. Still, the shadow market committee has at least refocused the market's attention on the fact that the Fed will tighten monetary policy sooner or later, assuming the recovery holds. In any event, the bond market had been heading for a correction after its sharp summer rise, and it has now got one. Whether the market can resume its advance will depend partly on the next round of economic statistics. But it will also depend on any further policy messages which may leak from the Fed over the next few weeks.</p>

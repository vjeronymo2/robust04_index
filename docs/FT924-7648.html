			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Books: Mothers' ruin THE AMERICAN WAY OF BIRTH by Jessica Mitford Victor Gollancz Pounds 16.99, 288 pages EVERYONE knows America has too many lawyers and too many doctors. Americans have long loved to hate the legal profession. Nowadays it is about doctors that Americans grouch most. Why is it, they wonder, that they pay more for medicine yet receive worse health care than any of their industrial competitors? Why should medical insurance for workers add Dollars 900 to the cost of every General Motors car? How is it that the 280,000 strong American Medical Association has torpedoed every effort at reform? Such are the concerns behind the health debate currently raging across the Atlantic. Jessica Mitford, who tackled the US funeral industry in The American Way of Death 30 years ago, has predictably joined the fray. Her new work is a survey of childbirth practices that shows how expectant mothers are abused and overcharged by their doctors. When Jessica Mitford wrote about the eccentricities and excesses of mortuary practices American-style, her revelations were fresh, shocking and funny. Perhaps 30 more years of California have dulled her experience, but this companion book, The American Way of Birth, seems less filled with pertinence that with granola-and-aerobic breathlessness. The typical American new-born, we find, costs over Dollars 2,000 in obstetricians' fees. Should the birth be Caesarean - and in America's can-do hospitals it often is - the price doubles. Should the mother-to-be number among the one in three Americans without insurance, she will give birth in an emergency room and receive no pre- or post-natal care. In many states, trained midwives have been hounded underground by the doctors whose prices they undercut. Money is not the only price mothers pay. American medicine, Mitford tells us, treats pregnancy as a dangerous disease. As a result women are said to be humiliated by being strapped to an electronic foetal monitor and tied to a hospital bed for hours at a time. Still, this is a far cry from past practice. The earliest successful Caesarian (no relation to Julius; it comes from the latin caesura meaning a cutting, we learn) was performed in 1500 by one Jakob Nufer, a Swiss pig-gelder. Over time, men increasingly intruded on the process of childbearing, so much so that in the 16th century midwives in Europe were executed as sorceresses. In America it is only in the past decade or so that professional women have begun to make inroads on this male preserve. Mitford is at her shrillest describing how midwives with spotless safety records have had to fight for the right to practice. Yet slowly, she believes, home delivery is making a much-needed comeback.</p>

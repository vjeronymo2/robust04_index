Paianton, (202) 272&hyph;0961 or 0566. Telefax number: (202) 504&hyph;4752. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Typical, in the Corps of Engineers, the VEQ clause is used in contracts for dredging or construction excavation. When the VEQ clause is used, the Government estimates the quantity of units of work to be performed, and the solicitation and contract provide a unit price for the work. The clause provides that, if the actual quantity is between 85 percent and 115 percent of the original estimated quantity, the original contract unit price will be paid by the Government to the contractor, but, if the actual quantity is below 85 percent or above 115 percent, the unit price may be revised for the underrun or overrun quantity only, but not for the quantities within the 85&hyph;115 percent range of the estimated quantity. The clause states that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``The equitable adjustment shall be based upon any increase or decrease in costs due solely to the variation above 115 percent or below 85 percent of the estimated quantity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* (Emphasis added.) Because the FAR VEQ clause limits unit price adjustment so those ``due solely to'' the variations in costs, it freezes the results of a ``bad bargain'' for the Government or the contractor in computing a unit price for increased work above 115 percent of the estimated quantity. The revised EFARS clause proposed by the Corps provides for repricing based on the contractor's profit or loss position as well as changes in costs. This will compensate the contractor fairly, but eliminate windfalls for either the contractor or the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corps of Engineers is interested in receiving comments on the following issues: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Should contracting officers have discretion to use figures different from 85 percent and 115 percent? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Should the use of this clause (and its repricing mechanism) be limited to ``major'' work items under the contract? How would a major work item be defined? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Should implementing guidance make it clear that issuance of a request for repricing by the contracting officer is a discretionary decision to be issued only when it is expected that the reduction in contract price will exceed the administrative cost involved or is otherwise in the Government's interest? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Regulatory Analysis is not required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;611). The proposed change would not impose a new burden on any small businesses. It is estimated that the revised method would increase the price paid to a contractor about half the time and decrease the price paid to the contractor about half the time and that the instances when the clauses would allow reporting the work above 115 percent or below 85 percent would be few. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C., Ch. 35) do not apply. This deviation would not impose a new requirement on ten or more offerors or contractors to submit, maintain, retain or disclose information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The USACE would be granted a deviation from FAR 52.212&hyph;11 to use a new clause to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Variation in Estimated Quantity (Deviation) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As prescribed at  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for fixed-price construction contracts when subdivided items are to be separately priced for payment purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Variation in Estimated Quantity (Deviation) (XXX 1994)_EFARS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) If the quantity of a unit-priced item in this contract is an estimated quantity and the actual quantity is at least 85 percent but not more than 115 percent of the estimated quantity, payment for the actual quantity shall be made at the contract unit price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the actual quantity of a unit-priced quantity varies more than 15 percent above or below the original estimated quantity: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Either party may request an equitable adjustment in the contract price as set forth in (2) and (3) below. The party requesting the equitable adjustment must establish the basis for the equitable adjustment; if no basis is established, payment for actual quantity shall be made at the original contract unit price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the actual quantity exceeds 115 percent, payment for 115 percent shall be made at the original contract unit price, and an equitable adjustment may be made in the unit price for the quantity above 115 percent. The equitable adjustment in the unit price for the balance of the actual quantity above 115 percent shall be based on the reasonable costs for that part of the work. Such reasonable costs may include reasonable various costs and a reasonable profit; additional fixed costs may be included, if incurred and reasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the actual quantity is less than 85 percent of the original estimated quantity, payment for the actual quantity shall be made at the original contract unit price, and an equitable adjustment may be made to compensate the contractor for incurred reasonable fixed costs that would otherwise be unrecovered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If a quantity variation causes an increase in the time necessary for completion, the Contractor may request in writing an extension of time. The written request must be received by the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the beginning of the delay, or with such further period as may be granted by the Contracting Officer before the date of final settlement of the contract. Upon receipt of the written request, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and make an adjustment for extending the completion date as, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, is justified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> (end of clause) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Kenneth L.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Christian Democratic Movement, by Jan Zizka in Komarno on 8  January: "We Do Not Want To Secede From Slovakia"]    [Text] Komarno -- In the course of Saturday's [8 January]  assembly of elected representatives of the Hungarian minority in  Slovakia, held in Komarno, Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], granted an  interview to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. The MKDH is the coalition  partner of the Egyutteles [Coexistence] Movement; both movements  jointly represent the Hungarian minority in the Slovak  Parliament.    [Zizka] Do you think that today's assembly might exacerbate  relations between Hungarians and Slovaks?    [Bugar] For a whole month, someone has been persuading  Slovak citizens that what we are doing is anti-constitutional  and that we are about to proclaim territorial autonomy.  Naturally, this is not true. How can an assembly of citizens,  irrespective of their nationality, exacerbate the situation? We  are not adopting any memorandum "against someone" but "for  something." The situation, in my opinion, will not come to a  head.    [Zizka] What was your movement's share in this undertaking?    [Bugar] The organizer is the Association of Zitny Ostrov  [Rye Island, Hungarian-inhabited area in southern Slovakia]  Towns and Villages. The MKDH and Egyutteles are actually only  "allies." We joined the initiators and tried to help them  organizationally. The assembly has been addressed by mayors and  representatives of self-administration bodies, not by political  parties.    [Zizka] The view exists that, outwardly, you dissociate  yourselves from this undertaking somewhat, while in reality you  are the spiritual fathers of this assembly.    [Bugar] We definitely do not dissociate ourselves from it;  we only point out that this is not a rally of political parties.    [Zizka] Is the idea of territorial self-administration  realistic at this time, in your opinion?    [Bugar] The terms territorial autonomy or province are not  even mentioned in the statements adopted by this assembly.  Quite the contrary, it is repeatedly stated in them that all  problems must be addressed within the framework of the territory  of the Slovak Republic. The new territorial arrangement should  result in exactly the same powers [for local self-administration  bodies] in the south of Slovakia as in purely Slovak regions.  However, the citizens of Hungarian nationality should not be  dissipated [rozdrobeni] as provided for by the government's  current project. I think that in pointing this out, we are only  making use of our constitutional right.    [Zizka] So how do explain that in the assessment of your  steps, the view also keeps cropping up that you are demanding an  independent province?    [Bugar] A mistake occurred in that in the first appeal  issued by the organizers of the assembly, the word "tartomany"  was used, which can also be translated as province. (Tartomany  can be translated as province or area -- editor's note.) We  often explained this, but the explanation never appeared in the  newspapers. To this day, Slovak constitutional officials have  not accepted that the organizers are not after a province or  territorial autonomy, let alone secession from Slovakia.</p>

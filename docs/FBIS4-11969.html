			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah has  said that the government has silenced national and Islamic  media, which support security measures and peace. He urged the  government to rescind its decision immediately.    Nasrallah was addressing a memorial for Hajj 'Abdallah  Mi'mah  in Al-Laylaki Mosque yesterday. The service was attended by  'Ammar al- Musawi, Hizballah deputy Political Bureau chairman;  Deputies Muhammad Ra'd, Muhammad Funaysh, and 'Ali 'Ammar; and  some ulema. Nasrallah said: Government officials have  repeatedly sought to oppress the media. We even hear dissonant  voices today calling for additional controls on the printed  media, which thought the publication law protected them from  oppression. These voices are also demanding control over  printing houses.    He added: People in Lebanon feel annoyed and suffocated by  this. The government was not wise in making this decision.  Indeed, it was opportunistic because it used the political and  security situation to pass the plan. Like all forces, trends,  and all the Lebanese people, we call on the political authority  to rescind this unfair and terrorist measure and to promptly  pass the media law. [passage omitted]</p>

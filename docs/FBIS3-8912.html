			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence </F> correspondent]    [Text] Patrol groups of elite SAS [Special Air Service]  troops are believed to be operating inside the besieged Muslim  enclave of Maglaj in northern Bosnia.    Their presence underscores the determination of United  Nations commander Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose to lift  the nine-month siege.    Surrounded by Serb artillery and mortars, the 20,000  inhabitants have been surviving on airdropped food in appalling  conditions. The last convoy to reach Maglaj was in October. UN  relief officials who visited the area in January reported  "larders bare and children nothing more than skin and bones."    Lt. Gen. Rose, who has spent much of his Army career with  the  SAS, plans to open the enclave to aid convoys preferably with  Serb consent but using a more muscular approach if necessary.    With most of Bosnia quiet under two cease-fires, the Serbs  are being pressured by the international community -- including  their traditional ally Russia -- to halt attacks on the town.    Lt. Gen. Rose dropped several teams of armed British  soldiers  into the Muslim enclave earlier this week to assess the  situation. The Ministry of Defence in London maintained its  usual "no comment" on special forces operations.    However, trained to operate in small self-sufficient patrol  teams of as few as four men, the SAS are the ideal  reconnaissance troops to feed back information on frontline  positions, weapons and conditions in the area. They will report  back directly to the headquarters of Lt. Gen. Rose, who  undoubtedly made the request for their assistance.    Although the use of SAS-type units in a UN peacekeeping  operation is unusual it is not unique. American Delta Force  troops were sent to Somalia last year in an abortive attempt to  capture the warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.</p>

The  orders, in a circular issued over the weekend by the Communist Party Politburo  and the State Council, China's Cabinet, are seen as preparation for tough legal  action against thousands of people being rounded up nationwide by security  forces. Meanwhile, an editorial in the People's Daily, the official party  newspaper, accused the United States and other foreign forces of harboring a  "wild ambition" to subvert communism and using political and economic weapons  to support that goal.  </P></p>

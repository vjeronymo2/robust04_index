			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / British Gas to expand abroad if MMC proposals adopted BRITISH GAS intends to expand its overseas operations and concentrate more of its investment abroad if the recommendations made by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Tuesday are adopted by the government, the company said yesterday. The commission proposed in two wide-ranging reports that British Gas lose its monopoly over household supply by 2002. It also recommended the sale of the company's trading arm by 1997 to encourage competition. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said: 'With the sale of the trading arm, we will no longer have the opportunity to grow in the UK gas market directly. From the point of view of growth of the company, that puts more focus on our overseas activities.' He said the company had already placed a great emphasis on expanding overseas. Its opportunities to invest in the UK would be curtailed with the loss of the trading arm - which sells gas to households and industrial customers. British Gas acknowledged that there were many opportunities for expansion worldwide. But its overseas expansion programme, which has seen the company pay Pounds 1.5bn to build its Global Gas division since privatisation, has been widely criticised in the City as lacking focus. 'So far Global Gas has a portfolio of various businesses around the world which hasn't added up to anything meaningful,' said Ms Irene Himona, industry analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. The company is conducting a review of its Global Gas operations as a way of giving them more focus in the company. British Gas's overseas businesses are concentrated in its exploration and production division, which also includes interests in the North Sea, and its Global Gas unit which buys into overseas gas markets. The company said several years ago that it aimed to earn 60 per cent of its profits from these divisions by the end of the decade. Mr Brown said these targets were no longer relevant, since a higher proportion was likely to come from overseas activities in future. These two divisions helped make up for a drop in profits from UK gas supply last year, when they contributed Pounds 361m to profits compared with Pounds 1.2bn for UK gas supply. Mr Paul Spedding, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the overseas business held the key to growth at British Gas. He expected it to generate income of Pounds 450m by 1997.

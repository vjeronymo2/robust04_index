			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 KILLED, 6 WOUNDED AS GANG FIRES ON FAMILY;  </P> <P> 30-YEAR TURF WAR BLAMED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING TERMED ONE OF WORST IN ORANGE  COUNTY HISTORY  </P> <P> A group of Orange County gang members, riding in a pickup truck and armed with  automatic assault rifles, opened fire on a Garden Grove family leaving in  several cars for the movies, killing a 17-year-old rival and a 4-year-old boy  while wounding six others, police said Sunday.  </P> <P> The attackers, who had ventured onto turf controlled by a gang of bitter  enemies, systematically shot at a dozen people at dusk Saturday outside a home  in one of the bloodiest gang attacks in Orange County history, police said. The  victims were preparing to see the movie "Lethal Weapon II."  </P> <P> Killed were Miguel Lorenzo Navarro, 17, a warehouse clerk, and Frank Fernandez  Jr., 4, whose 23-year-old mother, Irene, 2-year-old brother, Christopher, and  18-year-old aunt, Inez Fernandez, were among those wounded.  </P> <P> Irene Fernandez and her surviving son were in satisfactory condition Sunday  night -- the mother at Garden Grove Medical Center and her son at Fountain  Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.  </P> <P> Also wounded in the Garden Grove attack were family friends Richard Rendon and  Anthony Carmona, both 26, and Jennie Hernandez, 21, all of Santa Ana. Inez  Fernandez, Carmona and Hernandez were treated for minor injuries and released.  Rendon was in critical condition with leg wounds at the Fountain Valley  hospital.  </P> <P> Police detectives and gang specialists from Santa Ana and Garden Grove were  working together in the investigation. They believe members of a Santa  Ana-based gang, known as 5th Street, carried out the attack, but they had no  suspects in custody Sunday night.  </P> <P> Such drive-by shootings are relatively rare in Orange County, where gangs are  growing but thus far have not resorted to the kind of violence associated with  the large gangs of South-Central Los Angeles, where children increasingly have  become victims of shootings.  </P> <P> But Saturday night along the 13800 block of La Bonita Avenue, less than a block  from Santa Ana city limits in a working class neighborhood of second- and  third-generation Mexican-Americans, a 30-year-old feud between two gangs was  played out against a backdrop of what police say has been increasing activity  and unrest among Santa Ana-area gangs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Never Forget'  </P> <P> Residents have spotted gang members cruising the street in recent months but  said there had been nothing to foreshadow the violent outburst Saturday.  </P> <P> "I'll be surprised if anyone sleeps on this street for a long time," said Ruth  Macias, a La Bonita resident since the 1940s who lives three doors from where  the shooting began. "You never forget the popping of the guns. Never."  </P> <P> Police said Navarro was the primary target because he was a member of the 17th  Street gang, which was blamed by the rival 5th Street gang for a recent  shooting.  </P> <P> The dark-colored pickup truck turned onto the 13800 block of La Bonita Avenue,  across from a Pentecostal church, as members of the Fernandez family, several  relatives and friends talked and laughed in front of a tiny stucco house. The  late-model pickup rolled slowly by with the windows down and the occupants'  guns blazing, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The sounds of gunfire were quickly replaced by screams and cries for help as  the street and sidewalk were littered with bodies.  </P> <P> "Approximately 20 rounds were fired by the attackers who obviously had no  concern about who their gunfire would harm," Garden Grove Police Sgt. Dan Lyons  said.  </P> <P> Neighbors who had gathered outside to chat or share a beer on the muggy night  scattered as the bullets riddled several homes and cars along a 50-yard stretch  of La Bonita Avenue.  </P> <P> One man was under his car, working on his transmission, when the gunfire  erupted.  </P> <P> "I just clutched my wrench and started praying," said Rodolfo Zepeda. "I just  hugged the ground."  </P> <P> Navarro, known as Smokey to his gang brothers, was sitting in the back seat of  a black Nissan sedan parked on the street, police and witnesses said. When the  shooting started, he lunged for the front seat, throwing his body over a  terrified Inez Fernandez.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Never Had a Chance'  </P> <P> "If he hadn't shielded me, I would have been dead," said Fernandez, who was  slightly injured when her neck was grazed by an errant bullet. "The truck was  less than 20 feet away. Mike never had a chance."  </P> <P> Fernandez's 4-year-old nephew, Frank Jr., was shot several times as he stood in  the back of another car parked in the family's driveway.  </P> <P> Frank Sr. had just taken his family to his mother's La Bonita Avenue house  after an outing at a nearby park. They had gone there to meet the others, who  were grabbing coats and sweaters for the regular Saturday night outing at a  drive-in.  </P> <P> Fernandez's wife was driving, and had left the engine running in the gray  sedan, believing they would be stopped no more than a minute or two. Irene  Fernandez, in an interview from the hospital, said she was about to back the  car out, her three children in the back seat, when the bullets started flying.  </P> <P> "It sounded like something big and fast," said Frank Fernandez, who described  himself as a former gang member. "Everybody (outside the car) was yelling, 'Get  down! Get down!' I tried to put everybody down, but my little boy was standing  up in the back and he got shot through the chest.  </P> <P> "Everybody was crying," he recalled. "My sister opened the back door and said,  'Frankie's shot. . . .' I took my son in the car and drove to the hospital. I  wasn't gonna wait for no ambulance. My first priority was my son."  </P> <P> The assault, police said, was carried out by members of the 5th Street gang,  decades-old rival of the 17th Street gang, in retaliation for a shooting  several weeks ago.  </P> <P> Youths who identified themselves as members of the 17th Street gang denied any  involvement in the earlier incident, and said Saturday night's shooting was  unwarranted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'There Are Rules'  </P> <P> Chris Lovato, a 17th Street gang member, said he was on the phone talking with  a friend at the Fernandez house when he heard someone yell through the  receiver, "I've been hit! I've been hit!" He ran two blocks to the shooting  scene to find his best friend, Navarro, bleeding profusely.  </P> <P> "There are rules, and one of them is you don't shoot at women and children,"  Lovato said.  </P> <P> The hows and whys mattered little to Navarro's mother, Micki Camacho, who wept  softly Sunday while holding a picture of her son, "Mikey."  </P> <P> "I tried and tried to get him to quit the gang," she said. "But he wouldn't  listen. He said it was too late."  </P> <P> Navarro, his mother recounted, had been a gang member since he was 13. In 1986,  the handsome, dark-haired teen-ager had been shot in the stomach as he stood  outside his mother's house in another apparent gang incident. He was not  seriously wounded, and a week later, she said, he began a 2 1/2-year sentence  in a California Youth Authority facility for possession of a concealed weapon.  </P> <P> "In some ways, I felt better he was there than on the streets," Camacho said  outside her Santa Ana home Sunday. "On the streets, I worried all the time. I  used to spend night after night searching for him. I told him: 'This only leads  to one thing, death.' "  </P> <P> Three months ago, Navarro was freed and returned to live with his mother and  younger brother and sister. Camacho said Navarro constantly warned his  5-year-old brother not to get involved with gangs. "It's bad business. No  good," she overheard him say.  </P> <P> Navarro had even shown signs of mending his ways and "going straight," Camacho  said. He had just begun a new job as a warehouse clerk and purchased his first  car. Saturday night, Navarro said he would be home by 8 p.m., the curfew  imposed by his mother. Camacho had gone to the video store to rent some movies  that she and her son could watch when he returned.  </P> <P> He was killed about 7:40 p.m.  </P> <P> "It just rips families apart," she said as her 6-year-old daughter Esmeralda  hugged her waist. "When will it stop?"  </P> <P> Times staff writer Mark Landsbaum contributed to this report.  </P> <P> THE AFTERMATH  </P> <P> An ex-gang member worries over his wounded son after a turf war shatters a  neighborhood.

Police believe the target of the assault was a man who reportedly belonged to  the rival 17th Street gang of Garden Grove.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attackers in pickup truck turn on to La Bonita Avenue  </P> <P> </P> <P> Miguel Navarro, 17, killed, Inez Fernande, 18, wounded, while seated inside car  </P> <P> </P> <P> Richard Rendon, 26, Anthony Carmona, 26 wounded  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jennie Hernandez, 21, wounded while seated in car  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frank Fernandez Jr., 4, killed, Irene Fernandez, 23, Christopher Fernandez, 2,  wounded while seated in car  </P></p>

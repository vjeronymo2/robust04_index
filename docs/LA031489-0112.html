			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI TROOPS' WEST BANK UNDERCOVER ROLE TOLD;  </P> <P> SOLDIERS REPORTEDLY DON ARAB DISGUISE FOR AMBUSHES, ARRESTS, OTHER MISSIONS  </P> <P> Israeli army troops posing as Arabs are being sent on missions to ambush,  arrest or simply provoke rebellious Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip, Israeli and Arab sources say.  </P> <P> The undercover activity, a little-discussed tool of fighting the Arab uprising  that is now in its 16th month, has been revealed in several ways: through the  death of Arabs in unusual or mysterious circumstances, through botched  operations in which the disguised soldiers have been endangered or from  eyewitness reports.  </P> <P> In at least one case, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed the use of soldiers  out of uniform. Questioned in general about missions using disguised soldiers,  military spokeswoman Ofra Preuss remarked: "We have many ways of fighting the  uprising. Sometimes we have to penetrate the ranks of the terrorists to catch  the stone-throwers and the leaders."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Setting Up Roadblock  </P> <P> In the case in question, in late February, two out-of-uniform soldiers fatally  shot a Palestinian in the West Bank village of Eizariya, just a few miles east  of Jerusalem. The villager had accosted them as they were setting up a  roadblock in an alleyway.  </P> <P> The pair had wrapped traditional checkered Arab kaffiyehs, or cloth  headdresses, around their faces, witnesses said. On previous occasions, such  masqueraders had been seen throwing stones at Arab houses along the highway to  Jericho.  </P> <P> On this occasion, when the Palestinian, Mohammed Said Rishik, ripped a kaffiyeh  off one of the men, a fistfight erupted, and one of the disguised agents opened  fire with a pistol, hitting Rishik with a bullet near the heart, Arab neighbors  said.  </P> <P> Both armed men then chased three of Rishik's sons into a nearby drugstore. The  boys hid in a corner of a small bathroom while one pursuer fired through the  door. The back wall of the bathroom is pockmarked with at least four bullet  holes. The door of Rishik's house is also scarred with four marks from bullets.  </P> <P> Rishik, 57, a father of 13, lay dying on the road. Arabs say that a car with  Jewish license plates stopped and that the driver offered to take the man to a  hospital but was shooed away by the undercover soldiers. A car with blue  license plates, the color assigned to West Bank Arabs, stopped and took Rishik  to Mokassed Hospital in Jerusalem. He died on the way.  </P> <P> Soldiers who manned a rooftop outpost within view of the proceedings intervened  only after the two men in kaffiyehs had fled. The uniformed soldiers arrested  the three youths who were cowering in the bathroom, later releasing them.  </P> <P> At first, army spokesmen were quoted in press reports as saying the shooting  may have been a mistake. Afterward, the army confirmed the activity of the  undercover operatives but denied that there was anything untoward about the  incident.  </P> <P> Preuss, the army spokeswoman, said the victim had stabbed one of the undercover  agents in the hand, inviting retaliation.  </P> <P> "If this happened anywhere, say New York, the target of the stabbing would have  the right to open fire," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Emphasizing Legality  </P> <P> The use of soldiers in civilian dress raises tangled questions about the  purpose of Israeli troops in the occupied lands and how the soldiers are  controlled. Army officials have taken great pains in recent weeks to emphasize  the legality of all military actions directed at Arabs, including the tearing  down of homes, detentions without trial, expanded sentences for stone-throwers  and relaxed rules for firing weapons on Arab protesters and rioters.  </P> <P> The tactic of setting ambushes for stone-throwers or leaders of the uprising  suggests that judgment and punishment of suspects is sometimes in the hands of  anonymous commandos. Critics have charged that while such actions may be  justified under rules governing Israeli security, they hardly fall within norms  of lawful behavior.  </P> <P> Speaking on the question of law and the suppression of the uprising, human  rights lawyer David Kretchmer recently called the government's tests of army  action in the West Bank and Gaza "formalistic."  </P> <P> "Under military occupation, the people who carry out the law make the law," he  argued. The major question in rules concerning who can fire on whom and under  what circumstances is secondary to "what units do in the territories,"  Kretchmer added.  </P> <P> After an unfavorable human rights report from the State Department and growing  criticism of Israel's handling of the uprising, the Bush Administration is  urging Israel to reduce tension in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> During talks this week in Washington with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens,  American officials are expected to ask the Israelis to reopen West Bank  schools, release Arab prisoners and curb the practice of jailing Arabs without  trial. Reports here suggest that Israel may make some gestures to meet  Washington's requests but will not bend on its basic position that the  intifada, as an assault on Israeli security, must be put down.  </P> <P> Outlines of the undercover work began to take shape last fall when reports  surfaced of plainclothes units operating both in the West Bank and Gaza. The  British news agency Reuters reported the existence of two units, code-named  Cherry and Samson, deployed "as a mobile force using unconventional methods to  penetrate remote villages before residents raised the alarm."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Blood on Their Hands'  </P> <P> Such units were under orders to catch stone-throwers and shoot to kill  fugitives "with blood on their hands," the report added, quoting Israeli  security sources.  </P> <P> The Israeli government denied, however, that the army had assassinated anyone.  The military censor lifted the credentials of two Reuters reporters for several  weeks after publication of the report.  </P> <P> On Oct. 9, unidentified men shot and killed two Arab activists in the West Bank  village of Yatta. Palestinian witnesses said the assailants wore checkered  headdresses, a common Arab fashion, and fired from an unmarked van. The  Jerusalem weekly magazine Kol Ha-ir reported that witnesses saw the two  Palestinians being dragged into the van still alive. A shot inside the van was  heard as the vehicle sped away.  </P> <P> The day before, a Palestinian activist in a village near the West Bank town of  Tulkarm was shot in the heart at close range. Palestinians said he was hunted  by undercover agents; the Israeli army said he was the victim of an Arab clan  feud.  </P> <P> Last August, armed men in civilian dress commandeered an Arab-licensed bus and  shot and wounded three Palestinian stone-throwers.  </P> <P> One such unit was involved in a violent mix-up in September. An Israeli settler  on the West Bank whose car was firebombed shot at two men he believed were  Arabs responsible for the attack. Instead, the men were soldiers in civilian  dress waiting in ambush on the road, according to Israeli press reports.  </P> <P> Members of such units have also posed as reporters in order to close in on  protesters and rioters. Last summer, American television crews complained to  Israeli authorities that agents had masqueraded as TV reporters to arrest an  Arab suspected of throwing a gasoline bomb at a public bus.  </P></p>

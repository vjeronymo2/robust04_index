			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, Arab League secretary  general, arrived this evening in Tripoli on a visit to the Great  Jamahiriyah where he was welcomed by the secretary of the  General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International  Cooperation and the brother secretary of the General People's  Committee for Unity.    After his arrival, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid made a statement  to JANA in which he said:    In the name of God the merciful and the comassionate, it is  my pleasure to be in Tripoli today. It is always a happy  opportunity for me to visit sisterly Libya and meet the brother  Colonel [al-Qadhdhafi] and the brothers officials to exchange  views in respect of all that concern us all. It is also an  opportunity to review a number of matters that concern us, Libya  and the Arab world. No doubt I will listen and get more  knowledge of the situation. It is always a pretty opportunity to  visit Libya and I am very happy about this visit. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Record subscription for Kunming Machine Tool Kunming Machine Tool Company, the sixth Chinese state corporation to launch its flotation on the Hong Kong stock market, has become the second most heavily subscribed new issue in the colony's stock market history. The HKDollars 128.7m H share offer for the company was 628 times oversubscribed, attracting HKDollars 81.7bn (USDollars 10.6bn) in public money. The largest over-subscription was in February, when Chinese car manufacturer Denway pulled in HKDollars 240bn. The offer closed on Friday, in a nervous stock market and amid increasing concerns over the lack of agreement between Britain and China over the colony's political future. It demonstrates the continued enthusiasm for companies profiting from the rapid restruc turing of China's economy. Kunming Machine Tool, founded in 1938, has developed into the market leader within a niche industry, despite its location in the capital of one of China's poorest provinces. About 92 per cent of its orders are in China, servicing the manufacturing, transportation, energy, aerospace and electronic industries. The company is on a strong growth track, with profits forecast to increase from Yn16.4m (Dollars 2.8bn ) to Yn31m, putting the shares on a fully diluted prospective price-earnings ratio of 10.6, a substantial discount to the blue chip Hang Seng Index average of more than 15. Support for the issue was fuelled by the performance of the previous five H share flotations. When the Kunming Machine Tool offer closed, the average increase in share price for the previous five H share offers was 103 per cent.</p>

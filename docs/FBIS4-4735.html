			<p>BFN     [Text] Hiroshima, April 1 KYODO -- Two South Koreans  forced to work for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in Hiroshima  during World War II began proceedings Friday [1 April] aimed at  recovering wages they say are owing them since the end of the  war. The two men submitted a request to the Hiroshima District  Legal Affairs Bureau for access to a list of people and money  they say has been deposited on their behalf.    Hiroshima is the only place in Japan where the existence of  such a list has been confirmed and if it is made public, it  would be the first time in Japan. The South Koreans, Pang  Hun-chae, 71, and Pak Chang-hwan, 71, are members of an  association of former conscripted Korean employees of Mitsubishi.    A Japanese citizens' group which assists Korean "hibakusha,"  or people who have suffered from the Hiroshima atomic blast,  invited them to Japan.    Pang and Pak were brought to Japan in 1944. Pang was working  at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipbuilding yard and Pak at  the Mitisubishi machine assembly plant when the United States  dropped an atomic bomb on the city August 6, 1945. The bomb  destroyed most of the city.    Both made their own way back to South Korea in September  that  year.    The citizens' group said the list kept at the district legal  affairs bureau contains 1,951 names but only people on the list  are allowed to read it. Pang and Pak say their wages for July  and August, 1945 are unpaid.    During negotiations with staff at the bureau, they were able  to show the staff extracts from their family registers, but the  bureau staff said they will have to confirm what documentation  is required to determine their identity.    Pak said he produced a pension identity card issued to him  by  a local insurance office in Hiroshima during the war, and was  upset that the officials had not trusted his documentation  despite having the copy of the family register which shows the  "Japanese" name he was using at the time.</p>

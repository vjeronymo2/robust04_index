			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Does the Eurocorps Have </F> America's Blessing?"]    [Text] Brussels, January -- During the most recent NATO  summit, not even the parking lots of the press were booked up.  General boredom seemed to be the reason numerous correspondents  saved themselves the trip to Brussels. "You have realized that  not much is happening here," government spokesman Dieter Vogel  apologized for his unexciting statements. Had something escaped  the attention of Vogel and the correspondents? Diplomats at the  Alliance headquarters in Brussels and in Bonn and other capitals  expressed extraordinary satisfaction a few days later. "A new  NATO was created on Monday [10 January]," Bonn officials stated  jubilantly. "The declaration by the 16 heads of state and  government is a significant breakthrough. It was the most  important NATO summit since the end of the Cold War."    It is true that, nearly unnoticed, the 16 allies set a new  course in security and defense policy. The quarrel between the  "Europeans" and the "Atlantic-minded" on the role of the  European Union in security policy was settled. Not only does  the United States accept that, but it even applauds the European  allies in the community of 12 for their efforts to create their  own "security and defense identity." The defense pact Western  European Union [WEU], which the United States viewed  suspiciously for many years, is now considered "the defense  component of the European Union" by the U.S. ally. Thus, no one  else but the community should be authorized to strengthen the  "European pillar of the Alliance." This was no controversial  subject at the summit. Everything was settled in advance, and  NATO is now characterized by a harmony that it has not seen in  the past 14 years after the controversial dual track decision on  nuclear rearmament was adopted.    The trans-Atlantic quarrel over whether the European allies  should be allowed to safeguard their own joint  security-political interests was more than the topic of debates  among insiders on the diplomatic stage. It undermined  Washington's determination, particularly that of Congress, to  ensure European security and gnawed at the foundations of the  Alliance.    The squabbling started at the beginning of the 1980's as a  result of U.S. readiness to grant the Soviet Union strategic  parity. The strategic balance among the superpowers made  Moscow's military superiority vis-a-vis Europe appear in a new  light. Prior to U.S.- Soviet arms control talks in March 1985,  for example, the WEU states wanted to meet -- outside NATO -- to  discuss the situation. The United States objected. It insisted  on complete U.S. control over security and defense policies so  long as it had to protect Europe. If the Europeans had something  to say, then they should do so within NATO.    Thus, the WEU sank into oblivion for another two years. In  1987, however, the European Community adopted the project of the  single market, and the idea of an economic and monetary union  gained ground in France. A combination of these two concepts  was bound to nourish dreams of a "political union" that would  accompany Europe's economic integration with unification in the  sphere of foreign and security policy, and later even with a  joint defense policy on the basis of the WEU. From that time  on, France and Germany did not abandon this topic any more,  particularly since the Cold War ended two years later and Europe  had to make a larger contribution to its own security.    Yet, the Bush administration did not give up its resistance  -- not least because it mistrusted France, which was not  integrated in the command structure of NATO, and that, with its  support for the WEU, aroused the suspicion that it wanted to  create a structure of European armed forces outside the U.S.  sphere of influence. In May 1992, U.S. NATO Ambassador William  Taft stated frankly in Brussels that he did not understand why  the 10 states of the European Community that belonged to the  military integration of NATO could not make it clear to their  French partner "that France's vision of a common defense can  only be realized in the institutions of NATO." It is not  sufficient to cooperate occasionally with the Alliance, he  stressed. However, the U.S. position softened slowly.  President George Bush accepted the WEU as early as at the NATO  summit in Rome, "if it does not represent a European alternative  to NATO." Reginald Bartholomew, Taft's successor, stressed in  the autumn of 1992 that the Alliance should remain the supreme  "defense forum."    However, a change of power at the White House was apparently  necessary to transform America's resistance into agreement.  Strobe Talbott, the new U.S. deputy secretary of state,  admitted shortly before the most recent summit that this  resistance against an independent European defense identity was  "pure theology" -- which was quite unfounded because, with the  exception of France, the European partners were never interested  in founding an organization rivaling NATO. Quite the contrary.  "We support the WEU as a strong European pillar of the  Alliance," the declaration adopted by the NATO summit reads.  For the defense officials in Bonn, it is hardly conceivable for  WEU countries not to be NATO members.    Europe's security-political elements are now forming a  complete mosaic. "It was clear that if the United States  renounces its theology, the French will also give up their dogma  of Charles de Gaulle, according to which strict independence and  distance vis-a-vis Washington is to be ensured," a Bonn diplomat  pointed out. Bonn officials have always believed that a  European defense identity would bring France closer to NATO and  not increase the distance between Germany and the Alliance.  They were right in the end. The agreement that the WEU may use  the military apparatus of NATO is proof of that. In addition,  France will occasionally participate in the Alliance's defense  planning -- that is, the meetings of the defense ministers. Out  of consideration for U.S. feelings, Great Britain and the  Netherlands have so far kept away from the Eurocorps. Now that  the Strasbourg Armed Forces have been generally accepted, the  Netherlands and the Germans want to complete them with a second  corps. Great Britain is currently not participating.    In fact, time was also on the side of the Europeans after  the  end of the Cold War. The United States, which reduced its troop  presence to one-third in Europe, was hardly in a position to  deny the old world an independent defense initiative. Also, it  was not possible for the Americans to insist on having the final  say while, at the same time, calling on the Europeans to assume  their global share of work. This was Clinton's message at the  Brussels summit. He considers NATO the authority that is  ultimately responsible for the global strategy of the West,  including the military one. The European Union, however, should  concentrate on economic reconstruction -- with the United  States, in the case of Russia -- and, above all, the  democratization of East Europe. Allies who are expected to fill  these task do not have the feeling that somebody is putting a  spoke in their wheels.</p>

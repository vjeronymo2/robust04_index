			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman off the Defense and Internal Affairs  commission of the Armenian parliament Ghevork Bagdasaryan told  an Interfax reporter that Armenia saw no reason for worry about  Russian military presence because, in line with a bilateral  treaty of 1992, a Russian Army Group, with headquarters in  Yerevan, had already been deployed in the republic. According  to Bagdasaryan, Armenia's borders with Iran and Turkey were  controlled exclusively by Russian troops.    The treaty of 1992 was ratified by Moscow in 1993 but  remains  to be ratified by the Armenian parliament. A number of Armenian  legislators would like to rewrite some parts off that document.  They raise objections to the articles on preferential treatment  for Russian servicemen and the creation of troop deployment  areas in their republic.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Poland to seek EC loan to bolster reforms POLAND plans to ask the European Community later this year for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m) loan to shore up the government's painful economic reform programme and stave off the threat of a rapid rise in inflation. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance minister, told the Financial Times that Poland needed the loan to assist it in financing a large projected budget deficit for 1992 without adding to inflationary pressures. He said he had sounded out Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the new French prime minister, and senior German officials on the idea and their response was 'not negative'. The prospect of such a loan request may stir unease among EC governments, which are anxious to support Poland's pioneering efforts to transform its economy but which have been alarmed in the last few months at signs that the reforms have been thrown off course. However, Mr Olechowski made clear that he would not formally make the request until Poland had concluded a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund, negotiations on which will re-commence if and when the Polish parliament, the Sejm, approves the proposed 1992 budget. Warsaw's existing accord with the IMF was suspended last year when Poland failed to meet the required economic targets. But Mr Olechowski was told by senior IMF officials when he visited Washington a month ago that the proposed 1992 budget, which provides for a deficit of Zl 65 trillion (million million) - Pounds 2.8bn - the equivalent of 5 per cent of gross domestic product, would not constitute an obstacle to the resumption of talks. An IMF agreement is also critically important for Poland's efforts to gain relief on its external debt of more than Dollars 40bn. In June it is due to embark on negotiations with the London Club of commercial bank creditors, to which it owes some Dollars 11bn. Mr Olechowski, who took office just over a month ago after his predecessor resigned in a disagreement over policy, is widely credited with injecting some order into economic policy-making. He has also improved Poland's relations with the international financial community after a period of uncertainty. Only two months ago, the World Bank warned the government that there was an imminent danger of hyperinflation if the government failed to bring its spending more closely in line with revenues. Now the government believes inflation for the year as a whole will be 45 per cent, down from 70 per cent last year.</p>

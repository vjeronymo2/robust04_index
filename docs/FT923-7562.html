			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / National Savings pulls in Pounds 481m NATIONAL Savings contributed Pounds 635m last month to government funding, the third highest monthly figure ever recorded, according to official figures released today, Andrew Jack writes. Total gross sales were Pounds 950m, including Pounds 299m on the new tax-paid First Option Bond which was launched on July 7 and had its rate cut within two weeks. The inflow - which caught the government by surprise and brings the total contributions so far this year to more than Pounds 2.1bn - indicates the high demand for National Savings certificates and accounts compared with the rival products offered by banks and building societies. The Treasury has cut rates three times since May. It is widely believed to have bowed to pressure this month from building societies, which warned that they would be forced to raise mortgage rates in order to compete with National Savings interest rates to savers. The rate for First Option, which was designed for basic-rate taxpayers, was cut from 10.34 per cent gross to 9.67 per cent on July 21. The 37th issue tax-free National Savings certificates, which was introduced in May paying 8 per cent, was withdrawn this month to be replaced this week by the 38th issue paying 7.5 per cent. The government had not envisaged such a high demand from individuals for its savings products, which help it to meet the projected public-sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn for 1992-93. Officials said they did not want to set the rates any higher than was necessary to make their contribution to funding. But City economists said the cut in the First Option rate had little bolstering effect on building society deposits. After repayments of Pounds 469m, net receipts from National Savings totalled Pounds 481m for July. Including accrued interest of Pounds 154m, the contribution to the government was Pounds 635m. Allowing for Pounds 700m in accrued interest, there has been a net cash inflow of Pounds 1.4bn since the beginning of the year. The total amount invested at the end of July was Pounds 41.9bn.</p>

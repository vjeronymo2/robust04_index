			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SELF-INTEREST AND OIL CRISIS IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> I have yet to see anyone suggest internationalizing the Mideast oil fields.  </P> <P> This should be done under United Nations control, if possible, in the name of  the world economy, world hunger or whatever. Now is the time and we have no  obligation whatsoever to restore the Kuwaiti rulers to power or to continue  supporting Saudi and other Arabian rulers to retain their power. Deposing  Saddam Hussein goes without saying.  </P> <P> The income from the oil could help pay for our military presence and prevent a  further budget crisis.  </P> <P> BOB KERBER  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

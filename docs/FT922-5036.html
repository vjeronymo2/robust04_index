			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Technology: Here's one for the road / Describing plans to co-ordinate Britain's street works If the road outside your house has just been resurfaced, you can be sure that it won't be long before someone comes along with a pneumatic drill and digs a hole in it. For years, street works have been poorly co-ordinated in the UK, with the gas, water and electricity boards and the local highway authority often ignorant of each other's plans. A marked improvement is likely from this October, however, when the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 goes live. The new laws, replacing existing legislation drafted in the 1930s, will improve communication between utilities and increase the highway authorities' responsibility for co-ordination. Under the new Act, local authorities must keep a register of all street works, and from 1994 that register will be held on a computer. A single, national database will eventually hold details of all the country's street works and the list will be updated as utilities and highway authorities exchange information by electronic mail. Whereas under the old Public Utilities Street Works Act (Puswa), there are three kinds of road works - major, minor, and emergency - the electronic register will have to cope with a host of new definitions. Certain streets, for example, have been deemed 'traffic sensitive' and any street works on them would require a longer period of notice. The total number of messages which utilities and authorities send to each other is also expected to increase by as much as 50 per cent. This is because for the first time local authorities must give warning of anything that is likely to effect the motorist, be it a manhole inspection or the London marathon. Even though the computer system won't be ready until 1994, authorities must comply with the new Act from this October. While they wait, councils are having to develop interim systems which in most cases will be based on fax machines and the post. The thinking behind the computer system stems from 1985 when Puswa was heavily criticised by a government report which, among other things, called for a national Computerised Street Works Register (CSWR). Since then, highway authorities and utilities have been working to develop improved codes of practice, and their representative body, the Highway Authorities and Utilities Committee, has advised the government on what the CSWR should look like. A blueprint is now being developed for the Department of Transport (DTp) by KPMG Management Consulting, and a contract worth about Pounds 14m will go out to tender by the end of the year. The CSWR offers a chance to improve the accuracy of road work information. This should not be difficult as Puswa has been notoriously inaccurate - it is said to have records of road works in the North Sea, for example. Increased accuracy would mean fewer cases of contractors and utilities damaging plant by digging holes in the wrong places. Over the last few years, the National Joint Utilities Group (NJUG), which represents utilities collectively, has been trying to achieve this goal through a series of regional trials; and two of these, in Lothian, Scotland, and in Dudley, in the West Midlands, have been useful precursors to the CSWR. In 1982 Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council started a trail-blazing experiment which involved utilities sharing their mains records through centralised digital maps maintained by the council. When this system went live in 1985, damage to plant was cut by about 50 per cent almost immediately. From 1987, the council decided to use its digital maps as the foundation for a street works register which would chart the life of an excavation from the planning stage to the final reinstatement of the road and settlement of invoices. Holes in the road were defined by their co-ordinates on the maps to an accuracy of within one metre. The maps now hold records of about 45,000 holes. Dudley's system has drawn considerable international interest. However, it is too expensive to be sustained indefinitely and now the council is about to move to a post and fax system to comply with the new Act. The trial will have cost Pounds 2.5m, funded jointly by British Gas, BT, Mercury Communications, the DTp, the council, and the electricity supply and water industries. Another NJUG experiment managed to outlive its trial by being less ambitious and therefore cheaper. The system, known as Susiephone, started life at Lothian Regional Council as a message-relaying service with the slogan 'Dial before you dig'. By making a single phone call a contractor could inform all the utilities of an intended excavation and receive a complete picture of underground plant. Backed by a consortium of users including Scottish Power, British Gas (Scotland), BT, Mercury and local cable TV companies, Susiephone soon developed into a PC-based electronic messaging system. In addition, Lothian developed its own 'Puswa management system' which has many of the features of a rudimentary street works register. Susiephone was very successful but not sophisticated enough to meet the demands of the new Act. So the consortium returned to the drawing board and this year announced a new version based on modern workstations from the US company Sun Microsystems. The new Susiephone has been aligned with the requirements of the national CSWR. Lothian intends to use it as an interim system before the full CSWR arrives in 1994, and the consortium has signed a Pounds 400,000 deal with ICL which will develop the system for marketing to other UK authorities. Although utilities doubt that it could be used as a full CSWR, it is just possible that Susiephone could evolve into a national system. Both the Dudley and Susiephone groups will be invited to tender for the CSWR contract later this year. KPMG's specification for this contract is nearly finished and some features of the future system are beginning to emerge. A consultation paper issued to authorities and utilities last month by the DTp recommends a single national database built from a network of regional computers. It will support: electronic mail for giving notice of road works; software for co-ordinating road works; software for handling road-work inspections (from 1996). For improved accuracy, the CSWR will make use of a new National Street Gazetteer which will be the first complete list of all streets in the UK. Greater accuracy - to within metres - would be possible using digital maps. However, a Dudley-type system covering the whole country has been dismissed for the present. The technology is 'slightly too immature', says Richard Goodwin, project manager at KPMG. But Mike Bosworth, Dudley council's chief land surveyor, says the CSWR may eventually resemble Dudley's system. 'Our concepts are sound and I think the national system will develop into what we've got here at Dudley after 10 years,' he says. The DTp's consultation paper suggests the CSWR will be controlled by its users through a management board, which would appoint a computer company to operate the network. However, authorities and utilities are still considering forming a company in which they would be joint shareholders. In Scotland, the home of Susiephone, the big issue is whether to have a register separate from the rest of the UK. 'There's a fairly strong feeling that we should have a system located in Scotland,' says Sylvia Murray, principal policy officer with Cosla, the Scottish local authorities association. 'But being Scots it would be hard to argue against sharing a system based in Birmingham - if it were cheaper.'</p>

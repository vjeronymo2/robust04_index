			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CARL ST. CLAIR IS NAMED TO LEAD PACIFIC SYMPHONY;  </P> <P> ORCHESTRA: 37-YEAR-OLD WHO WON RAVE REVIEWS DURING AN AUDITION EARLIER THIS  YEAR WILL ASSUME HIS DUTIES IN OCTOBER. HIS APPOINTMENT ENDS A TWO-YEAR SEARCH.  </P> <P> Carl St. Clair, an assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony, Monday was named  music director of the Pacific Symphony.  </P> <P> St. Clair -- at 37, the youngest of eight announced candidates for the position  -- will assume his duties Oct. 1 and expects to spend about three months of  next year in Orange County. He said Monday that although he will leave Boston,  he will hold onto one of two other jobs he currently holds elsewhere around the  country.  </P> <P> Under the terms of a three-year contract with the Pacific, St. Clair is to  oversee the orchestra's artistic development and planning and to conduct six  pairs of classical concerts each season at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center in Costa Mesa and two concerts each summer season at the Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre. In addition, he is to oversee school and community outreach  programs.  </P> <P> St. Clair and orchestra officials would not disclose his salary.  </P> <P> His appointment ends a search that began in February, 1988, with the  resignation of founding music director Keith Clark after a bitter power  struggle with the orchestra's board of directors.  </P> <P> The search made headlines early this month when previous front-runner Lawrence  Foster said the Pacific had offered him the job in December but withdrew the  offer after talks broke down over salary, rehearsal demands and residency  requirements. The orchestra management has refused to comment on Foster's  claims.  </P> <P> St. Clair is also music director of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) Symphony and the  Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. He said Monday that he will maintain  one of these posts in addition to his job with the Pacific, but has not yet  decided which post he will give up.  </P> <P> He added that he will maintain a residency in Orange County but that it will  not be his exclusive address. However, he said, "I intend to spend as much time  here as needed and as much time as I can."  </P> <P> Pressed further, he said he expects to spend about three months in Orange  County next year -- eight weeks for concerts plus "one month for administrative  types of things."  </P> <P> Musically, St. Clair said he intends "to work on the ensemble of the orchestra  . . . its ability to perform as a cohesive unit, and its tone. We will begin to  address that immediately with our first rehearsal." Critics generally praise  the Pacific's musicians on an individual basis but find fault in the overall  ensemble, asserting that the orchestra lacks refinement and a unified  perspective.  </P> <P> In terms of programming, St. Clair said he will "start out in a more  traditional fashion" but eventually will include contemporary music.  </P> <P> St. Clair was born in southwestern Texas, studied conducting with Walter  Ducloux at the University of Texas at Austin and taught music for 10 years at  Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and for eight years at the  University of Michigan.  </P> <P> He became a conducting fellow at Tanglewood, Mass., the summer home of the  Boston Symphony, in 1985, and the following January he became one of two  assistants to the Boston Symphony. (The other is Pascal Verrot.)  </P> <P> This past summer he toured with Leonard Bernstein and conducted various  orchestras in East Berlin, Leningrad, Milan, Paris and Rome, among other  cities.  </P> <P> He conducted the Pacific Symphony in a pair of concerts Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, the  week after his father died. Los Angeles Times critic Timothy Mangan praised St.  Clair for his "malleable phrasing and clear textures" in Mahler's  "Ruckert-Lieder," his "gentlemanly neatness" in Mozart's "Exsultate, jubilate,"  and his "moment by moment emotionalism" without loss of "musical argument" in  Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" Symphony. The Orange County Register said St. Clair  brought "a potent combination of control and chaos to the podium" and the  orchestra had "rarely shown the precision, finesse and genuine ensemble feeling  it showed throughout the program."  </P> <P> The Pacific was founded in 1979 by Clark, who worked tirelessly -- some said  relentlessly -- to build it from a 30-member organization with an $8,000 budget  to a full-size one with a budget of $3.1 million. Along the way, however, Clark  also built a reputation as an abrasive, autocratic administrator.  </P> <P> Since 1983, the orchestra has had four executive directors, one of whom  resigned after only six weeks. Current executive director Louis G. Spisto was  brought on in June, 1987, as an administrative equal to Clark rather than as  his subordinate, as his predecessors had been.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Pacific's move to the Orange County Performing Arts Center,  where Clark played on the same stage as such internationally recognized  conductors as Georg Solti and Riccardo Muti, increased critical scrutiny of  Clark's musical abilities.  </P> <P> Tension between Clark and board members reached the breaking point in February,  1988, when the board voted 12 to 11 to not review his contract to conduct;  Clark resigned as of the end of the 1988-89 season. Since then, the orchestra  has been auditioning possible successors.  </P> <P> Kazimierz Kord, music director of the Warsaw Philharmonic, has been the  Pacific's music adviser and principal guest conductor during the search. Spisto  said Monday that Kord is expected to return as a guest conductor in future  seasons, but Kord's schedule precludes his being a guest in 1990-91.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Carl St. Clair will not actually conduct the Pacific Symphony again until the  fall, when he assumes its directorship. He will lead the orchestra Oct. 9 in  the opening concert of its 1990-91 season. The program will be announced. The  orchestra's next concerts will be March 28 and 29 at 8 p.m. at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, where Richard Buckley, former  music director of the Oakland Symphony, will conduct Haydn's Sinfonia  Concertante and Mahler's Symphony No. 5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY'S NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR  </P> <P> Carl St. Clair, New Music Director of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra, effective  October, 1990  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal:  </P> <P> Age: 37.  </P> <P> Native of Texas  </P> <P> </P> <P> Present positions:  </P> <P> Assistant conductor fo the Boston Symphony Orchestra (One of two; the other is  Pascal Verrot.)  </P> <P> Musical Director of the Ann Arbor (Mich.)

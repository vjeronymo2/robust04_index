			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Harris Trust takes loss on mortgage-backed deal Harris Trust, the Chicago-based subsidiary of Bank of Montreal, said it would absorb losses of Dollars 51.3m on behalf of customers whose money it had invested in unsuitable securities created out of mortgage-backed bonds. The bank's decision, which will lead to a Dollars 33m post-tax loss, echoes moves by some other US banks and fund managers whose investment strategies have proved fallible in the volatile markets of recent months. BankAmerica recently injected Dollars 17m into a money market mutual fund it runs to make up losses which otherwise would have been born by customers, while PaineWebber paid Dollars 33m to cover mortgage-backed bond losses on behalf of investors in one of its funds. The latest losses stem from Dollars 2.3bn of collateralised mortgage obligations (or CMOs) which Harris bought on behalf of 40 of its pension fund customers. These instruments are created out of standard mortgage-backed bonds and comprise a near-Dollars 800bn market in the US. Harris said the pension funds were customers of its securities lending division. The money used to buy the bonds was collateral which had been deposited with the bank against securities it had lent out on behalf of the funds. This money should have been invested in safe, short-term instruments, the bank said, adding that it had decided to absorb the losses to protect its reputation. The money invested in the risky bonds represented more than a third of the Dollars 6.7bn in its securities lending portfolio. CMOs range in riskiness from highly geared instruments whose price can move quickly as interest rates change to standard fixed-income securities. Bank of Montreal said the CMOs in the Harris portfolio were capped floating-rate notes - instruments which pay a higher interest rate as market rates rise, but only to a certain ceiling. The losses were caused by the sharp fall in loan repayments by mortgage borrowers in the US, Bank of Montreal said. As repayments decline, the duration of the bonds grows longer, hitting their value - a trend which has caused widespread price falls in mortgage-backed bonds. The Dollars 2.3bn of bonds have been taken over by Bank of Montreal, which said it had sold Dollars 800m of the holdings in recent days. The remainder will be held as an investment, the bank said. As a result, the bank will not have to mark the bonds to market, something Harris would have had to do under US accounting rules.</p>

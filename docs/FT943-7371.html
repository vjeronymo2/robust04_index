			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Warning to Bosnian Serbs France and Germany warned the Bosnian Serbs yesterday they would bear the responsibility for more bloodshed if they insisted on rejecting the latest peace plan. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and his German counterpart, Mr Klaus Kinkel, called on Bosnian Serb leaders to reconsider their opposition ahead of a referendum they plan to hold on their territory next weekend. The two ministers also appealed to Serbian-led Yugoslavia to allow international monitoring of its blockade against Bosnian Serbs imposed to force them to accept the peace plan. In the Serb-held part of Croatia, UN relief officials struggled to provide food and water for thousands of Moslem refugees who fled fighting in the north-west Bosnian enclave of Bihac. The refugee exodus followed the defeat of rebel Moslem leader Fikret Abdic, whose forces were routed by Bosnian government troops two days ago. UN relief officials said 30,000 refugees were still marooned in miserable conditions after the Croatian government refused them entry to territory it controls.</p>

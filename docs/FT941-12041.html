			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Dow Corning slips deeper into red Dow Corning fell deeper into the red in the fourth quarter after taking a pre-tax charge of Dollars 640m to cover the cost of litigation related to breast implants manufactured by the company. The company, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, yesterday announced a net loss of Dollars 384.2m in the final three months of 1993, compared with Dollars 5.5m in the year-earlier period. Excluding the provision, which was disclosed earlier this month, net profits improved by 48 per cent to Dollars 30.8m, against an operating profit of Dollars 20.9m in the final three months of 1992. The special charge represents the company's best estimate of its potential costs under a proposed Dollars 4.75bn settlement of thousands of lawsuits brought by women who claimed to be harmed by leaking implants. Its total liability was estimated at Dollars 1.24bn, but insurance payments were expected to reduce the figure by Dollars 600m. Dow Corning was once the world's largest manufacturer of breast implants. In 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration banned their use in cosmetic surgery amid mounting concern over their safety. Its continuing operations remain on sound footing. The company, a leading supplier of silicone used in the manufacture of aerospace, vehicle and construction products, showed a 7.9 per cent increase in revenues to Dollars 521m in the quarter. Sales growth was particularly strong in the US, while some recovery was evident in Europe. Mr Richard Hazleton, president and chief executive, said he was satisfied by the company's performance and credited a cost-control programme begun earlier in the year for the profits growth. He said a highly competitive trading environment had limited the company's ability to recoup cost increases through higher prices, although prices were up modestly in the US. For the full year, sales reached a record Dollars 2.04bn, up 4.5 per cent from Dollars 1.96bn in 1992, but the bottom line suffered from the impact of the breast-implant provision. A net loss of Dollars 287m in 1993 was set against a net deficit of Dollars 72m a year earlier. Excluding special charges, net profits advanced 27.6 per cent to Dollars 128m.</p>

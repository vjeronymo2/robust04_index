			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Dreams of striking up the band: The plans of managers at South West Trains The opportunity to earn 'rail miles' on petrol purchases, the sale of rail tickets through cut-price 'bucket shops' and an introductory free rail-travel scheme are proposed by South West Trains once British Rail is privatised. Mr Peter Cotton, commercial director of South West, a division of BR's Network SouthEast, said innovative marketing would be one of the methods used to attract people to the railways. South West runs trains from London Waterloo to Reading, Exeter, Weymouth and Portsmouth. Mr Cotton, formerly managing director of Del Monte UK, said: 'Commuters often feel they are a captive market. We need to do more for them. It sounds frivolous but we might have a silver band playing in the station at Christmas.' Mr Peter Field, managing director, said senior managers of South West were 'seriously interested' in launching a buy-out bid for their company, probably late next year. The managers hope that they can obtain a franchise for 15 to 20 years, longer than has been indicated by the government. South West has a turnover of Pounds 230m and employs more than 4,000 people. The potential for increasing the number of passengers from the present 280,000 a week is large. Sixty per cent of adults in the south-east of England never travel by rail, 30 per cent use trains infrequently for leisure travel and 4 per cent commute daily. Mr Field said: 'We are fishing in a big pool. We need to get people to try us by, for example, providing more information for non-regular users.' He said the smaller, franchised railway companies would be able to take greater account of local needs than was possible in BR. South West is working with local councils and with Railtrack, the company which will own BR's track, on proposals to build a line to link Heathrow airport to the main line to Waterloo. It has plans for a fast shuttle service between Waterloo and Southampton, running air-conditioned trains at 20-minute intervals. Mr Field said fears that rail franchisees would have difficulty raising finance appeared unfounded. 'We have had serious expressions of interest from venture capitalists and from potential trade partners,' he added. South West has ambitious diversification plans. It would like to acquire its own maintenance facilities, handle its own advertising activities and manage retail outlets on stations. Mr Field said: 'British Rail could not do this because it was focused on cutting costs.'</p>

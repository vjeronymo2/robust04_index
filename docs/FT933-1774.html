			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional leaves Comac at Pounds 60,000 Comac Group, the USM-quoted computer consultant, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 60,000, against Pounds 44,000, for the half year ended June 30. These were the first results since Mr Philip Swinstead, the founder and former chief executive of SD Scicon, took a controlling interest and installed a new management. The profit was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 50,000) relating to directors termination costs and German payroll taxes for earlier years. Mr Bernard Friend, the new chairman, said that UK margins remained under pressure and business abroad fell significantly in the six months. However, there were the first signs of an upturn following policy changes by the new management. Turnover was Pounds 5.3m, compared with Pounds 4.91m. Earnings per share were up from 0.44p to 0.65p.</p>

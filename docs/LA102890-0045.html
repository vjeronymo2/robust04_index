			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> MAKING CONNECTIONS WITH THE RIGHT WIRE NUT;  </P> <P> ELECTRICITY: WIRE NUTS COME IN THREE SIZES. PROPER JOINING OF WIRES IS  IMPORTANT TO AVOID MALFUNCTIONS OR WORSE.  </P> <P> Looking for the easiest way to join two or more electrical wires together? It  has to be the wire nut. But don't be fooled. As easy as wire nuts are to use,  it's still possible to use them incorrectly.  </P> <P> And when that happens, the results can range from the annoying (say a ceiling  fixture that won't work) to the disastrous.  </P> <P> Wire nuts -- sometimes called solderless connectors -- are those little  twist-on fasteners that look like toothpaste caps. They come in various sizes,  usually labeled as small, medium and large. If you do much wiring, it pays to  have a package of all three sizes on hand.  </P> <P> And now, before we get down to using any nuts, let me state the obvious. Do not  work on any live wires. If you are working on a house circuit, be sure it is  shut off at the main service panel. If you are working on an appliance, you can  simply unplug it.  </P> <P> Normally, the label on your pack of wire nuts will specify how many of what  size wire the nut is sized for. If you end up with a bunch of nuts and no size  information to go on, work by trial and error. If a nut is too big for the job,  it will thread on loosely and come off if you tug on it. If a nut is too small,  you won't be able to screw it in place.  </P> <P> If you are joining two or more solid wires together, start by stripping each  wire evenly. How much to strip varies with wire size and wire nut size.  </P> <P> While you might strip just 5/16th inch off a 14-gauge wire for a small nut, you  might strip as much as three-quarter inch if you were joining heavier wires  with a larger nut. Package labels often specify how much to strip, but if not,  you can let trial and error be your guide. More about that in a second.  </P> <P> For the average job, stripping about half an inch is a good starting point.  After stripping, place the two conductors side by side with their ends even as  shown. Slip them into the wire nut, and while pressing firmly, screw the nut in  place until it stops. If any bare wire extends below the nut, you have stripped  too much. Nip back the ends of the wires and try again. If you have not  stripped enough, you'll find it difficult to twist the nut in place before the  insulations starts to interfere. In that case, strip off a bit more insulation  and try again.  </P> <P> Once the nut is in place, it makes sense to secure it with plastic electrical  tape. This will help prevent any possibility of the nut falling off and causing  a short. Start by taking a couple of turns around the base of the nut. Then  work down and take a few wraps around both wires. Finally spiral back up and go  around the base of the nut a couple more times. That should do the trick.  </P> <P> If you are joining two or more stranded wires (the type with conductors made up  of several thin wires instead of one solid wire), the directions above apply.  But if you need to join a stranded wire to a solid wire, a slightly different  technique is recommended to assure a solid connection.  </P> <P> Start by stripping about half an inch of insulation off the end of the solid  wire. Then strip an inch off the end of the stranded wire. Wrap the stranded  wire around the bottom half of the exposed solid wire as shown in the sketch,  and then fold the end of the solid wire over and squeeze it down tight.  </P> <P> Finally, screw the wire nut in place. If any bare wire extends below the nut,  you have stripped too far. Disassemble the connection and try again. It's best  to cut the ends off both wires and start over from scratch rather than trying  to straighten, unwind, rewind and rebend.  </P> <P> Once you make a connection you are pleased with, finish it off with electrical  tape as outlined above and the job is complete.  </P> <P> 1990, Los Angeles Times Syndicate  </P></p>

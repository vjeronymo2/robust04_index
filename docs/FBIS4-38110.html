			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Ma'mun </F> al-Hudaybi and Hilmi Murad, deputy leader of the Socialist Labor  Party [SLP], answering identical sets of questions by  correspondent Muhammad Raghib, published in AL-WAFD's "Political  Week" section; places and dates of interviews not given]    [Text] [Raghib] You joined the SLP in raising the slogan  "Islam is the solution" during the 1987 People's Assembly  election campaign. Was this an ideological or merely political  alliance?    [Al-Hudaybi] We first raised the slogan "Islam is the  solution" during the 1984 election, which some Muslim  Brotherhood members contested. Since then we have committed  ourselves to this slogan as a concise declaration of the basic  principle or ideology in which we believe. As for the alliance  involving the Brotherhood, the SLP, and the Liberal Party in the  1987 election, we all raised the same slogan and formulated a  platform of 10 basic points, which were more elaborately  explained in leaflets later. The SLP, the Liberal Party, and  the Brotherhood contested the election as a triple alliance and  on the basis of the platform just mentioned. We raised the  slogan "Islam is the solution." From this you can see that our  alliance with the SLP was both ideological and political. In  our Islamic faith there is no distinction between religion and  politics. Islam is both a religion and a state.    [Raghib] Does the SLP-Muslim Brotherhood alliance still  exist  or has it been dissolved?    [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is still allied with the SLP.  We are working, coordinating, and consulting with them.  Brotherhood members feel that the SLP's commitment to the  alliance continues. We welcome the alliance because it is  actually a form of dialogue, consultation, and exchange of views  over various political, economic, and social issues of interest  to the public. The dialogue depends on circumstances and the  needs of the parties. It is not limited to specific dates or  times.    [Raghib] A Brotherhood faction is reportedly operating  within  the SLP rank and file. How true is this?    [Al-Hudaybi] This is a point we always stress; the  Brotherhood has its own independent organization and has never  joined the organizations of other political parties except in  extraordinary circumstances. I will not speak of these now. At  the same time the SLP has its own structures and organizations  as a political party. It is not my business to discuss them  here. I have already explained that we and the SLP have an  alliance that we seek to preserve. We are joined under one  banner--"Islam is the solution."    [Raghib] The society "Young Egypt," which operated before  the  [1952] revolution and later became the SLP, had relations with  the Brotherhood, which involved agreements and disagreements.  What are the parameters of the SLP and the Brotherhood  relationship today?    [Al-Hudaybi] "Young Egypt's" relations with the Brotherhood  in those days fluctuated between extreme closeness and extreme  disagreement. This issue belongs to history. Current  political, economic, and social conditions are very different.  This change in circumstances has been fundamental and many of  the SLP and our own positions have changed. The saying has it  that everything happens in its own good time.    [Raghib] A few months ago there was an uproar in connection  with the SLP's plan to represent the Brotherhood at the National  Dialogue Congress. What was the result?    [Al-Hudaybi] The SLP never intended to represent the  Brotherhood or speak on its behalf at the National Dialogue  Congress. SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri made this clear during an  interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM. He said: "The SLP will  never represent the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has the right  to have its own representatives."    The Brotherhood has its own status and can represent itself  anywhere anytime. But we welcome any consultations or meetings  with the SLP. I must make it clear that it is out of the  question for the SLP to represent the Brotherhood at the  National Dialogue Congress or any other forum.    [Raghib] Will there be some form of coordination or alliance  between the SLP and the Brotherhood in the next parliamentary  election?    [Al-Hudaybi] No one knows what form the next election will  take. We have heard rumors that it will be held in accordance  with the list system. Then we heard denials. We also heard  that it would adopt a mixed list-and-independent-candidate  system. When the election draws near things will become  clearer. Then the existing security, political, and economic  conditions can be evaluated. We can decide then whether we want  to coordinate or forge an alliance with the SLP or do something  else. Likewise the SLP can decide on these issues. It is  difficult for Brotherhood and SLP leaders to make decisions on  this affair right now.    [Raghib] You joined the Muslim Brotherhood in raising the  slogan "Islam is the solution" during the 1987 People's Assembly  election campaign. Was this an ideological or merely political  alliance?    [Murad] Our alliance with the Brotherhood is merely  political  and its purpose was to participate jointly in the election  battle. But this alliance continued--it still does--even after  joint participation in the election to the People's Assembly  ended. This does not mean the programs of the SLP and the  Brotherhood are identical. The alliance is based on specific  published points but the detailed programs of the SLP and the  Brotherhood are not identical. Otherwise the agreement would  had been a merger, not an alliance, which would have required a  word-for-word and detailed agreement on every aspect of the  practical application of the two sides' views and their  understanding of the application of Islamic teaching in every  aspect of life. We cannot say this exists or has been achieved.  Thus it becomes clear that our alliance with the Brotherhood  is, as I said, political, not ideological.    [Raghib] Does the SLP-Muslim Brotherhood alliance still  exist  or has it been dissolved?    [Murad] Nothing has happened to warrant dissolving the  alliance with the Brotherhood, that is, nothing has happened to  our respect for the clauses of our political accord with the  Brotherhood to warrant such action. Thus the alliance between  the SLP and the Brotherhood still exists, but on the basis of  political cooperation only. This alliance is proceeding within  the framework of the points of the declared alliance; the SLP's  internal affairs are not bound by it. As long as no  disagreements occur over the application of any of the  agreement's clauses, as long as there are no clashes over  declared public stances, and as long as the stances do not  change, then the alliance as I described it still exists.    [Raghib] A Brotherhood faction is reportedly operating  within  the SLP rank and file. How true is this?    [Murad] This allegation is made for a malicious purpose,  which seeks to claim that there is a full merger between the SLP  and the Brotherhood. The truth of the issue is that each one of  us is keen to respect the independent identity of the other. As  proof of this, when Brotherhood candidates won in the 1987  election on the SLP list they had the right to attend the SLP's  higher committee meetings in their capacity as members of the  SLP's parliamentary caucus. But they did not attend these  meetings so as not to create any ambiguity. They restricted  themselves to attending the parliamentary caucus meetings in the  People's Assembly. We have no thought of including Brotherhood  members in the SLP's organizations. Both parties have their own  political views and the desire to maintain independence. No  party should be responsible for the other party's behavior.    [Raghib] The society "Young Egypt," which operated before  the  [1952] revolution and later became the SLP, had relations with  the Brotherhood, which involved agreements and disagreements.  What are the parameters of the SLP and the Brotherhood  relationship today?    [Murad] The SLP and the Brotherhood were bound together by  the Islamic tendency and the belief that abiding by correct  Islamic teaching would achieve whatever is best for Egypt and  all its sects. It is the same tendency now. Occasional  disagreements or the absence of an identity of views and  policies do not spoil the general trend and do not justify  clashes or divisions in the circumstances. The same situation  existed before the revolution between "Young Egypt" and the  Brotherhood and fierce clashes took place between the two as a  result of their different attitudes and ideas. But such  disagreements--today and in the past--are not so grave or vital  as to lead to hostility and clashes.    [Raghib] A few months ago there was an uproar in connection  with the SLP's plan to represent the Brotherhood at the National  Dialogue Congress. What was the result?    [Murad] It was never said that the SLP could represent the  "Brotherhood." It is known that both the SLP and the  Brotherhood have their own independence and political identity.  To avoid official objection to the Brotherhood being  represented in the dialogue as a recognized group, the SLP  proposed letting this trend be represented by "Muslim Brothers"  in their capacity as public figures who have their own views and  ideas about society. It was merely a suggestion aimed at  removing the embarrassment in which the various parties found  themselves. There was a misunderstanding of the aims behind the  SLP's proposal. There was no indication that the SLP intended  to represent the Brotherhood.    [Raghib] Will there be some form of coordination or alliance  between the SLP and the Brotherhood in the next parliamentary  election?    [Murad] We have not discussed this before, neither inside  the  SLP nor with the Brotherhood. It is too early for that. There  must first be an understanding on fighting the next election  before the issue of coordination and alliance is studied,  because it is known that the opposition parties -- with the  exception of the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party --  and the Brotherhood boycotted the last election. The issue  depends on ensuring the honesty of the election so that  participation will be serious. If this does happen then we are  open to the possibility of coordination and an alliance with the  Brotherhood if they ask for it. We might also ask them to do so  if we believe that coordination and an alliance with them will  serve the national interest and public objectives. This applies  to any other political party, not just the Brotherhood.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lower property profits and interest check Thorntons IT WAS not so much the high street recession as the dwindling of property profits and increased interest charges that affected Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer. Pre-tax profit fell 7 per cent to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 7.75m) on sales of Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 46.2m) in the six months to January 11. Operating profit inched ahead to Pounds 7.55m (Pounds 7.5m), but interest costs rose to Pounds 478,000 (Pounds 210,000) and property profits fell to Pounds 95,000 (Pounds 464,000) as the group got out of development. Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive, said increased costs, particularly shop rents, wiped out the gains made through sales growth and improved productivity. Christmas, which accounts for 30 per cent of sales, had been 'extremely late and highly nerve-racking'. But in the end like-for-like takings in the Thorntons shops were up by nearly 9 per cent. Franchised outlets in greetings card shops had not done so well and companies had cut back on gifts. Retail turnover totalled Pounds 35.9m and the number of outlets reached 386. Mr Thornton said the target was to have 650 within five years. In France, where there are 59 shops under the Martial and Sunset names, sales were virtually flat at Pounds 4.6m. Losses, which amounted to Pounds 850,000 last year, were being reduced. Meanwhile, the French ice cream factory was helping to meet rising demand in the UK. Sales of chocolates to private-label customers grew by 31 per cent. Overall the commercial sales division contributed Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 7.8m) to turnover. A review of management had led to 50 jobs being cut, although some of the people had been redeployed. About nine new managers were being recruited. The changes, which would save Pounds 600,000 a year, carried a one-off cost of Pounds 630,000. After a Pounds 250,000 profit on the sale of a shop in the Champs Elysees, exceptional charges would total Pounds 380,000 for the year. The Pounds 2m disposal would also help turn net debt of Pounds 4m into a probable cash surplus by July, said Mr Thornton, whose family owns 53 per cent of the equity. Earnings per share declined to 7.53p (8.01p). The interim dividend goes up to 1.25p (1.2p). COMMENT Thorntons has proved itself to be one of the better small-company stocks and the share price, up from 116p to 201p just before these results, has responded after doing little since the May 1988 flotation. However, its recession-resilient image has been a soured a smidgen by squeezed margins on the commercial side and by soft demand between such treat-peaks as Christmas and Valentine's Day. For the rest of this year the minuses, including rent increases and redundancy costs, seem set to outweigh the pluses, which should at last include a better performance in France. A pre-tax profit of between Pounds 11m and Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 11.9m) gives a prospective p/e of nearly 17 on yesterday's close of 200p. At this level, there may be some profit taking, although the group's long-term prospects remain good.</p>

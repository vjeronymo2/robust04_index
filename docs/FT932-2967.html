			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: UK building society in PIBS issue NEWCASTLE Building Society, the UK's 25th largest building society, has placed its second issue of permanent interest bearing shares (PIBS), via Charterhouse Tilney, at the lowest yield spread over gilts yet achieved by any building society. The Pounds 10m placement will be treated as core capital for building society capital adequacy purposes. The shares will pay fixed interest of 10 3/4 per cent, yielding 240 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. This represents a substantial reduction from the spread on Newcastle's first deal, launched last September at a yield margin of 360 basis points. Spreads on PIBS issues have tightened substantially, partly due to unexpectedly strong demand from retail investors keen to buy relatively high-yielding assets in the current low interest rate environment. The tightening of spreads is also attributed to a shortage of stock in some issues, such as the first Newcastle deal, which is now trading at a spread of 203 basis points. A PIBS issue launched by the Halifax, the UK's largest building society, in January 1992 at a spread of 275 basis points, is now trading at a spread of 170 basis points. Given that the principal amount invested in PIBS is never repaid, some dealers think that spreads are now looking very tight.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- A 60-day nationwide  general inspection of the implementation of the Statistics Law  began today. Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistical Bureau  and head of the leading group for nationwide general inspection  of the enforcement of the Statistics Law, explained: The  inspection will focus on the industrial output value that has  created relatively serious problems and attracted comparatively  adverse reaction from various social circles, particularly  statistical data on village and town enterprises output value,  population, grain output and reserves, peasants' per-capita  income, investment in infrastructural construction projects, and  commodities price indices.    It is learned that with the State Council leaders' approval,  the leading group for nationwide general inspection, which has  been formed by relevant comrades in charge of the State  Statistical Bureau, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State  Council's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, has made comprehensive  arrangements in this regard. Targets of the general inspection  will include all investigative units which have been involved in  organizing previous statistical surveys, as well as all units  which have been obligated to provide statistical data and which  have been surveyed previously. The general inspection mainly  aims at inspecting and handling wrongdoings of recent years,  particularly those which occurred since the beginning of 1993.  They include the following: To attain certain political glory  and economic benefits while discarding the state statistical  laws and regulations, some individuals or small groups  misstated, concealed, fabricated, or illegitimately changed  their data when filling statistical reports; forced or  instructed statistical organizations and personnel to falsify  statistical data reports; retaliated against personnel who  boldly upheld principles by reporting and exposing illegal  statistical activities; and obstructed the investigation and  handling of illegal statistical cases.    The leading group for nationwide general inspection urged:  While carrying out the inspection, various localities and  departments should earnestly and properly conduct  self-examination. All investigative units and units which have  been surveyed previously should self-consciously check existing  problems that may have arisen when they enforced statistical  laws and regulations within their own units. They should  thoroughly mobilize the masses to report and expose illegal  statistical activities within their own units, and produce,  after conducting self-examination, reports that aim at seeking  truth from facts. Meanwhile, to prevent self-examinations from  being performed as a mere formality, we should thoroughly and  properly conduct major random checks. Counties and cities must  organize effective investigative teams and specify units for  random checks based on a ratio of one to every 10 units.    The leading group for nationwide general inspection  stressed:  We should earnestly and properly handle various cases. We  should uphold the general inspection's basic principle that we  must handle all complaints; we must investigate all cases; we  must penalize all violations of laws; we will be lenient in  meting out penalty if violations are revealed through  self-examination reports; we will mete out harsh penalty if  violations are exposed by investigative teams; we will seek  truth from facts; and we will investigate and handle cases  according to law. We must strictly handle, according to law,  major and important cases that are exposed by investigative  teams during the general inspection, particularly, those units,  including their personnel who are directly involved, that have  engaged in illegal statistical activities which are serious and  have a relatively grave impact.</p>

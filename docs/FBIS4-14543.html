			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "No One Wanted To Give In. </F> Serious Battles in Latvian Parliament Over Ratification of  Agreement on Russian Troop Withdrawal"]    [Text] As you know, the Russian and Latvian state  delegations initialed an agreement 15 March regarding the  Russian troop withdrawal from this Baltic Republic before 31  August 1994. However, it will be extremely difficult to ratify  this agreement in the Latvian parliament. Two of the Saeima's  eight factions -- the Movement for National Independence and the  "Fatherland and Freedom" Association, holding 21 out of 100  seats -- are taking a hard-line stance.    Deputies from the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction are  taking  the most hard-line stance. They are proposing to poll citizens  29 May -- the day of the local self-government elections -- and  find out their view of the demand that the Russian radar at  Skrunde should cease to operate at the same time as the troop  withdrawal (and not remain in the Republic for another four  years' work followed by the 18 months allocated for it to be  dismantled, as envisaged by the agreement initialed by the  Russian and Latvian delegations).    At first glance, there are more people in the Latvian  parliament who are in favor of a civilized Russian troop  withdrawal from the Republic, but the methods they are using in  an endeavor to win public support evoke at the least perplexity.  Thus, according to RIA, Ludis Pavilonis, deputy head of the  Latvian Government office supervising the Russian Army  withdrawal, speaking on national television, said that the pace  of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia has been appreciably  stepped up of late. The RIA report also claimed, citing the  Northwestern Group of Forces [NWGF] Press Center, that, owing to  the success of the interstate talks and mindful of Latvian  leaders' wishes, the command of the NWGF has allegedly found it  possible to hand over to the Latvians by 1 April 1994 the  military airfields at Tukums, Daugavpils, and Jekabpils, along  with the Riga and Daugavpils aviation-engineering schools'  stock. Actually, neither of these reports is accurate. I was  told by Colonel Golin, head of the NWGF Press Center, that there  is no question of the pace of the Russian troop withdrawal from  Latvia being speeded up, nor has the press center made any  statements regarding actions of goodwill on the part of the NWGF  command in connection with 1 April, if only because all these  installations...have already been handed to the Latvians either  prior to 1 March or during the first few days of March....    At the same time, the Latvian Government backed the package  of agreements with Russia. As its 29 March statement indicates,  the cabinet of ministers sees the speediest signing of the  documents and their ratification by the Saeima as the "only real  guarantee of the Russian troops being withdrawn from Latvian  territory by 31 August this year."</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fuel cell use is predicted for platinum FUEL CELLS, environmentally friendly units which produce electricity and heat from a controlled chemical reaction be-tween hydrogen and oxygen, are likely to provide the next substantial industrial application for platinum, according to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. By the end of this century about 200,000 troy ounces of platinum a year could be ab-sorbed by this new market - about the same as the chemical and electrical industries each use today, JM suggests in its annual review of the market. However, this could be a conservative estimate. If fuel cells incorporating platinum catalysts are used and if the market develops as projected by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, annual demand for platinum in that country alone by the year 2010 would be more than 400,000 ounces. 'Beyond the turn of the century platinum consumption could soar, should the market for fuel cells in vehicles materialise and dreams of a hydrogen economy become a reality,' says Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of the JM review. The fuel cell is a prime contender to meet demand for electricity without increasing pollution, he points out. It is versatile and efficient, produces hardly any noxious emissions and so could help to re-solve the apparent conflict between continued economic growth and the preservation of a healthy environment. Fuel cells went into commercial production for the first time last year. Japan is showing the most commitment to their development. The Japanese government is spending about Dollars 27m a year on research, and Fuji Electric, Toshiba and Sanyo have developed marketable products and established production lines to build them. The US Department of Energy is currently spending Dollars 44m a year on fuel cell research while spending in Europe is about Dollars 60m. By 1995 more than 100 fuel cells will be installed and producing power in Europe, Japan, the US and the Far East. Mr Coombes says commercial units should be available in 1993 at a cost of Dollars 1,500 per kilowat of generating capacity, not much more than the cost from conventional generating plant, and the cost is likely to fall as more fuel cells are built. On the main features of the platinum market last year, the JM review reports: Demand for platinum in-creased by 5.5 per cent to a record 3.66m ounces. Supplies rose by 9 per cent to 3.73m ounces. The market moved into marginal oversupply of 70,000 ounces from a marginal undersupply of 45,000 ounces in 1989. The slight oversupply might continue for some years. Supplies from South Africa, the world's biggest producer, were constrained by production difficulties but grew modestly. Shipments to the west from the Soviet Union, at 700,000 ounces, were the highest for 15 years. This year JM expects platinum to trade at about Dollars 400 an ounce before rising as the year progresses towards Dollars 450.

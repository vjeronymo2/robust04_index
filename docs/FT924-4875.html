			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: UK insurers may get tax benefit THE GOVERNMENT is reconsidering the tax treatment of insurance companies after complaints from British insurers that they are penalised more heavily than European counterparts, it was disclosed yesterday. The Inland Revenue said it was considering whether the competitive position of British insurers was being penalised by the fact that they are not allowed to deduct tax on equalisation reserves made against future claims. The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce said it had received a letter from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, saying that the government was re-examining the tax position. Mr Dorrell's letter said the Inland Revenue was looking at the treatment of equalisation reserves. 'If some change is called for, we will consider whether this can be achieved without causing unacceptable distortions,' he said. Mr Roger Miller, executive director of Airmic, said the association ovhad put forward a number of arguments for changes Airmic believes the government should make equalisation reserves tax deductible. This would allow insurance companies to reduce taxable profits by setting aside sums to pay for future catastrophic claims It wants to prevent discounting for tax purposes on long-term insurance provisions. This would stop taxation of investment sums set aside to pay for specific future claims. Mr Miller said in a letter to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the British insurance industry was being penalised because European companies were allowed more favourable tax treatment He said Airmic regarded 'the stability, competitiveness and solvency of the British insurance industry as vital to the interests of the whole of British industry. Export earnings would rise if there was a 'level playing field' in taxation. Mr Dorrell said in his reply that differences in accounting methods in other EC countries meant there were good reasons why discounting did not arise as a tax issue elsewhere in the way in which it did in Britain.</p>

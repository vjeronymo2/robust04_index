			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish protest campaign launched SCOTTISH nationalists are mounting a special campaign demanding full independence within Europe to coincide with next month's European Community summit in Edinburgh. Launching the programme at Westminster yesterday, Mr Alex Salmond, Scottish National party leader, said the aim of the campaign was to use the summit to galvanise support for independence. In the run-up to the summit on December 11 the SNP will be urging voters to sign a Declaration of the Scottish Nation - demanding full national status for Scotland as an independent member of the EC. There will be an independence rally in Edinburgh on December 4 and a torchlight demonstration in the city the following day. Another mass demonstration is being planned for Edinburgh on December 12.</p>

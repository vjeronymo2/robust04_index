			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Arts: Beautiful Thing - Theatre The wave of gay drama currently breaking over London rolls back for the third time Beautiful Thing, Jonathan Harvey's soft hearted play about gay awakening on a south London council estate. After rapturous acclaim at the Bush, then the Donmar, it comes close to hitting the rocks at the Duke of York's, a colder, less intimate, arena. The problem is not the play. Harvey has written a light hearted slice of cockney life with enough carefully set up one-liners to grace a TV sitcom. The timing is the trouble. If only Jamie (Zubin Varla) and Ste (Richard Dormer), the teenagers who find bunking up together a mind blowing experience, could venture to Hampstead to see Poor Superman, where the realities of the gay scene for 30-pluses are laid bare, their joy might be dented. This is feel-good theatre for gays, who roar with approval at an ending happy enough to bring a tear to the eye of a Mills &amp; Boon reader. Harvey has a sharp ear for working class dialogue. 'He ain't seen life; he hasn't even had a holiday', snaps hard pressed mum Sandra trying to warn Jamie off. 'I hate old people' says Leah, a desperate drop out. 'It's alright if they're dead.' As the tower block neighbours gently spar and swap aphorisms we are given an unusually warm picture of inner city life, made even more glowing by Johanna Town's lighting. Sandra may be an abandoned single mum; Ste the beaten up son of a drunken father, but they are as chipper as Tommy Trinder in a war time movie. As the velvet drapes fall at the end of the first act and Jamie and Ste exchange their first tentative kiss we enjoy the cosy escapist romance that delighted audiences in the 1950s when Ste would have been Stephanie. There is nothing to shock in Beautiful Thing and Harvey shows dramatic insight in making Sandra's lover Tony (Rhys Ifans), the only genuinely decent person, the fall guy. As a tentative middle-class hippie, he is heartily despised by Londoners leading real lives. Varla and Dormer seem too old for their roles but Diane Parish as Leah is a marvellously drawn self-victim, and Amelda Brown manages to turn Sandra into a budding Mother Courage, with a sense of humour. Hettie Macdonald directs deftly and anyone in favour of positive discrimination should enjoy it.</p>

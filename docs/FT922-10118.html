			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: A cut-price trove of solid silver bounty whether for a wedding, a christening, a birthday or an anniversary - it is worth taking a look at the mail-order company Silver Direct. A selection of its silverware is pictured below. Nothing it sells is startling. You will not find in its brochure anything to amaze or wonder at. What you will find is solid, dependable, classic (if not staid) pieces at very affordable prices. Silver Direct sells fine-quality silver made into the sort of everyday articles that most people want at prices that it claims are considerably lower than most retailers - and a quick check reveals its claims to be true. For example, some admirably plain cutlery - Rat Tail design - selling at Pounds 50 for a place setting (table knife, fork, spoon, desert knife, fork and spoon) in silver-plate and at Pounds 238 a place-setting in sterling silver sells in another emporium for Pounds 107 for silver plate and Pounds 354 for sterling silver. Other classic patterns - Old English, Kings, Queens, Fiddle Thread and Shell, Albany, Dubarry and St. James - are also available. Then there are hip flasks (Pounds 185) and pillboxes (Pounds 45), a plain square silver-plated photograph frame (3 1/3 ins by 2 1/2 ins Pounds 16), silver and gilt 12 bore salt and pepper shakers (Pounds 129), pure bristle silver military bushes and combs (Pounds 165) and all the other appurtenances deemed essential to the solid bourgeois life. On the more glamorous front there is also a selection of jewellery - safe and accessible as you would expect (Russian bangles, twisted knot ear-rings) but nonetheless good value. Nothing in the brochure costs more than Pounds 500. Part of the reason prices are good is that Silver Direct does not hold a lot of stock, so orders take between one week and a month to arrive. The other reason is that Silver Direct has low overheads, no city centre rents and few staff. For a brochure write to Silver Direct, 3 Crosland Place, Taybridge Road, London SW11 5PJ.

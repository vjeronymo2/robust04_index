			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan relives dream of cheap electronics - China's demand for electronics is greater than Japan's was in the 1960s MR Konnosuke Matsushita, the late founder of the electronics company which bears his name, dreamed of making consumer electronics products available in Japan as cheaply and abundantly as tap water. With Japanese markets for TV sets and video recorders at saturation point, Matsushita is now gearing up to relive its founder's dream in neighbouring China. Last week, Matsushita announced it would set up a joint venture facility to produce core components for video tape recorders in the high tech industrial complex of Dalian. The venture with the China Hualu Electron Company, which will manufacture 1.5m VTR components a year, will be Matsushita's 12th facility in China. Ten of those, including the VTR venture above, will be making products for the Chinese market itself, making Matsushita unusual even among Japanese manufacturers. Many Japanese companies have invested in southern China as a manufacturing base for export but Matsushita is looking to the future of the Chinese market itself, says Mr Katsumi Tametani at Matsushita's corporate management division for Asia, Oceania and the Middle East. Already, China produces 10m TV sets, most of which go to meet domestic demand. In volume terms that is larger than the entire European market, not to mention the Japanese market itself, which is about 800m-900m sets. Meanwhile, penetration of colour TVs is estimated to be as low as 5-6 per cent in rural areas and 7 per cent in the cities. The potential for growth in demand looks far more promising than in the west and Japan, where demand is mainly for replacements. Mr Tametani says that China, in some ways, is like Japan 30 years ago, when Matsushita saw its business expand as Japanese consumer spending began to increase. Just over 30 years ago, sales of colour TVs rose strongly in Japan, spurred by the marriage in 1959 of the current Emperor and Empress. But the rate at which Chinese consumers are buying electronics products today is even faster than that seen in Japan in the 1960s. 'If the market develops at this rate it could outstrip Japan in value terms as well,' Mr Tametani says. Matsushita is also looking for growth in demand for washing machines and pagers which are in wide demand as there is on average only one telephone per 100 people. The speed at which the Chinese markets for consumer products are advancing to ever-more sophisticated technology and the rapid development of the domestic industry mean that Japanese companies need to offer greater value to compete in China. Matushita's VTR joint venture signals a major development in the Chinese video industry, which has long been dependent on Japan for the key components that go into the sets assembled in China. By joining hands with Matsushita, the Chinese aim to replace some of those imports from Japan with locally produced components. With a 20-year stake in the joint venture, Matsushita appears to have ensured itself a role in the development of what could become the world's largest VTR market.</p>

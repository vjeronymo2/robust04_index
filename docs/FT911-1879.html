			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Economic Viewpoint: Reappearance of the 'growthmen' The years after the first oil shock following the Yom Kippur war of 1973 were ones of very rapid inflation and slow average growth. But national leaders thought they had learned something from this experience and the 1980s saw a somewhat better growth performance and a much lower average inflation rate. Policy was governed by what some people have called the 'new orthodoxy', and what I once called the counter-revolution. Its intellectual underpinning was, among other things, a demonstration by Professor Milton Friedman in 1967 that governments could not spend their way into desired rates of output and employment without risking not merely an inflation, but accelerating inflation. This theme was put starkly by the then Mr James Callaghan to, of all bodies, the 1976 Labour party conference when the UK was negotiating a rescue package with the IMF. The Labour prime minister's words were repeated time without number by Mrs Thatcher and her chancellors. One reason why Labour still wants to dabble in industrial interventionism is that it is not prepared to challenge this new macroeconomic orthodoxy, any more than President Mitterrand's socialist government is in France. The new orthodoxy does not mean that all policy is 'ineffective' - a caricature view of what some later academics have espoused. It merely states that macroeconomic policy will be most effective if it concentrates on nominal aims - such as stable prices, exchange rate objectives, monetary targets or Nominal GDP - the precise choice or combination of objectives varying with time and place. Who are the main opponents of the new orthodoxy? They are in ascending order of importance: the technical monetarists who are so incensed by exchange rate targets or any departure from their personally favoured monetary aggregates that they threaten us with the spectre of world depression. In practice their advice is not too different from that of the pockets of unreconstructed Keynesianism that remain in academia, and more instinctively among politicians and businessmen. A good example is the British House of Commons Treasury Committee, which still sees salvation in reforming the official forecasts and has now come up with the perverse idea of four forecasts a year instead of two, with politicians not interfering - as if that alone were a guarantee of impartiality. The chancellor is right that a careful use of surveys can provide a better idea of turning-points than any number of formal forecasts. But the only unreconstructed group of growthmen who really matter are in the US policy-making establishment - interestingly, the Republicans, even more than the Democrats. The most unreconstructed of all appears to be President George Bush, despite his avowed preference for foreign affairs (for which many Kurds will be grateful). Has the world been experiencing such a depression or growth recession that it is reasonable to throw away the new orthodoxy and stimulate spending at all costs? The large chart, taken from a DRI McGraw Hill study of The International Outlook after the Gulf War*, shows that the slow-down in world real growth has so far been mild by historical standards. On the other hand, inflation, on present prospects, is unlikely to fall as far as it did in the mid-1980s, when admittedly it was given a downward shove by a collapse in the oil price. The annualised rate of growth of US Nominal GDP has now slowed down from 8 per cent in 1988 to 3 1/2 per cent in the first quarter of 1991 compared with a year ago (and 2 1/2 per cent compared with the previous quarter). This is far from being a depression rate; but it is low enough to create some presumption in favour of stimulation. The obstinate persistence of underlying US inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) at 4 per cent suggests caution about the dose and keeping an eye on the dollar. Even if US nominal demand needs a stimulus, it is still difficult to see why other countries have also to be pressurised into reducing interest rates. This might have made sense in the US a few months ago when the weakness of the dollar was cited by some Fed governors as a reason for resisting still cheaper money. But after the dollar shot up why did the US administration bother to launch its deservedly abortive Group of Seven initiative, rebuffed by the Germans and Japanese? Unilateral US interest rate cuts are surely more useful in achieving the administration's twin objectives of a brake on the dollar and stimulating domestic growth. US action only makes sense on the assumption that the administration was in such a panic about economic prospects that it wanted to throw in every weapon of which it could think: lower interest rates abroad; much lower interest rates at home; a dollar depreciation to boot; and every kind of pressure on its trading partners. Normally, I abstain from second guessing the US economy from 3,000 miles away. But an interesting light is thrown by some confidence surveys put together by the London Business School. These show that US consumer confidence, which had plunged alarmingly during the Gulf conflict, has now returned to a near-level trend, despite a very slight kick-back in April. Producer confidence, which normally lags, is still declining. In the UK the profile has been different. Consumer confidence started to deteriorate much earlier. The beginnings of a recovery were apparent in the middle of 1990 but were nipped in the bud by the Gulf crisis; but since the 'end' of the war the improvement has resumed. Producer confidence is charted by the CBI survey. The accompanying table shows key answers compared with the corresponding period of the 1980 recession. Answers relating to past or recent performance show a sharper deterioration than was expected at the turn of the year. But forward-looking answers show what can only be described as much less pessimism. The two questions with the best record in plotting turning points are business optimism and expected volume of output. Although there is still a balance of pessimists over optimists, it is much smaller than in January and much smaller than in the corresponding period of 1980. The same applies to expected volume of output (and a similar picture is shown by the chart of expected orders). Export pessimism is also much less than in January and in the corresponding period of 1980. For there has not been the kind of upward pressure on sterling that squeezed business so much a decade ago. But there is still enough pressure on margins to put a dampener on producer prices. The balance of companies expecting to raise their prices is now at its lowest since 1967. The most dismal answer relates to employment, where there is still a substantial balance of respondents expected to lay off workers. The British disease of putting all the pressure on staff numbers rather than pay costs remains; and because unemployment is a lagging indicator it will continue at varying rates well into 1992. A broader perspective is supplied by the IMF chart showing the deviation of output from trend in different groups of countries. In the three English-speaking countries, the US, the UK and Canada, output rose in the late 1980s to a non-sustainable level in relation to capacity; and in order to keep inflation down, these economies will have to go through a period of below-capacity operation, even when recovery of sorts begins. In France and Italy, there was a smaller boom and a more moderate slump is in prospect. In Japan and West Germany, the picture has been much more stable. The deep growth recession of 1987 was probably an aberration. The different experience of the English-speaking countries (which could have included Australia) has to do with the high indebtedness incurred by borrowers in those countries after financial liberalisation and the severe retrenchment now taking place. It may be that both borrowers and lenders in these countries will henceforth follow a course of 'once bitten, twice shy'. In any case the fashionable calls for 'reregulation' would weaken these countries in the sector where they have the clearest comparative advantage. *1 Hartfield Road, Wimbledon, London, SW19 3RU, price Pounds 2,500.

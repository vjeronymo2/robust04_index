			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Generators seal supply contracts THE COAL and electricity industries yesterday completed deals under which generating companies will buy 160m tonnes of coal over five years and sell the electricity it produces for about Pounds 13bn to regional power companies. The deals, notified to the Stock Exchange yesterday after nearly a year of intense negotiations, involve the sale of about 430 terrawatt hours of electricity from the generators to the regional companies. They are based on an average price of 3.26 pence per kilowatt hour in the first year starting on Thursday, a 12 per cent reduction on this year, falling to 3.1p pence in the final year. National Power, the larger of the two generators, said after the first year there would be a 1 per cent cut in real terms in each of the following four years in the cost of electricity to regional companies. PowerGen said price reductions to the regional companies would amount to 17 per cent over the five years. Both generators said the full benefits of lower coal prices were being passed on. But this is disputed by the regional companies who say the generators are keeping some of the benefits. The price in the first year is Pounds 1.51 per gigajoule, compared to Pounds 1.86 this year, and will fall to Pounds 1.33 in the final year. British Coal will earn Pounds 5.5bn through the contracts. National Power is buying 24m tonnes of coal in the first year and 18m in the four subsequent years. The agreements cover about 70 per cent of National Power's expected output in the first year, declining to about 50 per cent in later years. PowerGen, the other generator, is buying 16m tonnes initially and 12m in subsequent years. The generators are also committed to buying coal from private producers over the next five years, although contracts have still to be finalised. Yesterday's contracts underpin price decreases by regional power companies of up to 3.5 per cent from April 1.</p>

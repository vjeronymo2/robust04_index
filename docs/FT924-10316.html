			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound dips on policy speech STERLING lost more than two-and-a-half pfennigs against the D-Mark in Asian trading on Thursday night, as the markets took a dismissive view of the chancellor's keynote speech to the Mansion House, writes James Blitz. On the eve of Mr Lamont's speech, Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew, said that the chancellor would need to describe the broad and detailed framework within which macro-economic policy was being formed if the pound was to be boosted. It would not be enough, he said, to list the broad range of indicators to be used in the making of policy. In the aftermath of the speech, many dealers clearly took the view that the policy detail was missing. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, vice president of Bank of America, said that sterling investors were worried by the strong emphasis on growth as the guiding principle of policy with little mention of inflation. And there was a strong feeling on Thursday night that cuts in UK interest rates would be announced as Friday trading opened in London. The pound therefore broke an important barrier of DM2.40 in Asia, slipping to DM2.3952 against the D-Mark and to Dollars 1.5575. However, the Bank of England did not cut interest rates when London opened, and the pound recovered some of its lost ground, peaking at DM2.4127. It later closed in London at DM2.41, down 1 pfennig on the day. The market's focus for the next few trading days will be firmly fixed on the US Presidential election. With the approach of polling day, the market has become increasingly unwilling to take a bet on the result. In part, that has been because of the narrowing of Mr Clinton's lead. A CNN/USA Today poll yesterday put him neck-and-neck with President Bush. According to Mr Hawkins, a Clinton victory will probably be followed by a short-term rise in the dollar. The incoming President's commitment to increased fiscal spending would make another ease in US interest rates unlikely. If Mr Bush wins, however, there could be a fall in the dollar/D-Mark rate. The dollar has been supported by republican victories in the past, but, in recent weeks, dealers have talked themselves into thinking that a Clinton victory would be good for the currency. 'If it doesn't happen there will be some unwinding of positions,' says Mr Hawkins. A Bush victory would also give dealers more time to focus on the plight of the US economy. Until the election, the dollar will probably trade quietly against the D-Mark. Yesterday, it closed at DM1.5420 from a previous DM1.5410.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE'S BAWDY, SHE'S ZANY, SHE'S PUSHING SAFER SEX  </P> <P> Like an Italianate Dr. Ruth stuck on fast forward, Suzi Landolphi is skipping  around on the lawn in front of the Cal Poly Pomona bookstore, talking sexy,  flinging blue condoms into the air, having a marvelous time.  </P> <P> "Don't you just love that word?" she says. "Don't you think it sounds Italian?  Gen-i-tal-ia. It's like an Italian liqueur. Let's see, you ordered the  Amaretto, you had the Galliano and yours is the . . . Genitalia, right? You  want it on the rocks or straight up?"  </P> <P> Passing students are giggling hard, threatening to drop their books. Many  decide to stop and listen as Landolphi, 39, all 5 feet, 1 inch of her, dressed  in turquoise leopard-skin print spandex pants, a stretched-out T-shirt and  high-top jogging shoes, steamrolls them with high-voltage sexual truth, giddy  blasts of earthy humor and a simple but effective demonstration of the  properties of condoms.  </P> <P> She has been at it since January, making paid appearances on college campuses  mostly in the East, talking about how to bring more knowledge and  understanding, and less confusion and viruses, into bed.  </P> <P> Her one-woman show, called "Hot, Sexy and Safer," arrived at Cal Poly Tuesday  as part of that university's AIDS awareness campaign. It was the first stop on  the five-campus Southern California leg of her national tour. (She is scheduled  to appear at Cal State Long Beach at noon today.)  </P> <P> The subject was safe sex, without the thou-shalt-nots. Landolphi did cover the  list of ways to become exposed to and to prevent AIDS, but rather than dwell on  the clinical, she went careening off into the more fanciful. Around the medical  information was spun a wildly uninhibited sexual primer for the possibly  bewildered young adult of the late '80s, awash in a sea of sexual anxiety and  misinformation.  </P> <P> "That's the whole essence of what I do," she says later. "It takes more courage  and guts to practice safer sex, but it can be more satisfying. We're so quick  to judge that if something's safer, it's not fun."  </P> <P> Landolphi says that, for college and university students right now, AIDS  prevention needs to focus basically on safe sexual practices, a fact of which  school administrators are aware.  </P> <P> "The administrators in the schools very much want me to talk about AIDS in  relationship to safer sex," Landolphi says, but it's not called an AIDS  lecture. "If we did that, no one would show up. I talk about AIDS, but we call  it provocative and zany and we use comedy."  </P> <P> Good sex is not limited to practices that can endanger one's health, she says.  </P> <P> "I think the sexual revolution made everything kinky again, everything we used  to do in between. Nobody pets anymore. Nobody even says the word pet anymore.  It's very satisfying, but no one does it. They go right to intercourse."  </P> <P> The root of the problem, she says, is a seemingly universal lack of  communication, honesty and trust between sexual partners, which leads to  inevitable confusion, misunderstanding and fumbling.  </P> <P> "Around the country people ask me if there's any difference between people from  the East or West, or the North or South. I say, 'Nah, people are having bad sex  everywhere.' "  </P> <P> Bad sex for Landolphi is sex that is unsafe, sex by rote, or sex that lacks an  element of playfulness. It's that last one that is Landolphi's hook to focus  attention on the others. She uses it to attract a crowd of about 200 in Cal  Poly's University Park area within the first few minutes of her 75-minute  ramble.  </P> <P> There is practically no escape into euphemism for those who stop to listen.  </P> <P> She explains, for instance:  </P> <P>  -- The essential differences among a number of condom designs.  </P> <P>  -- How communication between sexual partners can go awry. ("We need to start  to talk right from the beginning. As women to women and men to men, we don't  tell the truth to each other. Maybe safe sex is just bringing back honesty.")  </P> <P>  -- How "there are 2,862 ways to satisfy both yourself and your partner. Know  how I know? I'm up to 1,908."  </P> <P> All in all, it's pretty frank stuff from a woman who says she once wanted to be  a minister.  </P> <P> "I did end up being a kind of minister, though," she says.  </P> <P> A former film and video producer, Landolphi began doing volunteer work with the  AIDS Action Committee in Boston, where she was taught how to educate audiences  about AIDS and its prevention. She chose to do her speaking in local high  schools.  </P> <P> This January, she decided to escalate to college audiences, spruce up the  presentation with comedy and lots of frank adult talk, and take the show on the  road. She said she speaks at between 20 and 25 colleges each month to audiences  that sometimes number 2,000 or more.  </P> <P> It's all part of a process Landolphi says is designed to break a kind of sexual  logjam.  </P> <P> "People will come up to me after a show," she says, "and say that they were  just stuck sexually. Maybe they just didn't have the courage to make changes.  Or all the talk they've heard is the old condom-or-a-casket stuff."  </P> <P> Though her frank talk at Cal Poly occasionally caused some edgy laughter and a  few averted eyes, the reactions afterward were positive.  </P> <P> "She was very effective," said Douglas Lin, commissioner of programming for Cal  Poly's Associated Students Inc., the sponsor of the event. "(The audience)  responded a lot better to her than they would to someone saying that if you  don't use a condom you'll die. It was lighthearted, but the message still came  across."  </P> <P> Sometimes, however, eyebrows do rise.  </P> <P> "I don't get any (bad reactions) after I talk," says Landolphi. "I'll  occasionally get it before. Some people think I'm here to promote sex and  promiscuity. I'm asking them to consider getting more information based on  truth.  </P> <P> "There was one woman in Modesto who didn't mind my talking about intercourse or  anything else, but she said, 'I can't believe you came to talk about  masturbation.' "  </P> <P> She says she didn't always come off like your crazy, bawdy older sister. Her  Hot, Sexy and Safer persona "grew as I grew. It's an exaggerated form of me.  It's part little girl, part brassy Italian and part professional educator."  </P> <P> The current sexual mine field, says Landolphi, is "a storm, and we've got to  hold each other's hands and take care of each other and go through it  together." But, she says, there's no reason you can't have fun on the trip.  </P></p>

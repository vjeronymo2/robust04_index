			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Lloyd's Names to be excluded More than 1,000 Names have been told that they can no longer expect to participate in one of Lloyd's syndicates, Richard Lapper writes. Mr Michael Cockell, the manager of syndicate 570, last week wrote to the agents of Names on syndicate 570 cancelling their participations as from December 31 this year. In the letter he said he was concerned about changes 'planned by Lloyd's Central (the market's authorities) which, if implemented, may involve fundamental alterations in the present position of our Names, members' agents and ourselves as managing agents'. A group of senior market professionals, known as the value group, is examining a number of potentially far-reaching reforms affecting Names and their relationships with agents, including the feasibility of attaching value to Names' syndicate participations. The group is expected to report later this month. Mr Cockell said: 'We are serving the notices so we can arrange a proper and acceptable relationship for the future. 'I'm running a business. I'm not in the business of not knowing what the new rules are going to be and want to be free to make a mutually acceptable relationship around the new rules.' He said he was also concerned about the impact on Names of the size of losses for the 1991 year which Lloyd's will report next month. Syndicate 570 relies exclusively on individual Names and has received no backing from corporate capital.</p>

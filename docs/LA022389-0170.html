			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM HAD LOSS AFTER BIG REBOUND;  </P> <P> WILES LEAVES AS HEAD OF AILING MINISCRIBE  </P> <P> Q. T. Wiles, one of high technology's top corporate turnaround specialists,  resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive of MiniScribe, a troubled  computer equipment firm that until recent weeks was one of his biggest success  stories.  </P> <P> Wiles, who ran MiniScribe since 1985, could not be reached for comment. But  Warren Perry, MiniScribe's director of investor relations, said Wiles resigned  voluntarily. MiniScribe is one of the nation's largest makers of disk-drive  data storage devices, and its products are used in personal computers made by  such companies as Apple and Compaq.  </P> <P> Perry said Wiles, 69, told MiniScribe directors that he believed the company's  chief executive should be straightening out MiniScribe's problems from company  headquarters in Longmont, Colo. Wiles' office is in a high-rise Ventura  Boulevard building a few blocks from his home in Sherman Oaks in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> A Nebraska native, Wiles, whose full name is Quentin Thomas Wiles, is something  of a doctor for sick high-tech companies. His idiosyncratic management style  and tireless work schedule have gained him near-legend status in  high-technology circles.  </P> <P> At one point in 1986, Wiles was running seven companies while also serving as  chairman of the San Francisco investment firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist.  Obsessively meticulous, Wiles carries in his briefcase color-coded folders,  each color corresponding to one of the companies he is running.  </P> <P> One of his first moves when taking over an operation is to give managers "Q.  T.'s Disciplines," a 12-point guide that includes such suggestions as listing a  manager's five most important tasks. He also provides them with "Q. T.'s Method  of Operation," an eight-point list that includes general suggestions such as  identifying problems and planning solutions.  </P> <P> He also imposes wrenching cutbacks on companies, as he did when he took over  MiniScribe in 1985. Wiles was called in to turn around the company by Hambrecht  &amp; Quist, which owns 12% of its stock. Among his changes was to split the  company into about a dozen units to improve accountability.  </P> <P> After Wiles took over, the company's earnings and revenue grew every quarter  for three years, with sales soaring from $115 million in 1985 to $603 million  last year.  </P> <P> But MiniScribe's business turned down sharply late last year, in part because  it and other disk drive companies overestimated how much the business would  grow in 1988. Seagate Technology in Scotts Valley, which had expected a big  year, flooded the market with its drives, causing widespread price cutting.  </P> <P> Last week, MiniScribe reported its first loss in more than three years, showing  a $14.6-million deficit in the fourth quarter, compared to a profit of $9.1  million a year earlier. Sales were virtually flat at $116.6 million. In  December and January, the company fired 2,000 workers, most of them in  Singapore and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> MiniScribe's balance sheet, made public last week, also showed growing  problems. As of Jan. 1, MiniScribe's cash on hand had plunged to $8.9 million  from $49 million a year earlier and its inventory more than doubled to $199  million in the same period, reflecting large amounts of unsold products and raw  materials that were bought just as sales were slowing.  </P> <P> "It's too bad Q. T. didn't get out of there at the beginning of 1988. He would  have been a hero. But he stayed too long," said James N. Porter, president of  Disk/Trend Inc. in Mountain View.  </P> <P> Richard P. Rifenburgh, Wiles' partner at Hambrecht &amp; Quist Venture  Partners, was named to replace Wiles as chairman and chief executive. Perry  said Rifenburgh will relocate to Colorado.  </P> <P> Wiles remains vice chairman of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. He also is chairman of  some other companies, including Adobe Systems, a computer equipment company in  Mountain View, and Silicon General in San Jose, a Wiles spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

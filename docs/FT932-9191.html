			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Estate declines by 21.7% MITSUBISHI Estate, Japan's leading property company, suffered a double-digit decline in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year to March. Taxable profits dropped 21.7 per cent to Y70.6bn (Dollars 634m) from a year earlier because of a prolonged downturn in the domestic property market. Net profits fell 22.7 per cent to Y37bn, while sales grew a slim 1 per cent to Y349bn. The company owns land and office buildings in Tokyo's financial district. According to housing sector analysts, the economic downturn lowered Mitsubishi Estate's occupancy rates for large-scale office buildings to about 60 per cent, compared with 90 per cent in previous years. In addition, leasing rates are seen declining for its new buildings. Mitsubishi Estates shares, which have retreated from a 1993 peak of Y1,290, ended Y20 lower at Y1,140 in Tokyo yesterday.</p>

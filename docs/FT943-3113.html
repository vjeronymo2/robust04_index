			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Savoy in black with Pounds 0.58m Savoy Hotel, which announced a new management structure on Tuesday, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 575,000 for the half year to June 30 compared with losses of Pounds 1.75m. The group - whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley - said business had been boosted by recovery in both the US and the UK. Operating costs had increased, however, partly because of rising terrorism insurance expenses. Savoy said on Tuesday that Sir Ewen Fergusson would replace Sir Anthony Tuke as chairman at the end of the year. It said Mr Martin Radcliffe, a Savoy director, would be acting managing director in place of Mr Giles Shepard, who resigned on Monday. Savoy has approached Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager of London's Four Seasons hotel, to fill the position. A chairman's committee made up of Sir Ewen, Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte, and Mr John Sinclair, a Savoy director, would assist the new managing director. Savoy said Mr Radcliffe, Mr Sinclair and Mrs Jane Thorne, an assistant to Mr Radcliffe, had resigned as trustees of shareholding trusts. They no longer have non-beneficial interests in the shares held by these trusts. This does not affect the overall ownership of the group. Turnover for the six months increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 42.9m (Pounds 37.8m). There was an operating profit of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.61m loss). Earnings per A share were 1.3p (4p losses). Earnings per B share were 0.6p (2p losses). The A shares fell 12p to close at 913p.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Sometimes functional defects are observed at dose levels below those at which other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicators of developmental toxicity are evident (Rodier, 1986). Such effects may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transient or reversible in nature, but generally are considered adverse effects. Data from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postnatal studies, when available, are considered useful for further assessment of the relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance and severity of findings in the fetus and neonate. Often, the long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of adverse developmental outcomes noted at birth are unknown and further data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on postnatal development and function are necessary to determine the full spectrum of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential developmental effects. Useful data also can be derived from well-conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multigeneration studies, although the dose levels used in these studies may be much lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than those in studies with shorter-term exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Much of the early work in developmental neurotoxicology was related to behavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations. Recent advances in this area have been reviewed in several publications (Riley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Vorhees, 1986; Kimmel et al., 1990). Several expert groups have focused on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions that should be included in a behavioral testing battery, including sensory systems,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuromotor development, locomotor activity, learning and memory, reactivity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habituation, and reproductive behavior. No testing battery has fully addressed all of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions, but it is important to include as many as possible, and several testing batteries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been developed and evaluated for use in testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct extrapolation of functional developmental effects to humans is limited in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same way as for other endpoints of developmental toxicity, i.e., by the lack of knowledge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about underlying toxicological mechanisms and their significance. It can be assumed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional effects in animal studies indicate the potential for altered development in humans,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although the types of developmental effects seen in experimental animal studies will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily be the same as those that may be produced in humans. Thus, when data from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional developmental toxicity studies are encountered for particular agents, they should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered in the risk assessment process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agents that produce developmental neurotoxicity at a dose that is not toxic to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maternal animal are of special concern because the developing organism is affected but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity is not apparent in the adult. More commonly, however, adverse developmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects are produced only at doses that cause minimal maternal toxicity; in these cases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developmental effects are still considered to represent developmental toxicity and should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be discounted as secondary to maternal toxicity. At doses causing excessive maternal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity (that is, significantly greater than the minimal toxic dose), information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developmental effects may be difficult to interpret and of limited value. Current information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is inadequate to assume that developmental effects at maternally toxic doses result only from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maternal toxicity; it may be that the mother and developing organism are sensitive to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose level. Moreover, whether developmental effects are secondary to maternal toxicity or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not, the maternal effects may be reversible while effects on the offspring may be permanent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are important considerations for agents to which humans may be exposed at minimally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic levels either voluntarily or involuntarily, because several agents are known to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse developmental effects at minimally toxic doses in adult humans (e.g., smoking,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although interpretation of functional developmental neurotoxicity data may be limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at present, it is clear that functional effects must be evaluated in light of other toxicity data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including other forms of developmental toxicity (e.g., structural abnormalities, perinatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> death, and growth retardation). The level of confidence in an adverse effect may be as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important as the type of change seen, and confidence may be increased by such factors as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replicability of the effect either in another study of the same function or by convergence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data from tests that purport to measure similar functions. A dose-response relationship is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered an important measure of chemical effect; in the case of functional effects, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monotonic and biphasic dose-response curves are likely, depending on the function being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> 4.3.7. Physiological and Neuroendocrine Endpoints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> One of the key roles played by the nervous system is to orchestrate the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physiological functions of the body to help maintain homeostasis. To this end, the nervous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and many of the peripheral organ systems are integrated and functionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interdependent. For example, specific neuronal processes are intimately involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining or modulating respiration, cardiovascular function, body temperature, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gastrointestinal function. Because many peripheral organ functions involve neuronal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components, changes in such physiological endpoints as blood pressure, heart rate, EKG,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> body temperature, respiration, lacrimation, or salivation may indirectly reflect possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment-related effects on the functional integrity of the nervous system. However, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physiological endpoints also depend on the integrity of the related peripheral organ itself,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in physiological function also may reflect a systemic toxicity involving that organ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the neurotoxicological significance of a physiological change must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted within the context of other signs of toxicity. A variety of general physiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures can be applied to neurotoxicological problems. These procedures range in scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from simple measurements, for example, of body temperature, respiration, lacrimation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salivation, urination, and defecation, which may be included in routine functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observational batteries used for chemical screening, to more involved procedures involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements of blood pressure, endocrine responses, cardiac function, gastrointestinal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function, etc. The latter would be more appropriate for second-level tests to characterize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope of chemically related toxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The central nervous system also regulates the outflow of the endocrine system, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together with the influence of the autonomic nervous system, can affect immunologic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function (WHO, 1986). Hormonal balance results from the integrated action of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hypothalamus, located in the central nervous system, and the pituitary, which regulates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities of endocrine target organs. Each site is susceptible to disruption by neurotoxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents. Neuroendocrine dysfunction may occur because of a disturbance in the regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and modulation of the neuroendocrine feedback systems. One major indicator of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuroendocrine function is secretions of hormones from the pituitary. Hormones from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anterior pituitary are important for reproduction (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hormone), growth (thyroid-stimulating hormone), and response to stress (adrenocorticotropic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hormone). Hypothalamic control of anterior pituitary secretions occurs through the release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic hormones. Hormones from the posterior hypothalamus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (prolactin, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and growth hormone) are also involved in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of important bodily functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

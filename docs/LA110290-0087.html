			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION WITH MOST VOTES WOULD NULLIFY RIVAL ONE;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: THE STATE SUPREME COURT RULING PERMITS EXCEPTIONS WHEN CONFLICTS ARE  MINOR. IT MAY AFFECT SEVEN MEASURES ON TUESDAY'S BALLOT.  </P> <P> In a far-reaching ruling that could affect several initiatives on Tuesday's  election ballot, the state Supreme Court said Thursday that when voters approve  fundamentally conflicting measures, no part of the one receiving fewer votes  may take effect.  </P> <P> The ruling set important new guidelines that could resolve conflicts arising  from the growing trend of competing ballot measures. The state Constitution  says that when provisions of voter-approved initiatives conflict, those of the  measure receiving the higher vote take precedence. But left unresolved was  whether any parts of a measure with fewer votes could be salvaged as  reconcilable with a measure with more votes.  </P> <P> The justices held that when two such initiatives were presented to voters as  "all-or-nothing" alternatives -- or create a "comprehensive regulatory scheme"  on the same subject -- only the provisions of the measure that won more votes  can be enforced.  </P> <P> The decision could affect as many as seven initiatives on Tuesday's ballot that  could be considered in overall conflict, meaning that any of the measures  passed with fewer votes would be invalidated.  </P> <P> But the court also said that two conflicting propositions could survive if the  conflicts were only "minor." The measure with fewer votes would take effect  without the conflicting provision.  </P> <P> Some legal experts said the ruling leaves it unclear what would happen if  voters approve propositions that clash on one significant issue, but also  contain major provisions that are not in conflict.  </P> <P> For example, Propositions 131 and 140 on Tuesday's ballot conflict because they  would impose different term limits for office holders. But Proposition 131 also  calls for public campaign financing while Proposition 140 would limit the  Legislature's operating budget and eliminate its retirement system.  </P> <P> Thursday's action came in a 5-2 decision in which the court struck down  voter-approved limits on legislative campaign contributions and a ban on  off-year fund raising.  </P> <P> The court invalidated the remaining portions of Proposition 68, a campaign  finance initiative passed in the June, 1988, election with 53% of the vote.  Because a rival measure, Proposition 73, won 58% of the vote, only its  provisions could be enforced, the court said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the contribution limits of Proposition 73 have been declared  unconstitutional by a federal district judge.  </P> <P> When the Supreme Court decision becomes final in 30 days, California will be  left without any limits on campaign contributions -- even though voters passed  two such measures two years ago.  </P> <P> "Today's action by the state Supreme Court, combined with the earlier decision  striking down Proposition 73's contribution limits, returns California politics  to the law of the jungle," said Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, the leading sponsor of Proposition 131, urged voters to approve  that measure, which would reinstate Proposition 68's provisions enacting  contribution limits and public financing of campaigns.  </P> <P> The state high court, in a majority opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson,  refused to try to salvage parts of Proposition 68 that might still be  reconciled with Proposition 73, the measure that received more votes.  </P> <P> "Were the court to do so, the result might be a regulatory scheme created  without any basis for ascertaining whether the electorate understood or  intended the result," Eagleson wrote.  </P> <P> Dissenters Justice Joyce L. Kennard and Justice Allen E. Broussard criticized  the majority for its "all-or-nothing" approach to the issue. In order to uphold  the will of the voters, the court should examine the two measures, provision by  provision, and reconcile them "to the greatest possible extent," Kennard wrote.  </P> <P> A variety of propositions on Tuesday's ballot have conflicting sections, but  some also contain language making it clear what provisions would remain in  intact.  </P> <P> For example, Proposition 126, an industry-sponsored measure that would impose a  moderate increase on alcohol taxes, specifically seeks to wipe out Proposition  134, which would raise alcohol taxes by a larger amount.  </P> <P> And both initiatives affecting the state's logging practices -- the  environmentalist-backed Proposition 130 and the timber industry-sponsored  Proposition 138 -- say each would cancel out the other if it got more votes.  </P> <P> Two sections of Proposition 128, the sweeping environmental measure called "Big  Green" by supporters, also are targeted by other initiatives.  </P> <P> If Proposition 138 receives more votes, it would invalidate Proposition 128's  redwood preservation provisions. And Proposition 135, a pesticide regulation  initiative sponsored by farmers, would negate the pesticide provisions of Big  Green. But both of the counter-initiatives specifically state that they would  not invalidate the remainder of Proposition 128.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp and other backers of Proposition 131 contend that most of their  measure would take effect even if Proposition 140, with its conflicting term  limits for elected officials, receives more votes.  </P> <P> "The two initiatives conflict on only one point, and they have not been  promoted to voters as all-or-nothing, alternative regulatory schemes," Van de  Kamp told reporters.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, the sponsor of Proposition 140,  said the decision striking down Proposition 68 was "all the more reason for one  or both of these (propositions) to be approved."  </P> <P> Both Propositions 68 and 73 sought to impose broad changes in campaign fund  raising -- setting limits on contributions, barring transfers of funds among  candidates and restricting honorariums and gifts.  </P> <P> Proposition 68, applying only to state legislative candidates, was backed by  the League of Women Voters, Common Cause and Van de Kamp. Proposition 73,  covering all candidates for state and local office, was sponsored by state Sen.  Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) -- who subsequently resigned and is serving a 6  1/2-year prison term on federal corruption charges -- Sen. Quentin L. Kopp  (I-San Francisco) and Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton).  </P> <P> Under the state Constitution, any conflicts in voter-approved initiatives are  resolved in favor of the one that draws more votes. In this instance, some  provisions were in clear conflict: Proposition 68, for example, allowed  voluntary public funding for campaigns -- but Proposition 73 barred it. But  backers of Proposition 68 contended that there were other parts of the measure  that did not conflict with its rival and thus could take effect.  </P> <P> The state Fair Political Practices Commission ruled that overall, the two  measures were substantially conflicting and declared that only Proposition 73  could take effect.  </P> <P> But in August, 1989, a state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles compared the  measures provision-by-provision and said that Proposition 68 contained some  features that were "not in irreconcilable conflict" with Proposition 73 and  could survive.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a separate case, U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton of  Sacramento last September struck down the contribution limits and other  portions of Proposition 73 as a violation of free speech rights. The ruling  opened the way for local and statewide office-seekers -- such as gubernatorial  candidates Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein -- to receive unlimited amounts of  money in the campaign. But the judge reinstated the limits on contributions to  legislative races while the ruling was appealed.  </P> <P> In Thursday's ruling, the high court refused to engage in what it called  "judicial legislation" by trying to salvage parts of Proposition 68. There was  no way to prove that because the voters approved both, they wanted both to take  effect to the maximum extent possible, Eagleson wrote.  </P> <P> The court said that its ruling would not apply when "one or more minor  provisions" of an initiative conflict with a measure that gets more votes.  </P> <P> Eagleson's 40-page majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice Malcolm M.  Lucas, Justice Edward A. Panelli and Appellate Justice Arleigh Woods, sitting  temporarily by assignment. Justice Stanley Mosk concurred in the ruling  striking down Proposition 68's provisions and warned that piecing together  parts of two rival measures could create a "Frankenstein's monster whose  existence the voters never contemplated."  </P> <P> Hager reported from San Francisco and Paddock from Sacramento.  </P></p>

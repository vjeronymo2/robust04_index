			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has promised the banking sector it  will investigate the destabilization campaign against the  financial system, which was recently stepped up through false  reports of bankruptcies and closures of important banks.    An official spokesman said: "There are no plans to intervene  in the banks, and this has not been proposed."    In recent days, individuals who have no idea of the harm  they  are causing the nation took advantage of the last intervention  into banks subsidized by Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking  Protection Fund] to spread rumors nationwide on new measures  against other banks.    The truth is that no bank, and much less important banks, is  currently under investigation. Whoever is spreading these rumors  does not realize the harm being caused to the entire system.  Instead, all of us should make an effort to contribute to the  reestablishment of a normal situation for depositors, who have  become very tense in the wake of the last banking crisis.    Meanwhile, a Finance Ministry spokesman said the law  guarantees every depositor's savings, indicating the government  has complied with the law, as occurred in the Banco Latino case,  as well as in the cases of the other eight banks in which the  government intervened.    In another turn of events, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar  Salom said: "The bankers have expressed to me their justified  concern over this campaign, which the government will  investigate." Nevertheless, he admitted it is difficult to  locate those responsible for spreading false reports.    The crux of the matter is that now campaigns against the  so-called "solvent banks" have been stepped up, demonstrating to  the authorities that there may be criminal intentions behind the  rumors.</p>

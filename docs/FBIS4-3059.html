			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs have  agreed an international buffer force to enter the Muslim enclave  of Gorazde, according to U.N. Spokesman Major Dacre Holloway  today.    The spokesman said that Yasuhi Akashi, the chief U.N.  representative for former Yugoslavia, had been informed of the  Serb decision at Pale today, the stronghold of Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic, where Akashi and Karadzic had been  meeting in a bid to break the deadlock over the enclave.    Meanwhile, Akashi is negotiating with Bosnian Serb leaders  on  a truce for the besieged southeastern Muslim enclave and the  release of some 200 U.N. personnel.    According to the latest news reports, 19 Canadians -- 16  U.N.  soldiers and three military observers -- were released by  Bosnian Serb forces outside Sarajevo on Sunday [17 April], three  days after they were detained in retaliation for NATO air  strikes.</p>

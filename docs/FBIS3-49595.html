			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 12 January "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, January 12 (BTA) -- General Lyuben  Petrov, chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, helped  avert a cabinet crisis by persuading Defence Minister Valentin  Karabashev [title as received] not to tender a resignation, the  socialist daily DUMA says in a leader. According to the daily  which cites well-informed but unnamed sources, Defence Minister  Valentin Karabashev gave up his plan to resign at a closed  cabinet meeting on Monday [10 January]. His intention was  caused by a reportedly "scandalous" talk with the president who  treated the defence chief rudely, DUMA says. "Bulgaria Left With  no Defence Minister for Three Days," says a headline capping a  report on the same issue in the private daily STANDART NEWS.  The daily quotes General Lyuben Petrov as saying the defence  minister's resignation could trigger a chain reaction destroying  the entire army administration. "SDS (the Union of Democratic  Forces) To Ask President for Explanation," DEMOKRATSIYA, the  daily of the union, headlines its article. The report says that  according to the National Coordinating Council (the SDS supreme  leadership), the president's decree on a presidential Military  Office stirs suspicions of unconstitutionality. The  parliamentary Movement for Rights and Freedoms (of ethnic Turks)  will support the SDS, if the latter demands a closed plenary  sitting where President Zhelev would explain his stand, DUMA  says.    NATO gave the green light to letting in east European  countries through its Partnership for Peace Initiative.  Strangely, Bulgaria's name is not mentioned in any of NATO's  documents," [no opening quotation mark as received] OTECHESTVEN  VESTNIK, quotes Asparukh Panov, member of the Bulgarian  parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe, as saying.  Mr. Panov lays the blame on Lyuben Berov's cabinet, which  failed to implement the declaration adopted by parliament late  last year. In this declaration, the MP's obliged the cabinet to  do its best to file Bulgaria's candidacy for membership in NATO.    Bulgaria's Ambassador to Brussels Lea Koen was late to  submit  the National Assembly declaration on membership in NATO.  Instead of handing the declaration personally to the alliance's  leadership, she sent it by post, a correspondent of the  KONTINENT daily in Brussels reports. The daily cites Deputy  Foreign Minister Todor Churov as saying that right after the  declaration was adopted, it was given to all Bulgarian  ambassadors to the NATO member countries. According to the  procedure, Ambassador Koen had to meet with and hand the  declaration personally to Manfred Woerner, KONTINENT says. "It  would be ridiculous and regrettable, if Mrs. Koen really did  mail the document," Mr. Churov says.    President Zhelev asked for Bulgaria's full integration and  membership in NATO in a letter to the Alliance's Secretary  General Manfred Woerner on September 27, 1993, i.e., nearly  three months before parliament discussed Bulgaria's stance on  relations with NATO and adopted a declaration, reports the  press. BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leader Zhan Videnov  yesterday described this "as a new example of the fait accompli  policy becoming typical of the president's office," writes DUMA.  According to 24 CHASA, the Bulgarian Socialist Party sees the  president's letter as a gaffe manifesting his neglect of  parliament. KONTINENT reports Mr. Zhelev today will meet with  "eminent politicians to discuss the visit to Bulgaria on  Thursday [13 January] of U.S. envoy Madeline Albright."  [passage omitted]</p>

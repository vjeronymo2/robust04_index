			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs to get free vote on Sunday trading law EMPLOYEE PROTECTION emerged as a potential flashpoint last night as the government unveiled its plans for a bill to implement the reform of Sunday trading in England and Wales. Confirming that MPs would be offered a free vote on the core issue of whether restrictions to Sunday trading should apply, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, pledged that the envisaged bill would contain government clauses to protect 'existing' shopworkers from being compelled to work on a Sunday. But he skated around Labour demands that protection should additionally be given to future employees who objected to Sunday working. His 'instinct' would be not to aim at a set of regulations applicable solely to those employed in shops, he said. It later emerged that the government was not ruling out seeking to whip its employee protection provisions through the Commons. As outlined by Mr Peter Lloyd, home office minister, at last month's Tory party conference, MPs are to be offered a choice between a set of options for Sunday shopping ranging from full scale deregulation to a tightening of existing laws. Full deregulation - the choice favoured by Mr Clarke himself - would be on the present Scottish model, while the most restrictive option would be along the lines advocated by the Keep Sunday Special campaign. A third option, proposed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, is included. This would allow small shops to open on Sundays essentially without restrictions, while permitting larger outlets to open for up to six hours. It remains uncertain whether the bill will come before the Commons in the present parliamentary session. The drafting of legislation must await a decision by the European Court on whether the present law was overridden by the free-trade articles of the Treaty of Rome. Mr Clarke said yesterday that this ruling was now unlikely to be available before January. The government has been committed to reform of the Sunday trading laws since 1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986. For Labour, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, welcomed the proposals if handled in a 'sensible' manner and said the challenge was to present 'a lasting reform' which ended 'the present deregulation through anarchy'. The 'nub' of the issue was whether all employees - present and future - would be subject to the voluntary principle and entitled to premium payments for Sunday working. 'There are many inside and outside this House who believe that people should have greater freedom to shop on a Sunday provided that 'open on a Sunday' for us does not mean 'exploited on a Sunday' for those who will work in the shops that serve us,' he said.</p>

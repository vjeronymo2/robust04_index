			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAILED SATELLITE BOOSTER ROCKET FALLS, MISSES LAND  </P> <P> The rocket that launched a $157-million communications satellite but failed to  put it in the proper orbit burned up harmlessly in the atmosphere or fell into  the ocean, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Titan 3 booster came down on Wednesday morning at about the time the U.S.  Space Command had predicted, Army Maj. Thomas Niemann said.  </P> <P> The uninsured Intelsat 6 satellite, launched by the rocket on March 14, is  about 300 miles above Earth, a temporary position thousands of miles lower than  it is supposed to be.  </P> <P> The satellite wound up in a uselessly low orbit after failing to separate  properly from the second stage of the booster. Engineers managed to separate  the satellite via computer commands, then sent it into a higher orbit.  </P> <P> The second stage of the booster remained trapped in an orbit that swung within  about 100 miles of Earth and was pulled down by gravity.  </P></p>

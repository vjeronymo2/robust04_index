			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading ON NEW YEAR'S Eve the December stock index future and the Footsie traded options expired with the predictable hectic activity, as traders moved between derivatives and the underlying stock market. The operation, however, was turned up to full heat by London's response to the unexpected fresh surge on Wall Street to a new peak on the Dow, as well as by the calmer tone of sterling following Mr Norman Lamont's Christmas interview in the Financial Times. Futures traders said Wall Street had provided the chief impetus, while sterling, and the consequent outlook for UK base rates, remained potentially unsettling factors. The futures sector quietened down after the December expiry was concluded, but the March contract later provided a strong lead for underlying equities by moving to a premium of around 60 points, against an estimated 30-point fair value premium - the premium which takes account of financing and dividend flows. In traded options, the FT-SE contract was similarly active and later trading was featured by significant buying of calls on January option series. A large buyer for the January 2,450 and 2,350 was identified in the market.</p>

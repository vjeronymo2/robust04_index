			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: No right to speculate Sir, Your article on retail recovery and cash surpluses ('Pleasing some of the people', May 5) highlights an issue which is fundamental and yet is all too infrequently addressed. Whereas the analyst who advocates the return to shareholders of cash surpluses which are beyond the immediate needs of the business has an unassailable case, the arguments (pleadings) against are devoid of substance and cannot be sustained. The twin suggestions emanating from directors of companies featured - that share buy-backs and special dividend payments would be '. . . judged poorly by investors . . .' and '. . . would be indicative of a moribund management team with no ideas' - are in each case fatuous. There can be few recorded cases of investors being opposed to receiving a payment of cash which belongs to them, and the implication that investors cannot come up with ideas of their own on how to deploy their surplus cash is both arrogant and insulting. Managements (ie, the servants of the owners of the business) should be aware that it is not their function to speculate with their owners' money in fields beyond their briefs and outside their areas of competence. While this may clip their wings in a manner they find irksome, experience suggests that by being restricted to activities which they know and understand, even though these activities may be 'mature', they (and their shareholders) are more likely to prosper than if they are permitted to speculate with money which does not belong to them.

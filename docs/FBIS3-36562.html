Andrey Illarionov, head of the prime minister's analysis and  planning group, in his letter of resignation to Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, a copy of which has been obtained by  Interfax, says, among other things: "The approved present  composition of the government and the decisions which it is  drawing up (primarily those providing for huge benefits for the  agro-industrial and fuel and energy complexes and on the  unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus), as  well as public statements made by the premier make it clear that  the radical change in the economic policy started more than a  year ago is now complete."    In Illarionov's opinion, the present government has  effectively begun to restore former economic and political  practices. "Having gotten on their knees before lobbyists from  various industries and regions and giving in to their blackmail,  it will continue to meet their interests and bolster its own  power. Taking part in such activities contradicts my  convictions," the aide says.    "You are better aware than anyone else of the economic and  political damage done over the past year and a half to the  people of Russia and its president by the chairman of the  Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko. Recently you promised  comprehensive support to Gerashchenko. It is perfectly clear  that defending Gerashchenko is your position, with which I can  have nothing to do," Illarionov says, addressing Chernomyrdin.    "I cannot remain head of your analysis and planning group  because I came to the government to carry out economic reforms,  not to ditch them. I cannot remain in this post because I have  always been trying to defend the national interests of Russia  rather than those of a handful of collective-farm and state-farm  barons or generals from the fuel and energy complex. I cannot  remain in this post because I take a negative attitude to most  of the decisions you take and because I have to publicly explain  how harmful they are to Russia," Illarionov says.</p>

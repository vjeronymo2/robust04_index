Chiao Jen-ho, secretary-general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange  Foundation, and Tang Shubei, vice director of the mainland's  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, ended their  five-day talks in Beijing on Saturday [5 February] with the  issuance of a statement saying that agreement had been reached  on ways to handle three controversial issues.    The three issues are the sending back of airplane hijackers,  the returning of illegal immigrants, and fishing disputes. These  topics were on the agendas of previous talks between the SEF and  the ARAT'S but the two sides had been divided on how to deal  with them.    The negotiators also agreed at the Beijing talks that an  official pact will be signed after the exact wording of the pact  is decided in the next round of talks later this year. All this  can be seen as a breakthrough. Previous contacts between the SEF  and the ARATS had all failed to yield any concrete results.    This is only the beginning. There is still a long way to go  before a warm, brotherly relationship is established across the  Taiwan Strait. But the breakthrough, however small, is better  than nothing in view of the long, bitter confrontation between  Taiwan and the mainland.    The main obstacle to better progress by SEF and ARATS  negotiators is the sovereignty issue. While Beijing insists it  has sovereignty over Taiwan, Taipei maintains that the mainland  regime has no political or legal authority over the island.    This and other sharp political differences have prevented  the  SEF and the ARAT'S from settling a wide range of issues  concerning relations between the two sides.    The impasse must be broken if a favorable situation is to be  created for China's reunification -- the hope of all patriotic  Chinese.    At the news conference he held last Friday, Premier Lien  Chan  noted the importance of working for reunification of the nation,  and stressed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not  treat each other in an eat-or-be-eaten manner.    He has a point. At a time when Chinese around the world are  anxious for China's reunification, Taipei and Beijing should  work aggressively to overcome all the barriers to the  achievement of the goal.    Taiwan and the mainland, in negotiating for better ties,  should put aside the sovereignty issue. If both sides treat each  other with more trust, understanding, sympathy and respect, they  will be better able to solve the many seemingly unsolvable  problems troubling Taiwan-mainland interaction.    The sovereignty issue will probably sort itself out when  eventually a reunification arrangement is worked out that is  advantageous to both sides.</p>

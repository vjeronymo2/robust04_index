			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 30 (BTA) -- Speaking on the Nedelya  150 Weekly Political Programme of the Bulgarian national radio  today, Multigroup President Iliya Pavlov did not deny his  acquaintance with former communist functionary Ognyan Doynov,  but said that Mr. Doynov and Multigroup had no commitments to  each other. Mr. Doynov is believed to be in Austria now and the  Bulgarian prosecutor general has filed an official request for  his extradition to answer embezzlement charges. Mr. Pavlov  described as fabrications and lies the allegations that  Multigroup-affiliated companies have busted the Yugoembargo. As  for his acquaintance with Ivo Karamanski (the owner of the  Sevastopol Casino in Sofia and alleged Mafia boss now under  arrest), the Multigroup president said he had no personal  impressions as the two "represent different strata."    The Austrian press alleged that Multigroup is a Bulgarian  formation of companies-phantoms existing only as post office  boxes in Switzerland. There are also rumours that these  companies are laundering money of the former Bulgarian Communist  Party. According to press stories, Doynov's brother, Emil  Doynov, working as a consultant at the joint-stock company, was  playing the intermediary between Multigroup and Ognyan Doynov.  Newspaper stories alleged that Multigroup tops the list of the  companies that have busted the UN embargo. The group was said  to be involved in huge oil deals with former Yogoslav countries.  It was even said that the raging gangsters' war in Sofia was  ignited by a conflict between Ivo Karamanski and Iliya Pavlov.  The group was reportedly expelled from G-13, a formation of big  Bulgarian industrialists.    Iliya Pavlov said that Multigroup has over 3,000 staff and  the 1993 turnover was approximately $1,000 million, which is  "put down in the records of some major European banks." There  is no employee of the Doynov family in the holding group. Emil  Doynov had only been temporarily employed as consultant for some  deals with Poland in 1992, which "was an absolutely normal  business," and if it is necessary and profitable for the holding  group, it will employ him again, Mr. Pavlov said. Emil Doynov  is a former Bulgarian trade attache in Vienna.    Multigroup strictly observes the Yugoembargo, "all the more  that it had active business contacts in this region before the  enforcement of the UN sanctions," and these contacts will be  renewed when the embargo is lifted, Mr. Pavlov said. According  to him, undercover activity is unthinkable as the holding group  is the most strictly monitored institution in this country. Mr.  Pavlov dismissed as impossible allegations that G-13 members  have criticized Multigroup. "When Bulgaria and the national  capital are at stake, there should be no competition, G-13 means  that we have to be united when the national interests are  concerned," he said. Commenting on the difference between the  strata that he and Ivo Karamanski represent, Mr. Pavlov said  that Karamanski "is bodyguard or owner of a single casino, while  Multigroup is a economic giant which could own 100 casinos if it  wants to."    Multigroup emerged three years ago, starting its activity as  Multiart, a cooperative set up in 1988. The holding group works  predominantly in the sphere of metallurgy, chemistry and machine  engineering. It trades in coal, ores, salt, sugar, and develops  investment projects. The difference between Multigroup and  Multigroup Holding Group Inc., is that the latter holds the  shares of all Multigroup-affiliated companies, Iliya Pavlov  recently told the press. The holding group was registered in  Zug, Switzerland, and has subsidiaries in the United States,  Ukraine, Russia, South Africa and the Far East. The lending,  financial and banking activity of Multigroup is performed by the  Sofia Credit Bank, the Sofia Discount House and the Sofia  Insurance Company, First Bulgarian Stock Exchange and the  Macedonian Credit Bank.</p>

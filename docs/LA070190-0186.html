			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFE AND SANE FOURTH OF JULY PLANNED FOR WESTSIDE  </P> <P> From arts and crafts and pony rides in Beverly Hills to body building and  fireworks on the beaches, Westsiders will find a variety of safe and sane ways  to celebrate the nation's 214th Independence Day.  </P> <P> In Culver City, the Fourth of July will be an international civic celebration  of community service as well as a national day of patriotism. During the  two-hour program beginning at 7:30 p.m. on Culver City High School's Helms  Field, city officials will welcome the mayor of Lethbridge, Canada, the  community's latest sister city. The Canadian and American flags will fly side  by side as the Paul Bowman Million Dollar Country Western Band plays the  national anthems of both countries to an expected 15,000 spectators.  </P> <P> A 30-minute fireworks display at 9 p.m. will cap the program. Parking will be  available in the high school parking lot.  </P> <P> For those looking for something a little different, the Venice Beach Recreation  Center will sponsor its annual open muscle contest starting at 11 a.m. at the  site of the recently closed "Muscle Beach."  </P> <P> A Dixieland jazz concert starts at 2 p.m., and a fireworks display will start  at 9 p.m. Recommended for ideal viewing are sites along the beach as far north  as Venice.  </P> <P> In Pacific Palisades, more than 30,000 spectators are expected for the annual  Fourth of July Parade. The parade, complete with floats and marching bands,  will begin at 2 p.m. at Via De La Paz and Sunset Boulevard to Drummond Street  and the Palisades Park.  </P> <P> Later, at 7:30 p.m., there will be a fireworks display at the Palisades High  School Stadium.  </P> <P> There will not be a fireworks show in Beverly Hills, but there will be an  activities fair with art and crafts for children and music from two Dixieland  bands at Roxbury Park. The program runs from noon to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> And for those who just can't wait for the Fourth, there are the Hollywood Bowl  and Santa Monica's celebration.  </P> <P> On July 2, 3 and 5, there will be music under the stars and a host of Walt  Disney cartoon characters as part of Fourth of July celebrations at the  Hollywood Bowl. The Los Angeles Philharmonic and other visiting bands and  choirs will perform beginning at 8 each night.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, more than 200,000 early risers and patriots are expected for  the 4:45 a.m. Dawn's Early Light Fourth of July Celebration.  </P> <P> After a 30-minute fireworks show north of the pier, the 71-member L.A. Pops  orchestra will give a concert at the end of the Pleasure Pier featuring  traditional American marches and anthems, including selections from Aaron  Copeland's "Rodeo" and John William's score from "Born on the Fourth of July."  </P> <P> But for all the variety of celebrations, these events have one thing in common:  They are legal and safe. All fireworks, including the Safe &amp; Sane brand,  are illegal in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, Culver City and Santa Monica unless  they are being used by professional pyrotechnists with a city permit.  </P> <P> EVENTS FOR THE FOURTH  </P> <P> A list of concerts, fireworks and more to celebrate the Fourth of July.

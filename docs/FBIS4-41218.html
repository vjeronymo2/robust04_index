			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- Russian presidential  spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov described as "interesting, but  debatable" Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko's  proposal to postpone parliamentary elections.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Kostikov said  that "the extension of the deputies' mandates and, evidently for  maintaining the political balance, the postponement of  presidential elections would allow (us) to continue constructive  interaction between the branches of power established after the  signing of the agreement on civic accord."    He believes that the future parliamentary elections can  "make  the country bristle up again, whip up tensions and add to the  existing contradictions. This would play into the hands of only  extremists and impatient politicians."    "Russia is tired of the acute political fever. More than  anything else it now needs to preserve peace and conditions for  growing the fragile sprouts of civic peace and accord," Kostikov  said.    "There is one more aspect to it. We all see how difficult  the process of maturing and strengthening political culture in  Russia is. It will take more than one or two years to complete  it. But at the same time we see that seriously thinking  deputies and faction members are exerting considerable efforts  in order to fight the inertia of confrontation. We see the  gradual normalisation of cooperation between the president and  the constructive factions of the State Duma and the Federation  Council," he said.    Kostikov believes that the postponement of parliamentary  elections could "allow the deputies not only to gain political  experience, but, more importantly, to use it for Russia's  benefit."    Asked about Yeltsin's possible reaction to Shumeyko's  proposal, Kostikov replied that the president is unlikely to  announce his position on the issue in the near future. "He  values the sprouts of civic accord too much to endanger them,"  he added.    "This is a complicated, delicate and, I would say,  constitutionally contradictory issue. The most reasonable thing  we could do is to subject this dilemma to thorough and  comprehensive examination and discussion in parties, factions,  society and the press. But most importantly, to find out the  public mood," Kostikov said.    "In this situation we must act only on the basis of public  consensus and accord. Otherwise, the most interesting and  constructive idea can prove the opposite," Kostikov said.</p>

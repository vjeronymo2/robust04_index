			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Worry over postbags and pills - Tory MP's advice for ministers on public spending MINISTERS should listen to their backbenchers' views on public spending, then shut themselves up in an extended cabinet meeting and announce their decisions in 'one fell statement', according to Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister and member of the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs. With a government majority in the Commons of fewer than 20, ministers have no choice but to listen. Sir Rhodes' own views are clearly and vigorously stated. Any move that would hit pensioners - even though above the level of income support - would be 'immoral and politically disastrous', he said yesterday. Tory MPs have been shaken by the impact of the spate of reports on possible public spending measures. Many are expecting postbags bulging with letters from pensioners worried about the prospect of having to pay for prescriptions. 'Anything to do with prescriptions and health would be almost impossible to sell,' Mr Ian Bruce, an officer of the Tory backbench social security committee, said yesterday. The small majority meant that any changes had to be 'gradualist'. Not all Tories, however, are against the idea of making wealthy pensioners and parents pay for prescriptions. One described the present range of exemptions as 'lunatic' while others have expressed support for setting a limit to the exemptions, provided it was set in the right place. For the Tories, that means drawing the line so that people on moderately low incomes should not be penalised. It highlights the problem at the heart of the idea of directing benefits only to those who need them most - the lack of a sophisticated method of targetting. Many Tory MPs are deeply worried this means that changes will badly affect pensioners who are on relatively modest incomes and have made some provision for their retirement - the very people who should be among the government's core support and whom the government should wish to protect. Other spending options are unpopular for practical and principled reasons. Mr David Congdon, a Tory member of the cross-party health committee, expressed the view of several Tories in arguing that the bureaucracy needed to introduce 'hotel' charges for the better-off while they are in hospital, together with the likely scale of exemptions from the charges, made it a course 'not worth pursuing'. There was, however, less antipathy towards making employers rather than the state responsible for some work-related benefits. Mr David Willetts, a Tory member of the social security committee, said there was a case for making employers responsible for industrial injury benefits. Other MPs believe that maternity pay and sick pay could be transferred, especially as the Budget did not impose any new burdens on business. As for child benefit, its protection in the manifesto seems secure. 'The furthest you could possibly go on child benefit is taxing it,' one backbencher said. Whether it will continue to enjoy cast-iron support after the next election is more in doubt: another MP talked of being 'trapped' by the manifesto promises on benefits. For the longer term, MPs argue, the debate should be about the sort of welfare state the country wants to see. This should include discussion of how people can take more responsibility for providing for themselves, even though such options tend to involve short-term costs for savings that may not materialise for some years.</p>

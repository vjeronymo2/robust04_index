			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Management: Making political capital of running London Labour council leaders gather today in Blackpool for their annual local government conference, fervently hoping that a more sympathetic Labour government is on the way. But a change of government is unlikely to reverse the revolution in the management of local authorities imposed from above over the past 13 years. Labour's plans for a new strategic London authority, published last week, reveal that the party has now moved towards accepting many of the Conservatives' management reforms such as contracting out and performance-related incentives for top managers. According to 'An elected voice for London', the new elected Greater London Authority would determine the policy guidelines for strategic services such as public transport, planning, the police, fire brigades and environmental protection. But responsibility for the delivery of these services would be assigned to a small team of 'top calibre' directors who would be expected to contract out most of the work. 'Direct employment will be the least common option,' the paper says. 'Resources will be hired when they are needed for particular purposes and will not grow into a permanent bureaucracy.' While the directors would be supported by a small team of professional staff, staffing requirements would be minimised in two ways: by seconding staff for particular tasks - from business and industry as well as from London boroughs and transport operators. by contracting out even professional services such as research and policy development to research organisations, universities and polytechnics. Labour's advisers believe that enough Labour councillors now feel comfortable with the experience of contracting-out of local services for this radical approach to be acceptable. The directors would be appointed on five-year renewable contracts with remuneration packages designed to attract top managers from business and commerce as well as the public and voluntary services. Their brief would be to restore the services for which they were responsible to levels which could compete with other leading European cities such as Paris and Berlin. The blueprint for a new Greater London Authority reflects a determination among Labour leaders to find a new style of public sector management which builds on the managerial revolution launched by the Conservatives but gives an element of democratic accountability through the ballot box. Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, says that the new model is meant to mark a break from the sort of bureaucratic superstructure which characterised the now-defunct Greater London Council. 'If it works well,' says Gould, 'it will offer a managerial model for the regional authorities we hope to set up in the future.'</p>

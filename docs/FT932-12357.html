			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Yeltsin set to remove rebels from split cabinet PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday began moving against his conservative opponents by stripping his rebel vice-president Mr Alexander Rutskoi of his powers to oversee the government's corruption probe and preparing to sack conservatives in his divided cabinet. Mr Yeltsin, who won a convincing victory in Sunday's referendum, is being urged to move swiftly to consolidate his power base and push ahead with radical economic reform after warnings this week that Russia faces economic collapse unless swift action is taken. The man most at risk is understood to be Mr Georgy Khizha, a deputy prime minister. His removal would tilt the balance in the cabinet in favour of the reformist camp. Mr Yeltsin was also said to have spoken to Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a first deputy prime minister, about the possibility of promoting him to prime minister. Mr Shumeiko is a reformer who has become progressively more radical since joining the cabinet last June. Although Mr Yeltsin stopped short of offering the job to Mr Shumeiko, one radical insider predicted that Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, may soon be fighting to save his job. Mr Chernomyrdin, who has come into conflict with government radicals, recently compared the privatisation programme to Stalin's bloody collectivisation policy which destroyed private agriculture. President Yeltsin's move to strip Mr Rutskoi of the investigation into fraud, bribery and other official abuses, and take over the investigation himself, follows a weekend order also removing from the vice-president responsibility for agriculture. Mr Rutskoi, who ran on Mr Yeltsin's 1991 election ticket but has crossed into open opposition, has made sweeping allegations of corruption against leading government figures in an attempt to damage the president in the referendum campaign. He and other leading conservatives have dismissed the outcome of Sunday's vote, in which Mr Yeltsin won 58 per cent support for his rule and 53 per cent backing for radical economic reforms begun last year, which have since lost momentum. The conservative-dominated Russian parliament, meanwhile voted to set up its own investigation into corruption, sharpening the confrontation between the two sides battling for control of power in Russia. Parliament also ordered the government to dilute the mass privatisation programme initiated by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister. It voted to abolish its economic reform committee, which is filled with supporters of radical reform. The committee headed by Mr Sergei Krasavchenko, a Yeltsin supporter, had been instrumental in resisting attempts by the parliamentary leadership to give more shares to employees as opposed to the public. Mr Chubais said yesterday: 'Deputies have finally disengaged themselves from the people. This is a useless attempt to change the natural course of events. Life will go in one direction and the parliament will go in another.' Mr Andrei Illarionov, deputy head of the radical Centre for Economic Reform, who was appointed by Mr Chernomyrdin as his economic adviser yesterday, said the government was duty-bound by the referendum results to return to the radical reform course begun last year. 'That is my personal desire and understanding of the situation in the country,' he said in a telephone interview. 'I haven't seen signs yet of a shift back to radical reform. But it is possible this will be implemented in the coming few days.'</p>

[Georgiy Kunadze] Russia is displeased with North Korea,  which is trying to receive "special treatment" within the  Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT]. In March 1993 North  Korea declared that it would withdraw from the NPT, but has  withheld that decision. North Korea can choose on its own if it  will withdraw or remain in the NPT. As long as it has decided  to remain in the NPT, however, I believe that as a member of  international society, North Korea must sincerely implement the  duties of preventing nuclear proliferation. North Korea must  show a clear attitude regarding this matter.    [Kim] It was learned recently that the Russian Government is  showing moves to repay ROK's loan through the transfer of  military technology.    [Kunadze] The Russian Government regards the ROK as an ally.  Therefore, I believe that there will not be any big barrier in  transferring military technology. I believe that this issue  must proceed from a purely private level and in accordance with  international practice. If the quality is good and the price  satisfactory, I do not know of any reason for the ROK not to  purchase Russian weapons. This can be carried out in the form  of a direct trade or possibly through joint ventures.    [Kim] How do you view the bombing of the Korean Air Line  plane in 1983 and the issue of repaying the ROK's loan, which  are regarded as pending issues between the two countries?    [Kunadze] The Russian Government has cooperated to find out  the truth about the Korean Air Line plane bombing incident. I  believe that the Russian side is no longer politically  responsible. I would like to express profound sympathy for the  victims and the bereaved families. Even though experts from  Russia, the ROK, and other related countries carried out an  accurate investigation and reached a united result, I doubt that  this will by any means be a consolation to the bereaved families.    The issue of repaying the ROK loan is a slightly delicate  issue. When Russia was burdened with the old Soviet Union's  foreign debt, it reached an agreement with the Western creditor  group on the principle of repaying debt. A condition was  attached in that Russia cannot repay its loan with any other  country before receiving approval from the Western creditor  group. I would like to reveal that repaying the $3 billion debt  to the ROK side is not that big a burden to Russia, but Russia  can suffer economic consequences from the Western creditor group  if Russia repays the ROK.    [Kim] Do you have anything to say to the ROK Government?    [Kunadze] Most of all, I would like to discuss the issue of  returning the embassy lot situated in Chong-tong, Chung-ku,  which was used during the Czarist days. The embassy building  that we are currently using is situated in Samsong-tong,  Kangnam-ku and is too far away from the center of the city, thus  causing difficulties in conducting our work.    During the Czarist days, all embassy buildings in the ROK  were built from soil and building material brought from their  native countries. This is why we have such an affection for our  embassy lot. China and Vietnam have been allowed to use the  embassy lot that was used by the former Taiwanese and Saigon  governments. I would appreciate it if this was considered.    [Kim] What is your impression of being appointed ambassador  to the ROK?    [Kunadze] I have visited the ROK on many occasions before,  but this is the first time I have assumed the duty of  ambassador. I am working to get accustomed to Korean customs.  The ROK is a safe country at least in public peace and order  because there are not that many crimes such as highway  robberies. However, I believe that the ROK is faced with  serious social problems, such as water contamination and traffic  congestion.</p>

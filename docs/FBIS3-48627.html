However, it has once again served to highlight Europe's  comparative impotence in dealing with Tokyo on matters of trade.  In a concerted bid to break into Japan's obdurate business  culture, Washington has threatened Japan with trade sanctions if  it fails to reform the bidding process by which it has  historically excluded foreign contractors.    In an eleventh-hour move last week, the government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced a plan to increase the  openness and fairness of its construction market. The  concession comes on the eve of further US-Japan bilateral trade  negotiations next month at which Washington will press Japan to  open its markets to American cars and components and provide  greater access for its semiconductor manufacturers.    Progress on these and other trade-related matters are being  closely monitored by the European Union [EU],which faces similar  problems in its relations with Japan.    Despite the illusion of unity created by a single market,  however, the interests of the Union's 12 member states are still  far too diverse and uncoordinated for any comparable moves by  Brussels. Playing governments off against each other is an old  Japanese sport to which there is really only one solution: total  European union. The difficulty in achieving a more unified  stance is that while some countries seek protection from  Japanese imports, others are eager to attract Japanese  investment.    Yet Washington's problems of greater market access and a  huge  trade imbalance with Japan are no less real for the economies of  the European Union. This has seen the Union's trade deficit  increase from $18.5 billion in 1990 to $31.2 billion in 1992  which, despite a small improvement in 1993, is equivalent to 3.2  per cent of Japan's economic output. Indeed, a feeling persists  among many Union manufacturers that Japan still tends to favour  US exporters to the detriment of Europe.    "If Airbus Industrie has achieved a 30 per cent share of the  world civil aircraft market," asks Bernhard Salzer, chairman of  the European Parliament's trade delegation to Japan, "why is the  corresponding share in Japan only ten per cent? And why has  Rolls-Royce sold no aircraft engines in Japan since 1970?"    Japan is a master at denying foreign firms access to its  local markets. The techniques employed in targeting the  economies of so-called trading partners while simultaneously  protecting their own have varied from the unwritten  "administrative guidelines" issued by the much-vaunted Ministry  of International Trade and Industry (MITI), to the spoiling  tactics of an overzealous customs service.    Every embassy in Tokyo has its own favourite tales of the  ruses employed by Japan and its compliant bureaucracy at denying  foreign companies the right of entry to the world's second  largest economy. Through the pretence of language difficulties,  cultural misunderstandings and the invisible hand of government  officials dedicated to keeping foreign companies out, Japan has  long enjoyed the dual benefits of a protected domestic economy  coupled with easy access to most foreign ones.    Through its mission in Tokyo, the European Commission  battles  for reforms and the removal of these obstacles which, says the  Union's chief trade negotiator Sir Leon Brittan, "are simply  unacceptable in an open trading system".    The most frequent complaint of European companies is the  over-dependence of Japanese companies and government agencies on  traditional suppliers -- usually Japanese -- and the refusal to  explore the possibility of working with new ones. Others point  to the long list of excluded sectors and exemptions contained in  the country's anti-monopoly law and to its over-burdensome  regulations.    Prior to Kantor's recent successes, these have been  particularly marked in the area of public procurement.  According to the Commission, there are specific procedural  obstacles for foreign companies -- most notably the system of  prequalification and the demands for very high guarantees --  which effectively exclude foreign companies.    As the pressure on Japan to adopt more liberal trading  practices has mounted down the years, its exclusion techniques  have become more sophisticated and obtuse. The major hotels of  downtown Tokyo have grown rich on the steady stream of foreign  businessmen and government delegations attending this or that  trade conference seeking ways of penetrating Japan's invisible  trade barriers.    Creating joint committees and working groups to investigate  trade and protectionist grievances is a stalling tactic well  known to anyone acquainted with the intractable problems of  doing business with Japan. While the world is now a little  wiser to these ploys, it is remarkable how many gaijins  (foreigners) succumb to the charms of Japanese hospitality and  still come away believing they have wrung concessions from their  hosts.    "It can be depressing to look at the past," notes the EC's  chief trade negotiator. "Over the past 15 years, Japan has  pushed through a total of 13 economic packages to stimulate  growth and reduce the trade imbalance. And yet the surplus has  barely diminished. In 1992, it represented 3.2 per cent of  Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) and was over 3.5 per cent  of GDP in early 1993."    As Europe's trade deficit with Japan hit a new high of $35  billion in 1990, the Union demanded that Tokyo take immediate  steps to reduce this lopsided situation by opening its markets  to European exporters and removing the barriers that frustrate  commerce. The outcome of subsequent EC-Japan talks in July 1991  was another classic piece of highminded diplomatic rhetoric  backed by little substance which, say critics, will probably  achieve very little.    After more than two years of "co-operation and partnership",  the reality is still a yawning chasm in trade volumes as  Japanese ships dump huge quantities of manufactured goods at  European ports and return home with Plimsoll lines well above  sea level.    Taking inter-dependence to its logical conclusion, insists  Brittan, the 20 million unemployed in Europe are as much Japan's  problems as they are Europe's.    As Japan's economic fortunes wane and recession bites  deeper,  however, there are signs of greater understanding and humility  from the Tokyo side. Once quick to dismiss trade difficulties  as more about the inability of foreign firms to understand  Japanese markets and meet the high standards of the Japanese  consumer, the beleagured Hosokawa government has already shown a  greater willingness to address some of these longstanding  grievances than most of its predecessors.    For Europe, the creation of a single market is also helping  the EU to organise a framework of contacts and an agenda for  negotiations with Japan. Inevitably, such efforts continue to  focus on trade where -- although recession in Europe and a  strong yen have temporarily arrested the slide -- the underlying  imbalance continues to exacerbate relations between the two side.    Unlike the US's tougher line, the Commission is adopting a  softer, less confrontational approach in the hope of benefiting  from the new political mood now pervading Japan. Known as the  trade assessment mechanism (TAM), it focuses less on questions  of market share in given industrial sectors and more on a joint  EC-Japan analysis of specific products and how they perform.    "The idea," explains the Commission's Tokyo spokesman Gerard  Legris, "is to detect products which do not enjoy the same  market share in Japan as elsewhere. Selection is on statistical  criteria rather than partisan interest and aims to provide a  representative basket.    "Having mutually agreed those areas or products," he adds,  "we then analyse the factors behind this poor showing. It may  well be that the fault lies with Europe, or it may be with the  Japanese."    The Commission hopes this will allow both sides to identify  trouble spots and agree remedial steps. It also believes this  pianissimo approach is essential if the Commission is to gain  the cooperation of Japanese ministries and avoid tying the  exercise to the specific problems of individual companies.  Several TAM meetings have already occurred in Brussels and  Tokyo and their findings are due to be discussed at the next  round of EU-Japan ministerial meetings.    Once again, Japan's priority is on the US dispute in  readiness for the Hosokawa-Clinton summit on 11 February with no  date agreed for the European talks. Are Europe's interests,  therefore, once again playing second fiddle to Washington's?    The strategy of a country which produces 16 per cent of  global GNP but attracts only one per cent of direct foreign  investment has never been hard to fathom. Europe must learn  that, to the Confucian mind, a paper tiger poses no threat.</p>

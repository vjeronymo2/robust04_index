			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Markets: Weevils in the infrastructure carrots - Global Investor A 20-25 per cent return for investing in a stable utility such as a power station, or a toll road? A way into the emerging markets of Asia without pumping more cash into what have proved highly volatile stock markets? These are the sort of carrots being dangled in front of pension funds and other long-term investors in the US and other developed nations. Sooner or later, no doubt, many members of pension schemes or holders of mutual funds will indirectly own part of a toll road in Guangdong, a power plant in Malaysia or a telephone company in Indonesia. But when and how will those investments be made - and at what sort of return? Private investment in infrastructure in the developing world - mainly Asia - is running at about Dollars 15bn a year, according to one international development agency. That is a drop in the ocean compared with the Dollars 200bn being spent annually on power, water, telecommunications, transport infrastructure and drainage. A large part of the Dollars 200bn is going on projects, such as sanitation, which will never attract private money; but there is still a huge demand for capital which even the fabled savings rates of Asia's populations cannot satisfy. Much of it will simply have to come from international investors and western commercial banks. This is likely to be one of the conclusions drawn by the World Bank, which is publishing a study on infrastructure needs this month. That suggests one possible answer to a nagging question: if utility projects are so safe, why promise such big returns? In part, because capital from the developed world has not yet been mobilised on a significant scale. That places an immediate premium on those investments that are being made. There are signs that the money is starting to flow. Last week, the biggest fund of its kind - a Dollars 1.1bn Asian infrastructure fund backed by American International Group, the US insurer - was finalised. Peregrine Investments, a Hong Kong-based firm, is close to completing the first half of its Dollars 1bn fund. Portfolio investment may have been the most visible aspect of the renewed capital flows to developing nations this decade, but it has not been the most significant. Direct investment makes up the lion's share (see charts.) Bypassing the markets has obvious attractions: fewer valuation problems and less volatility. For long-term investors, there is also an attraction in the annuity-type returns of a utility. But these projects carry their own risks, aside from the obvious problems such as political upheaval or a balance of payments crisis, or the difficulties of completing the technically advanced projects. First, the high rates of return envisaged at present may simply not be available. They amount to an extra tax on local consumers - a concern that the Chinese are beginning to raise. One power project is reported to have been put on ice this year after the authorities refused to countenance an annual return for the equity investors of more than 15 per cent. A typical independent power station in the US earns a return of some 12-13 per cent a year. China (with a 13 per cent growth rate and commensurate growth in the demand for power) can be forgiven for asking why its consumers should reward foreign capital at twice the US rate. The projected equity returns are also dependent on the sort of gearing levels seen in developed-world projects, where debt usually makes up some 75 per cent of the finance. Will debt be available on that scale in the developing countries? One day, perhaps, bonds backed by a toll road in Guangdong will be as readily available in the US as ones secured on a toll road in Orange County. Rating agencies such as Standard &amp; Poor's point out that the model already exists: more than half of all municipal bonds issued in the US each year (or more than Dollars 100bn) are backed by specific projects. Right now, though, such vehicles are a long way off. That leads to the second risk. In most developing countries, the public policy debate over the rights and duties of privately owned and operated roads or telephone companies is in its infancy. It's all very well to run a power station: but on what terms will it be connected to the national grid system? How are the tariffs set, or the regulations which govern access to electricity? Until there are clear answers to questions like these, many investors will stay away. Third, there is the question of picking the right investment partners. Much of the private money has been channelled through contractors or equipment makers. Should portfolio investors stand shoulder to shoulder with them as co-investors? The commercial interests of a contractor-investor are broader than those of a pension fund: they include selling, say, power generating equipment, not just making an investment return. One of the most ambitious plans to date has been the venture between GE Capital, part of General Electric (a big supplier of power systems), financier Mr George Soros and the International Finance Corporation. These people make curious bedfellows. To date, says GE Capital, they have made no efforts to raise the Dollars 2.5bn they talked of back in January: the projects must come first, the finance later. How eager will investors be to back a fund which seems at least in part to be acting as a vehicle for supporting GE sales? And fourth, where is the exit? It all comes back to those stock markets. Sooner or later, many private utilities will find their way on to local bourses, as their shareholder-developers seek a way out. It all adds up to a huge demand for new investors somewhere down the line. But at least by then the emerging stock markets will have had a chance to grow up a little.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Total return in local currency to 2/6/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               % change over period                      US   Japan  Germany  France   Italy      UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week               0.08    0.04     0.10    0.11    0.14    0.09 Month              0.34    0.19     0.45    0.49    0.67    0.43 Year               3.69    3.34     6.75    6.94   10.13    5.81  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week               0.15   -0.87    -0.38   -1.33   -1.43   -1.15 Month              0.68    0.50    -0.67   -1.38   -1.43   -1.08 Year               0.74    7.26     6.52    6.01   15.59    3.79  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week               0.25   -1.89    -1.27   -3.08   -2.88   -1.63 Month              0.88   -0.05    -2.36   -3.63   -4.18   -2.54 Year              -0.32    9.29     4.02    4.19   18.04    3.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week                0.1     2.3     -0.4    -3.8    -1.2    -1.2 Month               1.3     6.5     -6.7    -7.5    -8.7    -4.7 Year                3.4     5.2     28.8    14.2    37.6     9.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ruben Dario Carles, Change 94 Alliance </F> presidential candidate, by Radio Soberana owner Alonso Pinzon  and reporters Blas Julio and Juan Ramon Martinez at the studio  in Panama City; from the "Crossfire" program; monitored in  progress -- live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Pinzon] There is a question  people are waiting for you to answer, and which we cannot avoid,  and it has to do with the bases. Panama now must face the fact  that the treaties will expire on the year 2000. No one has had  the courage to speak up as Professor Carles has with regard to  the bases, which are assets. We would like Prof. Carles to tell  us what he will do with regard to the bases, what will be his  government's initiative should he become president.    [Carles] Definitely, I believe the next government will face  a very important period, perhaps the most important in the  country's history. One of its main issues will be the operation  and functioning of the Canal, the appropriate use of the  reverted areas, and the decision on possible negotiations with  the United States for leasing some of the sites the U.S. Army  has occupied until now, and which must be vacated, according to  the treaties.    I think we must stop talking nonsense. The United States has  rights according to the neutrality treaty signed by Omar  Torrijos -- and the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD -- with  the Carter administration. The U.S. Government has the  following privileges according to the Nunn and DeConcini  amendments: expeditious transit, which according to them means  to be at the head of the line, and second, it has a right to  intervene and return to Panama whenever it feels there is a  justified reason, which it can easily interpret its own way.    I believe if someone occupying the basement or the attic my  house must leave because his contract expires, but at the same  time he can enter my house any time he wants because I  authorized it, then it would be better for me to offer him a  corner of my patio, but demanding certain concessions. You see,  the Americans.... [pauses] please, gentlemen, let's face it:  Omar Torrijos himself said so, he placed us under the  Pentagon's umbrella. Why? Because he did not dare speak the  truth. He gave the Americans the privilege of entering Panama  whenever they fell like -- because they are the ones who will  determine the circumstances -- in perpetuity, from here to  eternity.    So, what's the problem? What we could do is tell them: We  will lease you a piece of land at Howard airfield, or part of  Kobbe. In exchange for that, you will authorize the entrance of  Panamanian products, of thousands of tons of sugar, which will  create jobs for so many people in the central provinces;  thousands of tons of beef, which will benefit so many cattlemen  in the interior of the country; more coffee, fruits, tobacco;  guarantee the placement of banana shipments. We could also open  markets for the Panamanian textile industry, which would help  thousands of female operators who can sew top quality garments.  We could sell guayaberas, shirts, underwear, pajamas in the  United States if we have the quotas. What we could do is  exchange a lease contract to operate Howard, for example, for a  concession that would permit the hiring of 25,000 to 30,000  Panamanians in textile factories currently not being used at  full-capacity. That is what we must look for, gentlemen.  Employment for our youths and opportunities for investment and  production.    We must say this frankly. We want to negotiate with the  Americans. Why talk about nationalism and sovereignty?  Torrijos, the Panamanian officers and the PRD were always  talking about nationalism and sovereignty, when in fact one of  them was a CIA employee, and the other one negotiated a treaty  that placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella.    [Pinzon] Would you immediately appoint a commission to take  the initiative, to seek a formula, instead of waiting for them  to act?    [Carles] Definitely. I already have chosen the three persons  who would go to the United States to make contact with U.S.  authorities. Don't listen to those who are saying that the  gringos are not interested. They say.... [pauses] it is true  that some diplomatic officials have said they are not  interested, but what do the military forces have to say after  all? Who decides? Torrijos already placed us under the  Pentagon's umbrella. That treaty was signed by Carter and  Torrijos.    [Pinzon] I believe that treaty also allowed them to  intervene  in 1989, in addition to the blunder committed by the drug  trafficker.    [Carles] Of course.    [Julio] There is another interesting topic after the U.S.  bases, which the thesis presented by Prof. Carles undoubtedly  creates and fosters new hopes in the people that there will be  new job opportunities. Prof. Carles, I have witnessed several  meetings you have held with Indian leaders. The current  problems faced by the Indian communities have turned chaotic,  critical, disastrous. The Panamanian Indians claim they have  been neglected. You have met with the main leaders of the  various Indian communities. What can you tell us about those  meetings?    [Carles] Indians are as Panamanian as we are. They have  acquired representativeness, and they are very proud of their  customs, traditions, and language, which we must respect and  promote. They must feel that they are Panamanians, with their  own characteristics. That occurs everywhere in the world.  Families, even among us, maintain certain traditions, customs,  and speak their native language. Once they join the country,  respect the laws, and feel that they are Panamanian citizens, we  must help them, especially with public services. The government  must take care of their needs in education, health, housing,  transportation, security, and protect them from vices, drugs,  abuses, and criminals. That occurs in Indian communities in San  Blas, Darien, Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, and parts of Veraguas.  We must respect them, support them, and help them join society.    The Panamanian Government -- not now, but during the past  few  years -- has sketched programs with other countries and  international indigenous organizations. The funds, however, are  not properly used. Those groups of Panamanians are deceived, as  their needs for public services are not met. Millions of  dollars were squandered under the military governments to make  Indian communities believe they were receiving help. This  happened in Veraguas, Chiriqui, and San Blas. We must tell  those Panamanians: We have a plan for you, in which you can  participate, and we will do it the right way. Forget it,  politics is not eternal. Political campaigns are one thing, and  another is working to find permanent solutions to the problems.    I have told those Panamanians in the indigenous groups that  I  will struggle on their side, respecting their Indian identity.  I will help them, not doing what they themselves must do, but  support them. It is better not to adopt paternalism, which  creates dependency and in the long run does more harm than good,  because it corrupts. The Indians and the state.... [pauses] in  this case I could get funds from many international  organizations, but they must start preparing to work in  reforestation activities, environmental protection, ecology.  They are a valuable resource, their living conditions are  important from the standpoint of ecotourism and tourist  attraction. They must participate, and not think that others  will do the work for them.    There is a very interesting and important group residing  here, which includes doctors, lawyers, sociologists, economists  -- people who know. But they must start thinking in terms of  Panamanians who are going to help their ethnic fellow men. The  state must work together with the most capable and well-trained  Indians; with those that deserve official support. [passage  omitted]</p>

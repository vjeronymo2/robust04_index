			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses easier ahead of Buba meeting TOMORROW's Bundesbank meeting, the last until August 26, remained on most investors' minds yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. There is a view that even if a rate cut does occur the turmoil in the ERM will continue. UBS, in a global strategy paper published on Monday, wrote that 'the key question is what amount of easing is needed by the Germans to stabilise the ERM lastingly, in view of the fact that in the past 10 months the German repo rate has fallen by 260 basis points. 'The answer surely is much more than the Bundesbank will be willing to give in the near term and the conclusion must therefore be that an end to the long running ERM crisis cannot be expected from this week's meeting'. While forecasting that the Buba could leave interest rates unchanged tomorrow, the UBS strategists noted that 'the risks to this view are steadily increasing as international pressure mounts'. UBS suggested that a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate could happen - anything greater virtually ruled out by the 'deterioration in domestic economic conditions' - accompanied perhaps by a 50 basis point cut in the Lombard. FRANKFURT featured cars and banks as the overall market slipped back slightly after Monday's solid rise. The DAX index closed off 9.29 at 1,845.23 in turnover of DM10bn. BMW surprised some analysts after announcing a 39 per cent fall in first half net profit and the shares drifted down DM16.50 to DM562.00. Daimler slipped DM2.80, having earlier seen a high of DM694.50, on news that it was to be listed in New York. Volkswagen eased DM6 to DM348 during the session before rising to DM350.50 in the after market on news that a news conference had been called for today at which the group will comment on the 'Lopez affair'. The major banks went against the market trend, Commerzbank up 80 pfg at DM318.80, Deutsche 70 pfg higher at DM744.70 and Dresdner up DM1.80 at DM399.80, on expectations of strong operating gains in forthcoming interim results. PARIS fell back through the 2,000 barrier in a thin market. Eurotunnel featured with a gain of FFr2.30 or 6.3 per cent to FFr38.60 after the group said that it had reached agreement with TML on completion of the project. AMSTERDAM was unchanged on the day, the CBS Tendency index closing at 119.2, although there were some steep falls among a number of stocks. DSM retreated another Fl 1.90 to Fl 94.70 ahead of tomorrow's interim results while KLM slipped Fl 1.20 to Fl 33.00, Philips lost 10 cents to Fl 31.20 as the group said that it was to sell its Magnavox unit. BRUSSELS saw late selling in what some analysts thought might be the start of a consolidation phase after the recent rally. The Bel-20 index gave up early gains to finish 5.69 lower at 1,301.49. Ms Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson thought that the market was ready for a correction, noting that the rally had been led by strength in cyclical stocks which were now looking over extended on fundamentals. The Belgian franc was under pressure and there was also some nervousness as the government began to review its 1994 budget plans, she said. Solvay, opening the interim reporting season today, fell BF200 or 1.6 per cent to BFr12,075 on expectations of a net loss of between BFr500m and BFr1bn, following the collapse of the European bulk chemical industry and restructuring charges. Clabecq, the steel group, continued to surge ahead, rising BFr130 or 16.3 per cent to BFr930 on continued speculative buying, for a 55 per cent rise over three sessions. ZURICH encountered profit-taking which left shares off their best levels but the SMI index finished 9.7 higher at 2,398.5, on expectations that interest rates still have some way fall. Nestle continued back in favour, adding SFr22 to SFr1,055 in active trading. MILAN reversed the lower trend of the previous four sessions in volume that picked up strongly after Monday's lull and the Comit index rose 7.35 to 556.68. The telecommunications sector returned to favour with some large foreign orders driving Sip L100 or 3.7 per cent higher to L2,778 in volume of 14m shares. Short-covering helped Ferruzzi L31 or 7.9 per cent higher to L421.5 while speculative buying took Montedison L51 or 7.6 per cent ahead to L719 as the committee of leading creditor banks said that their rescue package would be ready by the end of August. VIENNA was unable to sustain an early 3 per cent advance and the ATX index edged back to finish 13.7 or 1.4 per cent ahead at 967.12. ISTANBUL fell sharply for the ninth consecutive day and the composite index lost 298.88 to 9,071.42, its lowest level this month.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 27                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1240.39    1240.87    1241.86    1242.57 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1296.51    1297.45    1297.84    1297.33  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1241.36    1240.62    1238.74    1238.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1297.05    1298.06    1297.47    1297.42  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 26    Jul 23    Jul 22    Jul 21    Jul 20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1240.21   1224.42   1217.14   1212.75   1224.85 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1294.91   1279.96   1275.93   1266.97   1275.46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1243.08; 200 - 1299.78 Low/day: 100 - 1238.01  200 - 1295.81.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

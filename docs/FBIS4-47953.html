			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, May 5 (AFP) -- Talks between Somalia's main  warring factions have been postponed for the third time, and are  now scheduled for the end of this month, a United Nations  spokesman said Thursday [5 May].    "The date that has been proposed by the Somalis themselves  is  May 30," spokesman George Bennett told AFP by telephone from  Mogadishu.    The talks to prepare the ground for a national peace and  reconciliation conference were proposed after Somalia's two  chief warlords, Mohamed Farah Aidid and self-styled interim  president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, signed a UN-brokered national  reconciliation agreement in Nairobi on March 24.    Mohamed Awale, a close aide of General Aidid, expressed  optimism that the meeting would go ahead as planned this time.</p>

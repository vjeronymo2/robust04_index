			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Warning Against U.S., Other Interference in Election--"In  keeping with his self-appointed role as president-in-waiting, Mr  Mandela, during his visit to The Hague last week, put in a  ten-minute call to President Clinton to discuss the steps that  the ANC has taken in recent days to facilitate the participation  of all parties in the April election, to quote White House Press  Secretary Dee-Dee Myers," notes the page-6 editorial in  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 21 February. A point  illustrated by the "Mandela-Clinton chat is that the U.S. is  still interfering in our affairs." The United States, and other  foreign governments, are urged not to show "any partiality" to  any contender in the election. "There cannot be a free and fair  election if foreign governments interfere directly or  indirectly. It is not for the United States to 'push'  dissenting groups to participate in the election."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   PAC Election Participation Welcome -- "Be grateful that the  PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] is participating" in the election,  states a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English  on 22 February. "It is nonparticipation that put the chips on  PAC shoulders in the first place. Let its members now  experience the parliamentary subcommittees and the  practicalities of administration. Let them discover the role of  loyal opposition. Let them take their places among the elected  leaders of a democracy, and we shall see the less defensible  portions of their policies whither away." Democracy has the  effect of "downscaling enemies into rivals, mortal conflicts  into pragmatic agreements."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   No Credible Force To Keep Peace in Natal -- "The continuing  efforts to draw the Freedom Alliance [FA], especially Inkatha,  back into the constitutional process seem to have little effect  on Buthelezi, though Inkatha's four bottom-line conditions can  apparently be met," notes Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English  on 22 February in a page-10 editorial. "He still sees no merit  in returning to round table negotiations, and tells his  supporters to resist any efforts to force them to vote on April  27." In view of this "there must be serious doubts that free  and fair elections will be possible in large areas of Natal."  The problem for the government and the Transitional Executive  Council is that "they do not have a credible force to keep the  peace in Natal." A peacekeeping force without representation  from Inkatha will have "no legitimacy in areas where Inkatha has  a following. Any deployment of this force in Natal will be  portrayed as an invasion by Umkhonto we Sizwe."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Service `Virtually Collapsed' in Venda -- "Bantustans like  Venda are going to pot," warns a page-8 editorial in  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 February. "Reports claim  that services have virtually collapsed in Venda with the capital  city, Thohoyandou, in a mess." SOWETAN believes Venda  illustrates "the failures and evils of the old homeland  policies."  <H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>   ANC's Compromise Proposals Basis for Further Talks --  Referring to the ANC's constitutional "compromise proposals"  made to the Freedom Alliance which were rejected by Inkatha  Chief Buthelezi, Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 20  February says: "This merry-go-round has been going on for a  long time now. Our people are frustrated by this politicking  which does not seem to be getting anywhere." The ANC has  acceded to the two-ballot system, and "as a sop to the white  right who are demanding their own Volkstaat [homeland], the ANC  now accepts the principle of self-determination can be  negotiated. These are important shifts. They may fall short of  Inkatha and the FA's demands, but they should serve as a basis  for further discussion. It is bad faith to reject them without  due consideration."</p>

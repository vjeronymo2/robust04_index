			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: WOODY ALLEN'S BRIGHT, WITTY 'CRIMES,  MISDEMEANORS'  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Could the most intellectually mature and morally challenging film of 1989 also  be one of that year's funniest? Check out Woody Allen's "Crimes and  Misdemeanors" (Orion, $89.98, PG-13) and see.  </P> <P> This brilliant film interweaves two stories -- one about the predicament and  choices of a socially prominent ophthalmologist (Martin Landau), the other  about a documentary film maker (Allen) who struggles with metaphysical  questions and competes with his overbearing brother-in-law (Alan Alda) for the  attention of a sweet but ambitious woman (Mia Farrow). Another incredible  combination of intelligence and humor from writer-director Allen.  </P> <P> If Woody Allen films strain your brain, then you might prefer the time-travel  sequel "Back to the Future Part II" (MCA/Universal, priced for rental, PG),  which takes Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd from 1955 to 1985 to 2015. Its  video release is timed to coincide with the theatrical debut of "Part III."  </P> <P> Several critics thought that the best thing about "The Fabulous Baker Boys"  (IVE, $89.95, R) was its fabulous female lead -- Michelle Pfeiffer, who graced  the top of a piano better than anyone since Helen Morgan. A lot of those  critics liked the rest of the movie, too -- a romantic comedy/drama about an  ex-prostitute's involvement with a small-time lounge-music duo (Jeff and Beau  Bridges).  </P> <P> Another film from last year boasting a strong cast was "Triumph of the Spirit"  (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R), with Willem Dafoe as a Greek prisoner who tries to  stay alive in Auschwitz by boxing. Edward James Olmos and Robert Loggia also  star.  </P> <P> "When the Whales Came" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG) is a British drama examining  mankind's lack of respect for nature, starring Helen Mirren and Paul Scofield.  </P> <P> "Worth Winning" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13) stars Mark Harmon and Madeleine Stowe  in a comedy about a cocky TV weatherman.  </P> <P> OLDIES: One of the most fascinating, metaphysically slanted dramas that  Hollywood (and producer David O. Selznick) ever made, "Portrait of Jennie"  (1948), is available for $39.98 from CBS/Fox. It stars Jennifer Jones and  Joseph Cotten. Also at that price from the same label (and also produced by  Selznick): the lovely World War II tear-jerker "Since You Went Away" (1944),  also with Jones and Cotten, and two of John Barrymore's best performances, in  "A Bill of Divorcement" (1932, also the screen debut of Katharine Hepburn), and  "Topaze" (1933).  </P> <P> COMING ATTRACTIONS: "My Left Foot" (June 13), "Steel Magnolias" (June 20),  "Music Box" "Peter Pan" (the Disney cartoon version, Sept. 21).

Propagandists have sought to portray our  party as intransigent, unreasonable and constantly shifting the  goalposts. Sadly, those making such claims are strangers to the  truth and are gambling with our country's future.  The facts are as follows:    The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] has always negotiated on the  basis of written documentation -- from Codesa [Convention for a  Democratic South Africa] on. Unfortunately, our eminently  reasonable submissions were totally ignored at the Kempton Park  talks. We walked out in protest on 2 July 1993.    We then engaged in bilateral and trilateral negotiations  with  the Government and ANC [African National Congress] and have  continued to do so. Our final proposals were contained in a  document of 19 December 1993, known as the "yellow paper" which  incorporated our proposed constitutional amendments placed on  the Order Paper of Parliament.  Far from shifting the goalposts, we have in fact constantly  reduced our demands.    No proposal over and above those contained in the yellow  paper have been advanced. Our negotiators have shown  flexibility, departing from principles and positions in the  yellow paper. This is particularly the case with regard to the  powers of provinces, their fiscal autonomy, the role of the  Senate, provisions of rationalisation, the deadlock-breaking  mechanisms, matters relating to provincial civil services and  police, the functions of local government and more besides.    The National Party could not sell these reasonable proposals  to its partners in the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party]  alliance, with whom it had struck a deal. Indeed, negotiations  broke down on a clear and cynical ultimatum tabled by SACP  chairman, Mr Joe Slovo. He said the IFP and the Freedom  Alliance had to accept two conditions, or further negotiations  would be futile.    These were:     -  that provinces could have no exclusive powers; and    -  that a Constituent Assembly would have absolute power to  determine the powers, functions and boundaries of provinces.       The latest "offer" by the ANC and NP [National Party]  government changes little, since both organisations again refuse  to deal with the core objections we have to the interim  constitution.    My fellow South Africans, my party cannot, in conscience,  accept this state of affairs.    Constitutions are not drafted to last for a few months or  years. The constitution of the greatest democracy on earth, the  United State of America, has endured for over 200 years.  Constitutions are not there to look to the interests of parties  in power -- they are there to protect individuals and minorities  against the abuse of power.    The National Party government and the SACP/ANC alliance have  placed self-interest above the country's interest in negotiating  deals to suit themselves. That is not the way to secure our  country's constitutional future.    What we want as a precondition to securing the well-being of  all our people is very simple. We want federalism and we will  continue to fight for it. We promise that once this is  achieved, we will work day and night for a free and fair  election to secure true democracy for every individual in this  great country of ours.    That is the task my party and I have set ourselves. We will  not rest until the job is done.  [Signed]Mangosuthu Buthelezi    President    Inkatha Freedom Party       President: The Hon. Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi    National Chairman: Dr. F. T. Mdlalose</p>

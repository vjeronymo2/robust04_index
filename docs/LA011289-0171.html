			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOHL CALLS FOR SOLUTIONS TO BEEF CONFLICT  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday called for a reasonable  solution to a trade dispute between the Economic Community and the United  States over a ban on the imports of American hormone-treated beef.  </P> <P> "Both sides should resolve their problems in a reasonable way in the spirit of  transatlantic partnership and aware of their responsibility for the world  economy," Kohl told reporters at a news conference in Bonn.  </P> <P> The EC ban on U.S. beef produced from cattle that had been fed growth hormones  took effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The United States retaliated with punitive tariffs on several European  products.  </P> <P> "Such trade conflicts can only hurt both sides economically and politically,"  Kohl said.  </P> <P> He said such disputes give a "completely false signal" for a meeting of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that will be held in April and for the  world economic summit scheduled this summer.  </P> <P> Kohl did not suggest any solutions to the beef dispute.  </P> <P> He pledged strong support for the 12 European nations' efforts to forge a  single European market by the end of 1992.  </P> <P> "We've reached the point of no return; the target date will be met," Kohl said,  adding that West Germany will make every effort to assist Spain and France,  which hold the rotating EC presidency this year, in pushing through important  decisions that must be made.  </P></p>

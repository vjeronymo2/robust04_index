			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 25 Apr (NA) -- The Grand Front  (FG)'s Constituent Assembly members confirmed today their  rejection of the Olivos Pact Basic Agreement Nucleus [Nucleo de  Coincidencias Basicas del Pacto de Olivos] and announced their  decision to walk out of the Constituent Assembly at voting time  if the "13-point `package'" agreed upon between the PJ  [Justicialist Party] and the UCR [Radical Civic Union] on the  constitutional reform issue "is not opened."    The proposal was approved today by 29 of the 31 FG  Constituent Assembly members elected on 10 April. This was the  FG's first meeting after the elections. The meeting was held in  the new FG headquarters at the intersection of Rivadavia Avenue  and Ayacucho Street.    The meeting was chaired by Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez,  Deputy Graciela Fernandez Meijide, Deputy Fernando "Pino"  Solanas, and Neuquen Bishop Monsignor Jaime De Nevares.    Among the FG's main leaders also present were former Deputy  Carlos Auyero, teachers union leader Mary Sanchez, Buenos Aires  municipal councilman Anibal Ibarra, metalworkers union leader  Alberto Piccinini, [Communist Party leader] Patricio Etchegaray,  and Eduardo Barcesat.    During the meeting, it was confirmed that Monsignor De  Nevares will be the FG candidate for Constituent Assembly  president. De Nevares' candidacy was raised by Solanas. The  Constituent Assembly is scheduled to reform the Constitution.  [passage omitted]</p>

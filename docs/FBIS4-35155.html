			<p>Plot   <F P=102>   PA2906024594 Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 28 Jun 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> PA2906024594 </F> <F P=104>  Caracas ECONOMIA HOY </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafael Rodriguez Olmos] </F>   [Text] The suspension of constitutional guarantees was last  night's big surprise, because it had been rumored all day that  measures to control foreign exchange and prices would be  announced. Following President Caldera's announcement, the  reporters asked if this resolution would negatively affect  individual and economic rights. In the end, they were clearly  informed that the following articles of the Constitution had  been suspended:    -- Paragraph 1 of Article 60 on individual freedom of  prisoners and people who have been arrested.    -- Article 62 on the inviolability of residences.    -- Article 96 regarding economic rights.    -- Article 99 that guarantees the right to own property.    -- Article 101 that controls how assets are confiscated.    The government spokesmen clarified: "The economic and  financial crisis has compelled us to make this decision, because  it could trigger chaos or social violence. [no closing quotation  marks as published] According to sources at the Presidential  Palace, the government learned that a coup d'etat was being  planned and managed to contain the plot through its intelligence  services. It is also rumored that several generals are now under  surveillance. Perhaps this is why we noticed that during his  television announcement yesterday, the president was accompanied  by military officers representing the four branches of the  military instead of members of his cabinet.    As far as can be ascertained, the measures that went into  effect last night will last as long as the government considers  them necessary.    Hours before the Executive Cabinet met to give final  approval  to the measures, the president summoned the leaders of the  various political parties to inform them of the strong measures  the government would take. Although initially all parties  agreed, some political leaders criticized the measures and  announced they would define their positions at a later date.    For Radical Cause leaders, the problem lies in the fact that  even though the emergency measures were announced to them, they  were not told how these measures would be implemented. The  president spoke to them in "very general terms" about a  compensation bonus that would be based on a wage scale, and he  also "hinted" that social programs, such as the Pami [box of  food given to school children] and school milk programs, would  be bolstered. The problem is that he did not say where the funds  would come from.    The measures adopted yesterday certainly clarify some  things,  but not others. According to Deputy Melo, it is necessary to  modify the banking system through intervention. He said that  until the financial sector complies with its intermediary role,  high interest rates and inflation will not be controlled. He  said: "Structural measures need to be taken in this area." In  fact, National Convergence party leader Jose Miguel Uzcategui  proposed to the president that the banking system should be  nationalized.    AD [Democratic Action] party leader Lewis Perez listened to  the proposals, after which his only comment was that the CEN  [National Executive Committee] will meet to draw up a policy.  "My initial impression is that these are momentous measures that  need to be analyzed together in order to see what they mean to  the country and to the stability of Venezuela's monetary  system." The AD Directorate is expected to issue a communique.    According to Freddy Munoz [senator and secretary general of  the Movement Toward Socialism--MAS], these measures should have  been implemented a week ago, because they are intended to stem  the dollar outflow: "This is the only way to stop the  skyrocketing price of the dollar and rising inflation, not to  mention the contemptuous speculation. MAS will meet to discuss  exchange, financial, and pricing policies."</p>

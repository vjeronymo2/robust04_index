			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Leading Article: University challenge AMID THE furore over school league tables and opting out, the biggest change in UK education policy since the 1988 Education Reform Act has gone almost unremarked. It is the decision, buried in last November's Autumn Statement, to limit the growth in university student numbers to 13 per cent over the next three years. Though sudden, the move is far from arbitrary. In the 'new' universities (former polytechnics), enrolments for full-time courses have been rising at an annual rate of around 20 per cent for the past four years. Across the sector, student numbers are already significantly above those projected in last year's higher education white paper. Changes in funding methodologies will cause anguish, but vice-chancellors should welcome the respite to consolidate. However, capping student numbers can only be a short-term policy. Before long, pressure to expand further will be intense. Indeed, the decision to concentrate extra state funding for the next few years on further education for 16-19-year-olds will only increase the crush at the university gate. By the end of the decade, as many as one in two school leavers may be qualified to go on to university. The question is not whether, but how, the next wave of growth is to be accommodated. The answer will determine the shape of Britain's university system into the next century. It is essential, therefore, that the government use the current respite to launch a public debate on the options in terms of funding, quality and structure. Social equity If supply is to keep pace with demand, and quality maintained, the higher education bill could easily double in the next decade. With competing demands for resources, not least from schools, it would be unwise to assume that the taxpayer will meet the bill unaided. But the only other plausible source of funds for tuition is students and parents themselves. As a simple matter of social equity, there is a strong case for a means-tested student contribution to fees, either in the form of loans or a graduate tax; it could prove irresistible when expansion resumes. Much depends upon the answer to two subsidiary questions. What quality should students have a right to expect? And what aspects of higher education should the state have an interest in funding? At present, most students take for granted the right to study away from home, adding greatly to the cost of their education. They also expect small classes - but get anything from one-to-one tutorials at Oxbridge to jammed lecture theatres at some former polytechnics. A national assessment of teaching quality ought to be the first task of the new Higher Education Funding Council. At the very least, state fees to institutions should be geared to quality. Priority subjects The state has a strong interest in promoting the study of subjects, notably science and engineering, likely to be of direct benefit to the economy. It has almost none in giving teenagers a first chance to live away from home. State funding should be directed accordingly. The process has already started with differential fees for different subjects. The differential needs to be increased, and combined with substantial bursaries for students in national priority subjects. Financial support for students to study away from home ought perhaps to be regulated on the same basis. The relationship between research and teaching needs to feature prominently in the debate. The platitude that 'good teaching and research go hand-in-hand' is true enough. But with the expansion in postgraduate studies, it is important that researchers concentrate their teaching efforts on graduate students. Alas, Britain's ancient universities, which have many of the best researchers, still give pride of place to undergraduates and often treat graduate students as second-class citizens. In a national context, that attitude makes no sense. There is a case for elite colleges for the brightest undergraduates, but none for the country's leading universities making the provision of them their main activity. The government should say so, and prepare to adjust funding incentives accordingly.</p>

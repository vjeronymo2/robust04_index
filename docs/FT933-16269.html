			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Companies braced for missile cuts BRITISH DEFENCE companies are awaiting announcements on a series of cuts in equipment plans when the government's annual defence white paper is published today. Mr Brian Lowe, director-general of the Defence Manufacturers'Association, said: 'I don't think industry is expecting any good news. It's a question of how bad the bad news is.' The government is widely expected to abandon the idea of a new air-launched nuclear missile, which would have relied on either French or US technology. Also precarious are plans for air defence missiles, which are the subject of an international contest, and UK participation in a cluster weapon for multiple rocket launchers. The ministry has also been reviewing plans for upgrading the RAF's Tornado bombers and for either modernising or replacing current-generation tanks. A decision on the tanks may not emerge until later, however. In exchange for being allowed to go ahead with a helicopter carrier, ordered in May, the Navy is expected to have to dispose of its four brand-new Upholder class diesel-electric submarines. In a departure from the normal practice for the annual white paper, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is due to make a statement to the Commons this afternoon. The Ministry of Defence has to find more than Pounds 1bn of savings in this financial year and the next to match budget cuts imposed in last November's public expenditure round. The impatience of military contractors has been growing as the ministry has held back announcements on new guided weapons projects and other large programmes. Mr Lowe said: 'Any definitive plan would be helpful. What we want are decisions, whether they are good or bad.' The white paper will mark a significant further step in defence changes following the government's Options for Change exercise, which was outlined in 1990 and fleshed out the following year. Ministers have promised that the document will be 'an eye-opener', breaking new ground in releasing detailed information about the UK's military commitments and what they cost. Mr Archie Hamilton, the former armed forces minister, yesterday called for military cuts in Northern Ireland to help reduce the defence budget. Mr Hamilton, who left the government in the last reshuffle, said more troops did not necessarily mean less terrorism.</p>

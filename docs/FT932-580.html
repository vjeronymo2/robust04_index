			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: European chemicals The restructuring of European petrochemicals has yet to address the problem of overcapacity. Last week's joint venture between Statoil of Norway and Finland's Neste is a case in point. The duo are doubtless hoping for cost savings, and access to Statoil's feedstocks will give the alliance a competitive advantage. But plant closures are not part of the strategy. That is equally the case with BASF's acquisition of ICI's polypropylene interests, and Shell's proposed joint venture in plastics with Himont. Without more drastic action, the current trough will be long and painful. With European economies still deteriorating, demand is unlikely to pick up until well into next year. Neste's view that the polypropylene market will return to balance in 1996 - with polyethylene some way behind - is not unusually pessimistic. But it is hard to see which of the European producers will be first to swing the axe. ICI did most of the necessary pruning before BASF stepped in. Both Neste and Himont run efficient plant. The presence of state-owned companies such as Enichem may be a fundamental block to restructuring. On that basis, ICI's decision to negotiate its way out of polypropylene looks wise. But with others seemingly braced for a long haul, it will be hard pressed to find a buyer for the remaining petrochemicals business. Free of debt following the demerger of Zeneca, ICI can afford to wait. Deprived of cash flow from pharmaceuticals, though, it can hardly carry the business through the next downturn.</p>

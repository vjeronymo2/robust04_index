			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: A year in which the tail wagged the dog When stock market historians pick their way through the archives, 1993 could be seen as the year when the tail wagged the stock market dog. While many analysts are asking themselves if the stock market is seriously overbought, the Footsie futures have continued to drive it higher. Next Wednesday, the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) will publish volume figures for the year end. The data is likely to disclose a new record. Recent figures for open interest in Footsie futures - the number of short and long positions in the market  - show that activity has risen by around 50 per cent this year. The last contract for 1993, which expired on December 17, continually traded at a hefty premium to the cash market and its successor, which expires in March, has seen similar pressure. March began its life some 30 points higher than a stock market already at record highs and in the first four trading days of being the leading derivatives contract on the Footsie, it leapt 120 points. The questions begged by this frenetic activity are who is behind it and why? Derivative flows are hard to track but it does seem clear that the pressure is far less home driven than one might expect. Leading institutions such as the Prudential and Mercury Asset Management might use futures as a quick way into the market or a hedge against sharp falls. But many small institutions are like Scottish crofters still tuning into the weather report on steam radio while the average ten-year-old is quoting Michael Fish soundbites. There is a consensus that about 50 per cent of activity in futures comes from US investors. This is partly because they are far more comfortable with the technicalities of derivatives instruments than their UK counterparts. Also, large US funds need to move cash quickly and futures can provide a far more efficient way of doing this. This has caused an undercurrent of concern that when the US Federal Reserve begins to lift rates again the improved returns will quickly lead to suck-back of dollars that will drain many European markets. However, there is a competing argument that improved liquidity has fundamentally increased the level of global investment and that, as disposable incomes rise, there will be more money rather than less invested in the mature economies.</p>

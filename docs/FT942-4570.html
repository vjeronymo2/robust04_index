			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / TUC welcomes 'devastating blow' British unions were delighted at yesterday's ruling by the European Court of Justice. 'This is a devastating blow for the British government,' said Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. 'The right of workers to be consulted over redundancies and transfer of undertakings is a key element of European social policy - one on which the government are now obliged to legislate.' Mr Jack Dromey, national officer for the TGWU general union, described the verdict as 'a landmark decision'. He added: 'The days of buying and selling workers without their voice being heard are over. British workers will now enjoy the same protection as workers in the rest of Europe. The government will have to pay out millions to tens of thousands of workers.' But Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said last night no new employment compensation cases would arise from the ruling and said that claims from Opposition spokesmen and union leaders that many 'so-called illegally sacked' workers would have be eligible were 'outrageous'. He said the only new element that arose was over consultation - that in future cases of privatisation employers would be compelled to consult all their employees, not only recognised unions. Mr Dromey claimed that the British government would now 'have to legislate to enshrine for the first time in British law the human rights to consultation and trade union recognition'. He claimed that 'any attempt by an employer to derecognise a union will be challenged by our union.' Lawyers said yesterday that thousands of public-sector workers who lost their jobs or faced worse employment conditions following privatisation or the contracting-out of public services could now sue the government for compensation. They said workers who could show they suffered loss from the government's failure to implement important areas of the European acquired rights directive would be entitled to sue for compensation on the basis of a European Court decision in 1991 involving Italian workers. In this instance, called the Francovich case, the court ruled that individuals had a right to damages where they suffered loss through a state's failure to implement European Union law. The TUC has asked the labour academic Lord Wedderburn to present a considered legal judgment, which will be published shortly. Five unions - the TGWU, the Unison public service union, the GMB general union, NUCPS civil service union and the NIPSA Northern Ireland civil service union - have issued 128 writs against the government covering more than a thousand public-sector workers in local government, the National Health Service and government employment, claiming retrospective compensation for loss of earnings when their jobs were moved into the private sector. The TUC hopes to negotiate a settlement with the government over compensation for as many as 60,000 workers affected rather than pursue individual cases through the courts, which would be expensive and time-consuming. Mr Dromey said the unions had no dispute with contractors and other employers involved in transfers of employment to the private sector.</p>

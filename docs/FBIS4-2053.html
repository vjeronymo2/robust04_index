			<p>BFN     [Text] The municipal party committee and government held a  meeting of district, county, and bureau leading cadres on 15  March to relay the guidelines of the third plenary session of  the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, State Council's  work conference on opposing corruption, and the important  speeches of Comrades Jiang Z emin and Li Peng and to arrange  Tianjin's 1994 anticorruption struggle.    Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, and  Li Shenglin, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee  and executive vice mayor of Tianjin, gave speeches.    Attending were municipal leading comrades Li Jianguo, Liu  Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Li Huifen, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng,  Zheng Zhiying, Lu Xuezheng, Zhang Haosheng, Wang Dehui, Li  Changxing, Huang Yanzhi, and Zhang Guanwen.    In his speech, Gao Dezhan reviewed and appraised Tianjin's  anticorruption work carried out in the previous period. He  said: Party committees and governments at all levels in the  municipality have conscientiously implemented the central  guidelines and the arrangements of the municipal party committee  and government, remained firm in attitude and quick in action,  adopted realistic measures, and carried out plenty of work. The  vast number of party members, cadres, and the masses have shown  wholehearted support and actively participated in the  anticorruption struggle. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all  fields, Tianjin has created a good trend in the anticorruption  struggle, developed it in a healthy manner, and by and large met  the central requirements, thus achieving good results for that  period. 1) Good results have been achieved in waging special  campaigns to tackle specific problems and in correcting  unhealthy trends. Tianjin has started early and exerted earnest  efforts in the work to check collection of unwarranted fees,  fines, and donations and thus has achieved notable results. It  has conducted thorough investigations on the problem of  travelling abroad and beyond the border with public funds.  Meanwhile, it has drawn up clear stipulations to ensure strict  examination and approval, thus preventing some groups from  visiting abroad in violation of the stipulations. The work to  examine the businesses developed by party and government organs  is being carried out in an active and prudent manner, and about  a half of the business entities have severed their ties with  these organs or have been closed down. Other unhealthy trends  have also been effectively checked. 2) Leading cadres have  gained more initiative in remaining honest and self-disciplined.  Leading bodies at and above the county or section level in the  municipality have extensively held inner-party democratic  meetings to examine and correct themselves in line with the five  regulations on honesty and self-discipline. Problems, such as  holding concurrent jobs in economic entities of various types,  accepting money and marketable securities as gifts, applying for  membership cards and credit cards with public funds, and buying  enterprise shares to be sold within the enterprises only, have  been solved. 3) Substantial progress has been made in  investigating and handling major and serious cases. Discipline  inspection commissions at all levels investigated 852 discipline  breaches committed by party members in the whole year, and  concluded 680 of them. Procuratorial organs investigated and  handled 330 major and serious cases on embezzlement and  bribe-taking and publicly pronounced judgments on nine major  economic criminals. The initial success in Tianjin's  anticorruption struggle has enhanced people's confidence in  opposing corruption and their trust in the party and government,  thus playing a positive role in safeguarding social stability,  promoting reform and opening up, and facilitating economic  development. Although fairly good results have been achieved in  the anticorruption struggle for the previous period, leaders at  all levels should remain clearheaded and never overestimate the  results. Our work is still falling rather far behind when  considering the existing problems and the demands of the masses.  Development of work has been uneven in different departments  and different units. Some good results have yet to be  consolidated, and any slack efforts might lead to a setback. We  should not only realistically affirm the achievements in the  previous anticorruption struggle, but also we should note that  corrupt phenomena are still serious, and we should continue our  painstaking work and never take them lightly or slacken our  efforts, even in the slightest degree.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: The general demand on Tianjin's  1994 anticorruption work is that we should persistently take  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide,  take the initiative in subjecting ourselves to and serving the  overall interest of the work of the entire party, continue to  implement the central decision on the anticorruption struggle,  carry out the new content of the struggle put forward by the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission while consolidating the  achievements already won, and continue the anticorruption  struggle in an in-depth, sustained, and more effective manner.  Regarding its anticorruption struggle for this year, Tianjin  should continue to do a good job in cadres' honesty and  self-discipline, in investigating and handling major and serious  cases, and in correcting the unhealthy trends in various trades  and, based on the characteristics of the situation, add new  content to these three aspects of work and conscientiously carry  them out.    First, regarding leading cadres' honesty and  self-discipline,  leading cadres at and above the county (section) level of party  and government organs in the municipality should strictly  enforce the various regulations of the party Central Committee  and the State Council on improving party style and honesty in  performance of official duties. The five regulations on honesty  and self- discipline put forward by the party Central Committee  last year should be further implemented. Comrades who did not  conduct self-examination and self-correction based on the  regulations and those who had problems but did not report or  correct them should take remedial measures. Regarding the  problems exposed after the self-examination which have not been  addressed, we should step up efforts to properly deal with them  in line with the relevant documents of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission. The above-mentioned work should be  conscientiously carried out by the end of April. After this, all  violations of the "five regulations" which are not reported by  the persons concerned after the self-examination and  self-correction, but are exposed by the masses and those  committed again after the issuance of the "decision of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council on the several tasks of  the anticorruption struggle to be successfully carried out in  the near future" should be strictly dealt with. While  continuing to enforce the "five regulations," we should  conscientiously enforce another five regulations put forward by  the central authorities this year.    1. It is prohibited to purchase cars in violation of  regulations or replace them with imported luxury ones; it is  prohibited to abuse power to exchange cars with and borrow cars  from enterprises or subordinating units or collect money from  them to buy cars; it is prohibited to use loans, the money  collected from people, and funds for special projects to buy  cars for leading cadres; and district and county party and  government leading organs and units which owe wages to their  staff members and workers are prohibited from buying cars.    2. It is not permitted to buy houses at reduced prices in  violation of the State Council regulations on housing reform; it  is not permitted to abuse power to provide preferential terms  for oneself or one's children, relatives, and friends to buy  houses; and it is not permitted to decorate one's house in  excess of the established standards with public funds.    3. Leading cadres should use simple cars and take few people  with them during domestic official activities, and their  accommodations should not exceed the local standards for  reception; and no special dance parties should be held for them.    4. It is not allowed to take the opportunity of the  marriage,  funeral, job transfer, birthday, and house moving of oneself and  one's family members to give lavish parties and spend without  restraint, still less to use public funds and materials for such  activities or to earn money from them.    5. It is not permitted to abuse power to refuse to return  public funds; and it is not permitted to use public funds to buy  or build houses for oneself and one's relatives and friends and  to engage in profit making.    Leading cadres at and above the county (section) level  should  earnestly conduct self-examination and self-correction based on  the above-mentioned five regulations. We should hold the  democratic meetings at high standard, refrain from vague,  general discussions, and conscientiously address problems. We  should immediately conduct examination of our own accord and  rapidly correct mistakes if any. Leading cadres of enterprises  and institutions should also remain honest and self-disciplined,  abide by laws and discipline, and oppose abuse of power for  selfish gains, embezzlement, bribe-taking, spending without  restraint, and numerous negative and corrupt phenomena. Leaders  of loss-making enterprises, in particular, must share weal and  woe with their staff members and workers and receive the same  treatment with workers concerning wage decreases and basic  living expenses. Loss-making enterprises unable to pay wages to  their workers are strictly prohibited from buying high-class  cars, and their leaders are prohibited from going abroad for  inspection or giving parties in excess of the established  standards.    Second, regarding investigations and handling of cases, we  should concentrate efforts on major and serious cases,  particularly the cases on embezzlement, bribe-taking, and abuse  of power for selfish gains committed by leading cadres, the  malpractice, bribe-taking, and other law and discipline breaches  committed by law- and discipline-enforcing personnel, and the  law and discipline breaches committed by legal persons. We  should step up efforts in handling cases and speed up the  progress. We should, in particular, step up efforts to  investigate and handle the major and serious cases involving  leading cadres and never procrastinate.    Third, in correcting the unhealthy trends in some trades,  the  general demand is that we should consolidate and develop the  achievements won last year in correcting the unhealthy trends  and, on this basis, correct three unhealthy trends thoroughly  and effectively in line with the new arrangements of the central  authorities. 1) We should conscientiously correct the practice  of the personnel of party and government organs who abuse power  to use, without compensation, the money and property of  enterprises to suit the purposes of their organs or of their  own. 2) We should investigate the allocation of enterprise  funds in various excuses to serve as the private coffers of  units and the indiscriminate issuance of bonuses. 3) We should  resolutely check the unhealthy trend of asking for donations  from enterprises in various excuses. All departments should  adopt effective measures to solve their problems well. We  should also make great efforts to check the lavish wining and  dining and vulgar gift-giving that the masses bitterly hate and  achieve good results in this.    Gao Dezhan urged: Leading comrades at all levels must study  and master the guidelines of the important speeches of Comrades  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, deepen their understanding of the  importance of the anticorruption struggle, and have more  initiative in this work. They should deepen their understanding  of the importance of opposing corruption from the perspective of  upholding the party's nature and its basic purpose of serving  the people wholeheartedly, the perspective of consolidating the  party's position as a ruling party, and the perspective of  ensuring the overall interests of the work of the entire party  and entire work.    Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should conscientiously strengthen  leadership over the anticorruption struggle and study documents  well. Leading bodies of departments, committees, offices,  districts, counties, bureaus, enterprises, and institutions  should devote enough time to the study of the speeches of  central leading comrades, the requirements of the party Central  Committee and the State Council, and the arrangements of the  municipal party committee and government. Meanwhile, we should  organize well the study of the cadres at and above the county  level. Through the study, we should enhance understanding,  master the guidelines, and have a good command of the overall  situation and policies. Party and government leaders should  make concerted efforts. Party committees and governments at all  levels should continue to list the anticorruption work high in  their agenda, and their principal leaders should attend to it  personally. Every level should be responsible for the work of  the next lower level to ensure implementation of work at every  level. We should stress realistic results, check vague  generalization, and oppose perfunctory work. We should  conscientiously extend the system of responsibility for the  anticorruption work targets. We should exert earnest efforts to  tackle knotty problems and put forward specific time limits,  progress, and work quality requirements. We should have a  strict command of policies and conscientiously implement the  guiding thoughts and the series of principles and policies  defined by the central authorities. The anticorruption struggle  should be geared to the overall interests of the work of the  entire party and serve the promotion of reform, construction,  and development and the safeguarding of social and political  stability. We should intensify investigation and study, have a  strict command of policies, and correctly distinguish and handle  the two different types of contradictions. We should firmly  rely on the masses in waging the anticorruption struggle, but we  should not launch mass movements or have everybody make  self-criticisms. We should encourage the people to report  crimes. We should give full play to the role of democratic  parties and the personages without party affiliation, organize  them to participate in the implementation of the tasks related  to the anticorruption struggle, and give more attention to their  opinions and suggestions. The anticorruption struggle should be  coordinated with the work to develop healthy trends. We should  keep education in view and aim at improvement. Opposing  corruption and advocating honesty is a strategic measure for the  enduring order and stability of the country, not a stopgap  measure. We should intensively and persistently educate party  members and cadres on the basic purpose of serving the people  wholeheartedly and the traditional work style of plain living  and arduous struggle, maintain and develop the fine tradition of  honesty in performing official duties and diligence in serving  the people, and develop honesty and diligence simultaneously.  This is the necessary demand on the purpose of serving the  people wholeheartedly. Only with honesty can we have stability,  and only with diligence can we have hope. We should combine  self-examination and self-correction with supervision. We  should first strengthen the inner supervisory mechanism for  opposing corruption and advocating honesty and, in the meantime,  strengthen the supervision and restriction by the masses and  various circles of society. We should persist in both stopgap  and radical measures. Regarding the problems exposed, we should  stem loopholes in a timely manner, improve systems, strengthen  management, and establish and improve various policies and  rules. We should fully develop the functional role of  discipline inspection and supervision departments. As  discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels  shoulder heavy responsibility for the anticorruption struggle,  they should step up efforts to improve themselves and  continuously raise their ideological and work levels. Party  committees and governments at all levels should show concern for  and support the work of discipline inspection, supervision, and  judicial departments, coordinate the relationship between  various sectors, check buck-passing, and rally their forces.    In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: The situation we are faced  with is very good, and our tasks are very arduous. We should  firmly implement the basic principles for and the overall  interests of the work of the entire party, unite more closely  round the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as  the core, conscientiously carry out the various arrangements of  the party Central Committee and State Council, and continue to  work hard and in a down-to-earth manner. In this way, we will  continue to score new and greater achievements in Tianjin's  reform, opening up, development, stability, anticorruption work,  and the work to build a clean government.    Li Shenglin gave specific opinions on the work to correct  unhealthy trends in some trades. He said: We should further  consolidate and develop the achievements in this work. First,  we should continue the great efforts in checking collection of  unwarranted fees. All departments in the municipality should  include this in their targets for management and have those in  charge hold the responsibility for it. If problems arise, those  in charge of the pertinent departments should be held  accountable. Second, we should do a better job in severing the  ties between party and government organs and the economic  entities they run and make sure that this work is by and large  completed by the end of June this year. Third, we should  continue efforts to check the unhealthy trend of travelling to  outside the country (the border) with public funds. Fourth, we  should do a better job in reducing the burdens on peasants and  never restore the unreasonable burdens that have been canceled  as stipulated in explicit orders.    Li Shenglin pointed out: We should thoroughly and  effectively correct these three unhealthy trends in line with  the new requirements of the central authorities. All  departments and units should make specific arrangements based on  their reality. We should coordinate this work with leading  cadres' endeavor to remain honesty and self-disciplined, with  the endeavor to do practical work for enterprises and their  workers, and with the endeavor to educate cadres on professional  ethics and the awareness in the legal system. We must never  allow continuous emergence of the unhealthy trends or refusal to  correct them, still less must we allow retaliation against the  enterprises and individuals who have reported problems.</p>

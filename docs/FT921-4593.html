			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Letter: A welcome fillip to improve the status of engineers Sir, It is disturbing that Britain is alone among 67 nations in the low respect and status that it accords to engineers. That is a principal reason why the number of first degree graduates going into engineering and allied industries has dropped 20 per cent in the last five years. 'Engineers and a welding job' (February 25) was welcome publicity for the efforts of the steering group which, with the approval of the 46 institutions representing engineers, is moving towards a new federal body as the focal point for the profession. In his Hugh Ford Management Lecture to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, our chairman, Mr Lewinton, recalled how, in the 1970s, the big accountancy firms pooled their efforts in a marketing campaign that transformed the social standing and image of their profession. He called on engineers to adopt a similarly positive approach. We in TI Group wish the steering group success. Anthony J Sumner, director, TI Group plc, 50 Curzon Street, London W1Y 7PN</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares give ground as base rate hopes cool - Market Report A postponement of hopes for the next long predicted reduction in domestic interest rates cut into stock market confidence in London yesterday. Although selling was modest, the FT-SE 100 Index fell by nearly 27 points, wiping out much of the gain achieved on Friday afternoon and brushing aside the record close on Wall Street overnight. A firm opening, on the back of Wall Street's 44-point advance, was soon unpicked by a dull futures market. Share prices slid away, with the less confident tone on interest rate prospects reflected in a firm undertone in sterling. Although the stock market had largely resigned itself to waiting until spring for a base rate cut, the latest data on UK housing starts, consumer credit and overseas trade have suggested that stronger economic growth will set the background to this morning's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England. Also suggesting increasing confidence, and therefore reduced pressures for a base rate cut, were several surveys of business opinion, including a view from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US based business information group, that UK businesses are seeking higher prices. At least one equity strategist raised the market's fears that domestic interest rates could be under upward pressures soon. There was little relief for the market as New York opened the new session with a fall of 10 Dow points and London's stock index futures remained discouraging. Traders commented that the institutions were no longer switching into second line stocks, but merely trimming holdings in Footsie shares. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,413.8, with a net fall of 26.8. The second line sector shared in the malaise of the blue chips, leaving the FT-SE Mid 250 Index down 12.2 at 3,889.2. Non-Footsie business remained high, making up around 65 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total of 882.8m shares traded. In the previous session, 849.1m shares through the Seaq electronic network returned a retail business worth of Pounds 1.75bn. Equity strategists were inclined to underplay the implications of the latest economic statistics and commentaries. At Panmure Gordon, the UK brokerage house, Mr Robin Aspinall commented that 'businesses always want to put up prices', and denied that the rise in consumer credit indicated rapidly rising borrowing. There were also signs that the big securities houses were beginning to hold back equity investment as they positioned themselves ahead of the auction of government bonds expected at the end of the week. Retail issues, still awaiting convincing news on the Christmas sales period, lacked support and some high street banks were also easier ahead of the sector reporting season, which is about to open. With base rate hopes now taking back seat, the market's second hope for a further advance rests on the prospects for the annual reporting season from British companies. The best share performances over 1993 came from the financial sector, with merchant banks, lending banks and properties showing the strongest gains. Strong valuations of shares in these sectors have left them highly dependent upon good profits news. But merchant banks, which have benefited from the strength of securities markets, came in for renewed buying yesterday.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / US group to open car parts factory TRW, the US motor, space and defence multinational, is to set up its fourth motor components plant near Nissan's Sunderland car factory, creating 160 jobs. TRW is investing Pounds 8m in the plant at Houghton-le-Spring, Wearside. It will produce electronic trigger mechanisms for safety air bags, one of the fastest-growing sectors of the motor components industry. TRW's three existing plants in the area make switches, engine valves and seat-belt systems - not exclusively for Nissan. The air-bag mechanism will be exported throughout Europe. Recruitment is to start early in the summer, with the plant expected on stream by the end of the year. The new facility is the latest in a series of motor component manufacturing investments in the north, and lifts to about 30 the number of such companies located close to the Nissan plant. When Nissan started production in 1986 only three suppliers were located in the north-east. Nissan, which employs about 5,000 people at the Sunderland site, says it has generated about 3,000 jobs at component suppliers based either on its car factory site or in the north-east.</p>

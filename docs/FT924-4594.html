			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UN chief urges force in Somalia THE UN Security Council has 'no alternative' but to authorise the use of force to secure international relief operations in famine-stricken Somalia, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, told members last night. Among five options he proposed was a Gulf war 'Desert Storm'-style operation not under UN command and control but 'undertaken by member states acting with the authorisation of the Security Council.' The US last week offered to send up to 30,000 troops to Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people have died from starvation as civil war continues - but only if US commanders were in control of the force. As the country now has no government that can request and allow the use of outside force, the Council would have to determine a threat justifying forceful measures to maintain international peace and security, Mr Boutros Ghali said. He was responding to a Council request last week for his views, even before the US offer was disclosed. The Security Council is expected to decide within a week whether to accept US proposals and, if so, how to employ the troops alongside a small UN operation that has proved woefully inadequate.

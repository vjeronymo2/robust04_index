			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Former partner offers KIO Dollars 2.5bn for Spanish holdings MR Javier de la Rosa, the Catalan financier who was an investment partner with the Kuwait Investment Office in Spain for six years until last month, has offered to create a consortium to buy Grupo Torras, the holding company for the KIO's vast property and industrial empire in Spain, for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.3bn). A provisional offer was made to the Kuwaiti finance minister, Mr Nasser al-Rawdan, nearly two weeks ago, bypassing the KIO in London, whose relations with Mr De la Rosa have become strained in the last six weeks. Mr De la Rosa could not be reached yesterday. The offer requires an informal response this week. Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader, president of the KIO, declined to say whether he was considering accepting it. The bid is a challenge to the new management of the KIO, which, since taking office in May, has indirectly accused Mr De la Rosa and former KIO leaders of mismanaging Kuwait's assets in Spain. It also coincides with evidence that the KIO wants to sell its Spanish portfolio. The offer creates a dilemma for the KIO. If it does not accept, it may have tacitly conceded that Torras is worth more than Dollars 2.5bn and thus risk supporting the view of former KIO managers that the Spanish assets are fundamentally sound. Since the mid-1980s, the KIO has spent Dollars 3.7bn buying Spanish companies and creating its biggest chemicals, foods and paper groups, and one of its most dynamic property developers. But the KIO assets have been shaken by the collapse of the chemicals division, Ercros. It filed for protection from its creditors earlier this month owing more than Dollars 2bn after the KIO refused to inject fresh capital into its fertiliser operations. Stock in two other Torras quoted companies has fallen sharply. The offer involves a Dollars 400m payment followed by two further payments of Dollars 1bn each over the next two years. If the Kuwaitis signal interest by the end of this week, a formal offer, to expire on October 25, would be made. Mr De la Rosa's role in a consortium would be limited because of the large amounts involved. He promised to supply guarantees from reputable banks.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Babcock warns of loss after Drax problems SHARES in Babcock Inter-national fell more than 20 per cent to 31 1/2 p last night after the big UK engineering contractor said it would be unable to pay an interim dividend and would report a loss for the six months ending September 30. Babcock blamed a Pounds 20m pre-tax provision to cover higher than expected costs on its Pounds 400m-plus flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) contract at National Power's Drax power station in North Yorkshire, and closure costs for Babcock Africa's non-core mining activities. The expected first-half loss contrasts with pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.6m a year ago, and underlines the risks involved in large project contracting. The announcement was the first indication of problems on the Drax contract, the world's largest FGD project for cleaning up the emissions from coal-fired power stations, and producing commercial gypsum as a by-product. Mr Jonathan Getz, analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, said the news was 'a really major disappointment'. Mr Jeff Whalley, Babcock's acting chief executive, said the problems at Drax stemmed from the costs involved in completing tests on the FGD units so far installed. 'We brought more people in and took our eye off the cost line.' In July a team from head office had found a Pounds 15m gap between expected future income on the contract - due to be completed in 1996 - and costs, he said. Mr Whalley said the first two FGD units at Drax were due to go into commercial operation in December, but Babcock would be able to build the final four more efficiently. He said he had 'turned over every stone' at Babcock in the past six months and was confident there would be no further cost overruns at Drax or elsewhere. Last year's interim dividend was 1p. Babcock said the amount of the dividend for the current year ending next March would depend on trading results for the year as a whole. Babcock also confirmed it was appointing Mr John Parker as joint deputy chairman and chief executive, filling the gap created in April when Mr Oliver Whitehead left after disagreeing with the board over strategy. Mr Parker resigned last week as chairman and chief executive of Harland &amp; Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder. Babcock has also appointed Mr Nick Salmon, an executive at the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom engineering group, as managing director.</p>

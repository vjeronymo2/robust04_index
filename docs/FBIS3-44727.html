According to Chi Fulin with the Provincial Office for  Economic Restructuring, since 1988 when Hainan was designated a  special economic zone, a market economy has taken shape in line  with a new social security system.    However, the official said, the reform of property rights  has  become a pressing need nowadays, and a lot of state enterprises  are far from efficient. By the end of last year, 30 percent of  the province's state-run industrial enterprises were operating  at a loss, while 70 percent of its commercial and trading firms  did not make profits.    The province will place more emphasis on transforming its  state enterprises into share-holding companies. So far Hainan  has approved the setting up of 126 share-holding companies with  total assets of more than 20 billion yuan.    The province will also foster the transaction of various  property rights concerning stocks, patents and fixed assets, the  officials said.</p>

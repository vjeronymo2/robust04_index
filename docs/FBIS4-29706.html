			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Expanding Military Pressure"] </F>   [Text] Dangerous military moves aggravating the situation  on the Korean peninsula are being witnessed continually.  According to a report, a strike group of the United States,  Japan, and South Korea has been organized in the process of the  Rimpac-94 joint military exercise conducted off Hawaii. The  report says that the strike group is composed of the combat  ships and planes of the United States, Japan, and South Korea,  with the aircraft carriers Independence and Constellation  forming the basis of it, its mission being the battle against a  hypothetical enemy.    As has been reported, they raved, even before the Rimpac-94  joint military exercise began, that the exercise would serve as  a message to North Korea. Moreover, it is a public fact that  the United States, Japan, and South Korea became even stronger  allies during the exercise. In view of this, the hypothetical  enemy they designated is undoubtedly our Republic. This shows  that the strike group has been organized for the purpose of a  preemptive attack on our country, thus clearly showing how  frenziedly the U.S. imperialists, the Japanese reactionaries,  and the South Korean puppets are maneuvering to crush [apsal]  our Republic.    The world publicly admits that we are not developing nuclear  weapons. It was the United States that gave birth to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is also the United  States that is increasing the danger of nuclear war. The U.S.  imperialists are threatening us with the 1,000-odd nuclear  weapons deployed in South Korea, and the Japanese reactionaries  and the South Korean puppets are growing their own nuclear  mushroom under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.    Nevertheless, like a thief turning on the owner, they who  are  posing a nuclear threat, went so far as to form a strike group  aimed at attacking us militarily, going further in harassing  us--who do not have nuclear weapons and who are under the  nuclear threat--with a nuclear issue. Furthermore, not to be  overlooked is the fact that the strike group was formed when the  situation on the Korean peninsula was extremely aggravated and  entered a dangerous phase of war.    Now the United States has massively assembled its aggressive  forces, including aircraft carriers, in South Korea and its  surrounding areas to crush our Republic under the pretext of the  so-called nuclear issue. Raving about a preemptive strike on  us, the United States is aiming at an opportunity to provoke a  war. The Japanese reactionaries are also attempting to take the  lead in taking sanctions against us.    The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique, raving about the  inevitability of sanctions against us, is persistently  maneuvering, in collusion with outside forces, to harm its  fellow countrymen and to drive the nation into a nuclear  calamity.    It is far from an unpremeditated development that the United  States, Japan, and South Korea organized a strike group at a  time when a grave explosive situation is being created on the  Korean peninsula because of the said maneuvers. It is an  advance preparation for the formation of multinational forces  to be put into a war of northward invasion on the Korean  peninsula when those countries provoke it. In other words, it  can be said to be a trial formation of a multinational force.    With the organization of the strike group, they are  attempting to further expand and intensify their military threat  against us and force us to submit. This is proven by the  foreign press report on the organization of the strike group,  which said it is a political warning for Pyongyang.    They, however, are miscalculating. Our people are never  frightened nor do they submit, no matter what pressure is put on  them. We have already made it clear that a sanction is a  declaration of war against us, and that not only those  participating in a sanction but those supporting it will be duly  held responsible for it. We mean what we say.    Our people treasure peace, but do not beg for peace by  having  the country's sovereignty trampled upon. We will inflict a  resolute punishment on those who set upon us to crush our  socialism.</p>

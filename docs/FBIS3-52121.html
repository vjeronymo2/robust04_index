"According to our information, President Mubarak, who is  displeased with the disappearance of Mr. al-Kikhya, has given  his orders to competent authorities to do all that is possible  in order to clarify this matter," said Muhammad Jibril, who  represents the National Front for the Salvation of Libya in  Cairo.    He said the Front had urged Mubarak to "adopt a firm stand"  against the party responsible for the abduction of al-Kikhya,  leader of the National Rally which is opposed to Libya's leader  Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi.    Jibril said the "silence" which had prevailed over the past  week over al-Kikhya's case only encouraged al-Qadhdhafi to  commit other similar acts against members of the opposition.    The opposition had accused Libyan agents of kidnapping  al-Kikhya who vanished on December 11 after leaving his hotel in  Cairo where he was attending an Arab human rights conference.  Libya denied last week any involvement in the affair, saying  al-Kikhya was the victim of a feud between opposition groups.    "This silence gives way to other regimes to kidnap or  liquidate dissidents living in Egypt," Jibril added.    The Egyptian president's political advisor, 'Usamah al-Baz,  found no cooperation from Libyan officials during a visit to  Tripoli on December 19 aimed at tracing the 63-year-old  al-Kikhya, who was foreign minister under al-Qadhdhafi in the  1970s and represented Libya at the United Nations between 1976  and 1980.</p>

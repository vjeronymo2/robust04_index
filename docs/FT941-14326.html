			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (28): The build-up to recovery begins - Companies have had a poor year. But there are signs of improvement / Sector Analyses - Construction It has been a horrid year for most European construction companies. Profits have tumbled. Domestic building and civil engineering markets have shrunk and large numbers of construction workers have been laid off as companies have closed or reduced capacity. The only consolation has been found in stock markets where share prices, particularly of British contractors and building material suppliers, have risen sharply, indicating that investors believe that bottom may be approaching and that, at least in the UK, recovery may be round the corner. The reason for this resurgence in shareholder optimism has been the continuing low levels of European and US interest rates. This is perceived to have two beneficial effects. The first and most important of these is to reduce the cost of borrowing to finance new construction of factories, homes and offices. Secondly, lower interest rates encourage greater investment in equities, including construction shares, by reducing returns available on cash deposits. A slow recovery in US construction markets, together with the indications that a similar thaw may at last be getting under way in the UK, has further assisted investment sentiment in companies with exposure to these markets. As a result, the rankings of the 29 construction and building material companies included in the latest FT European 500 generally enjoyed a modest improvement in 1993, in spite of publishing some very poor profits figures. Of the 17 companies to increase their rating - including three new entries - nine were British and a tenth, CRH, was Irish. The improvement in the ranking of continental European companies Lafarge Coppee and Holderbank, the French and Swiss cement companies, has more to do with their large US interests than any strength in continental markets which generally struggled in 1993. Lafarge Coppee, the second largest construction company by market capitalisation in the FT European 500, rose from 153rd to 131st in the overall table. Holderbank rose from 241st to 183rd. Saint Gobain, the French glass maker with the largest market capitalisation in the sector, saw its overall rating fall 20 places to 81st position. The company suffered because of its exposure to the declining French construction market which has been hit harder than most as the recession has moved to the European mainland. EuroConstruct, representing construction research agencies and economic forecasting bodies in 15 European countries, estimates that the volume of construction output, measured in constant prices, fell by about 3 per cent in western Europe last year. It forecasts a further fall of 0.3 per cent this year with further declines in output expected in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. UK construction output, by contrast, is forecast to rise by just 0.9 per cent, having fallen by 14 per cent in the previous three years. Growth rates in Germany have slowed considerably with continuing strong demand for more and better housing in eastern Germany offset by reduced investment in the west as the national economy has come under increased pressure. Output is forecast by EuroConstruct to rise by just 1.5 per cent in 1994. No German construction company improved its FT 500 rating last year, with four out of the five companies reducing their ranking. Hochtief, the best performer, only just maintained its place in 150th position. Three new construction-related companies joined the 500. These were Lapeyre, the French joinery group, which was floated last year; Dragados, the Spanish contractor and Wimpey of the UK. The British contractor crept into 494th position in spite of announcing a Dollars 171.4m loss for 1992, the worst result in its 100-year history. Wimpey has since moved back into the black, making a pre-tax profit of Dollars 1.6m in the first half of last year. Net debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds fell to 36 per cent at the end of June following the group's Dollars 155m rights issue. UK housebuilders raised Dollars 701m from rights issues last year, including Dollars 321m from Tarmac. The money was needed to repair balance sheets and provide cash to buy land to take advantage of the fragile UK housing recovery which got under way last year. British building material companies such as Redland, Blue Circle, RMC, BPB Industries and Pilkington have also benefited from a resurgence in British building material prices as markets for their products have improved and manufacturing capacity of cement, bricks and structural steel has reduced in the recession. However, some British stock market analysts believe that the rise in share prices of UK construction and building materials companies may be coming to an end since the modest rate of recovery predicted for the industry does not justify the rating that some of these companies are now on. Annual pre-tax profits published last year for the 29 contractors and building material companies in the FT500 fell by 27.7 per cent to Dollars 3.13bn with British companies among the worst affected, reflecting the depth of the property recession during 1992. The 29 accounted for 1.96 per cent of the total published profits of FT500 companies compared with 2.47 per cent the previous year.

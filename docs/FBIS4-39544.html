			<p>BFN     [Text] Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan today  received Russian Defense Minister and Army General Pavel Grachev  and the delegation accompanying him.    The question of granting the status of a military base to  the  Russian Federation Army units stationed in Armenia, the  prospects of implementing the current plan for the peaceful  settlement of the Karabakh problem, matters pertaining to the  organization of Armenia's air defenses, and a number of other  issues were discussed during the meeting.    State Minister Vazgen Sargisyan, Defense Minister Serzh  Sargisyan, and Interior Minister Vano Siradegyan participated in  the meeting.    Russian Defense Minister and Army General Pavel Grachev  granted an interview to an ARMENPRES correspondent. Replying to  a question on the purpose of his visit, he said that he is  visiting Armenia at the invitation of Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan to conduct talks on a number of military-political  matters, particularly on cooperation between the two countries  within the framework of the collective security agreement. The  minister said that the [word indistinct] conditions for the  deployment of the Russian Army units in the Republic will be  discussed. Grachev added that matters relating to the  Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict will also be discussed during his  visit to Armenia and meetings with the Republic's leadership.  In this connection, he specifically emphasized that Armenia and  Karabakh have signed the agreement on peaceful settlement of the  conflict worked out with Russian mediation, whereas Azerbaijan  has so far refrained from doing so. Therefore, after his visit  to Georgia on Saturday he will go to Baku to meet Aliyev to  propose that Azerbaijan finally sign the agreement.    Commenting on whether the number of Russian troops could be  increased in Armenia, Grachev noted that there could only be  talk of reducing them.    After his meeting with Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan, Mr. Grachev told reporters that he is satisfied  with the results of his talks with the Armenian president. The  president and the Armenian people desire to have Russian bases  on Armenian territory within the framework of the collective  security agreement and on a bilateral basis to jointly ensure  the security of Armenia and Russia. The Armenian president  reiterated support for the implementation of that agreement [on  Nagorno-Karabakh], which we formulated in Moscow, said the  Russian defense minister. He added that he will leave for Baku  on 11 June with these impressions and will ask Aliyev to once  more reassess the situation and sign the agreement. He  expressed the hope that after that a real and stable peace will  be established in Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

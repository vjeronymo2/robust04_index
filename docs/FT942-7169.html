			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: US management urged to improve use of derivatives Senior US company managers needed to understand and control the risks of using derivative financial products, Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England's executive director of banking supervision, said yesterday. Mr Quinn said recent losses announced by US companies 'seem to have the common theme that senior management did not have full knowledge or full understanding or what was being transacted'. He told a conference organised by the Futures Industry Association and the Futures and Options Association that the need for companies trading derivatives to have 'full and proper controls' was as great as for banks. Mr Quinn said he 'fully-endorsed' recent remarks on controls by the US General Accounting Office. 'There will always be some products to which the correct response for an end-user is to say 'no', or at least 'not yet',' he said. He said the responsibility of banks selling derivatives to companies varied depending on whether they were acting as advisers or simply as counterparties. In the latter case, there was no 'best advice' requirement. 'Of course, commercial considerations may narrow the difference, but it must be correct for the precise nature of the relationship to be made clear from the beginning. Beyond that, caveat emptor,' Mr Quinn said. He said the use of derivatives would probably grow further 'albeit, perhaps at a less hectic pace'. The rate of growth would depend on treatment by financial regulators, and whether the number of market-makers grew. He said there were signs the differences between exchange trade products and over-the-counter derivatives were being eroded, with the development of more customised exchange products such as Flex contracts in Chicago. Separately, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse said yesterday derivatives were not excessively risky for companies to use, provided they took appropriate care. Mr Andrew Coleman, a partner at the firm, said any company looking to manage risks should 'ensure that the appropriate risk culture is in place, that risk management policies are set and compliance monitored'. He said these requirements were the responsibility of senior management. Senior executives had to have a detailed understanding of the risks the business was trying to manage and the hedging techniques it was adopting. In a number of recent cases, companies had incurred losses through the use of derivatives which seemed to involve types of interest rate swaps with an option embedded in the structure, Mr Coleman said. 'If the user is not sophisticated enough to recognise and control these risks, they could easily be overlooked in a company's internal review,' he said. He said the swap market was evolving too rapidly for some players to keep pace. Many companies were now relying on banks to help them value some of the more exotic derivative products.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Action man reputation: A bank newcomer Perhaps the most striking evidence of Mr Jean Peyrelevade's determination to give Credit Lyonnais a fresh start is his decision to bring in Mr Pascal Lamy, who has been chief of staff to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, for the past nine years. A cryptic communique, issued yesterday in Paris and Brussels, merely said Mr Lamy would 'join the management' of the bank. But it seems likely that the 47-year-old Eurocrat may end up number two to Mr Peyrelevade, although Mr Lamy's precise relation to the bank's two general directors may be of less import. The Credit Lyonnais president is said to want to run the bank more collegially and to get away from the monarchical style for which his predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, and indeed many French bosses are often criticised. Bringing a man with no commercial banking experience into an institution that self-evidently needs just that, may seem odd. Yet Mr Lamy is an old hand in multinational institutions, and Credit Lyonnais - thanks indeed to Mr Haberer's over-ambitious expansion of recent years - has become one. The bank may not operate in all 12 European Union countries. But it has more than double the Commission's 15,000 staff, and is now the most trans-European of banks. At all events, Mr Peyrelevade had no hesitation in starting to headhunt Mr Lamy last October, when he took over Credit Lyonnais. The two men were socialist comrades-in-arms in the early 1980s. Mr Lamy moved in 1983 from being Mr Delors' chief aide in the finance ministry to succeed Mr Peyrelevade as deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy. As such, they were architects of the nationalisations that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is now busy undoing. But, evolving outside the hot house of French socialist politicking, both now see themselves - and are evidently seen by Mr Balladur, who has the last word on top jobs in state-owned bodies like Credit Lyonnais - as non-ideological managers. Acknowledging his inexperience, Mr Lamy said yesterday: 'I will have to take six to eight months to learn the banking business.' Though he becomes a banker on May 1, his last Euro-job will be as Mr Delors' 'sherpa', preparing for the Group of Seven summit in July, 'because this is something I've done for 10 years'. More to the point, however, he says he has steered, and will steer, well clear of any Commission consideration of yesterday's state aid plan for Credit Lyonnais. 'I won't be involved with this in Brussels, or in Paris, from near or from far.' If confirmation were needed that Mr Delors, whose mandate ends this December and whose successor will be named this June, has no more big Euro-projects in mind, Mr Lamy's departure is it. For if Mr Delors has been Europe's 'ideas man', Mr Lamy has been its 'action man' - not in routine running of the Brussels bureaucracy, but in getting all the special projects through: the treaty revisions of 1986 and 1992, the single market white paper, the Euro-dimension of Germany's reunification, monetary union, and most recently the Delors white paper on growth and jobs. He freely owns up to his Brussels reputation as Mr Delors' 'hatchet man' or 'Exocet' (a French missile used to effect by Argentina against UK ships in 1982). 'But those who know me know this is not a trait of my character, but has been a consequence of my function,' he says. The moody Mr Delors has never liked to take tough personnel decisions himself. From May 1, Mr Lamy will have a boss who is less squeamish than his old one.</p>

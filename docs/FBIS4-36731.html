			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F> correspondents Assane Diop and Dominique de Courcelles at the  OAU summit in Tunis; date not given; from the "Afrique Soir"  program -- recorded]    [Text] Our guest on "Afrique Soir" this evening is Algerian  Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri. Interviewed by Assane  Diop and Dominique de Courcelles, he began by speaking of  relations and cooperation between Sub-Saharan Africa and the  Arab world:    [Dembri] We currently face the problems that are thrown up  by  the transition to a market economy and the bringing together of  our potentialities in order to build up economic  complementarity; this will ensure that, in the future, Africa  and even the Arab world will be able to talk on an equal footing  with the developed world. This is not just our own conclusion:  The European Union, which is for us the closest pole of  development, is pushing us toward economic integration.    [Correspondent] As concerns bilateral relations between  Algeria and some of its African neighbors, you have, in  particular, intervened on the problem of the Tuareg refugees  from Mali. You recently held a new series of meetings. Where  at present do things stand on the return of the Malian refugees?  Algeria is playing a major role in this issue, as most of the  refugees are on Algerian territory.    [Dembri] If you take the problem of displaced persons in  Algeria, we do indeed have some 40,000 Malian refugees in the  south of the country. We are trying to make their lives  somewhat easier, as best we can, by contributing our own  facilities, and also making use of aid from international  organizations, from some countries also, including France, in  order to make sure that these people do not feel completely  abandoned.    [Correspondent] Will you encourage their return, because we  know that the program has been seriously delayed?    [Dembri] Absolutely. There are always difficulties, which  flow primarily from the primary difficulty, which is that of  transport-- we are talking about enormous distances, arid or  semi-arid regions; there is also the problem of the dispersion  of these displaced persons. I think that we are trying to do  something.    [Correspondent] Algeria is currently weighed down by its  internal problems, and in particular, by the security problem  and the lack of dialogue between the government and the Islamic  militants. What can Algeria expect from an OAU [Organization of  African Unity] summit, and from other African nations as far as  this problem is concerned?    [Dembri] It is true that we may have a few hotbeds of  insecurity in Algeria. It is true that there is some terrorist  activity, but there is a momentum of political dialogue that is  beginning to pick up speed, and this movement is irreversible.  The transition platform enabled the opening of political talks  to all the children of Algeria--all of them, without any  exceptions.    [Correspondent] Including the extremist armed Islamic  fundamentalists?    [Dembri] All the children of Algeria. We just have to  realize that political dialogue can only work through the  peaceful confrontation of ideas.    [Correspondent] So the OAU could do something?    [Dembri] The OAU can quite simply address the general  problems of transition: I mean that we cannot achieve in a few  years what the Western world took two centuries to achieve.  Consequently, this transition must be accompanied in a  responsible way by the surrounding countries, because it is  quite clear that situations of instability here will lead to  instability elsewhere. There is a kind of cosolidarity that  must develop, which must emerge from this forum.</p>

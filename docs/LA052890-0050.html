			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: DAVID GONZALES SHOT, BUT IN STABLE CONDITION  </P> <P> David Gonzales of Houston, the World Boxing Council's sixth-ranked lightweight,  was in stable condition Sunday after being shot in the back outside a lounge,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Gonzales, whose record is 23-1-1, was to fight Darryl Tyson of Ft.  </P> <P> Worth June 11 for the North American Boxing Federation Championship. Tyson is  ranked fourth in the world by the WBC.  </P> <P> Police said Gonzales and an unidentified man fled after a companion, Miguel  Angel Martinez, 25, was shot and killed outside the lounge about 1:30 a.m.  Sunday. Gonzales was shot in the back and the other man was shot at, but not  injured, officials said.  </P> <P> The three apparently had walked to the parking lot in back of the club, where  two men confronted them, police said. One placed a small handgun on Martinez's  chest and fired. Then the two left in a small white Ford.  </P> <P> Police said a game of pool a week ago between some of the men at the lounge  triggered the dispute. Police said Martinez was not involved in the game.  </P></p>

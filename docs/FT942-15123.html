			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Rates drop Many larger building societies have been lowering their variable rates in recent weeks. The trend continues with the Leeds Permanent reducing its rates on Bonus Gold, Solid Gold and Tessa. Smaller societies have begun to follow: Hinckley &amp; Rugby has dropped its Tessa rate to 7.35 per cent. Even at this figure, though, it still heads the table. New headline rates are being introduced to attract savers to longer-term fixed products. Newcastle has launched a market leader paying 8 per cent yearly (7.75 per cent monthly) from Pounds 5,000. Northern Rock, its local rival, responded by introducing a Pounds 15,000 tier to its Postal Bond paying 7.75 per cent monthly. Monday will see Britannia launch a five-year fixed bond paying 8.25 per cent annually, which will make this the market leader. Again, a monthly option is available. Escalator bonds have been introduced this week from Norwich &amp; Peterborough and Portman. The best rates are available from Cheshire and Leeds &amp; Holbeck, both paying from 6 per cent in the first year to 10 per cent in the fifth. The most noticeable firming of fixed rates has been on the Guaranteed Income Bond front. After being in the doldrums for many months, net rates have increased by more than 1 per cent on many five-year bonds in recent weeks. NatWest Life has increased them several times, giving it market-leading rates at Pounds 5,000. Premium Life and Consolidated have increased their rates and are top for lower deposits, on one and four-year bonds respectively. The best rate on a five-year bond comes from Eurolife, paying 6.60 per cent net from Pounds 10,000. This is equivalent to 8.80 per cent gross to a basic-rate taxpayer, making it more than a match for similar building society accounts.</p>

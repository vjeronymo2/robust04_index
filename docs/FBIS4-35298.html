			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council  member, has left Sanaa for Amman en route to New York. Before  leaving Sanaa International Airport, he made the following  statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA':    Entrusted by the Presidential Council and the Council of  Ministers, I will represent the Republic of Yemen in the UN  Security Council [UNSC] deliberations, which were requested by  certain states. In this regard, we are interested in explaining  the facts as they are to the UN Security Council to ensure that  the results of these deliberations will be in harmony with the  hopes of our people to preserve the country's unity and  democratic march in the face of the conspiracy and malicious  attack against unity and democracy by the secessionist elements  in the Socialist Party leadership. These elements are trying to  reverse history by insisting on returning to the pre-22 May 1990  situation.    We will also brief the UN Security Council on the truth  about  what is happening in our country. It is an armed rebellion  against constitutional legitimacy and a violation of the  Constitution and a flagrant attack against citizens and their  security and stability. The legitimate agencies' fulfillment of  their tasks in the face of the armed rebellion reflect their  national and constitutional responsibility to protect the  sovereignty and stability of the homeland; it is also an  internal affair and no one should interfere in it.</p>

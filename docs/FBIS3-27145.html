In an interview with the CNN Television Network, Christopher  said, "We have information they have taken out probably 50 or so  of the heavy weapons and we understand that they are beginning  to move some additional weapons out ... [ellipses] It means  that they've got lots more to take out. They've taken out only  a minority."    He said U.S. President Bill Clinton would make a statement  Saturday [19 February] morning on the possible air strike on  Serb Forces in Bosnia, in which the United States Air Force will  take part if it ever takes place.    "Right now, we're in a wait-and-see attitude... [ellipses as  received] I am cautious about this. The Serbs have  disappointed us many times before," said Christopher.    "There will be severe punishment if they (Serbs) don't  comply  with the NATO ultimatum. They will pay a very heavy price,"  Christopher added.    He also said that Russia's decision to deploy 400 troops in  Sarajevo would not affect NATO's decision on air strikes.    He rejected Russia's warning that any air strike would lead  to an all-out war in the Balkans, saying that the air strike  would only end the "carnage" in Bosnia.    Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton met with his top  advisors on Friday in the White House on the Bosnia situation.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Major rejects proposals for a 'two-tier' Europe: 'There is not, and should never be, an exclusive hard core of countries or of policies' Mr John Major denounced calls for an inner core of EU states yesterday as Britain and its main European partners locked horns over the community's future. Speaking in the Netherlands, the prime minister spelt out his opposition to a 'two-tier Europe', warning this would lead to 'dangerous divisions' among member states. He defended his call for a reformed EU constitution that would give greater flexibility to individual member countries, allowing them to decide how much they should engage in specific projects such as monetary union and the single market. In a speech certain to appeal to Euro-sceptic Tory MPs, he also called for clear limits to the amount of power that should be given to the European parliament. He claimed that the parliament had 'a long way to go before it wins respect and popular affection'. Delivering the William and Mary lecture to the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, Mr Major became the first EU leader comprehensively to reject a call by the German Christian Democrats (CDU) for the creation of a hard core of European states based on France, Germany and the Benelux countries. Remarks last week by Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, were taken as implying the same hard core. In Paris yesterday, however, Mr Balladur distanced himself from the CDU position, defending his conception of 'variable geometry' in European integration, in which different groups of EU states would come together to pursue faster integration in varying fields, such as monetary, military and social policies. 'Where I differ from the Germans is that I don't think there can be a central core of the same countries pursuing faster integration in all fields,' he said. But he stuck by his belief that the pace of EU integration should not be dictated by the most reluctant members of the Union. In Leiden, Mr Major acknowledged that the EU seemed 'temporarily to have lost the self-confidence of the 1980s'. But he added: 'I see a real danger in talk of a hard core, inner and outer circles, a two-tier Europe. There is not, and should never be, an exclusive hard core either of countries or of policies.' He argued that the nation state must remain 'the basic political unit in Europe', and that the European public was 'wary of over-centralisation and of over-ambitious blueprints for a new European architecture'. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday stood firm, telling the Bundestag the CDU 'is and will be the motor of integration in Germany and Europe'. 'We absolutely do not want that the slowest ship decides the pace of the convoy,' the chancellor said, repeating the words used last week by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the leader of the CDU parliamentary party and Mr Kohl's de facto deputy. However, Mr Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrats, said: 'There must not be a Europe of first and second class,' adding that Germany would remain a 'reliable team player'. Downing Street officials stressed that preparations for the 1996 inter-governmental conference, which will decide the future of Europe, were still at an early stage and that Mr Major's comments should be seen as a 'contribution to a vigorous debate'. But they admitted concern about a growing 'nostalgia' in France and Germany for an EU centred once more on the community's founders. 'That cannot be an option because the Union is committed to a policy of enlargement,' said one official. Mr Major also rejected calls from other governments for the 1996 conference to increase the role of the European parliament. He argued that it would be 'premature' for the Strasbourg assembly to be given more powers and urged stronger links between national assemblies and the European parliament.

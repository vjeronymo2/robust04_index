			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / New team stresses need to contain inflation THE NEXT governor of the Bank of England last night showed his years of experience in the Bank's back rooms as he talked of trying to effect gradual change after he takes over at the end of June. 'I have got to be jolly careful of what I say because I would not want to present myself as in any sense a revolutionary,' he told a press conference over his appointment. Mr George, a heavy smoker, was apologetic about being thrust into the public eye on an evening when his throat was hoarse. 'It shows you how hard I had to talk to get the job,' he said. He said his primary task was the permanent reduction of inflation. Achieving this was more important than whether the Bank was given formal independence, but greater operational freedom for the Bank was nonetheless desirable. 'The foremost issue is stability, not for its own sake but because it has been instability and inflation that has done the damage, that has caused people to lose their jobs, their homes and their businesses,' he said. 'Compared with that, the question of independence is not that important. The forms in which we can exert independent influence are various.' Mr George emphasised the importance he attached to the chancellor's statement that his task was to reduce inflation. 'We have never before had a clear mandate from government as to what our role is, not in public,' he said. He also made clear the tender state of Bank morale. He said the Bank had been 'sobered' by criticism over its supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and the undignified exit of Britain from the exchange rate mechanism. Despite his voice, Mr George looked at ease compared with Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, who confessed he had been 'gob-smacked' to receive a call from the chancellor yesterday morning asking him to become deputy governor. Mr Pennant-Rea faced a particularly difficult task at the press conference because as editor of The Economist he has called for the Bank to be given independence. But Mr George emphasised his welcome for an outsider as deputy. 'I absolute recognise the case for having fresh air brought into the bank. That is certainly something the political masters that made this appointment will have been conscious of,' said Mr George. Mr Pennant-Rea said that 'as a journalist' he supported the Bank being given independence. 'It is a view I will bring with me to the Bank, recognising, however, that in the last analysis this is a decision for the politicians,' he said. Mr George said the circumstances surrounding Britain's departure from the ERM last September had been 'uniquely difficult'. The referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty had given the financial markets a focal point to speculate against sterling. 'Even with hindsight there was not much we could have done (to prevent devaluation),' he said. He accepted that Britain's departure from the ERM, and its poor post-war record on inflation, had left it with a 'credibility gap' in terms of convincing financial markets about the soundness of the effort on price control. The new sense of independent thinking at the Bank would not lead to changes 'of a qualitative kind' regarding its relationship with the Treasury. There was an 'open and straightforward' partnership between the two. But he said he had no plans to order Bank economists to publish their forecasts which up to now have been kept secret. Asked about his view of recovery from recession, Mr George said: 'We have put in place the basis for sustainable expansion over the rest of the 1990s, similar to that which we saw during the 1980s. 'I am not insensitive to the immediate pressures that individuals and companies are facing throughout the country. But in the long run it would not help their prospects - indeed these could be damaged - if we were to go for an immediate quick fix (to stimulate the economy),' he said. He ruled out Britain's return to the ERM until the British recession had ended and until the economic instability elsewhere in Europe triggered by German unification had subsided.</p>

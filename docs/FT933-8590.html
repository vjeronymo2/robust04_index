			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Yields boost for waters WATER stocks surged as investors decided that their recent underperformance had been overdone and the yield qualities looked attractive. At the same time, the sector ignored the clouds cast over some other utilities by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into British Gas due on Tuesday. UBS was said to be prominent, according to dealers, in pointing out the relative cheapness of the water stocks. The sector has lagged behind on regulatory concerns, as the rest of the market has rushed ahead. From the beginning of July to mid-August, waters underperformed the market by 3 per cent, according to Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell at NatWest Securities. 'Having fallen behind, they're doing some catching up, but we are still feeling cautious ahead of Tuesday,' he said. Utility analysts are concerned that the MMC's decision on what the rate of returns allowable by Gas should be will be followed by the water and electricity regulators. In the case of the water stocks, analysts said there was some correlation between the Gas pipeline return to be decided on Tuesday and the water companies infrastructure. 'Anything below 4.5 per cent will be bad for waters,' said one specialist. All the stocks showed hefty gains. Among these, Anglian jumped 15 to 510p, Thames 13 to 520p and Yorkshire 14 to 530p. British Gas edged 4 ahead to 332 1/2 p. A rally by the Recs saw most stay in positive territory by the end of the session.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brasilia, 3 Jun (AE) -- Today, one of President  Itamar Franco's advisers reported that political pressure on  Planalto Palace and several ministries has reduced to only three  the number of state-owned companies' directors who were  dismissed for converting employees' salaries into Real Value  Units by the maximum percentage index. Transportation Minister  Rubem Bayma Denys had estimated that at least 50 managers would  be dismissed, discharged, or retired as a result of the  incident. The official gazette, however, only published the name  of three directors to be dismissed: Rilson Carneiro Raposo, Jose  Eudes Rangel, and Roberto Vaz da Silva. They are, respectively,  the president and directors of the Executive Group for the Study  of Transportation Integration Policy (Geipot). [passage omitted]</p>

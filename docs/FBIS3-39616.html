			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jacques Amalric commentary: "From Paris to Washington: </F> Genesis of an Ultimatum"]    [Text] When on 5 February [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe  and [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard learned of the tragedy  on the Sarajevo market, they agreed that the indignation of  Western public opinion should be used to make a last diplomatic  and military attempt to involve the United States in the Bosnian  issue once again. For some time, the idea of a withdrawal of  the French contingent from Bosnia had been gaining ground in  Paris. The fierce controversy which had just arisen between the  French and Americans on the plan to partition Bosnia, supported  by Paris but described as unjust and immoral by Washington,  convinced many French officials that the war would be stepped up  and that there would soon be no alternative but to withdraw the  Blue Helmets if a repetition of the Lebanese fiasco was to be  avoided.    The first stage in the operation launched by Juppe and  Leotard -- two men who do not respect each other excessively but  who nonetheless will overcome their feelings and work together  -- is aimed at securing the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo  before reopening negotiations. First, because the Bosnian  capital has become a symbol over the 22 months in which is has  been besieged by the Bosnian Serbs. Second, because France can  no longer be suspected of only proposing to use force where it  has no troops.    Paris remembers with some embarrassment the objections which  were made last January at the NATO summit in Brussels to the  French idea -- which was nonetheless accepted but has still not  been implemented -- aimed at securing, by force if necessary,  the reopening of Tuzla airport and the relief of the Blue  Helmets stationed in Srebrenica: No French soldier is stationed  near these two areas; it is the Swedish Blue Helmets, who have  no heavy weapons, who are deployed in Tuzla, and Canadians who  are to be relieved in Srebrenica by a Dutch contingent.    Once it was decided to no longer be paralyzed by the views  of  the French military hierarchy hostile, like most of the other  Western military leaders, to air strikes which did not have the  sole aim of helping Blue Helmets in difficulty, the foreign and  defense ministers' aides asked the essential question: Is it  better to go through the United Nations or NATO to carry through  the French initiative? Francois Leotard was, for a time, in  favor of the NATO solution, but it was finally not accepted:  There was a fear that it would meet with excessively strong  opposition, not only from the Greeks, who make no secret of  their hostility to operations against the Serbs, even if they  are Bosnian, but also from the British and Canadians who have  strong reservations about exposing their contingents to possible  reprisals.    Moreover, nobody was certain that the idea of going through  NATO would have the -- vital -- approval of the Elysee or even  that of the United States which, at the NATO summit, made every  effort to ensure that the Atlantic Alliance is not seen as a  machine with anti-Russian connotations. Did not Bill Clinton at  the last minute reject the NATO membership applications  presented by the Central European countries, only conceding to  them the very vague status of a Partnership for Peace, after  verifying that the Kremlin had no objection to that?    It is therefore the UN solution which was initially proposed  by Alain Juppe to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  during a telephone conversation. The French minister proposed  to his counterpart that a resolution should immediately be  submitted to the Security Council demanding the lifting of the  siege of Sarajevo in 10 days and the creation of a security zone  with a radius of 30 km around the Bosnian capital. Surprised by  the demand, which involves obvious risks for the French  soldiers, Christopher made objections to the UN route, because  of the risk of a Russian veto; he also mentioned the possibility  of an immediate reprisal raid against the Serbian lines.    The French side rallied to the NATO solution which has  finally received the go-ahead from the Hotel Matignon [prime  minister's office] and the Elysee [president's office], but it  is difficult to know what to think when you hear the remarks  made by Bill Clinton who seems to link any American reaction to  the result of an investigation to determine the origin of the  mortar fire which killed 68 people on the little Sarajevo market  place. Is Washington not playing a double game and seeking  excuses to do nothing? Paris does not yet know what THE NEW  YORK TIMES revealed on 15 February: On the eve of the mortar  attack on the Sarajevo market, Warren Christopher sent a long  study on Bosnia to Pentagon Chief William Perry and to Anthony  Lake, the President's security adviser, in which he says he is  "extremely uncomfortable" about the "passiveness" of U.S. policy  and suggests a "new initiative."    On Sunday, in the early afternoon, the French decision was  made and communicated to Warren Christopher by Alain Juppe:  France will call for an emergency meeting of the Atlantic  Council to repeat its proposal for an ultimatum and the creation  of a 30 km security zone. The U.S. secretary of state approved  of the approach in principle and suggested that the United  States is prepared this time to be involved in the negotiations  on the partition of Bosnia, provided certain territorial  concessions are made to the Muslims. Late in the afternoon,  Alain Juppe and Francois Leotard solemnly announced the decision  at the Quai d'Orsay. To avoid having to wait for the  hypothetical results of an uncertain investigation, they  specified that their proposal is valid whoever was responsible  for the previous day's attack. This attack, they explained, is  the result of the siege of the city and it is this siege which  must be lifted.    An anecdotal detail but one which is indicative of some  reservations and pro-Serbian feelings: The defense minister,  probably on the basis of information communicated to him by  French military intelligence, explained that Sarajevo is the  target of around 100 Serbian batteries, howitzers, and tanks.  But the figure is much lower than the real one (it has since  been corrected) because from that time the American and British  intelligence services assessed it as between 250 and 300....    On Monday 7 February, the French plan was accepted with  amendments by the United States. Fearing that a 30 km zone  around Sarajevo would demand too much monitoring from the Blue  Helmets -- it must not come under Muslim control if the West  does not want to be accused of fighting for them -- the  Americans, still anxious to limit the dispatch of GI's to the  area to the strict minimum, are proposing to reduce it to a 20  km radius.    The French, all too happy that Washington should finally  agree to be diplomatically involved in the Bosnian negotiations,  accepted. All that remained to be done was for Bill Clinton to  telephone John Major and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien  to persuade them to support the plan and thus save NATO's  credibility, which was starting to be a serious problem. Late  on Wednesday 9 February, the NATO Council adopted the ultimatum  in principle.    If this had not been done, Paris clearly states, it would  have been impossible to rule out the hypothesis of a withdrawal  of the French contingent in the medium term. This is a  hypothesis which never had Francois Mitterrand's support but it  is one to which Edouard Balladur would probably have resigned  himself, because he is so afraid of the prospect of military  losses. This is a risk which is now being shouldered by him, by  Francois Mitterrand, Alain Juppe, and Francois Leotard.</p>

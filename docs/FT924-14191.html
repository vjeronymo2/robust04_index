			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Andalucia left to nurse a post-Expo hangover: The likely regional impact of the world fair's closure THE Seville Expo '92 winds up today after receiving more than 40m visitors over the past six months. As the red carpet is unfurled for the last time for King Juan Carlos, the frequent Expo visitor who will preside over an extravagant closing ceremony, the immediate question is what Spain has achieved after investing about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in the biggest world fair to date. As Expo's promotors tell it, just about everything involved with the exhibition deserves to be consigned to the Guinness Book of Records. There were more national and corporate pavilions, at 98, than at any other similar event and the exhibition grounds boasted the biggest car park, for 40,000 vehicles, anywhere. They even say, although the figures are disputed, that Expo, managed by a public company expressly created for the purpose, will break even. It is hoped the books will be balanced by the resale of Expo's buildings to a second ad-hoc public company designed to create a research and development park on the fair's site. What is left for Spain, and for Seville, after the party is over is more difficult to assess. The fate of Spain's first bullet train in the coming months might serve as an indicator. The high-speed train links Madrid and Seville and cuts rail travel time between the two cities by more than half, to about two hours 40 minutes. It was inaugurated just in time for Expo's opening in April and has operated at full capacity for the past six months. The problem is that up to three-quarters of the passengers boarding the train were travelling to Expo. Now the show is over the biggest engineering project undertaken in Spain is almost certain to incur considerable losses. There is little money left to build a more economically rational high-speed link between Madrid and Barcelona. Seville was the 16th century boom town that grew fat on the gold and silver brought back by those who followed Columbus to the New World. It declined sharply when it lost its monopoly trading status and is now the capital of Spain's southern belt of Andalucia, where per capita GDP stands at less than 60 per cent of the European Community's average. Mr Emilio Casinello, who is tipped to be Spain's next ambassador to London and has been Expo's tireless commissioner general, claims the isolation of Seville and Andalucia is a thing of the past. 'There is no possibility of a Spanish Mezzogiorno like in Italy now,' he says. 'There can be no dissection between the north and south.' He was referring to the billions of dollars that have been pumped into the south in the form of roads, telecommunications, overhauled airports  - and the high-speed train. Mr Jacinto Pellon, Expo's chief executive, says: 'We have laid out the land and we have planted the seeds. It is now up to Seville and Andalucia to provide irrigation.' However, the economic climate is not conducive to nurturing Expo's fruits. And nobody now talks of Andalucia as the California of the United States of Europe, as they did when work began on Expo in the booming 1980s.</p>

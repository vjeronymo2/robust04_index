Under the proposed action, the National Park Service would not manipulate the Stehekin River or remove or manipulate woody debris except to protect public roads and bridges. The active sand, rock, and gravel borrow pit would be maintained at less than or equal to its current size. Fire suppression, prescribed natural fire, management-ignited prescribed fire, and selective manual fuel reductions would be used to restore or replicate the natural role of fire. Firewood would be provided at fair market value instead of a set permit fee and there would be no guaranteed cordage per year. The airstrip would remain open. Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands, riparian areas, and high visual sensitivity areas. Under the no-action/minimum requirements alternative, river erosion and flooding would be controlled only to protect life, health, public roads, and bridges. Where feasible, federal lands would be treated with prescribed fire to reduce fuels. Firewood would be obtained from harvesting 1-acre woodlots. The airstrip would remain open. Land protection would emphasize wetlands, shoreline characteristics, high scenic quality, water quality, visitor access, restriction of unsightly development, and development on areas with gradients greater than 20%. Under alternative A, new river shoreline or bank protection structures would be prohibited. The mining of sand, rock, and gravel would be prohibited within the valley. Natural ignitions would be suppressed on the valley floor for the protection of human life and property. Woodlot cutting of firewood would stop immediately. The airstrip would be closed and restored to natural conditions. The Stehekin Valley road between the Landing and Cottonwood Camp would be converted to a trail. All NPS and concession housing and maintenance facilities would be substantially reduced and located at the Landing. Land protection would involve acquisition, on a willing seller/willing buyer basis, or by eminent domain authority, of all private lands within the recreation area. Under alternative B, riverbank protection structures would be allowed if no adverse environmental impacts would result. Mining of sand, rock, and gravel in the valley would be prohibited. Fire and forest fuels would be managed to restore or replicate the natural role of fire. Firewood would be provided at fair market value instead of a set permit fee. There would be no guarantee of firewood cordage per year. The airstrip would be closed. Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands, riparian areas, and high visual sensitivity areas. Under alternative C, protection of public or private improvements threatened by river erosion and flooding would be allowed. The size of the borrow put would remain constant. Selective manual forest fuel reduction techniques would be used to reduce hazard forest fuel loadings. Firewood would be supplied from administrative wood and natural selection ecoforestry selective cutting from a designated area. The airstrip would be managed by the National Park Service for emergency use only. Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands, and high visual sensitivity areas. Major impact topics assessed for the proposed action and alternatives include natural and cultural resources and the socioeconomic environment, including the local and regional economy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles H.

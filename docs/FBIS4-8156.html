			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by S. Tomanek on a news conference held by members </F> of the Meciar-led "shadow cabinet" on board the Druzhba on 5  April on the occasion of the first anniversary of the daily  REPUBLIKA: "Provisional Cabinet Is Afraid of Control"]    [Excerpt] Gabcikovo--[Passage omitted] According to  members of the shadow cabinet, the Party of the Democratic Left  [SDL] as the strongest coalition party has an interesting  position. Even though the government includes 11 former members  of the Communist Party, the wires are actually being pulled by  the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], through the important  posts of state secretaries. [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss has  gotten rid of four SDL representatives who were ready, in the  interest of stabilizing the Slovak Republic, to negotiate with  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] by appointing them  to posts. Pavol Kanis, Pavol Koncos, and Juraj Hrasko are  ministers, and Lubomir Fogas is in the European Parliament. The  SDL, which proclaims its social orientation, has given up these  government departments and clearly goes after property through  privatization.  <H5>  They Are Trading in Deputies </H5>   According to members of the shadow cabinet, the provisional  government will try, out of fear of the election outcome, to  change the electoral law. By asserting a lowering of the  5-percent threshold [for winning seats in parliament], a greater  number of parties would get into parliament, and the result  would be a lasting destabilization of the political scene. The  attempts by the coalition to gain 90 votes before the elections  will probably continue. The elections would be in acute danger  in that case. The government coalition keeps addressing eight  to nine HZDS deputies, with seven-digit sums flying through the  air. In spite of everything, Vladimir Meciar is confident of  the HZDS's victory in the early democratic elections. [passage  omitted]</p>

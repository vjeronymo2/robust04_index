			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THAT PEACH YOU PLANTED MAY BE ONLY ORNAMENTAL;  </P> <P> BEFORE YOU BUY, DETERMINE WHICH TREES BEAR FRUIT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --  NURSERIES CARRY SOME THAT DON'T  </P> <P> This is the time of year when bare-root deciduous fruit trees abound in local  nurseries. No other time of the year offers such a bounty of different  varieties as our bare-root season.  </P> <P> A word of caution, however, before selecting a bare-root fruit tree for your  yard: It is crucial that the particular variety you select is suited to our  mild climatic conditions. Many of the more popular deciduous fruit trees simply  will not produce well here; they require colder winters than we experience.  </P> <P> Here is a listing of deciduous fruit-tree varieties that will produce well in  most Southern California climatic zones. New varieties are introduced each  year, many from countries such as Israel that have similar climates, so keep an  eye open for these as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> APPLES  </P> <P> Gordon -- Developed about 20 years ago in Whittier, it produces a large, plump  apple that is green with red striping and has an unusual sweet-tart flavor.  Bears fruit beginning in mid-August, and harvest extends through October.  </P> <P> Dorsett Golden -- The flavor and texture resemble that of Golden Delicious,  except that it is slightly tart. The skin is a rich yellow color blushed with  red. Harvest period begins in June, and it sometimes sets a smaller secondary  crop, which is ready for harvest in November.  </P> <P> Anna -- Produces a prime dessert fruit; sweet flavor, crisp juicy texture.  Fruit color is greenish, splashed with red. Bears a crop in June and sometimes  again in the fall.  </P> <P> Early Dawn -- This is a highly aromatic apple the tart -- sweet flavor of which  is delicious either fresh or cooked. The tree is quite ornamental, with  beautiful yellow fruit that is blushed with red. Harvest period begins in  August.  </P> <P> All of the above trees are self-fruitful (will produce fruit without another  tree nearby for cross-pollination) except for Anna. If you plant an Anna tree,  also plant a Dorsett Golden tree in close proximity for proper pollination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> APRICOTS  </P> <P> Royal -- Also called Blenheim in some nurseries, Royal is the best bet for  Southland growing conditions. It bears prime-quality yellowish-orange fruit of  superb flavor and texture. Begins bearing in late spring.  </P> <P> Royal is the only apricot variety I recommend for local growing conditions --  and even Royal can be a spotty producer if the weather is erratic during the  blossoming period. However, as a boy growing up in the Southland, I made a good  deal of spending money by selling to local markets the fruit of three  magnificent old Royal apricot trees that grew in my yard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NECTARINES  </P> <P> Gold Mine -- A very reliable producer of large, delicious fruit with white skin  that is blushed red. Bears in mid-July.  </P> <P> Silver Lode -- Medium-size fruit with yellow and red skin. The juicy white  flesh is of fine quality. Harvest begins in June.  </P> <P> Pioneer -- Productive variety with good-flavored fruit. Yellow skin is blushed  with red; yellow flesh. Starts bearing in early July.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PEACHES  </P> <P> Florida King -- A very early peach that starts production in May. Attractive,  large yellow fruit blushed with red. The juicy, sweet fruit features  bright-orange flesh and a smooth texture.  </P> <P> Florida Prince -- Similar to Florida King, but bears later. Medium-large fruit  of fine flavor.  </P> <P> Babcock -- This is an old favorite in the Southland that has been around for  half a century. Medium-size fruit have pure-white flesh that turns red at the  pit; sweet and juicy. The pretty fruit has a pink skin with a red blush. Starts  bearing in late spring.  </P> <P> Mid-Pride -- Produces medium-large yellow fruit that is blushed with red.  Yellow flesh is freestone and has a superb, rich flavor. Very low chilling  requirement. Begin harvest in mid-July.  </P> <P> August Pride -- Produces large, round, yellow freestone fruit of fine flavor  and texture. Very low chill requirement. The tree is large and vigorous, and  the fruit ripens 3 weeks later than Mid-Pride.  </P> <P> Desert Gold -- Very early producer of medium-size yellow fruit splashed with  red. Yellow flesh is clingstone and of very good eating quality. Produces as  early as May in some areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PEARS  </P> <P> There are four pear varieties with a low-chilling requirement that will produce  fruit in our area. The fruit quality, however, does not begin to match Bartlett  or Comice (which will not produce well here). Trees for these low-chill  varieties are very scarce in Southland nurseries, but if you are determined to  grow a pear tree locally, the four low-chill varieties are: Baldwin,  Floridahome, Fanstill and Hood. The only nurseries I know of that usually stock  these trees are Pacific Tree Farms in Chula Vista, (619) 422-2400, and Palos  Verdes Begonia Farm in Torrance, (213) 378-2228; phone first to make certain  they have the trees in stock.  </P> <P> Additionally, two Asian pears will grow and produce fruit here -- Ya-li  (pronounced Yah-lee) and Tsu-li (soo-lee). They must be planted together to  cross-pollinate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLUMS  </P> <P> Santa Rosa -- This is the most reliable plum for Southern California. Large,  juicy fruit with purple skin and yellow flesh. Begins fruit production in June.  </P> <P> Satsuma -- A delicious plum with small dark-red fruit and blood-red flesh.  Needs a Santa Rosa tree planted near it for proper pollination. Bears  mid-summer.  </P> <P> Green Gage -- An old-timer in Southland yards, it produces unusual  greenish-yellow fruit. The golden flesh is sweet and quite juicy. Starts  bearing in July.  </P> <P> Howard Miracle -- Produces pretty yellow fruit that is blushed with red. Flesh  is yellow with a sweet-tart flavor. This tree is a good choice for coastal  areas, as it needs very little winter chill.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, many bare-root fruit trees that will not produce here are still  sold locally. For instance, I went into a nursery in Long Beach last year that  had Bing Cherry trees for sale. Bing, or any cherry variety, will not produce  fruit anywhere in Southern California (and especially not in Long Beach) except  for a few high elevation areas such as Beaumont and parts of the Antelope  Valley.  </P></p>

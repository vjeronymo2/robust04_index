Furthermore, the  PSDB bloc should approach Cardoso today to ask him to announce  his decision this week.    Everyone is under the impression that Fernando Henrique will  run for election because if his decision was to remain as  finance minister, there would be no reason to postpone the  announcement. Deputy Joao Abraao, one of the most involved in  Finance Ministry affairs, commented: "If he announced now that  he will continue as finance minister, he would end the  speculation regarding the name of his replacement."    The movement -- still rather surreptitious -- of currents  for  or against this or that name during the past days has increased  expectations, irritated people, and stirred up ancient  ill-feelings. On 7 March, during a trip from Rio de Janeiro to  Brasilia, a member of the economic team did not conceal his  annoyance over politicians' negative comments about Finance  Ministry experts. According to the expert, the purpose of those  who criticize economic team members one by one is precisely to  demoralize the entire team in order to get Cardoso to remain in  the ministry and thus prevent him from running in the elections.  The actions, according to this argument, are allegedly  orchestrated by another candidate who aspires to the presidency.    This theory may even make some sense regarding a specific  group of politicians but there are some within the PSDB federal  bloc who openly uphold the names of Pedro Malan and Edmar Bacha  for this post. According to this theory, the two allegedly meet  the necessary requirements because they are well acquainted with  the economic plan and will be capable of efficiently  implementing it. Negotiations with Congress, in the case of a  technical solution, may be conducted by Fernando Henrique  himself, who would resume his seat in the Senate.    Rubens Ricupero, who until not long ago made a point of  saying -- rather jokingly -- that he would rather seek asylum in  Switzerland than run the Brazilian economy, may be the big  surprise. Ricupero gained a lot of experience and international  prestige in the foreign trade field through his work with GATT  and has received significant support from the business sector.    The possibility that the finance minister might postpone his  decision even more, in keeping with the amendment extending the  deadline for governors and ministers to resign until 2 July, is  dismissed by the PSDB. The reason for this is, according to  information available on 7 March, that 80 percent of the PSDB  deputies and senators are against the proposal because they  believe it is tied to circumstances and, instead of helping,  will mortally wound the credibility of Fernando Henrique's  candidacy.    The possible replacements:    Pedro Malan: Central Bank president and one of the most  mentioned candidates to replace Fernando Henrique. His  supporters are in every area: ministries, the economic field,  Congress, and within the PSDB itself. There might be someone  better acquainted with the economic plan, but Malan is always  regarded as the expert with the best minister-like face.    Edmar Bacha: Special Finance Ministry adviser. Was one of  the experts most involved in drafting the economic plan. He has  the advantage of also having being greatly involved in the  Cruzado Plan and, therefore, fully aware of the causes of the  failure of the Funaro plan. He enjoys the support of economist  deputies; he is regarded as arrogant by political circles.    Rubens Ricupero: Current environment and legal Amazon region  minister, was Franco's first choice as finance minister. He  rejected the offer in his capacity as ambassador with the excuse  that he had spent too much time out of the country. Now he  believes he is fully acquainted with Brazilian problems. At  Planalto Palace he enjoys the support of institutional  communications adviser Augusto Marzagao.    Osiris Lopes: Federal Revenue Secretary and favorite of  presidential secretary general Mauro Durante, who wants to  promote him. The problem is the public arguments in which he  calmly engaged with the economic team regarding tax increases.    Tasso Jereissati: PSDB president, he almost became finance  minister during [Jose] Sarney's administration. Now, however,  he has the obstacle of the elections because, running again for  the Ceara governorship, it is quite unlikely he will be elected.  He is finely attuned to Fernando Henrique.    Beni Varas: This senator will be sworn in today as planning  minister and, although discreetly, he already is mentioned as  one of the possible leaders of the economy. Politically, he  would be a God-sent gift for the PSDB.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: German groups cut PVC capacity HOECHST and Wacker, two leading German chemicals groups, are to close two bulk PVC factories with a combined capacity of 90,000 tonnes a year. The moves will follow the previously-announced merger of the companies' PVC interests into a single company, Vinnolit Kunststoff, which takes effect today. Around 100 workers will be affected by the closures, which will leave the new company with four German plants with a total of 580,000 tonnes annual capacity and 1,200 employees. The merger was announced last November as part of Hoechst's cost-cutting programme, under which all the company's PVC interests apart from film would be merged with those of Wacker, which is 50 per cent owned by Hoechst. Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of the Frankfurt-based group, said then that the new company would command 10 per cent of the western European market, and offer savings of DM50m (Dollars 29.5m) a year.</p>

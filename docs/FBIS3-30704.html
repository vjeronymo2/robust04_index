			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Feb 3 (CTK) -- It is distorting to speak  about an ethnically pure Hungarian population in southern  Slovakia, as the population of all the concerned regions is  mixed, in some places with a considerable Hungarian majority,  the Slovak Government daily REPUBLIKA writes today.    The daily denies the statistics which inspired  representatives of Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians to call for  establishing their own regions, which REPUBLIKA calls  "Bantustans," at their meeting in Komarno, South Slovakia, on  January 8.    The daily challenges the Komarno meeting's statement that  600,000 people with Hungarian as their mother tongue are living  in Slovakia. "only 556,447 citizens (10.5 percent of the  country's inhabitants) claimed Hungarian as their mother tongue  during the last census in 1991," REPUBLIKA states.    It also casts doubt on the statement that the 522 Slovakia's  towns and villages where Hungarians form a majority are located  in a belt along Slovakia's southern border, and that this  territory is inhabited by 98 percent of all the country's ethnic  Hungarians, who make up a 70-percent majority here. There are  such towns on the territory as Levice, Lucenec, Sala, Roznava  and others, where only 10 to 31 percent are ethnic Hungarians,  the daily stresses. The figure of 98 percent is controversial  as well because in Bratislava and Kosice alone, which are not  lying in the mentioned belt, there live 5.48 percent of all  Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians, it adds.    It criticises the "demagogic distortion of facts" the  arrogance and chauvinist feelings of superiority of the  protagonists of the ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement, which,  however, cannot be blamed on all Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians.  "But the "Henleinisation" of the situation of Slovakia's  Hungarian ethnic minority cannot be ignored," REPUBLIKA says.    Hungarian politicians are "calling for democracy but  continue  in perceiving, thinking and acting like their Greater Hungarian  predecessors, members of the `dominating' nation, the  `dominating moral' of which allows the chauvinist supra-people  to do everything, including establishing Bantustans in the  centre of Europe," the daily states.</p>

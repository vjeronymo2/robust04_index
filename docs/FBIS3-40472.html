			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takeo Matsuoka, staff writer, JAPAN 21ST] </F>   [Text] The Tokyo Motor Show, the auto industry's biggest  event, got under way on 23 October at the Nippon Convention  Center (Makuhari Messe) in Chiba Prefecture. Reflecting the  persisting recession, there is no festive mood in this year's  show, like past events; this year's event feels just like a mere  exhibition of new cars.    This is apparently because all participating automakers are  emphasizing the promotion of their ``sales strategies'' in a  frantic attempt to get visitors to buy by displaying a wide  array of new models that fully meet the practical needs of  today's drivers.    Despite such calculations, however, response to exhibits  remains low.    Can the show really help revitalize the recession-hit auto  industry?    Indications are that sales of new-model cars in 1993  (excepting registered cars and light motor vehicles) will fall  to an estimated 5 million units -- the 1988 level. This means  that the industry will suffer a sales setback below the previous  year's level for three years in a row.    Prospects for an early demand recovery are, therefore, dim  and the makers' ``sense of crisis'' is duly reflected in the  motor show.    This is eloquently endorsed by the remarks of the industry's  top management. ``The business climate surrounding our industry  is so severe that we have been forced to revise domestic demand  to about 5 million units. We, therefore, want the show to give a  shot in the arm to the industry,'' said Tatsuro Toyoda,  president of Toyota Motor Corp.    In the same vein, Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor  Co., Ltd., observed, ``We had expected sales to rebounce from  the second half of this year, but there is still no sign of  sales improving. In such circumstances, we must do our utmost to  promote demand recovery through participation in the motor  show.''    They, therefore, expect much from this year's show, which  they hope will be the catalyst that stimulates demand.    The exhibition halls are fender-to-fender with new models,  including Toyota's ``Celica,'' Nissan's ``Skyline'' and Honda's  ``Accord.'' The remarkable fact about this year's show is that  there is not one luxurious ``futuristic'' model on display.    Approaches to the event carry according to maker. Toshihiro  Wada, president of Mazda Motor Corp., for example, emphasized,  ``Public concern with problems directly related to everyday  life, such as the environment, safety and energy, continues to  assume serious proportions. We, therefore, designed our concept  cars for exhibition with these concerns in mind.''    Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., said,  ``Electric cars are our concept vehicles. We have exhibited new  models we are currently selling.''    Concept cars are invariably designed using state-of-the-art  technology, with concern for the environment and safety  uppermost in designers' minds. These cars are in themselves a  reflection on makers' strategies to stimulate sales.    No doubt, for the recession-plagued auto industry, the motor  show is a golden opportunity to promote sales.    ``The event is extremely significant in that all makers  participate. It is an opportunity to have the public take a  fresh look at their products, principally the latest models,''  stressed a top automaker executive.    Meanwhile, the Toyota president pointed out, ``There is a  definite need to make the most of the event in finding a way out  of the current recession by stimulating consumer confidence.  This is why we have our new models at the show.''    Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association and also chairman of Japan Motor Industrial  Federation, Inc. (JMIF), which hosts the Tokyo Motor Show, said,  ``There are at present few signs that suggest an early recovery  in car sales. I, therefore, hope that new cars at the show will  appeal to the visiting public.''    Automakers hope this year's show will help jumpstart the  industry out of the lingering recession and get it back on the  road to stable growth in and after next year.</p>

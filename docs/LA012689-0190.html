			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEBBLE BEACH NATIONAL PRO-AMATEUR;  </P> <P> STEVE JONES MAY BE WITHOUT HIS GOOD-LUCK CHARM  </P> <P> It would be no surprise if Steve Jones has already made arrangements for his  former golf coach, Mark Simpson, to be with him for the National Pro-Amateur  tournament starting here today.  </P> <P> Simpson, who coached Jones at the University of Colorado, has been a good-luck  charm for his protege.  </P> <P> When Jones won here last year in a playoff with Bob Tway for his first PGA Tour  victory, Simpson was in the gallery.  </P> <P> Simpson also followed Jones around the last 4 holes of the final round of the  Tournament of Champions in La Costa earlier this month. Jones won.  </P> <P> A week later in Palm Desert, Simpson was with Jones for all 5 rounds of the Bob  Hope Classic, which Jones won in a sudden death playoff with Paul Azinger and  Sandy Lyle.  </P> <P> Jones, however, was on his own at the Phoenix Open last week. Simpson stayed  home and Jones, who lives in Phoenix, didn't make the cut.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, by winning the first 2 tour events, Jones matched the  accomplishment of Gil Morgan, who started fast in 1983 with victories in the  Tucson and Los Angeles tournaments.  </P> <P> If Jones doesn't win another tournament the rest of the year, he still won't be  hurting financially. His victories were worth $315,000, or $73,123 more than he  earned in 25 tour events in 1988.  </P> <P> The sudden emergence of the 30-year-old Jones as a factor on the tour could be  linked, Simpson said, to his embracing Christianity.  </P> <P> During his rounds and after his wins at La Costa and Palm Desert, Jones opened  the press conferences with brief statements on his religious beliefs.  </P> <P> "I know a lot of people don't want to hear me talk about my religion," Jones  said after winning the Hope tournament. "But I'm going to keep talking about it  every chance I get.  </P> <P> "I used to be a boozer and I didn't care about anyone else 5 years ago. People  who knew me will tell you that."  </P> <P> Simpson confirmed that Jones was, indeed, difficult to deal with at one time.  </P> <P> "He was a partyer in college and in turmoil with himself," Simpson said. "We  had a lot of heart-to-heart talks. He wasn't easy to get along with."  </P> <P> Simpson recalled that Jones decided in 1984 to change his life style through  religion.  </P> <P> "As I remember it, he was at a tournament in South America with a buddy,"  Simpson said. "They got back to their hotel and were drunk and were messing  around with women.  </P> <P> "Steve said to himself, 'If I'm going to play professional golf, I'm going to  have to get rid of this stuff.' "  </P> <P> Jones later became acquainted with Paul Westphal, the former USC All-American  guard and National Basketball Assn. star of the Phoenix Suns.  </P> <P> "He had already become a Christian by the time I met him," said Westphal, now  an assistant coach with the Suns, who was coaching at Southwestern Bible  College in Phoenix at the time.  </P> <P> "However, I did introduce him to his future wife, Bonnie. She was a cheerleader  at the college and used to baby-sit for my kids.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'Steve, I want you to meet your future wife.' I really didn't  believe it at the time, but it worked out."  </P> <P> Westphal recalls that Jones was enthusiastic about his conversion to  Christianity.  </P> <P> Simpson added: "After about a month, he was really into it, preaching to  everybody and trying to get everybody to convert. It was exciting to him  because he finally had some peace in his life."  </P> <P> Simpson said that he first watched Jones play when Jones tried to qualify for  the U.S. Open in 1976.  </P> <P> "His fundamentals were bad and he shot an 84 on the first day," Simpson said.  "But he came back with a 72 on a really tough course."  </P> <P> Jones was Simpson's first recruit at Colorado in 1977.  </P> <P> "I gave him a full ride and, in college golf, that's almost unheard of,"  Simpson said. "In his last 2 years in college, he was a second-team  All-American. His fundamentals were still bad, but he scored in important  tournaments."  </P> <P> Jones qualified for the PGA Tour in 1982, but had to quit in June of that year  because of an injured left thumb that required surgery.  </P> <P> "That had to be the lowest point of his life because of his dream to be on the  Tour," Simpson said. "He knew his thumb was killing him, but he still got after  it. He shouldn't have been playing at all."  </P> <P> Simpson said there were other low points for Jones, such as finishing 129th and  136th on the money lists in 1985 and 1986, barely missing an exemption priority  of the top 125.  </P> <P> However, he fared better in 1987. He finished 66th in money, earning $154,918.  </P> <P> Last year, he moved up to 45th, earned $241,877, and got his first Tour win  here.  </P> <P> Simpson said that perseverance is one of Jones' main assets.  </P> <P> "He'll never give up until you beat him on the 18th hole," Simpson said. "That  was evident at the Hope tournament. He shot a 76 the first day and he wasn't  feeling good. He told his wife Bonnie that he wanted to win back-to-back  tournaments very badly.  </P> <P> "Then, on the fourth round, he shoots a 63 at Eldorado. He started out the back  nine eagle, birdie, birdie. It was the closest I've ever seen anyone come to  breaking 60."  </P> <P> Jones had another 63 a week ago in the pro-am event preceding the Phoenix Open.  </P> <P> He shot a 68 on the first day of the tournament, but couldn't sustain his drive  in the second round, slumping to a 79.  </P> <P> "I 3-putted the second, third and fourth holes and the air just went out of  me," said Jones, who added that he had had to unplug his phone before the  tournament because of so many requests for interviews. "But I have no excuses,"  Jones said. "I just burned out."  </P> <P> When he was asked if there was a sense of relief that the pressure of his  2-tournament winning streak is now over, Jones smiled and said:  </P> <P> "I would have liked to win 3, 4, 5 or more (in a row)," he said.  </P> <P> To some degree, Jones is a self-taught player.  </P> <P> "He learned to play by reading magazines and then experimenting," Simpson said.  "He had no formal instruction at all when he was young. But he knew he wanted  to play on the tour when he was 12 years old."  </P> <P> Simpson said that he'll most likely miss the tournament here because of his  coaching responsibilities in Boulder.  </P> <P> Jones said he may persuade Simpson to change his mind.  </P> <P> "If I make the cut here, I'm going to call him."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Atypical weather is forecast for the 4-day tournament, meaning no rain and  temperatures in the high 60s, or low 70s. . . . The tournament purse is $1  million, with first place worth $180,000. Three courses, Pebble Beach, Spyglass  Hill and Cypress Point, will be used the first 3 days, with the final round  played at Pebble Beach. . . . Mark Calcavecchia is confident, coming off his  7-stroke victory in the Phoenix Open. "I'm not changing anything in my game  this week," he said. "The main thing probably will be keeping my concentration  because I'm playing so good." Calcavecchia had a 2-stroke lead going into the  final round of the Bob Hope tournament. However, he shot a 72 for a 344,  winding up a stroke behind Steve Jones, Paul Azinger and Sandy Lyle, who were  involved in a playoff. Calcavecchia said he won't play it safe here. "If I'm  standing on 18th tee at Pebble Beach Sunday with a 1-stroke lead, I'll be  swinging a driver." In his last 8 rounds, Calcavecchia has been over 68 just  once.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, who isn't as active on the tour as he once was, is in the field.  "I haven't forgotten how to win," Nicklaus said. "I just don't get into  contention much anymore." Nicklaus, who has been bothered by back problems, is  spurning the option of surgery. "It's like the old joke. If I knew I'd hold up  so long, I would have taken better care of myself." Nicklaus is taking care of  himself here with stretching exercises. . . . The format for the tournament is  for each pro to play with an amateur partner in a foursome through 4 rounds.  Nicklaus is paired with his amateur son, Steve, a former football player at  Florida State. . . . Actor Jack Lemmon is paired with Peter Jacobsen in the  same foursome with his actor son, Chris. Lemmon, who said he has been playing  in this tournament since 1964, is dedicated to making the cut for the first  time. "Twenty-five is the magic number," he said, referring to his years in the  tournament. "The first step is to make the cut, then the next one is to win  it."  </P></p>

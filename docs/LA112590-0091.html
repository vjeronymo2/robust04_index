			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARTS FOR AMATEURS;  </P> <P> WORKSHOP STUDENTS ACT OUT THEIR FEELINGS TO EXPLORE THE REALITY OF AIDS  </P> <P> Tim Miller stretches his students to their limits.  </P> <P> If he isn't having them shake themselves like rag dolls or stretch in odd  contortions, he's having them instantly act out scenes by shouting: "Be a  ballerina while singing Italian opera for 14 seconds," or "Grab someone's head  and shake it gently while telling them what you had for breakfast for eight  seconds."  </P> <P> Then, he has them concentrate their thoughts on the AIDS crisis and asks each  student to pick a spot in a huge warehouse to rehearse and relate personal  stories. The result is an emotional exercise that provokes laughter, tears,  chills and warmth for both the storyteller and the audience.  </P> <P> That's just the first day of class. Miller, 32, an avant-garde performance  artist who has recently been swept into a battle with the National Endowment  for the Arts, is giving free performance workshops through the end of January  at Highways Performance Space in the 18th Street Arts Complex in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "These workshops are to focus on the AIDS and HIV crisis, and they are geared  for a diverse group of people, who are caretakers, friends and people who are  living with it," Miller said. "Our culture squelches people's stories, and I  hope this will help people find material that comes from their lives to use in  their performances."  </P> <P> The workshops are financed by a nine-month, $8,100 grant from the California  Arts Council and $4,500 more from Highways. Miller was one of four performance  artists who was recently denied funding from the National Endowment for the  Arts. The artists filed a lawsuit, claiming discrimination against the  homosexual content of their art. The state grant, however, is not connected to  the NEA funding.  </P> <P> Linda Burnham, manager of the arts complex, said Miller's workshop is "an  exciting new program for us."  </P> <P> Beginning this week, Miller plans a Tuesday evening class specifically for gay  men to work on performance pieces about homophobia, acquired immune deficiency  syndrome issues, activism, relationships and sex.  </P> <P> On Saturdays, two workshops are open to anyone. The Saturday workshops began in  early November and continue through Jan. 26. A "Living/Moving" class in the  mornings is for physical and vocal warm-ups and includes guide-visual imagery.  Miller also encourages people he calls "differently abled" to join in because  the exercises can be done while seated if someone is in a wheelchair.  </P> <P> An afternoon workshop called "Performing All Our Lives" is for people who want  to create their own performance works on how AIDS relates to people's lives.  Miller is also available on Thursdays by appointment for anyone wanting to  polish a performance or brainstorm about ideas for shows.  </P> <P> Miller admitted that he was nervous about his first Saturday class becoming a  bit depressing because of the AIDS focus, but he said it worked because the  students were so different. The class had a good mix of men and women, various  racial and ethnic groups, a young man on crutches and people ranging in age  from their late teens to a man who admitted he "went to high school during the  Eisenhower Administration."  </P> <P> Jordan Peimer, a journalist, said he joined the class "to contribute something  to an issue that has hit us all in some way." On his first day, Peimer herded  the class into a dark, cramped room in the back of the warehouse and told a  gut-wrenching story about a law school friend who died of complications of  AIDS.  </P> <P> Another student in a baseball cap sat on an old dusty couch and talked about  how he explained to his young daughter that he was HIV-positive. "Sometimes I  wish it would all go away, just disappear," he said. "It's been rough, I have  to deal with this without drugs or alcohol."  </P> <P> Standing on top of a brick wall and holding onto a pipe, Merry O'Cleary, a film  location representative and traffic school teacher, spoke softly about a recent  talk with a police officer who found it difficult to pay a hospital visit to  his brother, who has AIDS. "His co-workers were teasing him about it, but he  went," O'Cleary said.  </P> <P> "And for the first time, I saw this hand of authority reaching out to the  community," she said, making a salute with one hand and reaching her hand out  with the other.  </P> <P> As a recovering alcoholic who has met many gay men and women in recovery who  also have AIDS, O'Cleary said she is aware how the disease is devastating the  community. "At this workshop, I can express what is in my heart in an  absolutely supportive environment without judgment," said O'Cleary, who has  spent many years performing. "I have never done an autobiographical piece  before, and now I realize how hard it is."  </P> <P> O'Cleary said she is excited that her class will lead an all-night vigil Dec. 1  for the national "Day Without Art," commemorating art achievements and  recognizing the losses of people who have died of AIDS. One student, Memo  Sander, said the vigil and the workshops will help people begin to create a  separate form of art and culture for gays and lesbians.  </P> <P> "There is so much pain and suppression that myself and my friends are living  through, and Tim channels it and helps us express it, because even though we  may have similar sentiments, we all are different and have different needs of  expression," said Sander, a Turkish-born dancer who wears his hair in a  bowl-shaped tight-cropped cut modeled from the 1919 German Bauhaus art era.  </P> <P> "The AIDS crisis is an issue that is very much ignored in the art world, and  with a workshop like this, that will change," Sander said.  </P> <P>  Tim Miller's four performance workshops meet at Highways Performance Space in  the 18th Street Arts Complex, 1637 18th St., Santa Monica, from noon to 1:30  p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. every Saturday, from 6 to 9 p.m. Tuesdays and by  appointment Thursdays, through Jan. 26. The workshops are free. Call Highways  at (213) 453-1755.  </P> <P> </P></p>

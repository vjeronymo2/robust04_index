			<p>CSO     [Text] The M&amp;C Co. (4-4-63 Miyabara, Yodogawa-ku,  Osaka-shi; president: Y. Shimomoto) has developed and will soon  put on the market a rapid battery recharger that is able to  recharge different types of batteries including open and sealed  type lead batteries in less than one hour (photograph [not  reproduced] shows super high-speed recharger). The device has  made it possible for batteries to be recharged in shorter  periods of time by supplying large amounts of recharge current  intermittently. Demand for the rapid recharging device is  expected in electric vehicles, forklifts, and in certain types  of robots. There are seven types of rechargers corresponding to  several battery voltages ranging from 12V-192V and costing  between &yen;500,000-&yen;5,000,000. It used to take about 10  hours to recharge the 96V-120V batteries used in electric cars,  but now this can be done in less than an hour. When supplying  large current loads during rapid recharging, the terminal  assemblies of the battery tend to become overheated and damaged.  The rapid recharger avoids this by intermittently supplying and  cutting electric current while monitoring the terminal voltages  of the battery. Doing this not only prevents the terminal  assemblies from overheating, but also enables rapid recharging  by breaking down the oxide film on the surface of the electrode  to make the current flow easier. The intermittent charging  periods are automatically calculated by computer.</p>

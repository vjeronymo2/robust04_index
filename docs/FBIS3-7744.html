			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The central council of the Slovak National Party  [SNS], which was holding its meeting in Ruzomberok today, was  setting up a new organizational structure of the party. (Eva  Slavkovska) has been elected first deputy chairwoman, (Juraj  Molnar) has been elected second chairman of the SNS, and (Zuzana  Tvrda) was made central secretary.    Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the party, said that,  after the extraordinary congress [19-20 February] in Zilina,  approximately 10 percent of the over-6,000-strong party left the  SNS with Ludovit Cernak [former SNS chairman].    The immediate objective of the party is to revive the  party's  activity, to start off the work of the new executive, which has  shrunk from 19 to nine members, and to get ready for the setting  up of a preelection coalition. In this respect, Jozef Prokes  said that the SNS would not enter into coalition with the Party  of the Democratic Left, the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement, and Coexistence. He was not able to say yet who would  be the election partner of the SNS. Jozef Prokes went on to say  that parliamentary elections were the fastest and most stable  solution to the current situation. As to the future orientation  of the SNS on the political scene, Jozef Prokes said that the  party wanted to clearly declare its views. He said the party  would be more straightforward than up until now because the past  policy of Ludovit Cernak was not clear, and it could not answer  the question of whether the SNS was in coalition or in  opposition.</p>

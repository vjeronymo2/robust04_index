			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The Council of Agriculture  (COA) on Saturday [25 June] passed a revised draft to allocate  NT$10 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (U.S.$370 million) for a fund  to subsidize local farmers who will be affected by Taiwan's  entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.  The COA had originally allocated only NT44 billion (U.S.$148  million) for the fund.    All farmers will be eligible for the subsidies. The original  draft had stipulated that only farmers who produce certain items  -- citrus fruit, apples, plums, peaches, tea, beef, duck, pork,  and shrimp -- would be elibgible for the subsidiy. A COA  offical said that if the prices of agricultural products fall  due to an influx of foreign products after Taiwan joins GATT,  the COA will evaluate whether Taiwan farmers are being adversely  affected, and subsidize them accordingly if they are.</p>

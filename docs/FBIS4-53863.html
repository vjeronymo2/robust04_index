			<p>CSO     [Text] On 18 May, 25 listed securities firms announced  their earnings reports for the year ending in March 1994. Total  recurring results for all 25 firms came in at a profit of 46.6  billion yen versus a loss of 352.3 billion yen for the year  ending in March 1993. A recurring profit was recorded for the  first time in three years for the group as a whole, and the  number of firms recording profits increased from three to 13. A  recovery in stock prices has led to an increase in brokerage fee  revenues, indicating that overall revenues are recovering. Daiwa  Securities experienced profits from securities trading  activities and growth in investment trust sales fees and  realized recurring profits of 52 billion yen, slightly exceeding  Nomura Securities and ranking as the top performer for the first  time.    Operating revenues, which represent sales in most  businesses,  gained 22 percent for the 25 firms as a group and totaled 1.8928  trillion yen. The daily average volume of stocks traded on the  Tokyo Stock Exchange increased nearly 60 percent to a figure  just below 400 billion yen, leading to an increase in commission  revenues. Other factors contributing to improvement in earnings  included favorable sales of government and industrial bond  investment trusts, expansion of profits from bond trading  activity and the effects of cost savings resulting from  management improvement actions.    Investment trust sales commissions at the four major  securities firms reached 20 billion yen, while Daiwa, Nomura,  and Nikko registered bond trading profits exceeding 30 billion  yen. On the other hand, quasi-major and medium securities firms  experienced a slowing in the profits recovery trend near the end  of the fiscal year because of slow stock trading activity.    Among the 21 quasi-major and smaller firms, nine firms  recorded profits, and New Japan Securities, Wako Securities,  Okasan Securities, and Marusan Securities resumed payment of  dividends. On the other hand, 12 firms continued to record  deficits and cancel dividends. Dai-Ichi Securities and Yamatane  Securities recorded deficits for four straight years.    All firms anticipate stock prices to remain firm in the  fiscal year ending in March 1995 and expect recurring profits  for the year. However, stock trading volume has been slow from  the beginning of the year and the majority of quasi-major and  smaller firms suffered losses according to the monthly earnings  report for April. Now that cost savings from management  improvement actions are nearing their limit and fierce  competition lies ahead with the arrival of city bank securities  subsidiaries, earnings prospects will remain dismal.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Output price figures boost rate cut hope Hopes of further cuts in base rates were revived yesterday by figures showing that inflationary pressures in the UK remain subdued. Output, or factory gate, prices of home sales of manufactured products rose by 3.3 per cent in the 12 months to February compared with an increase of 3.7 per cent in the year to January. Producer price statistics are generally seen as a good indicator of the future path of retail price inflation, and yesterday's figures were better than expected. The Central Statistical Office said output prices rose by an unadjusted 0.1 per cent between January and February compared with a consensus forecast of 0.3 per cent. If the volatile elements of food, drink, tobacco and petroleum are excluded, output prices also rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent between January and February. The annual growth in this measure - seen as an indicator of 'core' inflation  -was only 2.4 per cent, down from 2.6 per cent in January. Furthermore, the core rate appears to be falling. On an annualised basis, prices over the three months to February were only 1.2 per cent higher than in the previous three months. Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said the figures indicated that 'disinflation is very broadly spread across the manufacturing sector as a whole'. He added that the figures represented a 'necessary, but not sufficient condition' for a further interest rate cut, which was likely to be triggered by signs that next month's tax increases were slowing the recovery. The news helped sentiment on the stock market, which was also cheered by news of continuing declines in manufacturers' costs. Input prices - the prices of fuel and raw materials bought by manufacturing industry - rose 0.3 per cent, on a seasonally adjusted basis, between January and February. Over the 12 months to February, input prices fell 3.6 per cent, compared with a 3.3 per cent drop in the year to January; a fall in oil prices has been the main cause of the decline.</p>

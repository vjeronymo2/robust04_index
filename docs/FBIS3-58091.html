			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Trade Minister Bjorn Tore Godal: "Norway and the </F> EU Agreed on High Environmental Standards"]    [Text] In the negotiations for Norwegian membership of the  EU [European Union], one of Norway's main objectives has been to  uphold our standards in the fields of health, safety, and the  environment. At the 21 December ministerial meeting between  Norway and the EU in Brussels, agreement was reached that Norway  may maintain the level of its standards on health, safety, and  the environment in those areas where Norway has stricter rules  than the EU.    Health, safety, and environmental issues are of importance  for many different areas of society. I want to stress that the  technical review prior to the negotiations showed there were  very few cases of differences between Norwegian regulations and  EU regulations, and a very limited number of areas in which it  took time to find satisfactory solutions. In addition, these  are often technically difficult areas where people should  ideally have a good prior knowledge to be able to evaluate the  results.    The negotiations have not covered standards for emissions  from industrial installations, the purification of waste by  local authorities, health and safety in the workplace, and so  on. Here the EU has minimum standards, but member nations are  free to introduce their own stricter standards.    There can be no doubt that the EU is on the right road when  it comes to health, safety, and the environment, even though  things move a little sluggishly at times. The chances that  within the course of a few years the EU will come up to our  standards in those areas where it is currently lagging behind  are great. Nor should we forget that in a few fields the EU is  actually ahead of us. For example, the EEA [European Economic  Area] agreement means that we have to tighten up our standards  or introduce new regulations covering the sulfur content of oil  and rules covering major industrial accidents and emergencies.    Norway has been given confirmation that Norwegian rules  covering asbestos and some other hazardous materials do not  conflict with the EU's regulations, and that we may as a result  retain Norwegian regulations. This also applies to the labeling  of organic solvents, safety information documentation for  chemical substances and preparations, concentration limits for  hazardous preparations -- 5 percent in Norway as against 25  percent in the EU -- PVB [polyvinyl butyral] and PCT (hazardous  chemicals).    The most difficult areas in the negotiations have been areas  relating to chemicals where the difference between EU and  Norwegian legislation is greatest because of different  approaches. The differences have chiefly been linked to:    -- the system of classifying and labeling carcinogenic  substances,    -- the system of classifying and labeling allergenic  substances,    -- methods of testing the amounts of allergenic substances  contained in preparations, and    -- Norwegian regulations covering the heavy metal content of  batteries.    In the negotiations Norway won a transitional period of four  years. In this transitional period, there will be comprehensive  cooperation with the aim of arriving at satisfactory solutions.  The objective is to arrive at common EU rules which satisfy  Norway's demands. Environmental issues are high on the EU's  agenda. As a consequence of Swedish, Finnish, Austrian, and  Norwegian membership, environmental issues will be given an even  higher priority.    If the EU has not come up to Norwegian standards in the  transitional period, Norway is expecting that the transitional  period can be extended. Norway is involved in determining the  premises for the work in the transitional period. Work will be  continuous throughout the period. If the work is not completed  by the end of the transitional period, it would therefore be  natural to extend the transitional period until a satisfactory  result has been achieved.    If it proves impossible to achieve a satisfactory result,  the  EU's regulations allow member countries to uphold their high  standards as long as real health, safety, and environmental  considerations form the basis for upholding and further  developing these standards.    However, the condition is that there can be no suggestion  that health, safety, and environmental considerations are being  used as as a smokescreen for a country's desire to protect its  own industry. Norwegian demands in this field are based on  specialist and scientific evaluations and are therefore clearly  justified for health, safety, and environmental reasons.    I am wholly confident that on this foundation Norway will be  able to uphold its regulations in the health, safety, and  environmental fields even after membership of the EU.</p>

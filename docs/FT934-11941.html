			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (11): Latin America's success story - Emerging markets / Bonds LOW INTEREST rates have left investors starved of high-yielding investments, and forced them to look at new ways of enhancing their returns. With bond yields falling to historically low levels, emerging bond markets are an attractive option for two reasons: they offer higher margins over treasuries, because of their weaker credit ratings; but they also offer the possibility of capital gains, as developing economies advance rapidly and investor perception evolves. The great success story of the decade so far has been Latin American bonds. Yearly issuance in Latin American Eurobonds has risen from just over Dollars 1bn in 1990 to Dollars 8.6bn in 1992 and is already around Dollars 11bn for the first eight months of 1993. 'On the supply side, the continuing absence of well-developed local capital markets forced issuers to look abroad for medium- to long-term funds. On the demand side, yields on long-term bonds of G7 countries were falling on the order of 100 to 200 basis points a year from 1991, prompting private and institutional investors to search elsewhere to enhance returns on global diversified portfolios,' according to Mr Edward Bartholomew, of J P Morgan's emerging markets research group. In the wake of the debt crisis in the 1980s, when many Latin American countries defaulted on their commercial bank loans, the secondary market in their debt grew as a result of trading by banks, largely creditor banks trying to lay off or manage their risk. When Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers returned to the Eurobond market a few years ago, these high-yielding bonds were initially bought mainly by retail investors in Europe or by Latin American nationals, with so-called flight capital outside the region. But the market's strong performance attracted new investors, first in the form of specialist country funds and then a broader range of institutional investors. The surge of international interest in Latin America helped the market in secondary debt and the bond market to mature rapidly. The market in secondary bank loans has now been virtually replaced by a market in Brady bonds, the restructured bank debt created under the Brady debt reduction plan. Venezuela, Mexico and Argentina have already implemented their Brady plans, and Brazil is poised to do so. A range of government-backed institutions, companies and banks from these countries are now viewed as acceptable credits and have seen their spreads tighten. Mexico has for some time been trading at a 200-250 basis point margin over US Treasuries in the Eurobond market. The potential for large gains on the back of credit improvement in the more developed Latin American countries has therefore been reduced, and the adventurous fund manager is veering off the beaten track. 'Everyone is looking for the next big opportunity,' said one trader. Smaller Latin American countries, eastern Europe and Asia are the key areas of interest. 'The LDC debt market relies on the improvement in economic management,' said Mr Mark Evans of ING Bank, 'and that process is clearly under way in eastern Europe.' Trading volume in eastern European debt has surged this year as the market rallied. Poland's commercial bank debt has been actively traded for a number of years, but Russia and Bulgaria defaulted on their debt more recently. Continental Bank estimates that trading volume in Russian debt will have grown from around Dollars 800m in 1992 to between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn in 1993, while annual volume in Polish debt is around USDollars 15bn. The scope of the market's investor base is also growing rapidly. 'The market has broadened from hedge funds and specialist LDC boutiques to portfolio managers, and, particularly in the last six months, to investors in North and Central America,' said Mr Igor Sitnin of Continental Bank. Investors are also turning their attention to south-east Asian countries, although spreads in this region are moderate, comparable with the more developed Latin American markets, as a result of their generally strong economic growth. The Philippines returned to the international capital markets early this year, having completed the restructuring of its commercial bank debt under the Brady plan last December. It was followed by a number of Filipino borrowers, including Philippine Airlines (PAL) and the Philippine National Oil Company. China also returned to the market this year with a Y30bn Eurobond, its first since 1987. Other Chinese borrowers, such as Citic, had already tapped the market. However, China has a relatively strong credit rating and so does not offer the high yields available in other markets (although many investors believe that it does offer potentially strong spread performance). Meanwhile, in the more mature markets, such as Mexico, a broader range of companies are now able to tap the market. Those lower down the credit spectrum prepared to pay higher spreads have become more attractive. For example, Swiss Bank Corporation recently completed a Dollars 75m five-year issue for Mexico's Axa, a privately-held cable and power transmission company, which was priced to yield 375 basis points above the comparable US Treasury. 'Mid-market companies are now able to tap the market,' said Mr Miles Protter, an SBC director. The emerging markets are evolving swiftly, and parts of them are already institutional markets. The Latin American retail investors who helped get the market going have in many cases moved their money - and their profits - elsewhere, often to their domestic stock markets. Meanwhile, banks and fund managers are rushing to create their own specialist emerging market funds. Many of them will be too late to catch the first few waves of the rally, but with government bond yields at low levels, they may now be willing to settle for enhancing yields.</p>

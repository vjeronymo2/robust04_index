			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Calcutta, December 20--The CPM [Communist Party of  India-Marxist], at its three-day central committee meeting, is  working on the details of distancing itself from the motely  National Front.    Tired of its image of being tagged on to miscellaneous  political alliances that have failed to yield electoral  advantage, the party is finalising a high-profile programme of  independent mass mobilisation.    According to sources, the CPM foresees that there will be a  great churning of political forces in the country in the near  future, as the most backward sections struggle to emerge on the  forefront of politics.    The emergence of the Dalits organised under the Bahujan  Samaj  Party has been an eye-opener for the CPM. Hence the party will  continue to pursue political alliances whenever and wherever  necessary, based on specific issues, but will not endure any  more its role of being a "shrinking tail."    The CPM will launch a large-scale countrywide mass programme  to educate the people about the perils of the new economic  policy and the changing social realities.    CPM leaders said that circumstances and the Congress had  kept  the attention of the opposition focused on the problems of  communalism, national unity and integrity, and stability, while  pushing through the economic reforms package.    While the economic liberalisation programme could not be  reversed and in states like West Bengal where the CPM was in  power, the administration had no option but to enter into the  spirit of the competitive era, the effort of the CPM would be to  increase awareness among the people on the disastrous impact of  the new economic policy. The struggle to fight the worst  fallouts of the new economic programme would be taken up at the  state and national levels, CPM sources said.    The central committee meeting, after analysing the results  of  the elections in the five northern states, concluded that caste  politics was bound to dominate the scene in the near future. The  emergence of the Dalits as a political entity under the Bahujan  Samaj Party was watershed in Indian politics.    The committee saw that the alliance of the Dalits and the  minorities was not a conscious, deliberate, calculated political  move, but was the reflection of a growing awareness and  empowerment among the weakest and most oppressed sections.    In the near future what was likely to happen was increased  conflict and violence within the same caste groups between those  who suffered from a sense of being oppressed against those who  were identified as the oppressors, the CPM's leadership  anticipated.    Chalking out a political agenda that can encompass the  multitude of problems the CPM faces in its struggle to revive  its languishing political fate is growing to be a difficult and  complex task for the central committee. The party is adopting an  attitude of playing it by the ear, of evolving its tactics as  its mass contact programmes get underway, to give it the kind of  flexibility it needs to trace a path through the confusing  political and economic scenario.</p>

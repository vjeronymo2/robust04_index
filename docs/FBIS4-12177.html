			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Coordination and Consultation  Summit", AL-THAWRAH writes: Inter-Arab coordination and  national and pan-Arab parameters are cornerstones of Syria's  policies. It has thus managed to scotch Israel's circuitous  tactics and deny it the opportunity to take on the Arab  countries one at a time. Syria is universally acknowledged to  be pursuing sound policies. Syria's key role and objective  outlook in peacemaking have been equally recognized.    Israel's intransigence, the paper emphasizes, remains the  real obstacle to the peace process. Unilateral deals have been  shown to be unworkable. Arab coordination and consultations,  AL-THAWRAH adds, are crucial to a successful common approach to  Israel's attempts at dividing Arab ranks and deflecting the  peace process from its set objective; namely a fair and  comprehensive peace -- the peace of the brave, to quote  President al-Asad at the Geneva summit.    Coordination and consultations between Syria and Egypt about  the peace process and how to counter Israel's  less-than-straightforward ways will go a long way toward forging  a united stand as the Arabs wage the battle for peace. Only by  adherence to national and pan-Arab parameters will it be  possible to establish a fair and comprehensive peace and regain  all the occupied land, free of any Jewish settlements, concludes  AL-THAWRAH.</p>

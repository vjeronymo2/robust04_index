			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Merchant banks are given warning on advice risks The Bank of England has warned merchant banks of the growing risks of being sued or suffering damage to their reputation as a result of advising companies on mergers and acquisitions and restructurings, it emerged yesterday. The Bank disclosed that its supervisors had discussed risks with merchant banks after cases such as Samuel Montagu being ordered to pay Pounds 172m to the creditors of the collapsed financial group British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings. It disclosed the action in its 1993-94 banking act report, which said the role of merchant banks in takeovers, new issues and corporate restructurings 'makes them especially vulnerable to litigation and loss of reputation'. Supervisors are thought to have questioned merchant banks over whether they are charging appropriately for the risk of losing reputation, even in cases where they are publicly criticised rather than being sued for damages. The Bank also disclosed that 170 cases of suspected fraud in banks had been referred to its new special investigations unit, established following the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International to prevent similar incidents. It said half of these cases had required 'further action' by the unit, although in some instances this was simply advice. There were three cases of formal investigation under section 41 of the Banking Act, but none led to prosecutions. The Bank's report and accounts, released separately, showed that it has released Pounds 10m of the Pounds 90m provision made last year against losses in the 'lifeboat' operation to keep four small financial institutions afloat in 1991. It said it had reduced estimated losses by taking over the financing of credit provided to the institution which required the 'major part of the provision' - thought to be National Mortgage Bank, a subsidiary of National Home Loans. The release of the provision helped the Bank's banking department record a pre-tax profit of Pounds 120.2m, compared with Pounds 88m in 1992-93. It made a dividend payment of Pounds 48.4m to the Treasury, against Pounds 38.1m the previous year. The banking act report said that the financial pressures on smaller UK banks have eased because of greater stability in wholesale funding markets, the lower level of short-term interest rates and the end of falling property prices. However, it said there was a net loss of 11 small UK banks during the year. Some had surrendered licences because of an inability to raise adequate funding. The Deposit Protection Board reported that in the year to February 28 1994 it had an outstanding liability to depositors of Pounds 25m. Net liabilities of Pounds 19.5m at the end of the year have been reduced to Pounds 6.8m by subsequent recoveries.</p>

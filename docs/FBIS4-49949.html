			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, in Jiangsu Province, recently adopted a  series of new measures allowing foreign entrepreneurs to  contract large and medium-sized loss-making state-owned  enterprises.    It was learned that three large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises based in Nanjing, each having assets valued over 40  million yuan, already had been contracted by Hong Kong and Thai  entrepreneurs.    The foreign-contracted enterprises are allowed to employ  advanced foreign management measures; institute advanced foreign  operational mechanisms; and enjoy full decision-making powers in  terms of production, supply and marketing, personnel, finance,  management, operation, and so on, on the premise of assuming  full responsibility for the wages of staff and workers, for  production and operational expenses and funds, for state taxes,  for contracted minimum profits, as well as for profits turned  over to the authorities at a yearly incremental rate. The  foreign-contracted enterprises are free to retain surplus  profits after turning over the minimum profits to the state in  accordance with the contracts.</p>

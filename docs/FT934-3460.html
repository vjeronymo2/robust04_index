			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Foreign operations increase Deutsche Bank profits 11% Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest private sector bank, yesterday reported an 11 per cent increase in operating profits to DM4.2bn (Dollars 2.48bn) in the first 10 months of 1993. The rise, however, came exclusively from foreign operations, according to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman, who said the German recession had caught up with the country's banks and that its effects would continue to be felt next year. Earnings at Deutsche's German-based parent company fell 9 per cent to DM2.36bn, largely as a result of record group-wide risk provisions of almost DM2.5bn, up 54 per cent on last year. Some 90 per cent of the provisions, which Mr Kopper expected to rise to almost DM3bn for the full year, were to cover risks within Germany. The cyclical and structural crisis had made a serious impact on the creditworthiness and income of Deutsche's domestic customers, Mr Kopper warned. 'As the house bank to thousands of small and medium-sized companies, we are feeling the effects of this,' he said. The bottom of the industrial recession had been reached, he added, 'but the bad news is that we will stay quite a while at this low point'. Deutsche holds 10 per cent or more of the equity of 25 leading non-banking companies, worth almost DM24bn, according to details released for the first time yesterday. These holdings include 10.65 per cent in Metallgesellschaft, the metals, mining and engineering group, which this week negotiated new credit lines with Deutsche and Dresdner Bank to help it meet margin requirements for hedge positions in oil future contracts taken out by a US subsidiary. Mr Kopper said Deutsche stood by Metallgesellschaft and saw its difficulties as a technical, short-term liquidity issue and not a matter of survival. In a robust rejection of media criticism of German banks' continuing healthy earnings growth while industry suffered, Mr Kop-per said profits were needed as capital to fund industry and job creation. 'I am always expecting congratulatory letters, but they never arrive,' he protested. Noting that a 20 per cent net return on equity was not unusual in the US, he said German banks were relatively 'under-developed', doing well to achieve 12.5 per cent. Detailing the results, which were compared as usual in Germany with ten-twelfths of the full 1992 results, he said foreign operations' earnings rose 40 per cent, with especially strong contributions from Luxembourg, Italy, and Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant banking business. Foreign branches and subsidiaries also contributed more than half the 7 per cent rise to DM9.7bn in net interest earnings.</p>

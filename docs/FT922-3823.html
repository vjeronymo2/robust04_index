			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Tenders to run council housing HOUSING associations and private-sector companies are to be invited to tender for the management of 4m council homes under plans announced yesterday by Sir George Young, the housing minister. Launching a green paper setting out the government's proposals, Sir George told a London conference on housing management that the extension of contracting-out to council housing would help tenants getting a bad deal. He said: 'There are too many estates where management breakdown is evident, with empty properties boarded up for long periods or taken over by squatters.' Compulsory competitive tendering would encourage decentralisation and tenant involvement in management, the minister said. The plans were attacked by Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local-government spokesman, as 'pure party-political dogma'. He said tenants would suffer while some private companies made 'a killing'. The government published a report on the scope for competitive tendering in housing management, commissioned from consultants last year. It said that competition would improve efficiency by focusing on cost accounting and quality assessment. The consultants recommended, however, that tendering for housing management should be introduced gradually, to allow councils to develop the necessary systems. Competing for quality in housing.

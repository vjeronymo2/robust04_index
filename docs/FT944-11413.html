			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Shokhin duties handed to fellow reformer President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister and economics minister, as the shake-up in the government continued over the weekend. Most of the departing minister's responsibilities were given to another reformer, Mr Anatoly Chubais, who was promoted to first deputy prime minister from his present post of deputy premier in charge of privatisation. At the same time Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, named as chief negotiator on debt rescheduling Mr Oleg Davydov, the trade minister, who caused concern earlier this year by suggesting that Russia should not pay back its debt. Mr Chernomyrdin acknowledged that Mr Davydov would take some time to familiarise himself with the debt talks, which depend heavily on whether Russia succeeds in making an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. However, he said 'Oleg Davydov is a properly qualified' person. Mr Shokhin had offered his resignation on Friday, after unsuccessfully demanding that he be consulted on naming a new finance minister, and warning that 'the economy is now hostage to politics'. His comments came as a struggle over policy continued between Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Yeltsin. Mr Chubais, 39, has headed Russia's programme to privatise state-run businesses since 1991, which is at the centre of the nation's transition to a free-market economy. As to being one of the last radical reformers left from the team that crafted Russia's basic reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said 'Russia has an all-reformers government'. The new finance minister, Mr Vladimir Panskov, a former official in the president's department of budget policy, was quoted as saying that 'there is still a lot of work to be done' on the 1995 budget. His words left open the possibility of changes in the budget, supposed to reduce monthly inflation to 1 per cent with the aid of substantial borrowing from the International Monetary Fund. Mr Chubais added to the confusion by saying that the cabinet reshuffles 'will certainly not lead to changes in the course of reform the government has been following'. Mr Chubais said he would take charge of the economy and finance portfolios, making him Mr Panskov's direct boss. Mr Yeltsin added further to contradictory messages when a close aide said the president was 'seriously concerned over the work of the government', while saying there was no division between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin, and that the president intended to 'push reforms quickly and effectively'. Mr Shokhin has been working on a concept of debt repayment which would be linked to the provision of external assistance and to the growth of the economy.</p>

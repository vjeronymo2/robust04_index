			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: City overflowing with art - Patricia Morison gets to know Rubens and his compatriots better THERE are sadly limited folk for whom true beauty exists only in the piazzas of cities beyond the Alps. But if your senses respond to the north, then Antwerp is without question one of the most beautiful cities of northern Europe. This great maritime city on the Scheldt has its sombre side, its rotting Renaissance facades and defaced Baroque Calvaries. Nonetheless, to my mind Victor Hugo's judgment is spot on; 'The city is delightful: paintings in the churches, sculpture adorning the houses, Rubens in the chapels . . . the city is literally overflowing with art.' In Hugo's day, Antwerp's dozen or so museums did not exist. Nor, of course, did the city's newly restored Central Station and any number of extraordinary late-19th and early 20th-century architectural extravaganzas. Now there is Antwerp 93, and a notable group of exhibitions which will ensure that the art-lover will indeed find this a city overflowing with pleasures. Perhaps the key fact of Antwerp's history is that as capital of the Spanish Netherlands, it was held for Catholicism. Any visit should therefore start at Onze Lieve Vrouwe, the largest Gothic cathedral in the Low Countries. It has been under restoration for decades, but Antwerp 93 speeded the programme up. The entire interior is again visible, with Rubens's three wonderful altarpieces, cleaned and conserved, displayed at the east end. From May 26 to October 3, the cathedral has an exhibition, Antwerp Altarpieces, the type of 15th- and 16th-century pieces shipped out in staggering quantities for churches from England to South America. Any civilised visit to Antwerp must be partly about getting to know Rubens better. An unusual exhibition at the Rubenshuis will shed light on the running of the many highly successful artists' 'factories' of the day. Rubens Cantoor (which means 'workroom') shows 80 copies of drawings by Rubens loaned from Copenhagen. Most were made by Willem Panneels, who was put in charge of the studio between 1628 and 1630 while the master was in England and Spain (May 15 to June 27). So intimate is the view of the artist conveyed by the famous Rubenshuis that you will surely want to round things off with a visit to the Rockoxhuis, the sumptuous Renaissance mansion which was home to Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox, Rubens's friend and patron. And of course, a pilgrimage is required to St Jacobskerk. Above the wonderfully elegant tomb of the lord of Steen is his last masterpiece, The Madonna with Saints. Jacob Jordaens at the Museum of Fine Arts (27 March-27 June 27) is the flagship exhibition of Antwerpen 93, celebrating 400 years since the artist's birth. When gout carried Rubens off in 1640, Jordaens immediately put up his prices. Over the next four decades of this artist's long career, the Jordaens studio continued to be hugely successful even though its master's talent declined as Rubens's never had. This should be the year and the show to reevaluate Jordaens's achievement. Antwerp: Story of a Metropolis at the Hessenhuis is a major exhibition mounted by historian Jan van Stock to examine the image and the reality of Antwerp's two first Golden Ages, in the 16th century and again in the early 17th century. Pride of the city throughout that period was the famous printing dynasty of the Plantins. It is not only bibliophiles who find the Museum Plantin-Moretus a place of rare fascination. So long as you are prepared to peer, books, prints, letters and bills bring the political and intellectual world of these centuries vividly to life. Here, too, are portraits by Rubens, an intimate friend of the great Balthasar Moretus. The Plantin-Moretus marks Antwerpen 93 by looking at the scientific side of the humanist culture so important to Rubens and his circle. Botany in the Southern Netherlands (13 March-June 13) comemmorates the studies of the three great Flemish botanists, Dodoens, Clusius and Lobelius, whose illustrated treatises were all published by the Moretus presses. Although its role in the Festival programme is small, the Museum Mayer van den Bergh cannot be missed, for it is one of the most remarkable 19th-century museums in the world. Mayer Van den Bergh was a wealthy connoisseur and art-collector. He never married - the story goes that he was always looking for a girl with the face of a late-Gothic Virgin Mary. Van den Bergh died in his early thirties. In 1904, his mother built the exquisite neo-Renaissance mansion with its intimate rooms. Original cases still house manuscripts, Byzantine and early medieval ivories, 12th-century sculpture, coins and a fine collection of Nethelandish and Flemish paintings. Few art-lovers realise that Breughel's chilling 'Dulle Griet' is hidden away in the Mayer van den Bergh with his 'Twelve Proverbs', two of only seven of the artist's works remaining in Belgium. Diamonds enter the festival in Diamond Jewellery from Antwerp's Golden Age (April 23-September 26). At the city's distinguished Ethnographic Museum, there will be The Face of the Spirits: Masks from Zaire (September 19-December 31). The contemporary art programme has not been finalised but summer will see openings at the Middelheim Open-air Sculpture Museum, the Museum for Fine Arts, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. A marvellous guide-book for exploring Antwerp is Derek Blyth's Flemish Cities Explored (Bodley Head, 1990). It would be nice if in Antwerp's great year of culture, every one of the chapels, mansions and gardens therein recommended might indeed be accessible.

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo rebounds by 1.7 per cent on bargain hunting Strong resistance to any further appreciation in the yen against the US dollar encouraged investors, and the Nikkei 225 average rebounded by 1.7 per cent on bargain hunting and arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained 338.27 at 20,639.23 after an opening low of 20,356.27 and a day's high of 20,732.55 in the after-noon on heavy index-linked buying from newly established investment trusts, and purchases from domestic financial institutions. A recovery in high-technology issues, which had been severely upset by the strength in the yen, also supported equities. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 22.46 to 1,672.24, while the Nikkei 300 put on 3.77 at 304.00. Advances led declines by 953 to 115, with 112 issues unchanged. Volume totalled 380m shares, against 362m. Some domestic investors remained cautious over the currency movements, although domestic institutions and investment trusts supported activity. In London, later, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index moved up 2.73 to 1,361.35. Traders said share prices were underpinned by buying orders below the Nikkei 20,000 mark. Domestic institutions, including life insurers, have indicated that they would be buyers if the index fell through that level. Reports of rapid growth on next-generation portable telephone systems spurred activity in high technology-linked shares. Ushio climbed Y60 to Y1,100 and DDI, a long distance telephone operator, jumped Y500,000 to Y9.2m, the highest level since its listing in September last year. Other high-technology recoveries included Fujitsu, which improved Y20 to Y1,100, and Oki Electric, Y26 better at Y786. Large-capital stocks, which also suffered selling on Monday, were firmer. Nippon Steel rose Y2 to Y353 and Mitsubishi Heavy Y3 to Y790. Banks rose on arbitrage linked buying. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank moved ahead Y40 to Y2,000 and Bank of Tokyo added Y50 at Y1,600. Brokers were also stronger, with Nomura Securities up Y20 to Y2,430. Hitachi slipped Y10 to Y1,020 on profit-taking, while Honda Motor also drew selling, losing Y20 at Y1,820. Mining shares, which were purchased actively last week on higher commodity prices, lost ground on profit-taking. Mitsubishi Materials eased Y1 to Y563 and Sumitomo Metal Mining dipped Y8 to Y977. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 328.39 to 23,102.95 in volume of 13.8m shares. Kyocera, the semiconductor packaging maker and a leading shareholder of DDI, strengthened Y220 to Y7,250. Roundup The Pacific Rim was mixed, with worries about the outlook for US interest rates and the currency proving an inhibition. HONG KONG regained a measure of confidence, although turnover dipped to HKDollars 2.6bn from Monday's HKDollars 2.9bn. The Hang Seng index finished 29.01 higher at 8,673.49, but well off the day's best of 8,777.58. Finance issues were mixed. HSBC Holdings gained HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 83 while Hang Seng Bank shed 50 cents to HKDollars 49. Property shares continued to ease, still hurt by worries that their earnings would be eroded by government moves to curb the soaring residential property market. New World Development declined 20 cents to HKDollars 21.30 and Hongkong Land 30 cents to HKDollars 19.20. SYDNEY recovered some of Monday's loss, although brokers reported that the market lacked direction. The All Ordinaries index put on 17.00 at 1,974.4, having moved between a session's high of 1,981.4 and low of 1,956.7. Turnover came to ADollars 587.5m. Among the blue chips, News Corp rose 16 cents to ADollars 8.44 and CRA gained 12 cents at ADollars 18.08. BHP firmed 6 cents to ADollars 18.22. Foster's Brewing, up 1 cent at ADollars 1.01, topped volume in the industrial sector with 8.45m shares changing hands. SINGAPORE closed higher after bargain hunters targeted selective index stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 18.89 to 2,227.60. The rise in the key index was mainly due to Keppel and Singapore Press Holdings, up 30 cents apiece to SDollars 10.60 and SDollars 15.40 respectively. KUALA LUMPUR posted small gains at the close, although trading was restrained by worries about the outlook for US interest rates. The composite index edged forward 3.40 to 1,006.92. BANGKOK registered its seventh consecutive loss as afternoon profit-taking wiped out gains seen earlier in the day. The SET index slipped 1.88 to 1,252.93 in thin turnover of Bt3.8bn. SEOUL turned lower as news of a possible summit between two Koreas failed to maintain its impact. The composite index was off 7.43 points at 923.61 after an intraday high of 939.17. Posco, the steelmaker, went the day's limit up, rising Won2,000 to Won65,000 after a report that the chairman had asked institutions to boost its price to Won100,000 before its share listing in New York. BOMBAY ended higher, although profit-taking, particularly in Tata Iron &amp; Steel, eroded sharp gains seen at midsession. The BSE 30-share index closed 37.43 up at 4,211.83 after touching 4,228.70. In KARACHI, the KSE 100-share index eased 1.52 to 2,350.60. Trading was disrupted towards the close as many agents stopped work to check reports of a fatality during a protest in a local community. TAIPEI lost some of its early gains on late profit-taking, leaving the weighted index up 7.61 at 5,874.56. Turnover contracted to TDollars 41.48bn from Monday's TDollars 46.57bn. Selected industrials saw some buying interest, the most active being China Petrochemical, up 90 cents at TDollars 28.50. MANILA failed to sustain an initial rise and the composite index finished 8.73 down on balance at 2,740.72. Turnover increased to 624.7m pesos from Monday's 574.9m. One exception to the weaker mood was San Miguel 'B', which firmed 1 peso to 133 pesos. WELLINGTON regained some firmness, the NZSE-40 capital index putting on 17.81 at 1,979.11, but after a high for the session of 2,017.82. Turnover expanded to NZDollars 40m.</p>

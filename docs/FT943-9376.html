			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cathay Pacific ahead but holds payout Cathay Pacific Airways, Swire Pacific's Hong Kong-based international airline, yesterday reported first-half 1994 earnings of HKDollars 803m (USDollars 104m), up 18 per cent from the HKDollars 681m reported for the same period last year. However, the dividend is being held at 10.5 cents. The results, which come after a 23.8 per cent drop in profits in calendar 1993 and a flat 1.9 per cent growth in 1992, were lower than the market had been expecting and reflected continuing difficulties in the airline industry, Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said. Business to Europe remained weak, as did the Hong Kong market. 'The boycott of tours to China by Taiwan travel agents (prompted by the murder of Taiwanese tourists at a Chinese beauty spot) reduced passenger numbers in one of our most important markets in the second quarter and led us to suspend nearly 100 round-trip flights between Hong Kong and Taiwan,' Mr Sutch said. 'Downward pressure on yields and overcapacity in the air transport industry generally, compounded by high inflation in Hong Kong, continues and shows no sign of ending soon,' he said. Cathay Pacific is tackling these areas by increasing its focus on customer needs and identifying means of improving productivity. Earlier this week pilots agreed to sign new contracts increasing their working hours, and senior and middle management structures have been streamlined. Staff numbers overall have swollen by 543 people year-on-year. Earnings per share rose in line with overall profits, to 28 cents for the interim, compared with 23.8 cents in the same period last year. Revenues on passengers and excess baggage rose 12.5 per cent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, although yields slipped 1.9 per cent. The number of passengers carried increased 12.9 per cent to 4.6m. Analysts said May and April yielded disappointingly low traffic, especially in the light of a big jump in Japanese arrivals to the colony. Net finance charges increased by HKDollars 139m year-on-year; however, the drop in interest earnings from managed funds more than offset the decrease in interest charges. Mr Sutch said the group traditionally enjoyed a better second half, and expected this to remain true for 1994.</p>

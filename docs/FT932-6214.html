			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Brent council rates lowest in service study THE Conservative-controlled London borough of Brent provides council tax-payers with the worst level of customer service in the UK, a survey published yesterday shows. BEM Research, a market research company, produced the study by asking 'mystery callers' to contact each local authority in the UK, asking the same questions about council tax each time. In Brent, they found a two-hour queue of 170 people, while telephone inquiries were put on hold for 10 minutes then cut off. In Labour-controlled Waltham Forest, which finished 413th out of 414 in the survey, a caller was told: 'We do not deal with any inquiries on Tuesday. We close to catch up with our paperwork.' Problems with computer systems were seen as the main difficulty for poor performers, followed by inadequately prepared staff. Top performers were Labour-controlled Wolverhampton, followed by South Somerset (Liberal Democrat) and Amber Valley (Labour). Following them were Ashfield (Labour), the Western Isles (Independent), Gravesham (Split) and Sunderland (Labour). Only 24 authorities scored below 60 per cent on the overall performance rating used, but many staff were unable to answer basic queries. For example, nearly one fifth of authorities were unable to say how much a caller was paying in council tax, and 86 authorities could not explain transitional relief. Local authorities are also preparing to start action against people who do not pay their tax. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation will next week hold meeting of more than 300 revenue officers to discuss how best this can be done. It also intends to continue collecting last year's poll tax, 25 per cent of which remains unpaid in inner London. Mr Nick Baker, of the IRRV, said: 'Unlike the poll tax there is provision for those who cannot afford to pay and so there is no excuse for nonpayment.' Enforcing the council tax will be much easier than collecting the poll tax, according to the IRRV.</p>

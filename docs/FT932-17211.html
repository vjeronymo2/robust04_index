			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (2): 'Hope in the economy rekindled' - An IMF agreement which paves the way to debt relief is within reach, says Chief Shonekan / Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of Nigeria's federal government and chairman of the transitional council, answers questions put by Michael Holman, Africa Editor What are your main objectives in the six months ahead? The transitional council has a short-term tenure and it must be properly focused to make a positive impact. Our overall goal is to lay a solid economic policy foundation for the next government. Specific objectives are to re-align government spending with revenue profile; reduce deficit financing by curtailing extra-budgetary expenditure; continue with reform measures where necessary; introduce appropriate pricing of fertiliser and petroleum products; promote accountability and transparency in the management of public finance and strive to leave the quality of governance better than we met it. Can you reach agreement with the IMF in the time available? And if you do, would you draw on the IMF facility? Yes, I believe we can reach an agreement with the IMF and our creditors. I wish to emphasise this time around we are interested in a medium-term agreement as opposed to the short-term agreements of the past. The advantages are quite obvious. The IMF and the World Bank are closely following our efforts in redirecting the focus of macro-economic management. We are all agreed on the necessary actions to be taken and I know that they appreciate the problems we confront in pushing through reforms at home. I expect that they will show understanding in the next round of negotiations. Our government policy on a draw-down from stand-by facility has been consistent and 1 see no reason why this should change now. However, I am made to believe that agreement of a medium-term strategy can enable us to access the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility and this will be considered on its own merits at the appropriate time. It seems unlikely you will win debt relief in the time available: what impact will this have, politically and economically? I do not share your view that we will not be granted debt relief before we quit the stage. The signals our antennae has been picking up are quite encouraging. My reading of the attitude of our creditors towards our government since we joined is that of an increasing appreciation of the need for us to have substantial debt relief if we were to succeed in our efforts at reform. My recent visit to Prime Minister Major was a case in point. There is increasing goodwill and international backing for our transitional council. There is also an understanding of the problems we confront. The debt burden is choking us. Over 50 per cent of the 1993 budget estimate goes for debt settlement. Try as we might, there can be no success in stabilising the economy unless the debt conundrum is resolved. I am happy our sovereign creditors realise this point and I am hopeful of a major breakthrough in this connection before our tenure ends. How can you ensure your reform programme is pursued by the new administration; can you bind them to an IMF deal? The straightforward answer is that we can neither force the incoming administration to adopt our reform programme nor can we bind them to an IMF deal. No incumbent government can impose its policies on future administrations. Nonetheless, if we introduce policies and programmes that are well thought out and in the best interest of our nation, it should not be difficult for the incoming government to adopt them. This is a major reason we have adopted the central policy of accountability and transparency. At the end of the day, our honesty of purpose and transparent management will enable the incoming administration to see the merits of our policies. I have no doubt future governments will award us a pass mark. Will the government allow distressed banks to continue operating? Is not a shake-out of the banking sector overdue? The government is looking closely at the thorny issue of distressed banks and a decision will be taken after a thorough analysis. It will be recalled the liberalisation and deregulation of the whole financial sector has been a major achievement of the structural adjustment programme. The banking sector in particular has witnessed changes of major proportions. The number of banks, for instance, more than doubled within two years, creating enormous problems of supervision and regulation. To ensure a sound banking supervision, the government created the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Coloration (NDIC) and I am happy that as a result, banking practices are being modernised and rationalised. However, it is taking the system time to properly digest the rapid changes. In a deregulated economy, banking reforms and shake-out ought to be a continuous exercise to have sanity in the industry. Even then, caution must be exercised because of the pivotal position of banks in the whole economy. By how much do you expect to increase the price of petrol? We are in the process of creating a conducive environment for the adjustment of petroleum products prices. There has been a public debate over this matter in our country for many years. It has now become an emotive issue of wide concern. Regrettably, the debate is befuddled by misconceptions about the utilisation of revenue to be generated. Very few people question the economic logic of our decision, but citizens want to be assured the gains will be judiciously managed to alleviate social hardship. We are now addressing their misgivings seriously and I am quite confident that we shall succeed. I cannot say precisely now by how much and when the fuel price adjustment will be. Do you need the revenue from a price increase to meet the budget deficit targets? True enough, the exercise will yield fresh revenue. However, this year's budget did not include anticipated revenue from adjustment of the fuel price. With the prudent fiscal management we have already adopted, we will meet our budget deficit targets anyway. What are your views on the proposal that part of NNPC assets be privatised? The petroleum industry remains the veritable success story in our economy and as such we must ensure that major decisions such as changing the ownership structure must be taken with circumspection. Put simply, we cannot afford to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. Be that as it may, I would form an opinion on this proposal after studying expert analysis of its merits and demerits. If the efficiency of the industry would not be adversely affected; if the stream of future revenue accruing to Nigeria would not decrease; if the pricing of the assets to be sold would be transparently competitive; and if the government's policy-making capacity in this very sensitive sector would not be diminished, then I am in support of the proposal. For some three years or so, vested interests have impeded reform and the political will has been lacking: what has changed that would allow you to put promises into practice? If we assume that your judgment of the policy environment was true, then the decisive change has been the coming of the members of our transitional council into government since the beginning of this year. Our council is principally composed of private sector operators with proven track records. We are men and women of action and high integrity and the nation knows it is too late for us in our careers to suddenly become indolent and passive. As an illustration, I had the privilege to run one of Nigeria's biggest companies (UACN plc) for over a decade before being invited to serve in the transitional council. I had always freely expressed my opinions on the Nigerian economy and the nation knows what to expect from me. Most importantly, by making accountability and transparency the cornerstone of our policies, I believe we will be given a fair chance to put our promises into practice. We have rekindled hope in the Nigerian economy. Let me declare categorically here that we have been given a free hand to implement our decisions. I have a deep faith in the promise of Nigeria and the collective integrity of the transitional council. I am sure that we will succeed and leave behind us an enviable legacy.</p>

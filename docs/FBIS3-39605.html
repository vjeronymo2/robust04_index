The visit was discussed during the recent visit by  President Boris Yeltsin to Belgium. Consultations regarding the  trade mission are being conducted with Foreign Trade Minister  Robert Urbain.    According to Ivan D. Ivanov, the recently appointed head of  the Russian trade representation for Belgium and Luxembourg, and  previously a Russian negotiator with the European Union and  GATT, exports to Russia from the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic  Union [BLEU] rose by 20 percent last year, despite the fact that  overall Russian imports were halved.    Only a few South East Asian countries came close to that  performance. Ivanov expects that the cooperation agrement  concluded in December will stimulate trade further.    According to him, Belgian traders are extremely active. In  addition, those Russian companies which used to produce weapons  of destruction and which are now attempting to switch their  activities, enjoy being involved in the manufacture and  distribution of consumer products. Until recently, Belgium  exported primarily metal and outfitting equipment to Russia, but  now it is also exporting an increasing amount of consumer  products, such as dairy produce, and chocolate. Last year, the  value of trade between the BLEU and Russia totalled  approximately 50 billion Belgian francs.    Belgium also appears to be the major recipient of Russian  investments abroad. There are something like 20 joint ventures  under way here, some active on the local market, others actively  producing items for export. The two countries have already  concluded an agreement aimed at protecting their reciprocal  investments.    According to Ivanov, the problem concerning the Russian debt  to Belgium was solved last November by restructuring it.  Belgian companies in Russia are still owed $150 million,  because the Russian Government froze hard currency assets.  These assets will now be liberated.    Russian trade representations abroad are no longer dependent  on a form of state organization run from Moscow, but are  operating, claims Ivanov, at the service of all Russian  companies that are active on the foreign market. As a result,  in the future, Belgian companies will be dealing directly with  Russian companies.    Consequently, Belgian companies may refer to databases for  information on Russian trade legislation and on the profile of  Russian companies. Meanwhile, the representation in Brussels  and the Belgian Department of Foreign Trade are currently  drawing up a business guide for use by Russian companies and  investors.</p>

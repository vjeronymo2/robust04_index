			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / EC troops must regroup First, a health warning. Last week at the Copenhagen Summit the European Community may have passed an important turning point. Most specialists are wary of turning points, which should only be administered in small doses: too many at once, and the reader gets giddy. So, before we go deeper into this heady stuff, a little story. The date is 1854; the place is the steep terrain south of the river Bulganek in the Crimea; enter General Lord Cardigan and General Lord Lucan, quarrelling furiously with each other and with the commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, over the leadership of their forces, the management of the British and the conduct of the war. The army had struggled across the Black Sea from Bulgaria, and landed in confusion in Calamita Bay. The troops, incapacitated by cholera and dysentery, were dying like flies under the burning sun. The logistics were appalling: salt pork for rations, too little transport and a water shortage. On their right flank, the French 'impatiently drummed and tootled', according to the account* of Cecil Woodham-Smith, and sent over to inquire about the delay. Still quarrelling, Lucan and Cardigan led their advance guard of four squadrons of cavalry up from the shores of the Bulganek. As they came over a crest half way up the long slope, they saw ahead of them a body of 2,000 Russian cavalry and prepared to do battle. But, from a higher vantage point behind them, Lord Raglan saw what Lucan and Cardigan could not see: on the plateau at the top of their slope were marshalled 60,000 Russian infantry, two batteries of artillery, a brigade of cavalry, and nine troops of Cossacks. In a panic, Raglan ordered the cavalry to withdraw again to the Bulganek to regroup and reconsider. For the first time, perhaps, the British began to reassess the enterprise they were embarked upon. EC member states may be undergoing a similar experience. For decades they have been riven by dogmatic quarrels over Europe's internal organisation. After four years of considerable effort and occasional Euro-centric euphoria, they are struggling to bring their Maastricht treaty to land, even though it is unseaworthy, decimated by currency upheavals and stricken with referenda and constitutional revisions. Labouring up the hill what do they see? One billion Chinese, that's what. Last week in Copenhagen, possibly for the first time in their history, the 12 spent more mental effort looking out than looking in. They were frightened by what they saw. What they saw fundamentally challenged notions of the welfare state and social market economy. They saw a future in which western Europe may simply be uncompetitive and affected by low growth and rising structural unemployment. The threat does not come solely, or even mainly, from exports from China or any other developing country. Rather, the threat to European competitiveness results from patterns within industrialised countries - from modern technology, computerisation, telecommunications, the mobility of capital and incentives to go off-shore - as much as it does from trade flows. Indeed, the latest figures show China running a trade deficit. But China's size and a combination of its high economic growth and its low production costs indicate the kind of competitive pressures developing globally. Western Europeans used to say: 'Gosh, the Koreans (Taiwanese, etc) are competitive, we can't match them.' But unconsciously they consoled themselves with the thought that the Four Horsemen of south-east Asia were comparatively small economies. China is quite a different matter. And, whereas labour costs in Taiwan or Singapore are something over Dollars 5 (Pounds 3.30) an hour, compared with Dollars 16 in France or the US and Dollars 25 in Germany, Chinese labour costs are only Dollars 0.44 cents an hour. The grim economic outlook seems to be provoking near-panic in some continental European countries. The new conservative government in France, which started its period in office with tax increases to control the budget deficit, has now virtually turned 180 degrees with the launch of a large public loan to finance job promotion. In Germany, the government has approved a DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) savings package, including cuts in unemployment benefits, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl has told German workers to stop whining and be prepared to work longer hours. The severity of Europe's economic difficulties means the EC will probably spend less time arguing about dogma and more considering how European economies can become competitive again; how they can increase growth and reduce unemployment; and whether they can afford their welfare states. Mr John Major could not resist cheap gibes last week at the EC's expense - as if Brussels were to blame for the uncompetitiveness of the UK economy. The others probably realised, however, he was playing to the Conservative party gallery. But, a dispassionate look at Europe, in the context of the global economy, shows the real differences between Britain and the original Six are trivial. British politicians are imprisoned in an antediluvian anti-Brussels mind-set. By most measures - the structure of the economy, taxation levels and public spending - Britain is obviously a western European country like the others and its problems European problems. With luck, the Copenhagen meeting will mark both a truce in the wearying arguments between the federalists and the nationalists and the beginning of real frankness on Europe's common problems. * The Reason Why, by Cecil Woodham-Smith, Penguin, 286 pages, Pounds 6.99</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT NOMINEE'S FAST RISE RAISES UNCERTAINTY ON LEGAL IDEOLOGY  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's previous five appointees to the state Supreme Court  had one thing in common: All were experienced judges with well-established  records that invited predictions of the moderately conservative course they  since have followed on the high court.  </P> <P> But there are no bold, sweeping prophecies being made about the governor's  newest nominee, Appellate Justice Joyce L. Kennard of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "She's climbed the ladder so fast -- one year on the Municipal Court, one year  on the Superior Court and one year on the Court of Appeal -- that no one can  know for sure what she will be like when she settles in on the Supreme Court,"  said UC Berkeley law professor Stephen R. Barnett.  </P> <P>  "Kennard obviously knows the existing law well," he said. "The question will  be how she will deal with the ideological and philosophical dimensions of  making the law. It will be very interesting for everyone -- including the  governor -- to see how she turns out."  </P> <P> Legal authorities do say that based on the limited number of opinions she has  written, they expect the 47-year-old Kennard -- if confirmed as expected -- to  be as tough on criminals as the other Deukmejian appointees on the court.  </P> <P> But there is considerable uncertainty over how she will perform in major civil  cases. Her opinions show no tendency to favor either plaintiffs or defendants,  nor can they be interpreted as necessarily "pro" or "anti" business. In one  case, for example, she ruled against an insurance company, but in another, an  insurer came out the winner.  </P> <P> Although the newly aligned court has sided with business more than its liberal  predecessor, some important civil decisions have come on 4-3 votes -- such as  its ruling in December substantially limiting damages employees may collect for  wrongful discharge. And observers say Kennard's role could prove pivotal as new  issues arise in the civil arena in the years ahead.  </P> <P> "She is definitely going to be an important member of this court," said Fred J.  Hiestand of Sacramento, counsel for the Assn. for California Tort Reform.  "There have been a number of close decisions, and she could tilt the court in a  different direction."  </P> <P> Authorities do not see Kennard's relative lack of judicial experience as a  major impediment to success on the high court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Useful Background  </P> <P> Her five years as a lawyer in the criminal division of the attorney general's  office, followed by seven years as a senior staff attorney doing legal research  on the Court of Appeal, could provide useful background for her work on the  high court, they say. And, they add, an open mind can be as beneficial as  judicial experience when it comes to deciding the cases that come before the  court.  </P> <P> "I'd like to think that when justices come on the Supreme Court they are not  committed to any preconceived agenda," said Harvey R. Levine of San Diego,  president of the California Trial Lawyers Assn. "The position is so important,  affecting so many lives and economic interests, that it's better they come on  thinking about the issues in a fresh and independent way."  </P> <P> Kennard's unique background and personal qualities are other factors seen as  weighing in her favor. Born in Indonesia of a Dutch father and  Chinese-Indonesian mother, she spent part of her childhood in a World War II  internment camp in West Java, migrated with her widowed mother to Holland,  survived the loss of a leg and then came to Los Angeles at age 20 to take a job  as a secretary. Later, after her mother died, she used a $5,000 bequest to  enter college, finishing up with a Phi Beta Kappa undergraduate degree and a  law degree, both from USC.  </P> <P> Robert H. Philibosian, a Los Angeles lawyer and former chief assistant state  attorney general and Los Angeles County district attorney, recalls Kennard's  departure from the Department of Justice as "the greatest loss we ever had in  the criminal division."  </P> <P> "Every place she's been in the system she's drawn rave reviews from  experienced, critical, hard-nosed people," said Philibosian. "She is no apple  polisher. She's very independent and she's going to be an excellent justice."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experienced as Judges  </P> <P> The five justices previously appointed by the governor had extensive  backgrounds on the bench. Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, appointed as an  associate justice in 1984, had spent 17 years as a state and federal trial  court judge. Justice Edward A. Panelli, taking office in 1985, had served 13  years as a judge. Justice John A. Arguelles had been a judge for 24 years,  David N. Eagleson for 17 years and Marcus M. Kaufman for 17 years when they  were appointed in 1987.  </P> <P> By contrast, Kennard's career on the bench began Feb. 28, 1986, when she took  the oath to become a judge on the Los Angeles Municipal Court. Deukmejian  elevated her to the Superior Court in 1987 and to the Court of Appeal in 1988.  </P> <P> The opinions she has issued as an appellate justice are seen by legal scholars  as concise, clearly written and generally well reasoned. "She is willing to  call the pitches as they come over the plate, without regard to who the parties  in the case are," said Barnett. "Her opinions are wonderfully direct."  </P> <P> Since her nomination to the high court, much attention has focused on a civil  decision filed in 1987 when she was a Superior Court judge serving temporarily  on the Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> Writing for a unanimous three-member panel, Kennard upheld a $5-million  punitive damage award against an insurance company for refusing in bad faith to  pay benefits to a savings and loan association allegedly defrauded by one of  its employees.  </P> <P> Kennard rejected the insurer's contention that the award was excessive,  amounting to nearly 2% of its net worth. She noted that other courts had upheld  awards representing over 3% of a company's net assets. "Because the purposes of  punitive damages are to punish the wrongdoer and make an example of him, the  wealthier the wrongdoer, the larger the award of punitive damages," she wrote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Basis of Decision  </P> <P> She also turned down the company's claim that the big damage award violated the  federal constitutional prohibition against excessive fines. "The 8th Amendment  applies only to criminal actions, not to purely civil penalties, as involved  here," she said.  </P> <P> Levine, an advocate for plaintiffs' lawyers, is enthusiastic about Kennard's  opinion in the case. "This was a very important ruling," he said. "It was  probably one of the best I've seen in the punitive damages field in its legal  analysis and reasoning."  </P> <P> But Hiestand, speaking for defense lawyers, is concerned that Kennard had too  easily dismissed the constitutional issue of excessive penalties -- a question  that now is under review in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. "The matter  is not nearly so clear as she states," he said. "Her treatment of the issue  seems a bit cavalier."  </P> <P> In another civil case, however, Kennard wrote the majority opinion in a 2-1  ruling in favor of an insurance company that had been sued on the grounds that  it improperly failed to provide a policy broad enough to protect all the  personal assets of apartment building owners facing a negligence suit.  </P> <P> There was no showing in this case that the insurer knew the extent of the  owners' assets, nor was there proof the owner would have been willing to pay a  higher premium for expanded coverage, Kennard said. Thus, the insurer had no  duty to provide complete liability coverage, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawsuit Reinstated  </P> <P> In a another ruling issued last December, Kennard reinstated a lawsuit brought  by a 74-year-old widow against an attorney who allegedly told her falsely that  a bench warrant had been issued against her for failing to pay a debt.  </P> <P> While state law provides lawyers some protections for their actions during  litigation, in this case the attorney's "blatantly false statements" appeared  not only unethical but possibly criminal, and the widow could pursue her suit,  the justice said.  </P> <P> Most criminal convictions that come before the state Court of Appeal are upheld  and, in her limited service on the court, Kennard has ruled consistently  against criminal defendants.  </P> <P> In one of her first decisions, Kennard refused to overturn the conviction of a  murder defendant who sought a new trial because his first lawyer was removed by  a judge for not being ready for trial 17 months after she received the case.  </P> <P> The lawyer's failure to offer good reason for the delay, and refusal to say  when she would be ready for trial, "constituted undue delay and a disruption of  the orderly process of justice," Kennard wrote for a unanimous court.  </P> <P> In a case decided last July, she upheld the conviction in a burglary and  attempted rape case, rejecting the defendant's claim that he should have been  placed in a police lineup with other people rather than being identified at his  residence soon after the crime by the victim.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assessment of Error  </P> <P> In another issue in the case, prosecutors conceded that the trial judge had  improperly allowed jurors to consider the fact that the suspect had fled from  the scene of the crime as evidence of guilt. But they argued that the error was  harmless in view of other evidence in the case.  </P> <P> Kennard, in a relatively unusual action, refused to accept the prosecutors'  concession of error, finding instead that the jury was properly allowed to  consider flight from the scene.  </P> <P> Last August, in another unanimous opinion, Kennard turned down an attempt by a  defendant to have stricken from his record, after completion of his probation,  a conviction for receiving stolen property. The panel ruled that the dismissal  should be denied because the defendant had failed to fully pay $2,571.65 in  court-ordered restitution as required under terms of his probation.  </P> <P> In January, Kennard wrote a unanimous opinion allowing illegally obtained  evidence to be used in revoking the probation of a defendant who was arrested  while carrying a concealed weapon.  </P> <P> Kennard, citing a decision by the appellate court in another case, said that  under Proposition 8, the anti-crime initiative passed by voters in 1982, such  evidence was relevant and thus admissible in probation revocation hearings.  </P> <P> Janice Kamenir-Reznik of Los Angeles, president of California Women Lawyers and  a close acquaintance of Kennard, makes no predictions on how the new justice  would vote on important criminal or civil questions, or how she would react on  such politically sensitive issues as abortion.  </P> <P> "She's not a knee-jerk person," Kamenir-Reznik said. "She's an independent  person who will use her legal knowledge and her reasoning skills and reach her  decisions on a case-by-case basis."  </P> <P> Other authorities draw similar impressions of the new nominee. "She's well  regarded in terms of her judicial capacity," said Gerald F. Uelmen, law dean at  Santa Clara University. "She's generally seen as a conservative justice, but  not any sort of ideologue."  </P> <P> Said Kamenir-Reznik: "This is an unusual woman, one who embodies the American  dream. She's endured a lot of adversity and beaten the odds to come out on  top."  </P></p>

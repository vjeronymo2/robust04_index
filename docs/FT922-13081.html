			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / East German workforce slashed: Post-communist job market devastated by economic realities AT the end of 1989, when it was still widely rated to be among the world's top 10 economies, the German Democratic Republic boasted a workforce of almost 10m. Since unification with the west in October, 1990, that number has shrunk to 6m and some 1.4m of those are officially unemployed. At least 1m more are on short-time, or labour in work creation schemes. Unleashing market forces has worked to devastating effect on the basic inefficiencies of the old command economy. And there the process has all but stopped. 'So far massive transfers and support measures have failed to spark the expected powerful, self-supporting, recovery process,' west Germany's five leading economic institutes reported yesterday. In the first overall independent view of conditions in the east, the institutes accept the conventional view that the bottom has been reached - after a 14 per cent fall in output in 1990 and 30 per cent last year. But they also underline the weaknesses of the new foundations. The number of new company registrations has fallen from 25,000 a month at the end of 1990 to around 20,000 now. Company failures, meanwhile, have risen from 6,000 to 10,000 a month. Net growth in the number of independent businesses slowed to 1.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Less than 60 per cent of newly-registered companies are actually doing business, the institutes said. The Treuhand privatisation agency is given credit for its successes so far. Chopping up large combines into smaller units has resulted in a sixth of all sales being made to management buy-out teams. outside Germany led to 74 companies being sold to foreigners in January and February, compared with 248 all last year. However, the agency still has around 6,000 businesses to dispose of, and, according to the report, the sale of up to 90 per cent of these is blocked by uncertainty over their ownership. While attempts are being made to speed up processing claims from people dispossessed by the Nazis and, later, the communists, the report stresses that shortages of expert manpower are still hampering progress. So far, only 5 per cent of the 2m claims put in for companies, land and buildings have been cleared. Meanwhile, the death toll mounts. By the end of last year, the Treuhand had closed 983 hopeless-case businesses; 1,000 will go this year. Builders, aggregate- and cement-makers, suppliers of reinforcing steel and construction equipment, have all benefited from the rebuilding boom which will be largely responsible for this year's expected 10.5 per cent increase in east German economic output. But the institutes report either no improvement or deterioration in other once-vital industries such as iron production, foundries, precision engineering and textiles. 'Overall, the manufacturing sector. . . . still faces serious adaptation problems,' they say. But if the east faces 'adaptation' difficulties, so too does the west. As the institutes make clear, pay and public spending in the old west Germany cannot continue to rise without stark consequences: first for recovery in the east and ultimately for the country as a whole. Of the DM155bn (Pounds 54.30bn) in financial transfers from the west's public purse this year, just DM2.5bn will come directly from the coffers of the individual states. According to the institutes, federal spending should be frozen in real terms, local authorities over-stepping the mark must be reined in with 'fines'. Tax cuts and other fiscal concessions should by paid for by savings elsewhere. People in the west must expect less real pay. Germany's OTV public service workers union is to call a strike ballot after rejecting a new government pay offer of 4.8 per cent, Reuter reports from Stuttgart. The vote is expected next week. If the strike goes ahead, it will be the first by German public service workers for 18 years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN ECONOMIC INDICATORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        West                East              Federal                       Germany             Germany            Republic Years              90    91   92*     90     91    92*    90    91   92*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP (% change)**  4.5   3.1   1.0  -14.4  -30.3   10.5   2.7   0.1   1.5 Workforce (m)    28.4  29.1  29.4    8.8    7.1    6.1  37.2  36.3  35.5 Jobless (m)       1.8   1.6   1.7    0.2    0.9    1.3   2.1   2.6   3.1 Prices (% rise)   2.6   3.6  3.75    0.2   13.6   12.0   2.3   4.7   5.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Forecasts **1985 prices  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

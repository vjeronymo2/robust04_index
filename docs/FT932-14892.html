			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: BR-union talks derailed - How unions and British Rail are locked in a fight over the future of the railways and who runs them TODAY's 24 hour railway strike, the second in a fortnight, is ostensibly over the issues of compulsory redundancies and the use of contract work. But as the conflict drags on, punctuated by interminable exchanges of documents and arguments over semantics, it may precipitate a final showdown in the industry on the issue of who runs the railways. British Rail, the last of the old nationalised enterprises with a trade union dominated work culture based on regulation and arcane procedure, is having to adapt rapidly to the approaching challenge of privatisation and increased competition. This change will be painful for everybody in BR but most of all for the rail unions who have exercised virtual joint control over the industry for the past 45 years. Faced with the prospect of an upheaval that will destroy their entrenched positions, they appear intent on fighting a rearguard action that looks self-destructive as commuters and business learn to live without railways. BR chairman Sir Bob Reid claims the main rail union the RMT is 'living in a different world' than the rest of Britain and demands it faces up to change. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT's general secretary, says he is appalled by the way he and his union is being treated by Sir Bob. The union's left-leaning executive seems ready to stiffen his resolve. But from the outside, the conflict looks like a squabble over words. Documents and letters have gone back and forth in recent weeks over the quarter of a mile separating RMT headquarters and BR head office which have often done more to muddy the issue of compulsory redundancies than clarify it. A total of 23 hours has been consumed in detailed discussions between the rail unions and BR since November 19 when BR told the unions its trading position required staff cutbacks, though every effort would be made to reach these by voluntary means. At the first meeting BR executive John Welsby assured the unions 'in the final analysis staff would have the protection of the industry's existing arrangements for redeployment and redundancy'. That meant BR would guarantee no compulsory redundancies on the railways as enshrined in an agreement signed in 1985 and known in the esoteric language of the industry as RT and R 464. This gives a clear 'assurance' that nobody will be dismissed from BR's employment 'on grounds of redundancy' subject to the proviso they are 'prepared, if necessary, to accept an offer of alternative employment which might involve a change of work or might require them to move to another place of employment'. Confusingly, BR management has not been ready to spell out that commitment explicitly in its present dealings with the unions, at least on paper. It was only under pressure from the media at a BR briefing two days ago that the wording of the 1985 guarantee was finally revealed. BR management say they cannot give any guarantee of 'jobs for life' but eight years ago they made a commitment to the unions there would be no compulsory redundancies on the railways. This was not a new departure for BR. Three years earlier it accepted there would be no compulsory redundancies when introduced flexible rostering for train drivers and staffless stations. Both sides are trapped by their history of joint regulation. The RMT even quoted from a 1947 report earlier this week to justify its position. Every twist and turn is enshrined in written agreements and letters that BR and the rail unions throw at each other with liturgical precision. It is this often pedantic and time-consuming system that is now under threat as the industry approaches the bracing world of privatisation. 'We are trying to prepare the railways for the next century', says Sir Bob Reid. But the RMT and ASLEF seem ready to fight against radical change at a heavy cost both to themselves and the travelling public. By battling over a form of words the unions threaten Pounds 1bn worth of business contracts at present under negotiation and Pounds 10m in lost gross revenue to BR. As Sir Bob Reid explains: 'Every time we have a shutdown of the railways, people get used to living without us.'</p>

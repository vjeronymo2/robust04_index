			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Delay to pension reform signalled MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, yesterday rejected demands from both sides of the Commons for swift reforms to pension legislation, and hinted that the changes could slip beyond next year. He said he would first have to seek comment from the industry on the 1,000-page report issued by the government's advisory panel, the Goode committee. Mr Lilley said in a Commons statement that he would shortly be issuing discussion papers as the basis for industry-wide consultation. He said, however, that it would be impossible to introduce pension legislation before the 1994-95 session at the earliest. 'We have to make sure that what we do makes the system better and safer and does not make the mistakes that ill-thought legislation might do,' he said. Mr Lilley added: 'I want to listen carefully to any comments on the detail of the committee's recommendations, not least to ensure that the burden on business is the minimum compatible with effective regulation.' Mr Donald Dewar, Labour spokesman on social security, welcomed the broad contents of the Goode report but warned that Labour would want to radicalise its recommendations. He said the recommendation that one third of trustees should be appointed by pension-fund members was insufficient. He called for legislation to introduce requirements to increase pensions in line with inflation, a proposal which the Goode committee debated at length but rejected. 'The report should be seen as a starting point, and not as the finished product,' Mr Dewar said. Mr Lilley also signalled that he was prepared to consider alterations to the government's rules for schemes which contract out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and provide the alternative Guaranteed Minimum Pension. Industry sources have said that Department of Social Security officials have privately indicated sympathy for requests to scrap or greatly overhaul the minimum pension scheme, regarded as an administrative nightmare. The Goode committee drew attention to the complexity of the contracting-out rules and suggested that easing these might offset the burden of additional regulation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Swaziland police have confiscated their biggest  haul of mandrax. The mandrax has an estimated street value of  about $5 million. It was packed in plastic bags hidden in  containers on a truck that had entered the country at the  Lomahasha border post in the north. Sources say that the  Lomahasha area has become a favorite route for smugglers of  drugs and arms from Mozambique. Apparently these are destined  for South Africa.</p>

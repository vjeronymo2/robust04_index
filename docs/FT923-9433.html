			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / French shy away from Maastricht FRENCH support for European union is slipping as next month's referendum on the Maastricht treaty approaches. A poll in Liberation newspaper shows 43 per cent plan to vote 'No', compared with 38 per cent a month ago. The referendum is seen as critical for the treaty. European union is still popular among the young, with 70 per cent of 18-to-24 year olds planning to vote 'Yes'. Robert Taylor adds from Stockholm: Joining the EC will cost Sweden only SKr3.4bn (Pounds 330m) net a year, according to a Commission report yesterday. This would be 3.2 per cent of EC's spending. Although Sweden will have to pay an estimated SKr10.8bn a year into the EC budget, it can expect to receive SKr7.4bn in return in financial support, particularly for its vulnerable agricultural industry. Between SKr4.4bn and SKr5.2bn will be earmarked for supporting cereals, milk and dairy products, lamb and mutton. The report says Sweden would have to abandon its state alcohol monopoly because it conflicts with EC competition laws.</p>

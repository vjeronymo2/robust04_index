			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / People: Citibank loses researchers Stephen Partridge-Hicks and Nicholas Sossidis have resigned from the research group of Citibank following a dispute over pay, funding and control of the operations with which they were connected. The two men were the business managers responsible for Alpha and Beta Finance Corporations, two entities that invested in high quality rated debt securities. Citibank said yesterday the resignation was due to 'a fundamental disagreement on the amount of future resources to be made available to the research group and the relative ownership of the management activity between the parties'. Alan Harley, a vice president, said the resignation would have little adverse impact and that while the two men were the 'figureheads' there were another 18 people who worked in the group. 'We continue as normal,' he said. Charles Covell has been appointed as new manager of the Research Group, which Citibank said would be 'fully resourced for growth'. Partridge-Hicks and Sossidis said they intended to develop a new investment management business with a joint venture partner, drawing on their experience with Citibank over the last six years. They said the management team would be tied-in with the 'appropriate contracts and financial incentives . . . so often requested by investors'.</p>

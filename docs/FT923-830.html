			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Sport: Around the world the hard way - Yachting endlessly - to have made the world smaller. At noon today the BBC's cameras will broadcast live from the Solent the start of the British Steel round the world yacht race. The success of the event owes a good deal to Chay Blyth's 1989 announcement on News at Ten, a British TV news programme, that he planned to send 10 identical yachts crewed by amateurs racing around the globe. Blyth was overwhelmed by volunteers clutching cheques for the required Pounds 14,850. Yet the 130 crewmen waving to the watching millions will not be watching much television for the next eight months. Nor, after 28,000 miles against the prevailing winds and currents, will the world seem so very small. 'They are going to be cold, wet and tired most of the time,' predicted Pete Goss, the former Royal Marine who trained the crews and himself skippers one of the yachts. Some challenges never diminish in size. All summer the small but voluble network of professional yacht-racers based around Cowes, Lymington and the Hamble have been disparaging the British Steel Challenge. These tanned, cynical veterans who can round the Horn on a can of Fosters and a muesli bar say that the amateurs are under-experienced and naive about what awaits them. 'We're all learning together and the whole first leg will be part of the training experience,' conceded Vivien Cherry, the only woman skipper in the fleet. 'Except for two, none of my crew have been at sea for more than five or six days. It'll be a nasty shock, I think. 'Reality will suddenly hit them when we're two weeks out and they think 'Ugh, we've got another three weeks before Rio and God knows how long at sea after that.' Keeping the concentration to run the yacht efficiently will be difficult. 'All you can do is get them to push the boat, look after the boat, look after themselves. Nothing else exists. There is no point in worrying about house, family, friends. You're just there,' added Cherry, who has competed in a solo transatlantic race and several Fastnets before taking the wheel of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in this event. It is my hunch that two things will protect these gutsy people, seeking only more adrenalin than normal life usually supplies, from harm. The first is that the 67ft yachts themselves were designed and built to be virtually bullet-proof. Steel hulls constructed by former frigate-builders at Devonport dockyard are not going to start shedding layers in the Southern Ocean - as some hi-tech Whitbread boats have been known to do. Masts more like industrial I-beams than the spindly antennae usually found on racing yachts are not going to topple in mid-Pacific. The modest sail plan is split into three via the cutter rig, giving greater flexibility and safety since crews on deck are always handling smaller sails than would be the case with a single headsail. High freeboard means the yachts should stay dry much of the time rather than the continual paddling pool which is the cockpit of a Whitbread racer - surfing downwind at double the speeds the Challenge yachts will average. Caution is the second safety factor. Most accidents happen when racers push themselves beyond prudent limits because of the desire to win. No professional sportsman lacks that drive, although some control it better than others. These crews are not professionals and are dancing to a different drum. Ken Parson, the Welsh dairy farmer, has cows to come back to. Caroll Randall will return to deadlines on the Harborough Mail which she edits. Every one in the fleet has their own agenda. The racing will be competitive and spirited but in the end, whether Heath Insured, say, beats Commercial Union into Hobart (the second stop-over) is only a sub-text to the main story. Except, perhaps, to some of the sponsors, their names are up there in lights and commercial giants that play hard do not want to be at the back of the fleet. Fury erupted among the amateur crews a week or two ago when it emerged that the Rhone'Poulenc yacht had smuggled professional round-the-world racer Lionel Pean aboard the boat for the Ushant / Fastnet training race, in defiance of the rules. There were angry scenes on the dock at the finish. The then skipper of Rhone-Poulenc, Alec Honey, has since found that his wife's illness obliges him to resign his command. It was an extreme case but other yachts have found their sponsors willing to pay for coaching - above and beyond the normal training programme - from professional sailors, particularly those with Whitbread experience. David Alan-Williams, a designer and four-time Whitbread veteran, trained the crew of Nuclear Electric in Southern Ocean techniques. Paul Standbridge, late of Rothmans, performed similar evolutions for other yachts. There is more to this race than just a spot of character-building.</p>

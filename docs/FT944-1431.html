			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: East Midlands' Pounds 86m beats City forecasts Shares in East Midlands Electricity rose by 5 per cent after the group announced substantially better than expected interim results and a surprisingly large dividend increase. East Midlands, the last of the 12 regional electricity companies to report, was the strongest mover in a sector already buoyed by the Trafalgar House bid for Northern Electric. The shares rose 41p to close at 851p. Analysts said the profits, which rose from Pounds 64m to Pounds 86m pre-tax for the six months to September 30, were some Pounds 13m ahead of average expectations. Sales fell from Pounds 666.2m to Pounds 619.3m. The dividend increase of 26 per cent to 8.6p compared with expectations of 8.2p and follows the special 85p pay-out announced in October. 'Having paid such a big special dividend, East Midlands might have had more reason than most to be less generous with the pay-out,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins of Hoare Govett. Mr Norman Askew, chief executive, pointed out that following the recent share consolidation, the underlying increase in the dividend was slightly more than 12 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent to 30.2p (22p). He said the group remained determined to return value to shareholders. The demerger of the National Grid, in which East Midlands holds an 8.4 per cent stake, would be the next opportunity to release substantial value, he said. The market expects this would mean a second special pay-out. Mr Askew said the profits improvement had been achieved by squeezing more profit from the regulated business and eliminating losses in the non-regulated operations. The pre-tax line was also helped by a Pounds 3.9m reduction in interest charges to Pounds 4.5m. Supply showed a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 7.9m on sales of Pounds 521m (Pounds 558m). Distribution lifted profits 10 per cent to Pounds 78.2m on sales of Pounds 183m (Pounds 177m). On the non-regulated side, operating losses in the contracting division fell from Pounds 1m to Pounds 400,000. However, retailing remained difficult. East Midlands share of the losses incurred in the retailing joint venture was Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 4.6m). Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 215m for the full year, with a dividend total about 18 per cent up at 30.5p.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (4): Slow reforms threatened - The Unions 'We have a saying in Romanian - you can't cut a cat's tail in stages. That is why we must implement market reforms more rapidly,' says Miron Mitrea, a well-dressed, well-built, chain-smoking man. 'I very, very strongly support privatisation - the faster, the better.' Equally, ardent followers of the market can be found throughout eastern Europe. But coming from Mr Mitrea, who also supports the central bank's tight monetary policy, praises the toughness of the International Monetary Fund and is not overly worried about unemployment, these accolades for economic reform have a distinctly surprising ring. For Mr Mitrea is the president of the CNSLR-Fratia, which, together with the Alfa Cartel, Romania's other main trade union block, represents 5.5 million people - more than half of the country's workforce. Dismal television pictures of coal miners from the Jiu valley brutally beating student protestors in June 1990, won trade unions international notoriety as the rough enforcers of an ex-communist government's continued rule. This is, however, a distorted image. Romania's two leading trade unions are strong advocates of market reform, and at the end of February held a national strike to protest the government's failure to privatise more rapidly or to reform the social security system. But Mr Mitrea, who was an engineer in a construction company before the 1989 revolution inspired him to organise the truck drivers in the company into a trade union which they elected him to lead, is afraid that the sluggish pace of reforms in Romania may be wearing out the patience of rank-and-file members. 'The attitudes of our membership towards economic reforms are changing in a negative way, and we, their leaders, do not know what to do about it,' Mr Mitrea said. 'Three years ago it was easy to explain why we were pro-re form. Reform meant a good economy and good jobs. 'Now our members say this 'good economy' is good for nothing.' Although Mr Mitrea is confident that in the short-term the union's progressive leadership will prevail over the populist instincts of some of its members, he worries that eventually Romania's unions might turn against economic reforms. If that does happen, Mr Mitrea will probably no longer be in charge. Mr Mitrea, who many believe will opt for a career in politics, is pushing for the entire leadership of the union, including himself, to resign to make way for a new generation. 'War needs one kind of general, peace needs a different kind,' Mr Mitrea says. 'Our revolution is over, but by nature I am a war general.'</p>

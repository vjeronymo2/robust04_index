			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine by </F> Mariya Bazelyuk, conducted in Kiev on the eve of the president's  visit to Lviv: " 'I Will Never Allow Ukraine To Return to  Communist Times' "]    [Text]    [Bazelyuk] Mr. President, we will soon be celebrating the  third anniversary of Ukraine's independence. How much stronger  has Ukraine grown as an independent state in this time?    [Kravchuk] In connection with the presidential election, I  have recently been spending more time in the collectives,  meeting with people locally, in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, in  Mykolayiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Zhytomyr oblasts. And I can  tell you without exaggeration that I have seen that the things  that are happening on the surface and that are represented in  official and unofficial interpretations and in information  presented by various mass media, parties, and movements simply  do not reflect the mood of the people, nor what has already been  accomplished even in the most difficult sphere of all for us --  the economy. Kharkiv Oblast is a large, comprehensively  developed region, with over three million inhabitants: it has a  machinebuilding complex, an agrarian complex, a gas complex, and  many other fields. You know, I remember when they spent more  than seven years designing the T-150 tractor in Kharkiv and in  the end never did finish the project, even though we are told  there was financing then, and accounts were settled, and there  were no problems with money. The Politburo of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine held two hearings on  this matter and the Secretariat held three, and still the  tractor never got built. Whereas now I saw more than seven  models of new tractors, all built in one year and all  significantly superior to the T-150 in terms of their technical  and economic indicators. This is an example of what people can  do when they do not have to report to the politburo and to the  secretariat, when no one stands over them telling them what to  do, what paint to use, when to sow, and when to reap. But for  there to be really major qualitative changes, you need time. I  am convinced that despite all the difficulties, despite the  decline in production, despite the reorganization and the  constructive changes that will inevitably be made, the national  economy and reforms are moving forward. Our political affairs  are moving ahead, gradually, with difficulty, in jumps and  starts, with reverses, accompanied by the reflections of various  forces; the political construction of our society is under way  -- in other words, we are moving ahead. Laboriously, taking into  account our particular internal and external circumstances, but  nonetheless moving forward.    [Bazelyuk] There is no question that the peace we have in  our  country is a great achievement. Both our own people and the  world community recognize that the president of Ukraine deserves  a great deal of credit for this. Now, however, certain political  circles are leaning in favor of Ukraine becoming a full-fledged,  so to speak, member of the economic union, rather than just an  associate member, by signing all the agreements involved in this  union. As we know, these agreements provide for joint defense of  the so-called borders of the CIS, including those where wars are  being fought. Is it not conceivable that the new politicians  might imprudently sign CIS agreements that are fatal to Ukraine,  and, just as during the Afghan war, we will once again be  receiving coffins holding the bodies of Ukrainian youths killed  on distant and foreign borders?    [Kravchuk] On the whole, it is very difficult to predict and  be so certain about what will or will not happen in politics.  But I can say this. Returning our society and our people to the  past, knowing what serious consequences this may have, is out of  the question. Although some of our present-day politicians -- if  you can call them that in this respect -- do make such  statements. But these statements are more in the spirit of  populism than reflective of a belief that this can actually be  done. For instance, I cannot understand nor take seriously a  person in the leadership of a political movement who today gets  up and says that it is possible to return to the Soviet Union.  These are illusions. This will never happen again. Or, for  example, without knowing the historical, ethnic, political,  spiritual, and other roots of the issue, there are those who say  that it is possible to create a so-called Slavic union. There is  such an idea. But when you are dealing with an ignoramus, you  can see that in describing this category as an aim, he has no  idea who is behind this and what it implies. To begin with,  strictly speaking, this is not a matter of a Slavic union, but  of an East Slavic union. Secondly, any entity created on the  national principle -- and history attests to this -- inevitably  gives rise to nationalism in the worst sense of the word,  because you cannot talk about nationalism or national phenomena  using only a minus sign. Every current carries in it both good  and bad. This is inevitably so. Thirdly, this kind of Slavic  union cannot be realized in practice. When they speak of three  states -- Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus (although Russia is not  purely Slavic) -- [they need to keep in mind] that 35 million  Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians today live outside the  borders of these states. Just imagine, we create a Slavic union,  then an Asian union, and then some other unions, and what are  those Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians who find themselves  living in an Asian union to do? Join the Slavic union? Are we  prepared to settle the territorial issues that this would  involve? The notion of this kind of union reveals a basic lack  of sense. I might understand this proposal coming from an  emotional person, a poet, for example, without any insult  intended to anyone. But when this is being proposed by a person  who considers himself a politician, he obviously fails to  understand and does not know what he is saying. And if he does  not know, he should remain silent. There is a golden rule: talk  when you know, and if you don't, say nothing.    [Bazelyuk] Leonid Makarovych, as long as Ukraine remains a  member of the CIS, we in Galicia, Volhynia, and other regions  will feel no peace about the fate of our state. There are  various ways of dragging Ukraine into interethnic conflicts,  none of which, incidentally, erupted without Moscow playing a  role, and this can ultimately result in the loss of our state.  We are anxious to know: when will we finally leave the CIS?    [Kravchuk] If only all of Ukraine were Galicia or  Volhynia...  As you know, I have to deal with a Ukraine in which people in  Galicia, Slobozhanshchyna, the Luhansk region, and the Crimea  all think differently. To prevent quarrels and divisions, we  have to ensure that we are understood everywhere, and haste is  not always appropriate. You may recall that there was this  notion a few years ago that Galicia could reeducate the East;  all it would take would be a few columns of buses with slogans  sent to the East and tomorrow we would have the same level of  national consciousness there as in Galicia. But this did not  happen. On the contrary, it made the situation even worse.    Today, the CIS poses no threat in terms of dragging us into  something; it is generally incapable of dragging anyone into  anything. Take my word for it. There is no mechanism for this.  The European Union has a mechanism; it has a common parliament,  common legislation that regulates the economic sphere, and a  council of ministers. The CIS has nothing; there are only  declaratory statements and signed documents that have never been  implemented in the past and are not being implemented now,  because to implement them would require concerted action. If we  were to sign a document today about a common economic space and  tomorrow about free trade, and yet Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine  continue to pursue policies inside their own countries dictated  by the domestic situation in each and with no regard for the  signed documents, these documents will never come into force. I  tell you this as someone who signed the documents: the CIS today  serves more of a psychological than a practical purpose -- it  assuages the fears of that portion of the population that  thinks, and is correct in doing so, that we cannot and must not  (I say this to you, Galicians, whom I know well) make it our  goal to split away or turn our backs on the East. If someone  gets the idea that something will come from Moscow tomorrow and  we immediately turn our backs on the East, we will be doomed.  Because we can live in peace with such a large neighbor only if  we build an intelligent and flexible policy. We do not have the  strength to oppose Russia. We have to preserve our gains. We  must not lose. We have to take advantage of this opportunity.  And this requires flexibility, partnership, independence,  concessions, becoming strong, and then we can say... But we  cannot do it right away, even though I might want to... You  know, if it is possible to compare all of Galicia, with all due  respect for it, with just my own small wish, then you can  believe me when I tell you that in the last four years so much  has passed through my heart and my nervous system for Ukraine  that there was nothing more in my life than the greatest wish  --that tomorrow Ukraine be truly strong, truly democratic, truly  prosperous and that I could say so loudly to my people. I think  about this constantly, but I know that I cannot do this, and so  I have to be patient. I have to keep moving forward, without  falling to my knees, without bending, while driving our servile  mentality out of myself and all those around me, so as not to  lose this opportunity. Meanwhile, they keep telling me: "Faster,  faster!" But, [as the saying goes], if you make haste, you'll  make people laugh. Only this will be laughter through tears. We  do not have the right to do this. And the Galicians must  understand this. These are not simple matters. If, God forbid,  we lose this time, I do not know what will happen.    [Bazelyuk] Ukraine is a central European state and a lot is  being done to build her relations with other countries, and not  only with Russia. What are Ukraine's prospects in the nearest  future for strengthening her contacts with the world community?    [Kravchuk] On 14 June, I am going to Brussels, where Ukraine  will be the first of the CIS countries to sign an agreement with  the European Union on the principles of partnership. This opens  up before us a real partnership with European countries, with  the European market, with European culture, with everything we  need to have real ties with Europe. We are being accused that  Ukraine pursues a policy of self-isolation. Well, someone says  so in the street, and another hears it and repeats it on  television. Such people have their problems, and that determines  my attitude to them. We must have normal partnership relations  in the East, and in the West, and in the North, and in the  South, and good-neighborly relations with our neighbors. That is  the only way to live without forever having to worry about our  borders, about whether there is someone standing behind our  backs and what their intentions are. Otherwise, we will have to  focus all our efforts on defending ourselves, and we will have  to surround ourselves with a great force. This is not  realistically possible in our present situation. That is why we  have chosen to develop relations in Europe, in the West, the  East, the South, and the North. The signing of the partnership  agreement with the European Union will be the first, very  important step for Ukraine.    [Bazelyuk] Leonid Makarovych, your opponents quite often  accuse you of backing down at times when it is necessary to  stand up for the national interests of Ukraine.    [Kravchuk] Give me an example.    [Bazelyuk] For example, on the issue of the Black Sea fleet.  Another issue that is very painful to us all is Crimea. You  know, the voters will also base their decision regarding whom to  vote for in the presidential election in large measure on each  candidate's approach to the Crimean question. Thus when one of  them recently announced that he will do with Crimea what the  residents of that peninsula vote for, clearly sensible people  will not vote for him.    [Kravchuk] He simply does not understand certain fundamental  things. The question of Crimea is not something that concerns  only the population of Crimea; this concerns Ukraine as a whole.  Even if we were to consider the possibility of deciding Crimea's  status by referendum, this would have to be an all-Ukrainian  referendum. We have to remember that for forty years, I, my  parents, and yours have worked to develop Crimea. It was Ukraine  that did this -- I say this without exaggeration --the roads,  the water, the resorts -- everything that was possible to do.  Today, all of a sudden, they tell me that it is solely up to the  population that lives in the Crimea to decide the Crimean  question. What if this population decides it on the basis of the  national idea, for example, or some other idea? Am I to agree to  this? Under no circumstances. I firmly maintain the position  that the Crimea was and will remain part of Ukraine. The  constitutional recognition of this postulate is the starting  point and ultimate goal of building relations with the Crimea.  No other option is possible. If the Crimea chooses another  course, we will respond appropriately. You see, I made  concessions up to the point that territorial integrity became  the issue. Then I said: "You have crossed the red line." That  was the end. Whatever the Crimea passes, we revoke. I have  stated officially at all levels: "Ukraine -- yes, in accordance  with the constitutional regime -- yes. We will defend our  integrity and inviolability, and everyone must understand this."  Otherwise, the world will never respect us. A state, president,  or government that does not defend territorial integrity,  sovereignty, and inviolability of borders cannot be regarded as  a state, a president, or a government. My sole concern is to  avoid a clash, to avoid a confrontation. So far, we have been  successful. I can see the situation in the Crimea changing  before our eyes. The people have also realized that the moment  of what might be called general romanticism has passed, that the  limit has been reached and from now on we will work in  accordance with the constitution. And no declarations, no  threats that they will do something in the Crimea without us --  these are merely intentions, whereas the proof will be in  actions, and I am convinced that these actions will be in favor  of Ukraine.    [Bazelyuk] Moscow politicians are now promoting a new idea:  they say, why does Ukraine not establish relations with the  Crimea along the same lines as Russia's relations with  Tatarstan? What firm step can be taken to put an end to the  chauvinist bacchanal in the Crimea, where normal people are  anxiously awaiting just such a step?    [Kravchuk] Let me tell you about Tatarstan. The people who  recommend this solution have not read the agreement signed by  Yeltsin and Sheymiyev. I have read it. It contains federal  powers, Tatarstan's powers, and shared powers. The armed forces,  the organs of the ministry of internal affairs, and the security  organs are all under the jurisdiction of the federal government,  and Tatarstan has no say in these matters. Other key spheres are  also shared. In the Crimea, they even wanted to have their own  army and all the power structures; they wanted Ukraine to get  out completely. The Crimean leadership's position is that the  peninsula is an independent state and that its connection with  Ukraine is allegedly only a formality. The suggestion that we  should look to Tatarstan as a model is an insidious attempt at  deceiving people. I say, fine, let's read this agreement and you  will see that our law on the division of powers gives just as  many powers to the Crimean side. We can review them and add to  them. But on one condition only: that the Crimea is an  autonomous republic that is part of Ukraine, and we strike from  the agenda all territorial issues, all issues pertaining to a  review of borders, all talk of the Crimea wanting to leave  someplace and or go someplace, to unite with someone, because  1954 was supposedly a mistake. None of these issues should even  be raised.    [Bazelyuk] Allow me to return once again to the question of  your yieldingness with respect to the Black Sea Fleet. On 5  April 1992, you signed a decree subordinating the Black Sea  Fleet and the strategic armed forces to Ukraine. Subsequently,  you put a moratorium on your own decree. Then, in the process of  settling the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, we made significant  concessions to Russia. Even now, when the question of where the  Naval Forces of Ukraine are to be based is under discussion, our  forces are being offered Balaklava, where neither our large  surface ships, nor our large submarines will be able to enter  the bay, and Danuzlav, where ships can only move in one  direction.    [Kravchuk] Is that what members of the military say?    [Bazelyuk] Yes, members of the military say so. All the  same,  why has your decree of 5 April 1992 not been implemented in full  -- why are the strategic forces subordinated to Ukraine and the  Black Sea Fleet is not?    [Kravchuk] If you recall, the day after I issued my decree,  Yeltsin issued a decree of his own, subordinating the Black Sea  Fleet to Russia. And so there were two decrees -- mine and  Yeltsin's. The situation grew tense and could have become  explosive. If all the officers and sailors serving in the Black  Sea Fleet thought the way I wrote in my decree, if Sevastopol  were Lviv and the population had taken an appropriate stand, the  situation would have been different. It was necessary to relieve  the tension. Then Yeltsin said that he would suspend the  relevant article of his decree if I suspended mine until the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet was resolved. So much for the  record. Now let us examine the practical aspects. Let us pose  the question bluntly: will Russia leave Sevastopol today or not?    [Bazelyuk] She will if she is removed by force.    [Kravchuk] Exactly. You are correct in saying that the only  way to achieve this is to use force. But we will not remove  Russia from Sevastopol by force. Everyone understands this.  Force means fighting. Neither I, nor you wants this. That means  that the only option we have is to negotiate. Russia and her  president have declared officially that they cannot leave  Sevastopol at this time and that they will not do so. This  declaration has been made. I do not like it. I believe that  those who think in normal terms, in terms of international  categories and international legal norms, could make a series of  arguments to show that this statement is incompatible with  international standards. But the situation is what it is, and  this declaration has been made by a state that has power today.  This state issues a declaration not regarding Kiev directly; it  makes it with respect to Sevastopol. The Russian parliament  declares Sevastopol to be a Russian city, and this declaration  on the city's status has not been revoked to this day. That is  the first point. Secondly, although he does not say so publicly,  the Russian president, as well as other governing structures [in  Russia], believes that Crimea, 1954, were a mistake, that this  was Khrushchev's gift, and they consider the Crimea to be their  territory, even though they cannot say so publicly in the broad  nternational arena. This is why they say that they will not  leave Sevastopol. What do I do? I say: "No, you will leave."  What other steps are there? People say to me, let us appeal to  international organizations, to the UN. We will declare the  Russian troops to be foreign troops on our soil and then discuss  this issue for years. But tell me, what world organization can  order Russia to leave Sevastopol? Is there such an organization?  There is not. This means that whether I like or not, my  yieldingness on this issue is not a matter of my seeing a  realistic solution and failing to implement it, but a matter of  my understanding that the solution that is being proposed is  unrealistic and impossible to carry out.    People tell me to use force. Were there times in history  when  force was used to decide certain issues? There were. But I have  to know in advance that my force will win, and I am not  convinced of this. I once put this question to the former  minister of defense. We were sitting together in an airplane.  Talking just as you and I are talking right now. And I asked  him: "What is the current correlation of Ukrainian and Russian  forces in the Crimea?" One to six in Russia's favor. That was  then. With Kerch and Novorosiysk nearby. Should we create a  Karabakh there, start a fight that will remain part of history  forever? A war between two Slavic peoples. Two nations that  lived together for 340 years -- with bitterness, on bad terms,  with better and worse pages in their history, but nevertheless  living together, and then suddenly they should embark on a war  that will end in tragedy. Or we'll create another Yugoslavia.  That is what all this can lead to. I take into account not only  my own wishes, but also realistic possibilities, the correlation  of forces, the support of the world. Even if the world supports  us, this support will be purely declarative. Believe me, there  will be no direct intervention, because this involves Russia.    [Bazelyuk] We now have a Supreme Council, in which not only  have the Communists and Socialists taken over the top governing  posts, but they also head most of the commissions. Moreover,  they make declarations from the tribune about communist ideals  and talk of the upcoming anniversary of the Great October  Revolution. This may frighten off and turn away the world from  Ukraine as a communist preserve. What is your view of this  problem, Leonid Makarovych? After winning the presidential  election, will you include only leftists in your team, or will  you also recruit rightists, especially in light of the fact that  deputies from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists have now  won seats in parliament?    [Kravchuk] I know one thing: as long as I live and if I am  elected, I will never allow Ukraine to return to communist times  and will do everything in my power to prevent this. Anything  else means tragedy. Not only because the world may or may not  recognize us. This is important, but this is not a tragedy.  Ultimately, they will recognize us. The tragedy lies in the fact  that this would mean the complete end of Ukraine. If someone in  the Supreme Council thinks that it is possible to change  direction and that this will benefit the people, that we can  return to a time when everything will be cheap and everyone will  immediately have security, this is no more than a contemptible  and overt attempt to deceive the people. It is my duty to tell  people this frankly in order to prevent this from happening. Why  are they fighting so hard against President Kravchuk just now?  Do you think there are other reasons for this? No. Only because  I stand in their way. And not because I have a negative attitude  to some specific member of the party. This was never the case. I  am opposed to changing course and to any attempt to represent  these intentions as being good for Ukraine. They are bad for  Ukraine. People tell me that things are bad today in any event.  I don't deny this, but we are moving ahead and we will emerge  onto a civilized path -- we definitely will. Every nation has  lived through this plight. But if there is an attempt to change  course, we will not solve our problems. We will end up in an  even worse situation, and, moreover, one that will end in  tragedy. I know Galicia, and not only Galicia, but also the  center, and Kiev, and Kharkiv. Do you think that the director of  a plant wants someone to stand over him again, to summon him,  stifle him, trample him, force him to acknowledge that he is a  good-for-nothing if he wants to keep his job, otherwise get  sacked? He used to stand there and give his word while they  poured filth over him and let him keep his job. Do you think  that he wants more of this today? Most have long since had  enough. But there are still some left. Therefore, what the  people feel and what happens on the surface -- party passions,  fights, and all the rest -- are totally different. They say: the  people gave us their support. But that's because they lied.  Unfortunately, it is still possible to deceive our people.    [Bazelyuk] Does this mean that you see your main support as  coming from society, from the people, and not from parties?    [Kravchuk] From the people! Absolutely not from parties,  which are still too weak. Let us talk frankly about the  Communist Party, which I know better than anyone else. The  Communist Party had 3.5 million members in Ukraine. According to  the data I have, today this party numbers 250,000-300,000  members. Who has remained in its ranks? The best people that  once belonged to the party have already found themselves: one  works in the economy, another in the cultural sphere, another  still in politics. They have gradually changed their attitudes  and found themselves as people with an intellect, a certain  amount of training, and a certain orientation. And those who  have not found themselves and never will -- what do they want?  To take power. But such people will not be able to cope with  power. What do I have in common with these people today?    Take national-patriotism, for example. There is a segment  among these eople about whom you speak with whom it is possible  to have dealings, but there is also another segment, which knows  only one thing -- to fight. Pressure, war. Look at them. Those  are leftists and those are leftists. Those say -- take away, and  those say -- divide; those say -- hang them, and those say --  cut their heads off. Absolutely identical slogans, identical  aims. And I am to deal with them? To whom should I look for  support? The times are so very difficult. The people bore a  bouquet, and it is made up of both flowers and thistles. I do  not want to divide them into categories at this time and offend  them. Consequently, I said I would not ally myself with any  group. We have a constitution. Let them live in accordance with  the law and work -- that's democracy. But in the work of  defending the state, of moving the state forward -- to  democracy, to reform, the only support I can rely on today is  that of the people.    [Bazelyuk] With all your concerns, do you have time to visit  Rivne Oblast, your native region?    [Kravchuk] Unfortunately, I do not. Perhaps during this  campaign. You see, I am at a disadvantage. I have to perform the  duties of president and cannot delegate these duties to anyone.  There is no office of vice-president, and I cannot say: "Well,  boys and girls, you stay here, while I go out to fight for the  presidential chair." I cannot do this. I don't have enough time  to even think about the places where I was born [as published].    [Bazelyuk] But these are the places that have probably left  the most vivid impressions in your mind, are they not?    [Kravchuk] Only from my childhood. I have retained the  memory  of our picturesque Polissya landscapes. Sometimes, during my  travels, I see something and think -- this looks like home,  there is an orchard like that in our village. In these  comparisons, one's own native region always wins out, because,  consciously or not, one always thinks one's own is the best.  Perhaps I will manage to get to Rivne Oblast. I would like to,  but it's possible I won't be able to manage. But I will  definitely come to Lviv on 12 June.    [Bazelyuk] We are waiting for you. Thank you for this  interview, and I sincerely wish you victory in the presidential  election.</p>

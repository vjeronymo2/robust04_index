			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Union [EU] Foreign Trade Ministers  Council concluded their meeting at Zappion Palace, and  interesting points were revealed about the entry of Greek  products into Balkan and Asian markets.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Usually no  reports are issued on informal ministerial meetings, but a  significant exception was made for today's meeting, the first of  the Greek Presidency. Probably this is why European  Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan congratulated Ioannis Papandoniou,  the Council's president and the Greek deputy minister for  economy.    An advanced cooperation agreement was concluded with  Slovenia. Brittan said this shows the road to what could happen  if there is peace in the former Yugoslavia. An advanced  agreement will be signed if problems with Russia on nuclear  trade and financial aid are resolved. The Council is proceeding  well with the GATT agreement and will press the Japanese and  more Asians to open up their markets to products that interest  Greece such as leather, footwear, and drinks.    Discussing the Balkans, it was decided to upgrade relations  with Bulgaria and Romania. Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia asked  the commissioner what he would say on the political intervention  of some EU countries in favor of their own companies and against  Greek companies that are performing very well in Bulgaria. The  commissioner said that the EU Commission will do everything  possible to reaffirm free trade in European markets, which means  more influence for Greek companies in the Balkans.    [Papandoniou] The selection of GATT issues and relations  with  East Europe and Russia reflects both the EU needs in current  conditions and the Greek Presidency's priorities. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Scepticism over motives for Nigeria's fuel price pledge: IMF team to urge cut in petrol subsidies despite warnings of violence AN International Monetary Fund team due to arrive in Lagos today will be urging Nigeria to cut subsidies which make its petrol the cheapest in the world, despite warnings that a rise in fuel prices could prompt violence. Nigeria's civilian-led transitional council has pledged, in the face of widespread opposition, to reduce the subsidies on June 1, as part of a package designed to secure an agreement with the IMF. This would pave the way for rescheduling the country's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) debt to the Paris Club of official creditors, on which payment arrears exceed Dollars 3bn. But cutting the subsidy, say some observers, could lead to violence and further delay the handover by soldiers who have been in power since December 31 1983. President Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military ruler, who in December appointed the council to run the government until the scheduled handover to civilian rule in August, last week took what appeared to be a precautionary measure: the issue of a military decree giving Nigeria's electoral commission power to postpone the presidential poll set for June 12 if serious unrest becomes likely. 'It is obvious that an increase in the fuel price will automatically cause a breach of the peace,' the Lagos-based Committee for the Defence of Human Rights said. 'Thus, the decree is not just a pre-emptive, panicky measure but part of the grand design for perpetual clinging on to power by the military,' the CDHR statement said. Raising the price of the world's cheapest fuel (3 cents a litre) to the level of import parity would put an estimated N41bn (Pounds 845m) in government coffers. Much of the money would go on social services, say the council, but the public is sceptical. They fear the funds will be squandered like much of government revenue in the past. Fears have not been eased by the appointment of leading Nigerians to monitor the spending process. Trade unionists have threatened strikes, and church leaders have warned of mass demonstrations. Neither Mr Bashir Tofa, the National Republican Council's (NRC) presidential candidate, or Mr Moshood Abiola, his counterpart from the Social Democratic party (SDP), are prepared to swim against the tide of popular opinion, leaving Mr Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the council, to shoulder full responsibility, Mr Shonekan seems undeterred. With his tenure due to end in August, and with no need to seek a mandate from the electorate, he has pledged to take the hard decision which has been ducked by successive governments. In the meantime, smuggling of fuel into neighbouring states has increased in anticipation of price rises. Out of the 300,000 barrels of oil a day allocated to domestic use (total daily production averages around 2m bpd), as much as a third is thought to disappear across the borders. A tanker of fuel worth N40,000 at the official price can fetch N1.2m in a neighbouring country. Just what price will be set in June is still unclear. The state-owned petroleum corporation is considering a two-price structure, charging about N5 a litre for a new premium grade fuel and N0.7 for a lesser grade, which will be phased out. Some observers believe the impact of the increase will not be as bad as feared. For many motorists, they point out, the price of 3 cents a litre is notional: the combination of smuggling and breakdowns in refineries has meant that in much of the northern half of Nigeria they have to pay as much as N5 already. Nor should the rise in bus and taxi fares elsewhere in Nigeria match the fuel increase, as the country's experience with airline fares demonstrated. Last month, when the government raised the price of aviation fuel by 400 per cent, domestic airlines immediately increased fares by 500 per cent, although fuel accounts for a comparatively small part of their running costs. But passenger refusal to pay the new rates forced the airlines to limit the increase to 75 per cent. No doubt the IMF team will make these points themselves. But it will still require a steady nerve on Mr Shonekan's part to implement the most critical decision of his tenure.</p>

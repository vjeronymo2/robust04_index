The USDA has adequate facilities and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these ports to the list of designated ports will facilitate trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Marshall P.

Section 9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538[f]) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action would facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in section 24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section 24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened. (The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing the importation of plants through those ports.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a March 24, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (59 FR 13921), the Service proposed that the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, be listed as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service's March 24, 1994, notice invited the submission of written comments regarding the proposal for a 60-day comment period ending on May 23, 1994. One comment was received by that date, from a lumber company. The commenter fully supported the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for Public Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before the Secretary of the Interior confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service's March 24, 1994, notice invited public hearing requests, which were required to be received by the Service on or before May 9, 1994. No such requests were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Leading Article: Touts out Ticket touts, along with gypsies, squatters and new age travellers, rank high in current Tory demonology. This seems odd, given their obvious social utility in matching supply and demand in markets which have been distorted by bureaucratic pricing. Yet touts at Wimbledon or Wembley can suffer a variety of indignities ranging from prosecution under local authority by-laws to arrest by the police for obstruction. Now the Department of Trade and Industry is proposing to introduce regulations under Section 26 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to crack down on ticket agencies selling tickets for theatre, concerts, sporting and other events. It is not clear why, in dealing with these areas of the arts and leisure industries, the principle of caveat emptor should be cast aside in favour of intervention by the state. At many sporting events touts are simply jobbers operating in a competitive over-the-counter market. Their existence reflects the reluctance or inability of the organisers of sporting events to establish a more formal secondary market to permit the privileged insiders who initially receive the tickets to pass them on to others at close to their real economic value. People who are prepared to buy from touts usually know what risks they run. In the case of ticket agencies the argument is less clear cut. The agencies are, in the main, selling tickets for performances - Cats, the Phantom of the Opera - that are booked out for months ahead. To the extent that foreign or out-of-town tourists might find it difficult to book so far in advance, they do provide a service. The snag is that they can be unforthcoming about the original price of the ticket and other details of what the customer is receiving for the premium paid. Many theatres remain unconvinced that the agencies' operations really extend the run of any given performance. The merit of the DTI's proposals is that they are confined to requirements for disclosure of the original price and the details of seating, which will at least make for more transparency. Since the agencies are identifiable businesses, local authority trading standards departments should be able to follow up complaints. Yet the people arguably most in need of protection - foreign tourists - are the ones least likely to complain. It says something about the priorities of Mr Major's government that it thought this game worth the candle.</p>

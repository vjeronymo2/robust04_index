The Metropolitan Opera, one of  the original presenters, now says that the company is having trouble raising  funds and the Met is no longer involved in the tour. The three-city tour was to  have included stops in New York, Washington and Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Otherwise, here are some music and dance picks for the new year.  </P> <P> MUSIC  </P> <P> *The Pacific Symphony's search for a new music director resumes on Jan. 31 and  Feb. 1 when Boston Symphony assistant conductor Carl St. Clair will lead the  orchestra in a program of works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Joseph Canteloube at  the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> St. Clair is the latest conductor in series of guest conductors that so far  this season has included Lawrence Foster, Christopher Seaman, Stuart Challender  and Toshiyuki Shimada.  </P> <P> The contest continues on March 28 and 29 with Richard Buckley, former director  of the Oakland Symphony, and on May 23 and 24, with Sergiu Comissiona, former  New York City Opera conductor.  </P> <P> The Pacific's music adviser, Kazimierz Kord, who says that he is not a  candidate, will conduct two pairs of concerts, on April 18 and 19 and on May 2  and 3.  </P> <P> Orchestra officials say that a decision will be announced this year.  </P> <P> * The Philharmonic Society will sponsor a number of appearances at the Center,  including Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Orchester der Beethovenhalle,  Bonn, on March 30, Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting the Radio Symphony of West  Berlin on May 6, and Yuri Temirkanov leading the Philadelphia Orchestra on May  31.  </P> <P> * The Garden Grove Symphony will be led by Philippe Bender, music director of  the Orchestre Regional de Cannes, in a program of music by French composers on  June 2.

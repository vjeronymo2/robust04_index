			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F> unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Francois Leotard, thank you for  joining us in the studio. [passage omitted] My first question:  is the withdrawal of Serb heavy artillery real or not?    [Leotard] Yes, yes. Of course, there can be, here or there,  a weapon that might have been left behind, but these are only  exceptions, and these exceptions are in fact often condemned by  the Serbs themselves. In other words, to sum things up: about  50 percent of the weapons around Sarajevo -- and there were  indeed more of them than we thought -- have been pulled back  beyond the 20-km perimeter or taken to Pale, which is the  enclave where the Bosnian Serbs have their parliament. There is  a large concentration of weapons there. I have photos that show  this quite clearly, but they are allowed to keep them there,  since we had allowed a two-km zone around Pale, which was not  threatened by air strikes. The other 50 percent have been  gathered together in barracks, in emplacements controlled by  armed members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].    [Correspondent] So you are not worried by pictures showing a  few undeclared Serb weapons?    [Leotard] No, there might still be a few tomorrow morning.  You know, until recently, we did not have any helicopters in  Sarajevo. France sent two helicopters at first, then four, and  they are now going from hill to hill to control this perimeter,  which covers some 12-13,000 square km.    [Correspondent] Is this withdrawal just tactical or is it  sincere? Have the Serbs promised not to come back anywhere near  Sarajevo?    [Leotard] No, no, we simply said: If you do that, if you  keep  these weapons, we will bomb them, so they are either leaving or  being regrouped. Of course, if they were to come back -- this  must be quite clear to everyone -- if they were to come back, we  would bomb. That must be quite clear. Yesterday, we met in  northern Italy with defense ministers from America, Holland,  Great Britain, and we said we would maintain our air deployment,  and that we would keep to the conditions of the ultimatum. If a  weapon comes back, it will be bombed -- this must be quite clear  -- and if a shell were to land on the civilian population, we  would punish those who had fired it. All this must be quite  clear.    [Correspondent] So it is out of the question that they  should  shell Sarajevo again?    [Leotard] Out of the question. You may have heard that  General Cot repeated this today at my request, and I can repeat  it to you now: we came to an agreement with the allies and with  the other defense ministers in Italy yesterday, and the  deployment will be maintained. We have not set an end date for  that deployment.    [Correspondent] So any strike could happen without an  ultimatum, without warning?    [Leotard] Absolutely. We have no need, either for a new  meeting of the North Atlantic Council, or for a new meeting of  the Security Council. Everyone must know that, and we will keep  our deployment for as long as necessary.    [Correspondent] Both the president and the prime minister  have said that if they withdrew, it was because our firm stand  had paid off.    [Leotard] It is true. It is absolutely true. There is no  doubt that, because of the cohesion of the allies, because of  the cohesion of the French executive also, we showed that there  were no chinks in our determination.    [Correspondent] Why don't we show the same determination for  Tuzla, for Zepa? The fighting carries on outside Sarajevo. Why  don't we do the same thing there?    [Leotard] First, there is a material problem, a problem of  means. You know that France already has some 9,000 men on the  ground, by far the largest contingent. There is also a  scheduling problem. We are currently planning the Tuzla  operation....    [Correspondent interrupting] In other words?    [Leotard] In other words, we would like Tuzla airport, which  lies to the north of the Muslim-held pocket....[pauses] This  airport is very interesting for humanitarian aid. We want to  take control of this airport and ensure that if ever planes  bringing in humanitarian aid were attacked by the besieging  Serbs....[pauses] Well, there also we would like to strike.    [Correspondent] So you want to press home your advantage?    [Leotard] We want to press home our advantage. You might  remember that Tuzla and Srebrenica are two of the areas  considered at the NATO summit on 12 January. So we are still  pursuing this aim. Another aim could be to bring the greater  Sarajevo area under UN supervision -- this possibility was  already being considered last August -- and this would mean  taking on the civilian administration -- gas, water,  electricity, security.    [Correspondent] Let us imagine that after this NATO  ultimatum, calm were suddenly to return to the whole of Bosnia.    [Leotard] I am less confident about this than you are. I  fear alas that in certain areas -- Mostar, Bihac, Srebrenica, to  quote but a few -- the warring parties are in a situation where  shelling continues, sieges are under way as we speak. We have  to do something about this. I once said that there was a  terrible game in this land, a game of hatred, of violence. It  started off as a Serbian aggression, but now it is happening on  all sides, so this is a terribly difficult task for UNPROFOR.  We have to go about it sector by sector, town by town, with a  lot of tenacity.    [Correspondent] So let us be quite clear: NATO has won a  lull, but the war goes on.    [Leotard] It is a stage. As the president of the republic  said, it is a turning point in this crisis in this horrible war,  a turning point in the right direction, without doubt. The very  fact of seeing women and children walking outside, like human  beings in Sarajevo, this is a wonderful reward for UNPROFOR.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Francois Mitterrand said that Russia had had  a moderating influence in the crisis. Is this the right term?  Wasn't the West afraid of seeing a return to the cold war, with  Russia playing this rather strange game?    [Leotard] We must always be very careful, but I don't think  so. I am glad that the Russians are involved. Russia is in the  process of democratization, and I am glad that it contributes to  security issues in Europe. We wanted this. Alain Juppe said  so, and so did I. I went to see Russian Defense Minister  Grachev some two weeks ago, and Mr. Kozyrev, and told them this.  We wanted Russia to have this attitude. It is a positive  contribution, for now. Let us enjoy the sight of a European  city returning to life. [passage omitted].    [Correspondent] Thank you, Francois Leotard.</p>

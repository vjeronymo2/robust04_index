			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Baozhong (0002 1405 1813)] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Malaysia's "1994  Asia Defense Exhibition," scheduled to last for four days,  opened here today.    In his opening speech, Malaysian Defense Minister Najib  Razak  said more than 500 firms from 37 countries and regions are  participating in the exhibition. The reason why so many firms  from all parts of the world vigorously are taking part in this  exhibition is that Southeast Asia is one of the world's economic  centers experiencing a vigorous growth and that Southeast Asian  countries are now carrying out defense modernization.    The Malaysian Asia defense exhibition, held every two years,  began in 1988. This year's exhibition exceeds all previous ones  in scope. Many new weapons and equipment are displayed at the  impressive British, German, U.S., and Australian pavilions.    Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the Chinese  People's Liberation Army, attended the opening ceremony. He  also viewed the exhibition.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Countrywide Bank loss nears NZDollars 41m Countrywide Banking Corporation, of New Zealand, which is 86 per cent-owned by the Bank of Scotland, incurred an overall loss of NZDollars 40.9m (Pounds 11.6m) in the year to June 30, against profits of NZDollars 16.5m. The loss included doubtful debt provisions of NZ30.5m, and also allowed for a write-off of NZDollars 38m on the recent purchase of United Banking. Countrywide paid NZDollars 182.5m for United and that was initially funded by Bank of Scotland. Now Countrywide is to meet the purchase price by raising NZDollars 180m through a share issue, probably on a 3-for-2 basis at NZDollars 1.65 each.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Poor start for trading in Credito Italiano Shares in Credito Italiano, Italy's seventh biggest bank, which has just been privatised, fell yesterday on the first day's trading after investors received details of their allocations. The bank's stock reached a low of L2,200 (Dollars 1.29), against a closing price of L2,320 on Wednesday, before ending the day at L2,237. The shares, which had been expected to drop as speculators sold unwanted stock, were also hit by news of a tax investigation into large write-offs claimed by the bank in conjunction with the purchase of a loss-making company in 1987. Allocations of shares to thousands of retail investors had to be scaled back because of heavy demand in Italy's first mass privatisation. About 100,000 of more than 292,000 applications received from domestic retail investors will not be filled, while successful applicants will be limited to a maximum of 2,500 shares. About 70 per cent of the 840m ordinary shares being sold by the IRI state holding company will go to Italian investors. Around 60 per cent of IRI's stake has been bought by retail buyers, while 10 per cent will go to Italian institutional investors. The remaining stock has been sold outside Italy, with strong demand from the US and Europe. IRI is holding back a further 45m ordinary shares, to be used as a 'loyalty' bonus to retail investors who keep their holding for at least three years. Eventually, IRI will dispose of its entire 67 per cent stake in the bank's ordinary capital. The Credito Italiano flotation has already provided lessons for the Italian authorities, notably the Consob stockmarket watchdog. It was at Consob's behest that retail allocations were not scaled back below the 2,500 share minimum level, despite the fact that it became clear early in the issue that many applicants would not receive stock owing to high demand.</p>

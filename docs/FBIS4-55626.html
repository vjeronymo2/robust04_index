			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "Feuding Over a Senate That Only a </F> Few Seem to Want"]    [Text] The very same political leaders who made an  81-member Senate part of the Czech constitution now seem to be  wondering why anyone would have done such a thing. Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus, who in 1992 lauded the new constitution  as "superstable," now calls the Senate wasteful and claims he  would have fought against its inclusion if he wasn't so busy  working on the split of Czechoslovakia. Klaus' Civic Democratic  Party (ODS) played a dominant role in drafting the constitution  and getting it approved.    President Vaclav Havel says he only supports the Senate  because it's in the constitution. The opposition parties are  absolutely opposed to it.    Originally conceived as a basis for a stable democratic  system and a possible compromise post for outgoing deputies of  the Czechoslovak federal parliament, it has now become a thorn  in the side of the political establishment.    Despite the lack of political will to establish a Senate,  the  upper chamber seems firmly on its way to being formed in  late-1994 elections.    The three small parties that ensure Klaus' coalition  government a majority in parliament are pushing for a Senate  electoral system that will benefit non-mainstream parties by  having three representatives elected from each district.  Although he says he would rather not deal with the issue, Klaus  is holding out for a one-senator-per-district system that will  clearly benefit his popular Civic Democratic Party (ODS).    The issue has rocked the four-party governing coalition with  stormy meetings and no easy resolution in sight.    The origin of the Senate dates back to late 1992, when the  federation was falling apart. Federal parliamentary deputies  agreed to vote themselves out of their jobs, as long as they  could be included in a new Czech Senate or have some other  political function.    When the Czech National Council--by then the supreme  elective  body of the new independent country--turned around and voted the  proposal down, Klaus seemed to favor the inclusion of federal  deputies in a new Senate. Instead, the federal deputies were  sent packing, and the Senate remained nothing but a few lines in  the new country's constitution.    In a regular Sunday radio address, Havel said the  constitution should be upheld at all costs but couldn't help  adding that he has "never been a friend of the bicameral  parliamentary system." As president, Havel has roughly the same  powers that a Senate would have under the Czech constitution--if  it existed.    According to article 46 of the constitution, the Senate can  veto laws passed by the Chamber of Deputies, the existing lower  house of parliament. However, as in the case of a presidential  veto, the lower chamber can override the decision with a simple  majority vote. Apart from that, the Senate can do little. It  has no say on budgetary matters and cannot adopt constitutional  laws, election laws or international agreements.    Politicians from both the government and opposition ranks  have questioned the need to spend more money in order to set up  such a weak upper chamber in a relatively homogeneous country of  10 million.    The opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) has  proposed that the Senate be abolished from the constitution  altogether. "It's too expensive for our state and wasteful for  our parliamentary democracy," said CSSD deputy Eva Fischerova.  "We don't think it's necessary."    No cost estimate exists for the new body, according to  Miroslav Havel of the Finance Ministry. "For now," he said,  "they can all philosophize at the political level, but we don't  have any figures [on how much] it will all cost yet."</p>

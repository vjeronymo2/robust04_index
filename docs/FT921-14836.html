			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Index opens on Madrid exchange FUTURES and options contracts on a new index of Spanish stocks will start trading today on Meff, the Spanish futures and options exchange in Madrid. The Ibex 35 index is made up of the 35 most active Spanish stocks. The index, initially named Fiex 35, started trading in December 1990. Sixteen houses will make markets in the index contracts traded on Madrid's Meff, formerly known as Moffex. The exchange will trade all equity-related products under the umbrella of a holding company. Meff in Barcelona lists fixed-income instruments. The holding company is expected to be legally registered later this month, an official said. Meff in Madrid plans to launch individual stock option contracts later this year, probably in the summer, depending on the performance of the index products.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Helping staff to help others A novel 'trade fair' at which 40 voluntary organisations effectively compete for the free time and expertise of up to 35,000 British Airways employees will be staged near London today. Designed to achieve a better return on what BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall calls the airline's 'care capital' - the largely untapped energy, skills and enthusiasm of staff which can be donated to charitable causes - the initiative is likely to interest senior managers in other large companies. The main aim of the Community Partners Fair, to be held in a converted hangar at Heathrow today and tomorrow, is to identify and recruit mentors. These are individuals or groups of individuals among BA's staff prepared to adopt a particular charity and offer their skills on a one-to-one basis. As well as all employees working at head office, BA has invited its pensioners, whom the company believes are a potentially valuable voluntary resource. 'This is by far the largest exercise of its kind in Britain,' said the organisation Business in the Community approvingly last week. 'It is also an example of a company listening to its employees rather than betraying the signs of what we used to call the chairman's wife syndrome.' Gary Gray, BA's head of community relations, sees staff development as one commercial benefit for the airline but he also maintains that companies such as BA require a broader 'licence to operate'. He adds: 'We have listened carefully to those who say that time and skills can be just as useful as money. In our overall strategy in this area we are giving surplus resources which are of minimal use to us but which are of enormous value to the community as a whole.' Today's fair has been widely promoted within the airline, half of whose staff said in a survey last year that they wanted to be more involved in community projects. BA has even costed the manpower value of time volunteered in the 1993-94 financial year at Pounds 2.7m. 'We want our employees to come and see what's on offer and decide for themselves how best to help,' says Gray. Exhibitors range from local organisations, such as the Hounslow Afro-Caribbean Association and the West London Somali Association, to national charities including Age Concern, the British Red Cross Society and the Prince's Trust.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: A mute cry of injustice GENIE: ESCAPE FROM A SILENT CHILDHOOD by Russ Rymer Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99, 227 pages A BOOK wafted into a reviewer's hands on publicity puffs from such diverse sources as crime writer Ruth Rendell and linguistic theorist professor David Crystal looks immediately dubious. But some - like this - are much better than their PR people tell us. This is an interesting moral tale, with a central character who utters scarcely a word. Genie - not her real name - was discovered in a small Californian town in November 1970. Aged 13, she had spent all her life caged inside a single room, often inside a wire-mesh cot, trapped by a demented father and a weak, cowed mother. Having lived in almost complete silence Genie spoke not a word, instead communicating her basic urges by a variety of crude physical gesticulations. The moral outrage of the media which the case aroused swiftly gave way to the muddled clumsiness of bureaucratic care and scientific fascination. Psychotherapists, doctoral students, social workers, lawyers and linguistic analysts spent the next decade squabbling over who owned and had the right to analyse - exploit is not too strong a word - Genie. No one emerges with honour; each used her as a means of self-promotion, even while fiercely declaiming altruistic intent. Rymer considers previous cases of children brought up without language, the most famous perhaps being that of Victor of Aveyron, discovered in France in 1800. The appalling irony of Genie's case is it demonstrates that while science has progressed, humanity has not. Were this simply a gentle delineation of man's inhumanity to man it would scarcely be anything more than a familiar moral tale. What lifts it are Rymer's efforts to explore the debates concerning how language is learned and how important is the learning of language to intellectual development. He concludes that 'the organisation of our brain is as genetically ordained and as automatic as breathing, but, like breathing, it is initiated by the slap of a midwife, and the midwife is grammar.' It will be interesting to see whether this thoughtful book adds a further layer to the exploitation of Genie. It has all the ingredients of a Hollywood movie. Will Rymer be able to resist becoming the final player in a grisly, shaming script? Does it snow in Greenland? Well, not always.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 1619(b)_Special SSI Eligibility Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643 and section 5032 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508 amended section 1619(b) of the Act to provide changes in the eligibility requirements for special SSI eligibility status. We discuss below the changes we made to reflect the changes in the law, as well as related policy changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;416.264 to provide that special SSI eligibility status applies for purposes of reacquiring status as eligible for regular or special SSI cash benefits, as well as establishing or maintaining eligibility for Medicaid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;416.265 to remove the 65-year age limit for section 1619(b) eligibility status effective May 1, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also revised &sect;416.265 to reflect that an individual must have been eligible for a regular SSI benefit or a federally administered State supplementary payment in ``a month before the month,'' rather than ``the month before the first month,'' for which eligibility for special SSI eligibility status is being determined. The month the individual was eligible for a regular SSI benefit or federally administered State supplementary payment may not be in a prior period of eligibility which has terminated according to &sect;&sect;416.1331&hyph;416.1335. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;416.265(b) to reflect that an individual, except for earnings, must ``meet,'' rather than ``continue to meet,'' all nondisability requirements for SSI eligibility in the month for which the determination is being made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These two changes permit special SSI eligibility status for Medicaid purposes following one or more months of suspension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;416.265(d) to add that we will consider publicly funded attendant care services, in addition to SSI benefits, federally administered State supplementary payments, and Medicaid, when determining whether an individual's earnings are sufficient to allow the individual to provide a reasonable equivalent of the benefits which would be available if the individual did not have those earnings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;416.268 to add that an individual may establish the need for Medicaid eligibility to continue working (see &sect;416.265(c)) by showing that Medicaid benefits would be needed to pay for unexpected medical expenses in the next 12 months. Previously, we considered only past or expected Medicaid use. This policy change adds consideration of the individual's ability to pay for unexpected medical expenses to the factors that can meet the statutory provision that termination of Medicaid would seriously inhibit the individual's ability to continue working. We believe the proposed change is consistent with the intent of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643 because such individuals, if not accorded section 1619(b) status, might be forced to stop working in order to get Medicaid to pay for unexpected medical expenses. This change enables individuals without recurring medical expenses or expectation of expenses to meet the requirement if they cannot provide for their own medical care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also deleted former paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;416.268, which required an individual's signed statement about use or expected use of Medicaid and verification, as necessary, of past services with the service providers or the State agency administering the Medicaid program. This change permits us to determine the need for Medicaid in order to continue working based on information provided by the individual. Our operational experience shows that the individual's knowledge about use or expected use of Medicaid is almost always valid and, therefore, verification results in unnecessary administrative burdens and costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Temerko, president of the </F> "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation, by correspondent  Valentin Rudenko; date and place not given: "The Future Lies  With Financial-Industrial Groups"]    [Text] The "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation was  formed on 10 June 1993. It includes concerns and corporations  which produce basic types of arms and military equipment (the  "SMM" Joint-Stock Company -- armored equipment and artillery  systems; the "Aviaprom" Joint-Stock Company -- combat aircraft;  the "Metallkhim" Joint-Stock Company -- ammunition and  gunpowder; the "Nord-Vest" Joint-Stock Company -- surface ships  and submarines; the "Optomprom" Joint-Stock Company --  electro-optical instruments; the "Vityaz" Joint-Stock Company --  small arms, antitank guided missiles, and portable  surface-to-air missile systems; the "Antey" Science and  Production Association -- S-300V, "Tor," and "Buk"  surface-to-air missile systems; and the "Rosobshchemash"  Joint-Stock Company -- space systems and missiles), and also the  "Voyentekh" State Company for the Sale of Arms and Military  Equipment and others.    The Council of Directors is headed by Stanislav Chernov,  formerly general director of the Kirov Plant and USSR first  deputy minister of the defense industry, now president of the  "Spetsialnoye Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya" Concern.  Aleksandr Temerko, formerly head of the Committee for the  Social Welfare of Military Servicemen, has been elected  president of the "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation.    [Rudenko] Aleksandr Viktorovich, as is well known, the idea  of financial-industrial groups is not new. They form the basis  of industrial might in most economically developed countries. A  number of large industrial enterprises in Russia have now  decided to set up something similar here. But do the objective  conditions for this exist?    [Temerko] The conditions have existed for some time.  Moreover, I am convinced that setting up financial-industrial  groups will become a priority aspect in the structural  reorganization of Russia's entire economy, as it perhaps offers  the only possibility at present to preserve our national  scientific, technical, and industrial potential, including at  enterprises, design bureaus, and scientific research institutes  in the defense complex.    Whereas previously the military-industrial complex worked  virtually 100 percent for the state and, naturally, was fully  financed from the budget, the situation now is drastically  different. At best, the defense order does not exceed 40-45  percent of total output, although it is generally 5-15 percent  with regard to aircraft firms, for example. Moreover, as a  rule, money is only allocated for this purpose after long delays  and is eaten up to a considerable extent by galloping inflation.  Tell me, is it possible in these conditions to supply the Armed  Forces in full with the weapons systems they need and at the  same time produce competitive export models of combat equipment?  Of course not.    The absence of budget finance has prompted large defense  firms to set up financial-industrial groups, which incorporate  financial structures -- banks, investment and insurance  companies, management firms, and so forth -- in addition to  leading design bureaus, series production plants, and  enterprises supplying components. This process was spontaneous  at first, but now it has a normative base: The Russian  Presidential Edict on the Formation of Financial-Industrial  Groups. The essence of this edict can briefly be summed up as  follows: It gives the right to attract nonbudgetary resources  -- both one's own and those of commercial structures  incorporated in financial-industrial groups -- to solve tasks,  including tasks relating to the defense complex, and creates the  conditions for these groups to work in practice.    For example, the good idea of forming mobile forces has been  put forward, but there is no money in the budget to supply them  with the latest combat equipment. Financial-industrial groups  could find the money. But only on the condition that money  spent on the production of defense equipment will be regarded as  direct investments to meet state needs, will be exempt from tax,  and will be given the necessary government preference.    The Defense Ministry must coordinate all work connected with  ordering weapons systems, regardless of whether they are paid  for from the budget or not.    Given the obvious inadequacy of the state defense order,  financial structures' participation in investments will allow  industrial enterprises to keep their cadres, continue their  present specialization, and manufacture competitive defense  equipment for the domestic and foreign markets. For commercial  banks which are past the formative period and eager for  large-scale activity, including the possibility of direct  competition with foreign banks, an alliance with industry also  signifies a qualitatively new evolutionary step.    [Rudenko] Tell me, how do you envisage the mechanism for  combining financial and industrial capital, and what function  will the "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation assume in this  process?    [Temerko] Our corporation, whose founders and partners  include leading producers of arms and combat equipment and large  financial structures, has a highly skilled apparatus, so it sees  its main task as being able to secure investment in production  programs within the framework of financial-industrial groups,  and also to monitor the management of financial resources so  that a complete cycle of cooperation can be established as far  as possible. Another important aspect of our activity will be  to create the right conditions in the market of sale. Moreover,  in some cases, the special corporation may fulfill the functions  of a controlling company within financial-industrial groups  being set up. But in any case the financial-industrial group  will remain a closed, independent finance and production  structure.    Although financial-industrial groups have been discussed for  some time, unfortunately none have been legally registered so  far. There are prototypes, but they are not proper  financial-industrial groups, so all the work to set them up  still lies ahead.    In our view, financial-industrial groups must not simply be  a  focus of powerful scientific and industrial potential; they must  also actively market their products on the domestic and foreign  markets. They will have considerably more favorable  opportunities to present and promote their products in the  broadest sense at international exhibitions and simply in direct  competition with foreign firms. That is why  financial-industrial groups must have the right to engage in  independent foreign economic activity relating to products they  create with resources they attract.    [Rudenko] But how does this tie in with the state monopoly  on arms sales and with the current restructuring of  military-technical cooperation?    [Temerko] You mean the reduction in specialist exporters and  the formation of "Rosvooruzheniye" on the basis of three large  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations foreign trade state  companies which export and import arms and military equipment  and, at the same time, duplicate one another? In principle, we  feel this is the right step to take -- particularly now, when  our industry and economy are undergoing reform.    On the basis of last year's results, military-technical  cooperation amounts to something in the region of $2.2 billion,  if you count money received for technical assistance. But there  are fears that this figure could be substantially lower by the  end of the year. Heaven forbid that it should fall below the  critical 1 billion mark. The main task facing "Rosvooruzheniye"  now is to prevent a possible massive slump, hold on to the main  markets, and thereby support industry, for which export orders  have recently acquired very serious significance.    Our special corporation is not a direct arms exporter, but  we  intend to do our utmost to promote the sale of our country's  arms and combat equipment abroad and to extend technical  assistance through investment and by lobbying in favor of  various decisions both here and abroad.    As far as the state monopoly on arms sales is concerned,  this  must, of course, continue. But, as Western countries'  experience shows, it certainly must not only take the form of  reducing the number of specialist exporters, but must also be  reflected in strict regulation of military-technical cooperation  by means of legal conditions and arms export laws. In the  United States, for example, more than 100 firms are authorized  to sell military defense products. Approximately the same  system operates in France, Germany, and a number of other  countries which have a large share in the sale of arms and  combat equipment. In turn, involving more structures in the  export of goods intended for military-technical purposes helps  to expand markets. Unfortunately, we still do not have a law on  military-technical cooperation.    In short, the system of selling arms must be more flexible,  particularly now, when defense enterprises are being  denationalized and turned into joint-stock companies. Not only  specialist exporters, but also other state structures should  concentrate on winning new markets. So far, there has been a  regrouping at the level of "trading" organizations. There were  three specialist exporters, now there is one. This must be  followed by structural changes in state bodies of administration.    [Rudenko] You mean the creation of a special body of  administration which could rapidly respond to any change in the  situation and monitor and coordinate military-technical  cooperation?    [Temerko] Exactly. At present, these functions are, to a  certain extent, the responsibility of the Commission for  Military-Technical Cooperation. For all its pluses, this  commission does not have an adequate apparatus. For objective  reasons, it cannot embrace the whole range of problems.    In the interests of government regulation and monitoring of  military-technical cooperation in accordance with the Russian  Federation presidential edict of 12 May 1992, it would be  advisable to form a Russian Federation committee for  military-technical cooperation with foreign countries within the  structure of federal bodies of executive power. This committee  would ensure balanced export orders by means of both centralized  allocations and nonbudgetary resources; fulfill the functions of  licensing arms exports (and imports); coordinate the activity of  financial-industrial groups both here and on the foreign market;  and promote Russian producers' inclusion in the system of  international integration relating to the defense industry,  which would, of course, help to give our arms and  military-technical goods access to world markets.    In addition, in my view, greater powers to fulfill these  functions must be given to the Defense Ministry, as a general  buyer of arms and military equipment. The military department  has all the structures for this.    The Defense Ministry is in a better position than anyone to  influence regional policy through its developed network of  military missions. This does not mean that military attaches  must become traders. But they can do a perfectly professional  job of selecting clients, checking out their honesty and ability  to pay, and analyzing in which markets we are threatened with  losing our positions and which weapons are needed by which  country at any given point in time.    More vigorous, bold efforts must be made to sell combat  equipment from Defense Ministry stocks. It is cheaper and is  snapped up in markets where we have influence. As is right and  proper, 70 percent of the profits would be used to tackle social  problems, and the remaining 30 percent to update arms and  finance the defense order. It is estimated that 30 percent of  the proceeds from the sale of one tank would be sufficient to  build three or four new tanks. As is well known, the  "Voyentekh" State Company, set up on the Defense Ministry's  initiative and approved by the Russian president, is responsible  for selling combat equipment and arms from military department  stocks.    [Rudenko] Aleksandr Viktorovich, the various directions in  which the economic reforms could continue are currently being  debated in the press. I would like to hear your point of view  on the subject.    [Temerko] As far as defense production is concerned,  strictly speaking, no reforms are being undertaken at present.  There is just an ad hoc response to the various situations that  arise. A situation arose with bad debts and mutual nonpayments,  to which there was a response. But even that was half-hearted.    The defense industry can and wants to produce modern weapons  systems, but the appropriate conditions must be created for it  to do this, instead of forcing it to engage in nonspecialized  conversion. The Defense Ministry and the government have  already taken some strategic steps in this direction. The basic  principles of a military doctrine and an arms program have been  drawn up and adopted. In this particular case,  military-technical cooperation should be regarded as an  inalienable part of the government's economic reforms.    If we are really concerned about preserving the unique  scientific and technical potential of the defense complex and  restoring its former glory and might, all opportunities must be  taken at all levels. There are no ready-made solutions for  extricating the defense industry from crisis, and there never  will be.</p>

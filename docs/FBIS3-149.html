			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good evening! Some progress has been reached in the  discussions of specific principles and modalities on national  reconciliation. Some sources said today that agreement had been  reached in more than half of the issues on specific principles  and modalities. The sources said agreements had been reached on  issues, such as administrative centralization and the  participation of the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA] in the country's administration. What now  remains is the definition of the percentage of UNITA's  participation in the central and provincial governments and the  news media. Other issues still to be discussed are connected  with the Constitution of the Republic, the granting of a special  status to Jonas Savimbi, and the recovery of UNITA's property.    Meanwhile, another reliable source in the peace talks  neither  confirmed nor denied this information. He said, however, that  an agreement on specific principles and modalities could be  reached this week. If this agreement is reached, the parties  will once and for all resolve the national reconciliation issue.  Once this is done, the peace talks will have practically been  concluded, since the next issue will be the mandate of the UN  Angola Verification Mission, which is already at an advanced  stage. A special envoy of Bill Clinton arrives in Lusaka  tomorrow to work for some days with Alioune Blondin Beye,  special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, to  prepare U.S. participation in economic and humanitarian  assistance to Angola after the coming into force of the  cease-fire. Bill Clinton's special envoy is expected to meet  with [words indistinct].    Here in Lusaka, reports say the government has already  reached an agreement with the mediators and observers on all  issues [words indistinct] by the mediators on specific  principles and modalities on national reconciliation, but UNITA  has not yet [words indistinct]. It worked alone during the  second half of this afternoon to once again examine the document  from the mediators and observers.</p>

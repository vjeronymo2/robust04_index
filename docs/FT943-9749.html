			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goldstar merger meets opposition Shareholders in Goldstar, South Korea's second largest electronics company, are opposing plans for its merger with loss-making Goldstar Telecommunications, a sister subsidiary of the Lucky-Goldstar group. 'It's one of the first times that institutional shareholders have complained about a corporate merger in Korea,' said Mr Andrew Holland, head of research at BZW Securities in Seoul. Corporate mergers are usually non-controversial affairs in Korea because of the close cross-holdings arrangements among subsidiaries of the country's main conglomerates and the normally passive role of shareholders. Goldstar said the merger, which will occur at the beginning of 1995, will strengthen efforts to enter the multimedia business. Shareholder objections focus on two areas. One is that the merger terms, under which 10 common shares of Goldstar Telecommunications will be traded for four Goldstar common shares, are too generous considering the telecommunications company's large debt/equity ratio of 1,768 per cent. The other complaint is that the merger threatens to slow down what has been a rapid rise in profit growth for Goldstar during the past 18 months. Goldstar reported net profits of Won65.6bn (Dollars 81.7m) last year and Won79.2bn for the first half of 1994. In contrast, Goldstar Telecommunications had a loss of Won23.7bn last year and an estimated loss of Won10bn for the first half of 1994. The losses result from interest payments on its debt of Won418bn and price-cutting in the heavily-competitive area of telephone equipment, which is the main business of Goldstar Telecommunications. Analysts believe Goldstar shareholders will not be able to stop the merger but may demand that the company repurchase their shares, which could increase pressure on Goldstar profits. The merger must be approved at a shareholders' meeting on September 29. The largest shareholder in Goldstar is Lucky, the group's petrochemical unit, with a 6 per cent share.</p>

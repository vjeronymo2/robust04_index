			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cut in interest boosts Cussins Property Cussins Property Group, the residential property developer, reported profits of Pounds 740,000 pre-tax for 1992, against losses of Pounds 365,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 16.3m. The main reason was a fall in interest charges from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 657,000. The company said a large part of the comparable figure related to discontinued activities. Borrowings were also cut over the 12 months from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 6.5m. A tax credit of Pounds 733,000 (Pounds 150,000) helped earnings increase to 10.3p (losses 1.9p). However an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.71m (Pounds 2.36m), including a full provision on commercial property, left the loss for the year at Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 2.58m).</p>

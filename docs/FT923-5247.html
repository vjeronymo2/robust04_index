			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (19): Barriers to a high speed breakthrough - Michael Donne, on this page, weighs prospects for stretched variants of Concorde and the Jumbo ALTHOUGH there is much interest in the world airline industry in the development of a second-generation supersonic airliner to replace the Concorde, it is unlikely that any such aircraft will emerge before the year 2005, if then. The reasons - environmental, technological and financial - are the 'three keys to success' in the aerospace industry. They are closely related, and without all being fully addressed, no second generation supersonic airliner - called the High-Speed Commercial Transport or HSCT - will ever materialise. Many long-haul airlines believe that an HSCT will be desirable into the next century - although not necessarily essential - if only because, as a result of traffic growth, there will be many more people flying long distances, especially over the oceans, who will want to reach their destinations quickly. This will be particularly true for trans-Pacific flights, which already take many hours in even the fastest subsonic jets, such as the Boeing 747-400. It is believed that with an HSCT cruising at a speed of about Mach 2.4 (or about 1,500 mph, faster than Concorde's Mach 2 or about 1,200 mph), with a range of about 5,000 miles, it would be possible to fly between Los Angeles and Tokyo non-stop in about 4.3 hours, instead of today's subsonic 10.3 hours, or between Los Angeles and Sydney in about 7.3 hours, with one stop in Honolulu for refuelling, instead of today's one-stop subsonic journey time of 15.8 hours or 14 hours non-stop. Such an aircraft would carry up to 300 passengers, instead of Concorde's 100, at fare levels broadly comparable to today's subsonic rates. If such an aircraft could be built at an economic cost the market would probably run to several hundred aircraft. While small in comparison with many subsonic types of jet airliner built over the past 40 years or so, that would still make it exceptionally successful compared with the total of 16 Concordes that entered service with British Airways and Air France (subsequently reduced as some aircraft have been taken out of service for use as 'spares pools'). But to achieve that will take considerable time, money and technological expertise, going far beyond the research effort put into the Concorde. The environmental problems, severe enough for the Concorde, will be far more difficult to overcome with an HSCT, in view of the significant growth of world-wide environmental concerns in recent years. Noise will be especially critical. The aircraft's engines will need to be much quieter than those of Concorde, because although much of the HSCT's flying will be done at very high altitudes and supersonic speeds over the world's great oceans, especially the Pacific, it will still need to land and take-off at existing airports, some far inland, requiring extensive subsonic flight (to avoid the disturbance of sonic boom) until the oceans are reached. Moreover, in recent years, international aircraft noise regulations have been progressively toughened, and it is unlikely that any relaxation will be made for any new HSCT. The engines will also have to be much more efficient, so as to save fuel and keep direct operating costs down, while also reducing if not eliminating pollutant emissions, especially nitrous oxides in the upper atmosphere. This will call for new forms of engine, with improved combustion processes. Much research is already being undertaken in these areas, but so far without a suitable production engine emerging. The aircraft will also need to make considerable use of high-temperature resistant materials, such as ceramics, especially in the form of new composites, capable of coping with the extremely high temperatures that will be generated both inside the engines and on the skin of the aircraft for the longer periods of sustained and faster supersonic cruise than Concorde is called upon to perform. Although several companies have produced individual design studies - notably Aerospatiale of France, Boeing of the US and British Aerospace - seen as models on elaborate display stands at international air shows  - these are little more than the reflections of designers' dreams and do not mean that an acceptable design is just round the corner. The major airframe companies in the US (Boeing and McDonnell Douglas), Western Europe (Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace) and in Japan, and now also Russia in the CIS, have been working on the many aspects of the HSCT for some time, pooling knowledge where they can, in an effort to reach some kind of consensus on precisely what kind of aircraft the market wants, when it is likely to want it and how big that market is likely to be. The American industry, backed by the long-running and extensive HSCT research programme master-minded by the Government's National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and supported by the vast technological knowledge emanating from its missile and manned space programme, is the most advanced in HSCT studies and is certainly the most confident, the overall attitude being that the basic question is not whether an HSCT will ever emerge, but when. Concorde entered service in 1976, but because its annual utilisation rate is low compared with subsonic jets (about 1,000 hours a year per aircraft compared with about 5,000 for a Boeing 747-400), and because of its careful maintenance, it will probably be able to continue in service until the early years of the next century. Many HSCT supporters therefore target the year 2005 as a suitable in-service date for the second-generation aircraft. They believe that technologically that is an achievable target, given the pace at which aerospace technology has been and is likely to continue accelerating. But others believe that if a later date, say 2010, is targeted, there is more time for further research, thereby improving the design and enhancing the ultimate environmental, technological and economic acceptability of the aircraft. The last aspect of that argument is the most important. Finding the answer to the timing of any HSCT is made more difficult because it will depend not so much on technological progress or environmental acceptability, as on finance. That, in turn, is where the project ceases to be an industrial matter, and becomes political. There are several possibilities. If the US aerospace industry can convince its government that an HSCT is worth developing, either as a purely commercial venture or one with both commercial and military uses, it is possible that the US Government may at some time consider subscribing part of the money, with the US industry itself subscribing the rest. Some other governments might be happy to see that situation emerge, given the high cost of developing such an aircraft. No one really knows yet what the cost is likely to be, but estimates have put it at upwards of Dollars 15bn for the entirely new airframe and engines that will be needed. No single company, even in the US, can afford that sort of money - especially with other large subsonic aircraft commitments under way, such as the current studies for a subsonic Ultra-High Capacity Aircraft (UHCA). The high potential cost would also make it difficult for the aerospace industries of Western Europe and Japan to get their own governments to think in terms of investing in a competitive collaborative HSCT of their own - a kind of 'Supersonic Airbus Consortium'. Moreover, a competitive European, or Euro-Japanese, venture would be an expensive option, with no guarantee of success. For while it would provide the alternative project the airlines would welcome, it would be disastrous financially if the anticipated market proved too small to sustain two ventures. A more sensible scenario would be for all the other governments to persuade the US to embark upon a single collaborative project on a global basis, with everyone subscribing some part of the cash, picking up some part of the development and production, and getting some part of the market in return. Experience of getting big international collaborative aerospace ventures off the ground indicates that launching an HSCT in such a way would be tough, involving long and complex negotiations. But it would not be impossible, and at least a start has been made in the existing internationally collaborative preliminary research programmes and market studies that have been under way at company level for some time. Given the right kind of encouraging noises from the rest of the world's aerospace industries and their respective governments, the US government itself might be willing to consider such a possibility. Economic facts would appear to indicate that only in that way will any HSCT stand any chance of success.</p>

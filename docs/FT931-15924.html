			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Playing away from home - Practical Traveller: Nicholas Woodsworth says commonsense precautions can minimise health risks - from viruses to dodgy food and water - and offers suggestions for coping with the uncertainties and frustrations of travel in Africa WHERE IN the world is it safe to travel? The answer, in the age of modern medicine, should be 'everywhere.' But it isn't. While medical science advances every day, so does global poverty and the bacteria, parasites, viruses, infections and diseases it breeds and spreads. Health risks to the traveller are in many cases greater than ever; short of staying at home and locking the door, there is no way of avoiding exposure to them. A few examples illustrate the point. A generation ago, new chloroquine-based drugs were highly effective in preventing malaria in tropical travellers. These days, many strains of malaria - some of them lethal - have developed drug resistance and every year now there are 2,500 cases of malaria brought back to the UK. Cholera, a disease for which vaccination is no longer obligatory, has made a comeback in South America and Africa. Aids continues unchecked: as many as 10m are now thought to have the virus worldwide. Not even the Mediterranean, Britain's favourite holiday area, is safe these days  - a diluted sewer, it now receives 2bn tonnes of sewage annually. Nor are Britain's coasts clean - up to half the country's beaches fall below EC hygiene standards. Travel may sound like a dangerous pastime, but it need not be. There are more than 25m trips made from Britain every year, and an upset stomach is the worst most of these travellers will experience. If risks cannot be avoided, a few commonsense precautions can minimise them to the point where they are worth taking. Some of the most important: FOOD HYGIENE. It is known by 1,000 euphemisms, but by any name diarrhoea is by far the traveller's most common complaint. In areas where the local water supply is suspect (most of the developing world), drink bottled water, avoid ice and salads, and eat only fruits and vegetables which you can peel yourself. Avoid milk products, food that has not been freshly prepared, and stay away from shellfish - only 4 per cent of Mediterranean shellfish-growing areas produce seafood fit to be eaten. The cost of a meal is no guarantee of its safety: five stars in the lobby says nothing about what goes on behind kitchen doors. Water purification equipment, medical kits and advice on self-treatment of intestinal infection, all vital in some areas, can be obtained from Medical Advisory Services for Travellers Abroad, the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tel (London): 071-631-4408. MALARIA. Today malaria is the second most common health complaint among travellers. With drug resistance now making many treatments wholly or only partly effective, informed advice on anti-malarial medication is vital. The Malarial Reference Laboratory (tel: 071-636-7921) provides free advice for individual countries. Specialists increasingly emphasise the importance of not being bitten by mosquitoes in the first place. In malarial areas use repellant liberally and wear long sleeves and trousers, especially in the early morning and evening. Use mosquito nets. Those impregnated with Permethrin are particularly effective. Malarial symptoms - fever, sweating, chills or headache - can develop up to one year after initial infection. Frequently, and sometimes tragically, symptoms are incorrectly diagnosed simply because the sufferer has failed to tell his doctor of a trip abroad. AIDS. It seems silly to note such an obvious and avoidable risk, but statistics continue to make a nonsense of human rationality: despite the fact that 70 per cent of Bangkok prostitutes are believed to be HIV positive, at least one-third of foreign male visitors to Thailand purchase their services. SUNSHINE. We all love to return home well tanned, and shrug off sun-burn as an integral part of holidaying. Take note, however, of the Australians, formerly the most passionate sun-worshippers: today very few are found on beaches without heavy protection from sunlight. Skin cancer has been clearly linked not just to long-term exposure to the sun, but also to short, intensive episodes of sunburn. There are literally thousands of other illnesses one could contract through foreign travel. Although most travellers' chances of contracting serious diseases are small, food and water, animals, insects and other people are all channels for infection. The best prevention is knowledge - knowing the risks and how to avoid them - and this is best obtained before going abroad. The most useful single volume of information is Traveller's Health (edited by Richard Dawood, Oxford University Press, Pounds 7.99). GPs are rarely well informed of health conditions overseas. Precise and up-to-date data on specific destinations, however, can be obtained from one of more than 30 British Airway travel clinics in the UK. Tel: 071-831-5333 for details. Like the BA clinics, Thomas Cook, 45 Berkeley Street, London (tel: 071-499-400) also gives vaccinations and information on travel destinations. While the British government still feels fit enough to fund it, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 4 St Pancras Way, London (tel: 071-387-4411) remains one of the best travellers' treatment centres in the world.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have, however, added a definition of the term ``low-stress pipeline'' to &sect;195.2, based on the present wording of &sect;195.1(b)(3). The definition enabled us to clarify that a pipeline (in the sense of a continuing run of pipe and components used for transportation) must operate from beginning to end at 20 percent or less of SMYS to qualify as a low-stress pipeline. In drafting the final rules, the definition also allowed us to simplify the wording of several proposed rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Applicability of Design and Construction Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One proposed rule simplified by using the term ``low-stress pipeline'' was &sect;195.401(c)(5). The purpose of this proposed rule was to state that the design and construction requirements of part 195 would not apply to low-stress pipelines on which construction begins before the effective date of the final rule. Several commenters thought proposed &sect;195.401(c)(5) lacked clarity. So we revised it in the style of similar provisions of &sect;195.401(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, one commenter pointed out that proposed &sect;195.401(c)(5) would not except existing low-stress pipelines from design and construction rules applicable to certain interstate and intrastate pipelines under &sect;&sect;195.401(c)(1)-(3). The final rule resolves this drafting problem by excluding low-stress pipelines from the interstate and intrastate designations under &sect;&sect;195.401(c)(1)-(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Cathodic Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.414, Cathodic protection, is amended in paragraphs (b) and (c). We separated requirements applicable to low-stress pipelines from existing requirements applicable to interstate and intrastate pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Advisory Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee is a federal advisory committee established under Section 204 of the HLPSA (49 App. U.S.C. 2003). The committee advises DOT on the feasibility, reasonableness, and practicability of standards proposed under the HLPSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 4, 1993, the Committee met in Washington, D.C. and discussed the NPRM. After due deliberation, the committee voted unanimously in favor of the proposed rules. The Committee's report and a transcript of the meeting are available for inspection in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Regulatory Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule will increase current information collection burdens under parts 195 and 199. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved this increased burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended (44 U.S.C. Chap. 35). The OMB approval numbers are 2137&hyph;0047, 2137&hyph;0578, 2137&hyph;0579, and 2137&hyph;0587.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OMB considers this final rule a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993). Therefore, OMB has reviewed this final rule. DOT considers this final rule significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments RSPA received on the draft regulatory evaluation of costs and benefits are summarized and discussed in the final regulatory evaluation. The final evaluation, which shows that this final rule will result in net benefits to society, is available for review in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the facts available about the anticipated impact of this rulemaking action, I certify, pursuant to Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605), that the action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Few small entities operate low-stress pipelines subject to this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685). RSPA has determined that the action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 195  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ammonia, Carbon dioxide, Petroleum, Pipeline safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR part 195 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SAIF takes 30% stake in Golden Charter The consolidation of the UK funeral industry took another step yesterday with the sale to the Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors of a 30 per cent stake, valued at Pounds 3m, in Golden Charter, a provider of pre-paid funeral plans. SAIF, formed in 1989, represents 500 independent funeral directors. Its members make up two thirds of the funeral directors who sell Golden Charter's plans. Mr Michael France, president of SAIF, said the deal would allow 'every independent funeral director to compete in the growing funeral planning market'. The two parties said they had been in discussions for some time but the deal had been accelerated by recent moves in the UK market. Mr Gordon Kee, chief executive of Golden Charter, said he expected the pre-paid funeral business to expand by 30 to 40 per cent over the next 10 years. There is no immediate cash payment and the consideration depends on Golden Charter achieving profitability and growth targets. Mr Kee said details of these would be disclosed in the new year. Golden Charter is jointly owned by Mr Kee and Mr Andrew Harvey.</p>

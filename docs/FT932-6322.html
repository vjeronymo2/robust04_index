			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fledgling Shanghai Metals Exchange is world's third largest THE FLEDGLING Shanghai Metals Exchange has become the world's third largest one year after its opening, but the first anniversary this week of its formation has not proved particularly auspicious. The market, in line with the slide on other metal exchanges, plunged to its lowest point since its opening. An exchange spokesman said trading had become more volatile since a Reuter link was installed this week. Traders were now reacting to up-to-the-minute reports of price movements in London and New York. By May 24, the SHME had traded 8.34m tonnes of non-ferrous metals. Volume totalled Yuan153.4bn (UDollars 26.8bn) for the year. Mr Sheng Kunxin, vice present of the SHME, blamed this week's price slump on international factors, China's tighter credit policies, a weakening local currency and gloomy world economy. 'On the whole the market has remained stable,' said Mr Sheng. 'Prices for some metals fell because they were affected by the London market and the grim world economy - we are quickly fully integrated with the world's metals market.' The SHME plans to increase domestic brokers from the present 55 to 68. It serves more than 1,000 customers in China and plans to include foreign members by the end of the year when the dealing system is brought into line with international practice. Six metals are traded on the SHME - copper, aluminium, zinc, tin, nickel and pig iron.</p>

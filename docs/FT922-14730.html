			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: Classics corner - Radio CLASSIC English novels, often more talked about than read, are great material for Radio 4's Saturday evenings (and Friday afternoon repeats). Lately, we had a splendid Mill on the Floss; this week we embark on Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, in a compact three-part adaptation by Sally Hedges. It starts with a brew of Angel Clare's association with Tess, wisely hinting at what is to come, for Angel is mostly off-stage in the first episode, and we must know him when he comes. But from the village song and dance onward, we stay well enough with the tale - Durbeyfield's fancied connection with the gentry, Tess's encounter with Alec D'Urberville after her accident on the road to Casterbridge, her fatal seduction, the midnight baptism and death of her baby. Now she has just begun as a dairymaid. Nigel Bryant's direction is lively, with Hardy-style music. Carolyn Backhouse's Tess, 'a pure woman', as Hardy insisted, has an apt pastoral voice with no excess of West Country vowels, and Michael Lumsden's Alec is a seemingly decent young country chap. Assassins, the Monday play, was not Stephen Sondheim's musical about the shooting of American Presidents, but an adventurous account by Peter Roberts of what became of the knights who murdered Thomas Becket. De Traci ended as an official in Henry II's court, the other three went on a penitential crusade to Jerusalem. FitzUrse quit and took to trading in Brindisi; Brito was killed by the Saracens; de Morville, in a less vigorous conclusion, returned to Canterbury to seek forgiveness. Direction by Nigel Bryant again, packed with action from the close-up of the murder to the quieter coda in the Cathedral. But I'm afraid I can't believe in 12th-century knights who say 'Excommunication means sod-all these days', though this may truthfully express their thoughts. While news-bulletins are crammed with election talk, and Radio 4 has six or seven election features a day if you use both FM and LW, we may perhaps be thankful that the network's other features have been kept free of any potential politics. This week's Europhile (Sunday, repeated from Friday) dealt only with Polish nobility in Krakow, over-taxed pensioners in Denmark, and football in Albania. There was a heartbreaking account in The Cutting Edge on Wednesday of a woman totally paralysed for seven years, fed only through a naso-gastric tube; but we were not told whether she was nursed by the NHS or privately. In the latest (and last) series of King Street Junior, there was complaint about the shortage of school books, but the staff set about correcting this themselves. No trouble with the buildings yet, either. The Politics of Choice, Radio 4's novel presentation of current political obsessions without politicians, seems rather a miss. The dodge is to contact listeners about their particular concerns - last Tuesday, the environment, though it boiled down to roads and railways - and have the problems answered by lay experts. The effect is Any Questions without the stars.</p>

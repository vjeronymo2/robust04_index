			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Prisoners involved in benefits fraud to be traced Steps are being taken to trace prisoners involved in an alleged multi-million pound benefits fraud. A report on BBC's Here and Now programme says up to 4,000 prisoners are claiming benefits - at an annual cost of Pounds 9m to Pounds 25m. The Department of Social Security said it believed the programme exaggerates the fraud but confirmed that the Prison Service gave the DSS details of all 35,000 convicted inmates in prison last week.</p>

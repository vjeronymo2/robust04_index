			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Lloyds raps investment watchdog Another cloud was cast over the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect private investors, yesterday when Lloyds Bank described the PIA proposals as 'seriously flawed'. The comment came a day after Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, said it would not apply to join the PIA but would insist on its right to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief financial watchdog. Lloyds, the high street bank which sells life insurance through its Lloyds Abbey Life arm, said the new regulator offered 'neither the merits of genuine self-regulation nor the settled framework and clear accountability of regulation by a statutory body'. The bank has so far stopped short of refusing to join the new regulator, but the fact that it is prepared to make public its reservations at this late stage will be a blow to the PIA, which is due to take over as the regulator for retail financial services in July. Its formation has been the subject of fierce controversy within the financial services sector, and many organisations which have said they will join have done so without enthusiasm. Now the PIA's supporters are lobbying to ensure that important groups in the sector, which have not yet declared their hand, will sign up for the new watchdog. Earlier this week, Halifax, the UK's largest building society, said it had 'serious reservations' about the PIA. TSB, National Westminster and Barclays banks have either applied or made clear that they will do so. Midland has yet to make an announcement. While the position of some banks and building societies is still in the balance, there is growing confidence at the PIA that even life insurers which do not like the proposals - such as Friends Provident - will apply. The government has made clear its determination to see that the PIA goes ahead on schedule. But the political controversy over the plans will intensify next Wednesday, when ministers will come under renewed pressure to defend their preferred regulatory system in a Commons debate. Labour, which has called the debate on personal pensions and regulation, will use the occasion to press the government to respond to Prudential's refusal to join the PIA. Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, said he saw the decision as symptomatic of significant dissatisfaction among many smaller companies and independent financial advisers.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Leading Article: In defence of local politics THERE ARE three good reasons for welcoming yesterday's report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation calling for a new relationship between central and local government. First it lifts its eyes above the UK parish pump to look at what is happening in the rest of Europe. It finds that the UK is unique in the EC in the degree of conflict between central and local government and in the reduction of the functions and financial freedom of local government. Yet local government offers a means of delivering local services which is more diverse and responsive to local needs than central administration. It is also a vital part of a pluralist democracy, which encourages participation and a sense of community. A second reason for welcoming the report is its emphasis on the desirability of finding cross-party agreement on the role and structure of local government. There has been little gained and much lost from 20 years of organisation and reorganisation in local government in response to the pendulum swings of politics. There is still no end in sight to the turmoil: the rest of the 1990s will be largely devoted to bedding in a successor to the poll tax and introducing unitary authorities. It would be worth the upheaval if it produced a stable outcome commanding support across the political spectrum. Unfortunately, this is not yet in prospect. Third, the report stresses the need for finance, functions and structure to be inter-related. A patchwork of reforms is unlikely to break the cycle of decline. This lesson has not been digested by either of the main political parties, both of which are currently peddling replacements for the poll tax in the absence of a clear blueprint for structure and functions in local government. The report rightly comes down heavily against further emasculation of local authorities. The government's assumption that councils are irresponsible and inefficient is not only corrosive to relationships between central government and local government. It also weakens local government by making it unattractive to men and women of ability. It is appropriate that public services which require local discretion and initiative should be the responsibility of local government. Education and social services fall obviously into this category; local councils could also take an increased role in a devolved health service. That does not mean returning to the all-providing municipal socialism of old. The model of the enabling council, which promotes the delivery of services by private companies, co-operatives and - occasionally - the in-house team now enjoys sufficient support across the spectrum for its survival to be no longer in doubt. The report is also correct to stress the importance of giving local government a substantial and stable tax base. The recommendation that at least 50 per cent of local revenue should come from local taxation, compared with less than 20 per cent now, should be a starting point rather than a target. If local authorities were to continue to do what they now do, a local income tax or some other additional tax mechanism would be inescapable. But if local authorities are to levy income taxes, they need to become more representative. The capricious and dictatorial one-party council will not be abolished by proportional representation, but it would become far less common.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-CHILE CENTER DAMAGED BY BOMB  </P> <P> A bomb caused extensive damage to the offices of the U.S.-Chilean Cultural  Institute on Thursday night, and a caller said that the device was set off in  retaliation for the now-ended U.S. embargo on Chilean fruit, institute director  Augusta Crino said Friday.  </P> <P> No one was hurt in the explosion, which broke windows and damaged office  equipment in the three-story building in central Santiago. Crino said the  institute received an anonymous telephone call soon after the blast from a man  who said "the U.S. had to pay for the fruit."  </P> <P> The United States imposed a five-day embargo on Chilean fruit last month after  cyanide was found in two grapes.  </P></p>

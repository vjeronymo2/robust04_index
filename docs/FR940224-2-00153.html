While other Middle Eastern societies have moved beyond this traditional process of mediation_at least for resolution of commercial and legal disputes_Palestinians have, in the absence of a rational legal structure in the occupied territories, continued to rely almost exclusively on this informal, consensual process. As the peace process evolves toward Palestinian autonomy, it has become critical that Palestinians adopt internationally credible models of dispute resolution as a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sine qua non  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for attracting the international investment essential to bolster Palestinian autonomy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project should be designed to: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Familiarize Palestinian legal experts_many of whom are now working on the general outlines of a constitution and legal framework to govern the autonomous regions_with the types of arbitration organizations and mechanisms Americans rely on to resolve commercial, labor, and other disputes. This introduction should be squarely placed within a framework of the judicial system in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Promote cooperation between Palestinian and American experts in formulating and proposing specific dispute resolution mechanisms for the Palestinian autonomous regions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Provide, as a third exchange component, internships with an American arbitration group for a small group of Palestinians closely involved with the evolution of dispute resolution mechanisms within the autonomous authority, so that they might learn how arbitration mechanisms actually work in American society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommended Structural/Procedural Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _A visit to the United States, to take place as early as possible, for six to eight Palestinian legal experts to become familiar with arbitration organizations and conflict resolution mechanisms. A three-week program, with visits to at least three cities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Travel of three or four American legal experts involved in the first component of the exchange, to take place after a lapse of several months, to work for four to six weeks in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza with legal experts on formulating dispute resolution mechanisms for the Palestinian autonomous regions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

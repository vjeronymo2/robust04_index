			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 23 March commentary: "Confrontation </F> Commotions by Those Who Dig Their Own Graves"]    [Text] Traitor Kim Yong-sam of South Korea called a  security-related ministers meeting at the presidential office on  21 March to examine the policy toward the North and the security  posture regarding the so-called nuclear issue of the North.    At the meeting the puppet traitor babbled that the nuclear  issue of the North had reached an important point and gave an  instruction to assume a complete military security posture  against someone else's provocation    Shortly before the presidential office meeting, U.S.  President Clinton sent a personal letter to puppet traitor Kim  Yong-sam through the U.S. ambassador. The letter reportedly  noted that the United States reaffirmed its security commitment  to South Korea and stated that it would strengthen the South  Korea-U.S. joint defense posture.    The puppets hastily convened a security-related ministers  meeting and made a fuss as if they made a decision on an  important issue. However, there is nothing new. They merely  reiterated the resumption of the Team Spirit joint military  exercise and the early deployment of Patriot missiles in  consultation with the United States, their master.    The puppets' fuss at the presidential office is a reckless  act to deliberately bring the situation to the phase of war  after breaking up [kyollyol] the contact of working-level  delegates for the exchange of top-level special envoys between  the North and South.    The puppets themselves broke up the contact of working-level  delegates for the exchange of special envoys, hastily convened  what is called a security-related ministers meeting as inspired  by the United States, and made some decisions for confrontation  with us. We cannot overlook the fact that these maneuvers by the  puppets can destroy [pagoe] peace on the Korean peninsula and  inflict a nuclear catastrophe on the nation.    In consultation with the United States, the Kim Yong-sam  ring  declared they would resume the Team Spirit joint military  exercise against us, its fellow countrymen, and deploy Patriot  missiles in a short time. This clearly shows the rascals  [nomdul] are dirty national traitors who seek a way out in  harming their fellow countrymen in collusion with outside  forces. The puppets' act shows their antinational colors as  those who break up North-South dialogue, harm their fellow  countrymen in collusion with outside forces, play a role in  destroying the DPRK-U.S. talks [chomihoedamui pagoe chagyongul  hago], and bring North-South relations to an unpredictable phase  of confrontation.    The reality again shows that if the Kim Yong-sam ring is  left  untouched, no dialogue or peace on the Korean peninsula can be  achieved, but only confrontation and a catastrophe of nuclear  war will result.    As we have declared time and again, we are fully prepared to  answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war.    We are not afraid [gomnalgussi opta] even if the South  Korean  puppets resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and  deploy Patriot missiles and anything more sophisticated  [paetriotu misailbbunanira kuharaebirul] in a short time.    We do not like empty talk.    Our people and People's Army will severely punish the  traitors who attempt to harm and stifle [mohae apsal] their  fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces and will  resolutely defend our socialist fatherland and the security of  the nation.    The Kim Yong-sam ring must know that its futile traitorous  attempt to enter into confrontation with its fellow countrymen  will bring its own destruction. The United States had better  know that there is nothing to gain and nothing good for it even  if it instigates and gives a shot in the arm [jumurugo ipkimul  purononun] to such a fool as Kim Yong-sam, who is writhing  because he was forsaken by the nation and became a target for  overthrow.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: SHOWDOWN VOTE ON ALCOHOL TAX BOOST SET IN ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> With backing from the liquor lobby, the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee  has forwarded to the lower house floor for a showdown vote a proposed  constitutional amendment to impose a $230-million tax increase on alcoholic  beverages.  </P> <P> The legislation (ACA 38) was launched by liquor interests to fend off a more  drastic "nickel a drink" initiative that would raise liquor taxes by $830  million. The industry seeks to persuade voters to adopt the more modest alcohol  tax increase.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), the industry-backed  measure requires a two-thirds vote to win a spot on the November general  election ballot. It previously passed the Senate.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the secretary of state's office said Tuesday that the tax initiative  has qualified for the November ballot, with more than 1 million signatures of  registered voters submitted.  </P> <P> Under the liquor lobby's plan, the per-gallon tax would increase from 1 cent to  20 cents on table wine; from 4 cents to 20 cents on beer, and from $2 to $3.30  on hard liquor. By contrast, the "nickel a drink" initiative would raise the  tax per gallon to $1.29 on wine, 57 cents on beer, and $8.40 on hard liquor.  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Signed into law a bill (AB 2986) by Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush  (R-Saratoga) to protect high-technology trade secrets from possible theft by  allowing closed court hearings in cases where the judge rules there is no  overriding public interest.  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Floor Action  </P> <P> Empty Bottles: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 41-23 vote a bill (AB 3050)  by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) to add empty wine and liquor  bottles to the state's recycling and litter-reduction program, effective July  1, 1991.  </P> <P> Air Pollution: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 54-19 vote a bill (AB 2766)  by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) to allow air quality districts to  impose up to a $2 surcharge on vehicle registrations to help pay costs in  reducing air pollution.  </P> <P> Criminals: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 66-1 vote a bill (AB 3821) by  Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) to make computerized photographs of  criminals with past records available to all law enforcement agencies in  California. The estimated $24-million price tag would come from increased  criminal offense fines.  </P> <P> Kids' Vote: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 41-28 vote a bill (AB 3871) by  Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to set up a pilot program in schools to  allow children to accompany their parents to the polls and cast mock ballots.  The program, financed by private donations, is designed to encourage children  to vote when they grow up.  </P> <P> Campus Crime: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 70-0 vote a bill (AB 3918) by  Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) to require college campuses to compile  records of crimes committed on campus and make the information available to  students, parents and college employees.  </P> <P> Water: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 50-19 vote a bill (AB 3426) by  Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City) to create a state task force to  develop a long-range strategic plan for water quality, water use and water  conservation in California. The task force would present recommendations to the  governor and the Legislature by 1993.  </P> <P> SENATE  </P> <P> Floor Action  </P> <P> Air Pollution: Passed and sent to the Assembly on a 29-4 vote a bill (SB 1905)  by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) to increase or decrease the state sales  tax on new automobiles based on how much air pollution they produce.  </P> <P> Black Boxes: Passed and sent to the Assembly on a 22-12 vote a bill (SB 2462)  by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) to require commercial trucks to carry  so-called black boxes that log the driver's speed and hours spent behind the  wheel.  </P> <P> Transportation: Passed and sent to the Assembly on a 32-0 vote a bill (SB 1784)  by Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear) to encourage planning for state and local  highway and mass transit projects and save money by allowing Caltrans to  acquire necessary rights of way long before a project is formally adopted.  </P> <P> Committee Action  </P> <P> Gangs and Drugs: The Appropriations Committee approved a bill (AB 1716) by  Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) calling for up to $200,000 to develop a  program for second-, fourth- and sixth-graders to equip children with skills to  resist pressure to join gangs and use drugs. A 10-0 vote sent the bill to the  Senate floor.  </P> <P> Capital Fact  </P> <P> In case of a disaster or emergency, the governor can call an extraordinary  legislative session by proclamation. Legislators can act only upon those  subjects specified in the proclamation during that session.  </P></p>

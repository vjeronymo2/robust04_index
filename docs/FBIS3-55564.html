			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  0939 GMT on 7 January carries an interview with Sergey  Aleksandrovich Zverev, deputy director general of the MOST  group, one of founders of the new Independent Television  service, Nezavisimoye Televideniye, NTV, by correspondent Boris  Simonov.    Introducing the interview, the announcer notes that a  Russian  government decision to set up NTV on the 4th channel has been in  effect since the beginning of the year.    Zverev says: "NTV will start to go out on the 4th TV channel  round about mid-January, from 1800," adding that on weekdays  services will run until about midnight, and maybe later on  Friday and Saturday.    On programming, Zverev says: "To start with, there will be a  cartoon for the children--various cartoons, both home-produced  and foreign. At 1830, a documentary TV serial will be shown.  That will begin with the TV series `The Most Notorious Crimes,'  which are documentary films about the most notorious courtroom  trials of the 20th Century. After that, at 1900 and at 2200,  there will be the daily editions of the `Today' news program,  after which there will be a feature film." Zverev goes on to  mention some of the feature films to be shown - all detective  stories.    Asked why he is going into television, Zverev replies: "From  a certain point onward, it's quite a profitable investment of  money, a profitable business. Admittedly, that time doesn't  come until about 10 years after work has started. But it's also  quite a profitable investment of money from the point of view of  our slight contribution to the stabilization of our society." He  adds: "After all, we're all tired of the joyless TV screen that  awaits us every evening at home. There is no happy program that  one could watch every evening. And when people came along,  saying that they knew how to do it, they had the ability to do  it, the banks that are taking part in the financing simply took  their word for it and dealt only with the finance. All the  ideology and the content aspect of the channel is a matter for  the professionals who are dealing with it today."    Asked to expand on the financing, Zverev said: "We have an  agreement on the financing of NTV. There is the National Credit  Bank and the MOST group in the capital. All these financial  groups are the founders of NTV. I would like to stress once  again that we conduct all discussions, all decisions and the  financing of all projects on a completely equal basis."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia cannot accept the statement by Britain  which wants the Bosnian Government to accept defeat in its war  against the Serbs. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi  explained that if the statement is accepted, it will mean that  Malaysia and the whole world agree with the policy of ethnic  cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to the minister, the  statement made by Britain indicates that the country will not do  anything to bring about peace in Bosnia.</p>

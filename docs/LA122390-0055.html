			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS: I WON'T BE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> For Travelers, there is inevitably a moment when the exhilaration of discovery  gives way to an acute sense of being a stranger in a very foreign place. As  soldiers, diplomats and foreign correspondents know, that sense of displacement  may be keenest at times of traditional togetherness and homecoming. Here,  current and former foreign correspondents share some of their most memorable  Christmases away from home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KENYA, 1980  </P> <P> The train from Nairobi, high on the Kenyan plains, down to Mombasa on the  coast, was slow and groaning and took all night. It was pulled by a team of  diesel engines but wasn't much different, from the perspective of the dining  car, than it appeared in the movie "Out of Africa." The waiters, sure-footed as  spiders on a rocking leaf, served soup from dented silver-plate tureens. Soft  lights gleamed off polished wooden walls, the cutlery jingled. It was Christmas  at the coast, and the train was crowded.  </P> <P> My wife and I had come with motorcycles, a pair of high-riding Hondas, loaded  into a baggage car. Other travelers came with trunks and suitcases. A pair of  shameless greenhorns, we brought packs, canvas bags and a tent, lashed to racks  on the bikes. We would wander the coast and camp for Christmas on a beach.  </P> <P> We awoke to the sudden swelter of the equatorial coast, off-loaded the  motorcycles and set out southward, pitching our tent beneath palms in a place  so remote we had to ride miles to find something cold to drink. After two days  -- dirty, sunburned, raw with the bites of sand fleas and mosquitoes -- the  idea of more formal accommodations took on the attraction of a mirage. But  every hotel on the coast was full to overflowing.  </P> <P> I had a new-found friend, a Scotsman who had lived 25 years in Kenya, who had  invited me to drop in to visit at the modest resort where he and his family had  been going for Christmas for years. We went, back through Mombasa, across the  ferry at Kilifi, north toward Malindi, arriving weary and scorched.  </P> <P> Naturally, there were no places. The white-washed cabins were all occupied, but  my friend interceded with the management, which consented to bend its  no-camping rule. It was as though we had fallen into a huge family gathering.  In fact, there were a score of families, all regulars who booked their cabins  from Christmas to Christmas, a year in advance. For two days, they averted  their eyes from our shameful tent, this flagrant breach of protocol, and then,  owing to some early departure, a place was found for us.  </P> <P> Slowly, we were taken in to a new world, a world of displaced Englishmen in  Africa, and enveloped in the stories of their lives, recollections of the  Mau-Mau uprising, memories of farms and lion hunters.  </P> <P> Every afternoon at 4:30, after a nap through the heat of the afternoon, tea and  scones, still warm from the oven, arrived on the cabin porch. For dinner every  night, if desired, there was fresh lobster, and trifle pudding for desert. And  for Christmas, Yorkshire pudding with the turkey and roast beef. And talk, into  the night, on bent camphor-wood chairs set in the sand on the edge of the  beach. They were discussions touched often with melancholy over the new order,  the dwindling fortunes, the growing number of college-aged children, born in  Kenya, opting now for British citizenship and leaving for England, voting with  their feet on their future in Africa. It was an ending, they said, that had  been a long time coming. But it had been a merry time while it lasted.  </P> <P> That was the first of six years in Africa, and although we spent two  Christmases in Europe, the Kenyan coast pulled us back most strongly. Our last  one was far down the coast from our first, although not far from our original  bivouac under the palms. Lucky at last, we found a beach cottage to rent for  the holiday. Good friends joined us, along with my daughter, all the way from  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> We, too, felt like veterans by then, tanned and weathered and nearing our own  departure. We sat out under the stars, our chairs in a circle. We had our own  stories to tell, and we told them and laughed a lot and surveyed the full moon  with binoculars, as though searching for our next destination in its silvered  face. CHARLES T.

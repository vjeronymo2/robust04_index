			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza City, April 11 (AFP)--The  Palestine Liberation Organization and the Islamic Resistance  Movement Hamas have opened talks in the Gaza strip to try to  halt conflict between themselves, a PLO official said.    "A meeting of senior PLO and Hamas leaders took place last  week to sort out daily problems and the two groups decided to  carry on the dialogue," the official told AFP.    "The discussions are serious and positive and we hope to  reach an agreement. We respect the position of Hamas on  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho," he added.    The fundamentalist organization has sworn to fight on  against  Israel despite the September 19 autonomy deal, which it  considers a sell-out.    A Hamas official confirmed that a meeting had taken place  after an armed clash between rival militants left 18 wounded in  the Rafah refugee camp at the end of March. But he refused to  say more until an accord was struck.    The fight erupted over a piece of wasteland on which PLO  supporters played football and Hamas wanted to build a doctor's  clinic.    Then on April 2, Fatah and Hamas each kidnapped one of the  other's supporters in Gaza City. Both hostages were freed  unharmed after lengthy negotiations.    A Palestinian research centre last month found that 40  percent of the Gaza Strip would vote in elections for PLO  chairman Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement and nearly 20 percent  for Hamas.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets TOKYO The unexpected defeat of Prime Minister Morihiro's political reform bill in the upper house last Friday is bad news for the stock market. The coalition government will have to negotiate with the Liberal Democrats, the leading opposition party, over a compromise. Share prices could plunge on profit-taking if further political turmoil delays the announcement of the economic stimulus package. PARIS Bouygues, the construction group, announces 1993 results tomorrow. The company, which reported a 27 per cent reduction in first-half net profits, has warned that full-year figures will be down on last year's FFr685m (Dollars 117.29m). Skis Rossignol holds an analysts' meeting on Thursday and BSN unveils 1993 sales figures on Friday. WARSAW Bank Slaski, the market's largest ever share listing, makes its trading debut tomorrow. The bank, one of the nine being sold under the government's privatisation programme, saw a massive oversubscription last month, with more than 800,000 domestic and foreign applicants offering 7,993.2bn zlotys (Dollars 372m) for 1,226.5bn zlotys worth of shares. Analysts expect the 500,000 zloty offer price to more than treble when trading begins. DUBLIN Investors are hoping for a mildly positive package from Wednesday's budget. Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, which this month told analysts in London and Edinburgh it expected domestic investors to replace foreigners as the driving force in the market this year, believe the government may re-jig investment tax treatment in favour of equity investors. STOCKHOLM SSAB, the steel company, is expected to announce 1993 net profits of around SKr600m (Dollars 74m) tomorrow. Firmer prices and lower processing costs have helped the recovery after 1992's SKr165 pre-tax loss. ZURICH Baer Holding is expected to unveil 1993 profit figures today. Tomorrow, the Swiss Insurance Industry Association holds a news conference. Swiss Re has analysts' presentations in Zurich tomorrow and in London on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an exclusive interview with a BELINFORM  correspondent, Belarus Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislaw  Shushkevich confirmed news agency reports that he is to meet  with Boris Yeltsin. The sides intend in the very near future to  make adjustments to their positions before U.S. President Bill  Clinton's coming visit to Moscow and Minsk, and also to discuss  the major problems of Belarusian-Russian relations.    Stanislaw Shushkevich said the state of our economy is  critical. Moreover, I do not support suggestions that joining a  single ruble zone will solve all our problems. [Words  indistinct] sick and must be cured. We ourselves must find ways  of restoring our economy on market relations. If that does not  happen, the republic will be threatened with a terrible collapse.    Speaking about Bill Clinton's coming visit to Minsk,  Shushkevich noted that if we solve theoretically such problems  as disarmament, conversion, and monetary questions, then signing  the corresponding agreements after that will be essentially just  a technicality. So it is hardly likely that many specific  documents will be signed in Minsk. That will have to be done in  the future.    Stanislaw Shushkevich's statement also dealt with the  INTERFAX report quoting Vyachaslaw Kebich as saying that after  Russia joins NATO, Belarus may also become a member of that  bloc. The point is, the speaker explained, that all Belarus's  most important documents, including the constitutional law,  indicate that Belarus adheres to a path of neutrality and of not  adhering to any blocs. We have a completely different foreign  policy doctrine, at whose center lies neutrality. Belarus never  officially declared its desire to enter the North Atlantic  union. This statement is no way connected with the CIS  countries' collective security treaty, which Vyachaslaw  Frantsavich [Kebich] has always supported. Perhaps this is some  sort of mistake by journalists, Stanislaw Shushkevich concluded.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pechiney groups unveil sharply higher earnings PECHINEY Group, the French state-owned aluminium company, and Pechiney International, its separately listed can-making subsidiary, both reported sharp increases in first-half net profits yesterday. Pechiney Group's net earnings rose from a restated FFr429m (Dollars 83.5m) to FFr782m in the first six months of the year, due to one-off gains from a complex asset re-organisation and injection of fresh capital carried out in May and June. Operating profits fell from a restated FFr2.44bn to FFr1.79bn, due to low aluminium prices and technical problems. Sales fell from FFr36.36bn to FFr34.06bn on the same basis. Pechiney International saw a more than five-fold increase in its earnings, from a restated FFr266m to FFr1.41bn over the same period, reflecting heavy exceptional gains. Net sales fell from FFr18.66bn to FFr18.29bn over the same period. It forecast a full-year profit of more than FFr1bn, excluding exceptional gains, as against FFr890m 1991.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Mortgage boost for bank lending LEADING British banks made gross mortgage loans of Pounds 4.137bn in the first quarter of 1993, a survey by the British Bankers' Association shows. This represents an increase of more than 14 per cent on the previous quarter and an increase of 15 per cent on the first quarter of 1992. The increase over the fourth quarter is in distinct contrast to the normal seasonal pattern and reflects the improving optimism in the housing market following numerous cuts in mortgage rates. It also reflects the banks' growing market share, with their standard mortgage rates below 8 per cent for the first time. Offers of fixed-rate loans have also proved popular. The survey shows that total bank lending rose by a 'modest' Pounds 890m to Pounds 273.4bn in the quarter to March. Lending to manufacturers and construction company sectors, however, both showed their eighth consecutive quarterly fall, dropping 3.8 per cent or Pounds 768m to Pounds 19.4bn and 3.7 per cent or Pounds 336m to Pounds 8.7bn respectively.</p>

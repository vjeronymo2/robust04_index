			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION WATCH;  </P> <P> CHANNEL ZERO  </P> <P> The best time to guide kids in the right direction is when they're young. The  worst thing to do is to ignore the reality that more kids watch TV than, say,  read the classics.  </P> <P> So few people would argue with the notion that children's TV should constitute  more than a means of selling products to kids.  </P> <P> But the White House is said to be less than enthralled with the action of  Congress in limiting the amount of TV advertising aimed at children.  </P> <P> The House and Senate passed legislation to limit commercials on children's  shows to 10 1/2 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on weekdays.  Since TV stations were freed of ad restrictions in 1984, they were selling as  much as 14 advertising minutes per hour.  </P> <P> The legislation also creates and funds a national endowment for children's  educational TV -- and requires that the Federal Communications Commission  review a TV station's educational and informative children's programming as  part of its periodic license-renewal process.  </P> <P> This should nudge broadcasters to develop new and creative shows -- and help  address concerns that toy manufacturers dominate the Saturday morning airways  with programs that are little more than thinly veiled merchandising ties-in for  products they advertise.  </P> <P> The legislation is backed by children's advocacy groups, education associations  and even the National Assn. of Broadcasters, which in the past has opposed laws  to set limits on advertising. President Bush, as the self-proclaimed "Education  President," should sign the bill.  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Court blow to Nafta might not be fatal, but it's messy - A US order for an environmental delay THE BLOW dealt on Wednesday to the North American Free Trade Agreement by a federal judge in Washington was not fatal, but it provided one more complication to passage of a pact which is as unpopular as any in recent memory. Lawyers and lobbyists yesterday were scrutinising the order by Judge Charles Richey that President Bill Clinton's administration prepare an environmental impact statement - a procedure which can take months, even years - for submission to Congress. The order is to go on expedited appeal, which could take about two months. Meanwhile, the ruling will not delay the tight schedule for the agreement's passage, since the administration intends to proceed with the Nafta implementing legislation. But if the appeal fails, there will be no possibility of Nafta coming into effect on its intended implementation date, January 1 1994. Moreover, the administration would then face new political battles over the environmental consequences of the pact which might be highlighted by the EIS. The law requires that the administration submit an EIS with every bill having an impact on the environment, but it has never been applied to trade agreements. The court has not specifically ordered the administration to submit one with the proposed Nafta legislation and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday insisted he could go forward without it. The implementing legislation for Nafta, which was negotiated by the administration of Mr George Bush, contains various changes in tariffs schedules and laws necessary for the trade pact to go forward. Ms Lori Wallach, a lawyer with Public Citizen, a consumer and environmental group, yesterday said the court could not issue an order to the president because of the separation of powers provided in the US Constitution. The court, however, ordered the US trade representative to negotiate a schedule for the EIS with the three organisations which brought the suit. Ms Wallach, however, said the US trade representative may refuse to negotiate while the appeal is pending. Mr Kantor and his counterparts in Canada and Mexico will continue trying to find their way out of the existing stalemate on environmental and labour side agreements. If the Canadians and Mexicans were ever in doubt about the clout and resolution of the environmental lobby, they were given a dramatic demonstration of it on Wednesday. The administration has a tentative deadline of July 15 for completion of the side agreements. Work is well under way on the implementing legislation, which must be voted on within 90 days of being submitted. Several weeks more will be needed to prepare legislation for the side agreements. It is likely they will go to Congress in September, but the time squeeze is severe since preparations will also have to be made to get new tariff schedules ready. Environmentalists contend that if the court orders an EIS or if the administration prepares one unilaterally, the environmental damage it highlights would hurt the prospects for the pact. Nafta proponents, such as Mr Chip Brown, chief economist for Solomon Brothers, say the reverse is more likely. 'Mexico is not going to go back to where it was 20 years ago,' Mr Brown said. 'The only issue is will Mexico industrialise in the context of a Nafta or without Nafta.' There has been increasing criticism of Mr Clinton for a lack of leadership in trying to turn around public sentiment on the Nafta. Congressman Lee Hamilton, a Nafta supporter, this week said the lobbying effort has begun to build but what has been lacking is 'the president's personal voice'.</p>

In January alone, among the 35 cities, Shanghai, Nanjing,  Hangzhou, Ningbo, Hefei, Xiamen, Nanchang, and Chongqing saw  prices for fresh vegetables rise by 50 percent.    Surveys have identified the following as the main causes of  the price hikes: Reduced vegetable farmland -- urban  development and rapid increases in development zones have taken  up much of the suburban vegetable farmland; a sharp  contradiction between demand and supply -- there has been a  noticeable increase in urban consumers and migrant populations,  generating an enormous demand for vegetables; increases in the  cost of growing vegetables -- there have been steep prices  increases for products that are essential for vegetable  production; and insufficient regulation and control over  state-owned vegetable markets.    Residents now obtain 98 percent of their vegetables from  markets. With the transformation of operational mechanisms slow  in coming, state-owned vegetable markets are lagging behind  market demand. Overall, the effort to achieve stable  macro-regulation and control over vegetable prices has run into  considerable difficulty.</p>

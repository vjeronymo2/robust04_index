Apart  from that, political activity in the country seems to be  focussed on the consultations convened by President Omar Bongo  for today.    From all indications, the preparatory meeting for the  consultations was not held. The opposition says it is in favor  of the consultations. It called for dialogue following the  recent bloody clashes in Libreville but wants several conditions  to be met before taking part in the consultations. These  include the lifting of the state of alert and the holding of  discussions elsewhere other than at the Presidential Palace. As  Pierre-Louis Agondjo-Okawe -- the opposition second in command  -- stated at a news conference this afternoon, the opposition  also wants the United Nations, the OAU, the European Union, the  United States, France, and Canada to mediate. Jean-Valere  Mbinamanza was at the conference.    [Begin Agondjo-Okawe recording] There should absolutely be  international participation in order to guarantee the true  implementation of what we say and decide upon. We do not want  to be taken for a ride, as happened with the so-called  monitoring committee that was set up after the national  conference. That happened because negotiations were held among  Gabonese. This time, we want a third party to guarantee that  what is decided upon will be implemented. The most important  thing in our view is to have transparent democracy. [end  recording]</p>

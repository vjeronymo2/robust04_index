			<p>In      an apparent effort to strengthen the claim that the Republic  of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in Croatia is a sovereign state, Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic has called on the Serbs of the RSK  to put their house in order by ending what he labeled extremist  politics and lawlessness.  His meeting in Belgrade on 6 April  with RSK "President" Milan Martic and "Premier-designate" Borisav  Mikelic was aimed at demonstrating his support for the two  leaders and putting an end to the infighting that has blocked the  formation of a new government in the RSK since the December 1993  elections.  Milosevic sharply attacked "extremists and extremism"  and denounced "individuals" who are "up to their necks in crime"  and threaten to "tarnish" the Serbian nation's reputation.  He  singled out the Serbian Radical Party and "other irresponsible  groups and individuals," saying they have engaged in  "destructive" politics in the RSK assembly.  He was likely  referring to the Radicals and to former RSK president Milan Babic  and his wing of the Serbian Democratic Party, who have tried to  block Martic's and Mikelic's efforts to form a new RSK  "Government" (Tanjug and Belgrade TV, 6 April).  Babic, who had  been offered the deputy premiership in an effort to form a  coalition government, recently announced that he had "postponed"  talks about his participation in the coalition (Tanjug, 30  March).  Even before Babic's announcement, Martic had complained  that assembly infighting was leading the "state" into "total  chaos and anarchy" (Belgrade TV, 23 March).  Suggesting that  Milosevic's intervention may have had its intended effect,  Mikelic declared that he would put together a government by 9  April and that the Krajina Serbs are "on the road of calming down  passions" (Tanjug, 7 April).     Like recent statements of other FRY leaders, Milosevic's 6 April  remarks gave no hint that he would backtrack on the Serbian  claims that the RSK has the right to self-determination and that  Croatia never established its sovereignty over the territory held  by the Serbs. (See Note 1)  He also continues to steadfastly  defend the Serbs' right eventually to incorporate all territory  they inhabit into a Greater Serbia.  Moreover, his statements at  a press conference during a 5 April visit to Romania suggest that  he continues to view all Serbs in former Yugoslavia as embodying  a single political entity for which he has the right to speak.  Denying that the Serbs are the aggressors, he claimed that the  United Nations has "punished and attacked those"--i.e., the  Serbs--"who wanted to preserve and save their country."  He  called the "fact" that the Serbian "nation was accused of  aggression against its own country" one of the "absurdities" in  international politics "at the end of the 20th century" (Belgrade  TV, 5 April).  However, Milosevic, ever striving to rid his  country of UN economic sanctions, reiterated his long-standing  position that he supported "peace talks" as the "only correct  way" of resolving the crisis (Tanjug and Belgrade TV, 6 April).

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Carlsberg posts 5% interim rise Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, increased first-half pre-tax profits by 5 per cent to DKr731m (Dollars 113m) in the six months to March 31, compared with the year-ago figure of DKr694m, but warned that the improvement might not be maintained in the second half. The group attributed the improvement to better-than-expected performances by several of its breweries. However, Carlsberg-Tetley, its joint venture in the UK with Allied Lyons, was hit by falling beer consumption and a small loss of market share. First-half group sales were ahead by 8 per cent to DKr7.87bn. Carlsberg said that extensive restructuring plans were on schedule and would result in operating economies in coming years, which would more than offset depreciation and interest in the investments.</p>

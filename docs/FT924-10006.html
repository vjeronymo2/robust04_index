			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Council union attacks tests MORE than 60 council workers have lost their jobs after Brent Council in north London introduced 'competency' tests as part of its redundancy selection process. The council is shedding jobs ahead of the introduction of the council tax and 200 staff sat the three-hour written tests and attended interviews. The introduction of appraisals is consistent with action by many employers who have moved away from traditional last-in-first-out methods of selecting staff for redundancy. Employers are increasingly concerned about losing efficient and highly qualified staff. The Nalgo local-government union said: 'We are concerned the tests may be used as an excuse for the council to get rid of staff on grounds of race, sex or anything else it likes.' Brent Council said the tests were compiled by the British Psychological Society, approved by the Equal Opportunities Commission, and results would be 'checked and double-checked' by managers. Meanwhile, at Islington Council, more than 700 workers yesterday defied warnings that they would lose enhanced severance agreements and the opportunity of redeployment by continuing with strike action over up to 300 job losses. The council wants to select staff for redundancies on the basis of performance and length of service. Workers have been on strike since September 4 over the council's refusal to guarantee that no staff will be made compulsorily redundant after the introduction of cuts of Pounds 16m over two years. Nalgo said fewer than 30 staff reported for work yesterday</p>

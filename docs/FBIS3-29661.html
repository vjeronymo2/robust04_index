However, it will  likely issue them during the time the IAEA Board of Governors  meeting is held--the meeting begins on 21 February--so that the  inspection team begins its activities."    Minister Han also stated that "North Korea is delaying the  issuance of visas because it needs to clarify the procedures of  the agreement it reached with the United States during a  working-level contact last 29 December."    Minister Han said he understands that "the scope of  inspection agreed between North Korea and the IAEA includes the  extraction of sample materials from the five-megawatt atomic  reactor, and this means that North Korea fully accepted the  scope of inspection demanded by the IAEA in the past."    He pointed out that IAEA's inspection activities and  analysis  of the inspection results would require about four weeks.  Therefore, in the event that the inspection begins next week and  proceeds satisfactorily, the third round of high-level  U.S.-North Korea talks would be resumed in late March.    Since the exchange of special envoys between the North and  the South is a precondition for the third round of high-level  U.S.-North Korea talks, the talks on this issue will be held  before late March.    Commenting on the report that there is difference in views  between the ROK and the United States on the deployment of  Patriot missiles, Minister Han said that "in view of the  sensitive time of the nuclear negotiations, the ROK and the  United States agreed to withhold the decision on deployment  until the IAEA Board of Governors meeting is held." He added  that "the two nations will consult the issue of deployment and  time by taking into account the judgment of commander of U.S.  Forces in the ROK and changes in the situation."    Minister Han pointed out that "if North Korea possesses  nuclear materials, the detection of their exact amount and  location is important. If sanctions against North Korea are  pushed because it possesses nuclear materials alone, North Korea  will not allow anyone to confirm the contents of the nuclear  materials it possesses. Therefore, sanctions under this  condition are not desirable."</p>

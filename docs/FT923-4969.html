			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bush's subsidy boost lifts Chicago wheat market CHICAGO WHEAT futures rose yesterday after President George Bush announced a Dollars 1bn expansion of US subsidies for wheat exports. In late trading the December contract was 5 cents ahead at 342 3/4 cents a bushel. Mr Bush told farmers at an election rally in South Dakota that he would offer subsidies for 30m tonnes of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program and announced his approval of Dollars 755m of emergency disaster aid for farmers. The disaster aid was approved by congress nearly a year ago, and will benefit not only Florida and Louisiana farmers hit last month by Hurricane Andrew but those affected by frosts and floods earlier this year. It will also cover unpaid crop loss claims from 1990 and 1991. White House officials said the wheat export subsidies would be aimed at winning markets in 28 countries, with China and the former Soviet republics at the top of the list. Indeed, Russian officials were in Washington yesterday to seek an additional Dollars 1bn in loan guarantees to buy grain, meat, milk and other products. Other countries targeted include South Africa, India, Yemen, Poland and Brazil. The expansion of the US export subsidy programme drew criticism from other grain-exporting nations. Some officials complained that Mr Bush appeared to be torpedoing attempts to complete the Uruguay Round of talks on revising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has sought to eliminate agricultural export subsidies. 'We deeply regret that domestic political pressures have overridden a US commitment to the pursuit of a less corrupted international trading environment for farm products,' said Mr Paul Keating, prime minister of Australia.</p>

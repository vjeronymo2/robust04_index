			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BIRD FINALLY BACK IN FORM -- AND SO ARE CELTICS  </P> <P> It took three-quarters of the season, but Larry Bird is almost all the way  back.  </P> <P> Bird, doing it all except making three-point baskets, is driving the Boston  Celtics toward the title in the Atlantic Division. The way they are playing,  the Celtics may be the only Eastern team capable of challenging the NBA  champion Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> Bird capped a sensational week with a triple-double Sunday at Boston to lead  the Celtics to a 122-106 victory over New Jersey that moved them to within a  game of first place.  </P> <P> Bird, who was slow to regain his shooting touch after missing most of last  season because of foot surgery, had 29 points, 18 rebounds and 11 assists. He  was 13 for 13 from the foul line, leading the Celtics to a perfect 33 for 33 in  free throws.  </P> <P> It was the NBA's second-best team performance for foul shooting. In 1982, Utah  was 39 for 39 in a game.  </P> <P> The Celtics, trailing New York and Philadelphia, have shaken the doldrums  mainly because of Bird.  </P> <P> In four games over the past six days, he scored 118 points (29.5 average), had  47 rebounds and 36 assists. He has been shooting only 47.1% from the field, but  in two-point attempts, he was 43 for 73 (59%) in the four games.  </P> <P> In three-point shots, Bird missed the two he took and was just two for 10 for  the week. The all-time three-point scoring leader, Bird is shooting only 30%  from that distance this season.  </P> <P> After the teams traded baskets to open the game, a 14-0 Boston run put the Nets  in a hole and they never got out, losing their 20th in a row on the road.  </P> <P> The Celtics welcomed back Robert Parish, who missed three games with a  hyper-extended right knee. Parish played 17 minutes. In the veteran center's  absence, Joe Kleine played extremely well and is sure to see much action in the  stretch run.  </P> <P> But Bird is the key. Early in the season he complained about not being allowed  to work out of the low post. Now he doesn't want to talk about it.  </P> <P> "I seem to be getting my shooting touch back and we are starting to play  better," Bird said.  </P> <P> Seattle 121, Golden State 116 -- The Warriors needed this one to keep their  playoff hopes alive. They built a 10-point lead in the first half at Oakland,  but couldn't handle Dale Ellis.  </P> <P> Ellis, playing only his fifth game after missing 27 because of broken ribs  suffered in an automobile accident, came off the bench to score 30 points.  </P> <P> The SuperSonics, in the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, moved four  games ahead of the Warriors.  </P> <P> With a 33-31 record, the Sonics also are 2 1/2 games ahead of ninth-place  Houston.  </P> <P> Detroit 114, Dallas 84 -- It's getting so easy for the Pistons that they're  having trouble maintaining their concentration.  </P> <P> The Pistons, unbeaten in March and a loser only once in February, built a  19-point lead in the second quarter at Auburn Hills, Mich. and coasted to their  11th consecutive victory.  </P> <P> The Pistons, 9-0 this month, have won 24 of their last 25. Their only defeat  since Jan. 21 was a 112-103 loss at Atlanta Feb. 23.  </P> <P> Early in the streak there were some close calls, but not lately. Last week they  routed Chicago by 25 and San Antonio by 12.  </P> <P> The Piston defense held the Mavericks to 16 points in the first quarter and 17  in the third.  </P> <P> Starters Dennis Rodman and Isiah Thomas didn't reach double figures, but the  other three starters and four reserves did.  </P> <P> Cleveland 120, Orlando 103 -- A year ago at this time, the Cavaliers were ahead  of the Detroit Pistons. But they were beginning to falter, and by playoff time,  they weren't good enough to beat Chicago in the first round.  </P> <P> Maybe they'll do an about-face this season. Off to a slow start, the Cavaliers  are rolling now.  </P> <P> With Brad Daugherty scoring 29 points and Mark Price 25 at Orlando, the  Cavaliers rolled to their fifth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Portland 109, Houston 96 -- Clyde Drexler scored four of his 21 points during a  16-0 run in the third quarter at Portland that broke open a close game and gave  the Trail Blazers their ninth victory in a row.  </P> <P> Despite 28 points and 15 rebounds from Akeem Olajuwon, the Rockets' road record  fell to 7-27.  </P> <P> Denver 103, Minnesota 98 -- Alex English, in and out of Coach Doug Moe's  doghouse, emerged again in this game at Denver.  </P> <P> English scored 27 points and the Nuggets moved closer to a playoff berth. The  Nuggets are in seventh place in the West. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent Aleksandr </F> Bulygin, Krasnodar: "The Kuban `Hawks' Are Already Dividing the  Portfolios"]    [Text] It would seem that the dream of ruling to one's  heart's content has so mastered even the minds of certain of our  fellow journalists that it gives them no rest, even by day or by  night. Krasnodar has a regional newspaper, KUBANSKIY KURER, and  at its editorial office is the kray headquarters of the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the leaders of which  cannot be suspected of having an excessive amount of modesty.  More than three months before the election to agencies of local  self-government, the Kuban "hawks" announced the formation of a  kray Legislative Assembly and a governmental cabinet.    The main portfolios were distributed, naturally, among the  closest retainers. The person who was seated in the chair of the  shady governor was Vladimir Serdyukov, the head of the LDPR kray  organization, who also performs the duties of head of the  Sociopolitical Research Department at KUBANSKIY KURER. The job  of chairman of the Legislative Assembly was yielded to Igor  Kolomiytsev, with this action apparently emphasizing  faithfulness to their principle of not forgetting services  rendered to them. Because Igor Pavlovich had done rather well in  providing services: during a short period of time the KUBANSKIY  KURER that is edited by him was converted into a mouthpiece for  the Zhirinovskiyites. So the deputy of the main Kuban "hawk,"  Sergey Kamarinskiy, had to be satisfied with the title of the  shady general director of the department for the fight against  corruption.    As you compare these personnel assignments, you have to  sympathize with the professionals, for example, with military  jurist Anatoliy Vetrov, who was given only the job of business  manager of the kray Duma. One can only guess how the already  appointed shady prefects of Anapskiy, Yeyskiy, Korenovskiy,  Labinskiy, and Mostovskiy rayons, and the mayors of the cities  of Yeysk and Sochi, will execute the "assignment" issued by the  LDPR kray organization, of making up cabinets for the local  agencies of authority within a one-month period.    As early as January, the leader of the Kuban  liberal-democrats, Serdyukov, publicly and with complete  seriousness, stated that Nikolay Yegorov, the present  administration head of Krasnodar Kray, "sooner or later will  have a need to join up with us... If Yegorov establishes contact  with us, and gives us several departments today, then we shall  not forget him tomorrow." But the "hawklets" had a misfire: the  governor did not react in any way to the bait put out by the  Zhirinovskiyites. Andrey Ivanov, press secretary of the kray  administration head, stated that the kray's executive authority  had been formed from professionals and is operating in  everyone's full view. No personnel shakeup in favor of anyone's  political vanities is foreseen. Everything will be decided by  the voters.    A valid question is: whom can the authority trust? How will  the people of Kuban evaluate (or will they evaluate?) the zeal  of the local "hawks, their struggle for seats in the kray Duma,  and their emulation of Communists at such time? Because the  Zhirinovskiyites do not spare even the Travkinites. Serdyukov  has indeed stated, "We do not have anything against former CPSU  members. But for all 'demorossy' [members of  Democratic Russia] the path to us is closed..."    As the saying goes, the masks have been thrown aside. And  apparently in time. So that the voters will have time to  scrutinize the situation a bit more attentively. There is still  time: it is a few months until autumn and the election.</p>

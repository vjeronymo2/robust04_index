			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Observer: Acute mistake It takes a lot to stop the printing presses at the Banque de France. France's central bank had printed 200m crisp FFr50 notes before someone spotted a spelling mistake the other day. The note, which bears a portrait of the late writer, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, mis-spelled his surname by adding an extraneous acute accent on the capital 'E'. The bank said it was not a device to catch forgers but an old-fashioned, low-tech printing error which had since been rectified. Coming only days after another defect was discovered - the note shrinks in the wash and loses its foolproof magnetic codes - it's a big blow to French monetary pride. When the Bank of England got George Stephenson's birthday wrong on its Pounds 5 notes, it spotted the mistake before they went into circulation. By contrast, there are now 200m flawed French banknotes in circulation and, with no plans to withdraw them, there is no chance of their becoming collectors' items. Perhaps the Banque de France's printing works should be added to the privatisation list?</p>

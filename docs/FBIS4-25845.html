			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ju Zhijia (72631807 0502): "Strengthen </F> Management Over Receipts and Stop the Loss of Taxes"]    [Text] Take action immediately, strengthen receipt  management work, and guarantee the smooth implementation of the  new tax system. This was proposed at the provincial meeting on  launching a special struggle against the law-breaking and  criminal offenses of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts  held in Xingcheng on 18-20 May.    Directors of tax bureaus of 14 cities across the province  attended the meeting. The participants summed up and exchanged  experiences in dealing blows to fake receipts during the  previous stage and defined tasks for launching this special  struggle in the near future. Five models, including Shenyang,  Anshan, Dandong, Fuxin, and Chaoyang, introduced their  experiences.    The meeting pointed out: If we fail to properly manage  special-purpose receipts, direct and big losses of taxation of  the state will inevitably be created and reform of the tax  system will be a failure. Therefore, tax departments at all  levels should regard the management of special-purpose receipts  as an important means for guaranteeing the smooth implementation  of the tax system reform and enhance the sense of responsibility  and urgency. Certainly, strengthening management over  special-purpose receipts does not mean to slacken efforts in the  management of receipts that are not related to the value-added  tax. Contrarily, we should step up our efforts to strengthen  management and inspection in an effort to stop up the loophole  in the management of tax revenue and financial affairs and  guarantee that the state taxation and property will not be  infringed.    The meeting held that at present the most serious and  harmful  thing reflected in the problem on receipts is the forging,  reselling and stealing of special-purpose receipts related to  value-added tax. Using receipts to engage in law-breaking and  criminal activities such as tax evasion has become a social  nuisance in society. It affects many sectors, and most of these  law-breaking and criminal activities are carried out covertly.  It is not easy to discover and solve this problem by relying  only on the inspection of tax departments. It is necessary to  maintain close coordination with the public security, judicial,  and procuratorial departments and take joint actions. Tax  departments at all levels, when they discover the law-breaking  acts of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts during their  inspection and when these acts constitute a crime, should  promptly transfer the persons involved to the judicial organs  for punishment.    The meeting stressed: Like we treat the banknotes, we should  consider strengthening management over receipts as a major  affair and grasp it firmly and well. We should investigate and  handle each and every law-breaking and criminal activity of  forging, reselling, and stealing receipts we discover,  resolutely check the law-breaking acts of using receipts to  bring a series of harm to society, and create a good environment  for the smooth implementation of the new tax system.</p>

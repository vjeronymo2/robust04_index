			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Two firms involved with creating problem-plagued Rancho Seco have agreed to  operate the nuclear power plant jointly with the municipal utility that owns  it, officials said. Sacramento Municipal Utility District officials said they  would support the proposed 5 1/2-year contract with Bechtel, the plant's  architect and engineer, and Babcock &amp; Wilcox, which built the reactor. The  agreement, they said, would lead to greater plant efficiency and savings on  customers' bills. But opponents maintain that the plant is unsafe and condemned  the proposal as a political ploy. Voters will be asked June 6 whether the  district should shut down the 913-megawatt plant.  </P></p>

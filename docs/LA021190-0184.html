			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3-MONTH PERRIER SALES HALT SEEN POSSIBLE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE AMERICAN IMPORTER OF THE FRENCH MINERAL WATER BELIEVES THAT 'HUMAN  ERROR' CAUSED THE BENZENE CONTAMINATION.  </P> <P> The American importer of Perrier said Saturday that it will stop selling the  French mineral water for two to three months while the company seeks the source  of a cancer-causing chemical that showed up in tests of the product last week.  </P> <P> Company officials believe that "human error" was involved in the contamination  of the water, possibly in the production of its famed green bottles, or in the  shipping from its plant in Vergeze, France.  </P> <P> But Ronald V. Davis, president of Perrier Group of America Inc., said that he  would not elaborate until the company is certain of the cause.  </P> <P> Davis, speaking at a news conference at the company's U.S. headquarters in  Greenwich, Conn., called the contamination "a very freak accident" that he said  did not appear to involve criminal intent.  </P> <P> Although the source of the water -- a natural spring in Vergeze -- has been  found to be free of contamination, Perrier is temporarily shutting down its  entire production operation in France and is blocking further shipments to the  United States.  </P> <P> On Friday, Perrier recalled an estimated 72 million bottles of the mineral  water from stores and restaurants across the nation after a relatively small  amount of benzene was found in a sample in North Carolina.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said that consumers of Perrier faced no  immediate danger to their health because the levels of benzene found were so  minute.  </P> <P> FDA tests of 13 product samples found benzene levels from 12 to 20 parts per  billion, an amount that nevertheless exceeds the federal standard of 5 parts  per billion.  </P> <P> Benzene, a colorless, flammable chemical used in making paint, detergent and  other products, has been found to cause leukemia and blood disorders in people  exposed to high doses for lengthy periods.  </P> <P> No recall of Perrier has been ordered in Europe, even though Davis said it was  possible that the same problem that afflicted the water sold in the United  States also affected water sold in Europe.  </P> <P> Perrier is the best-selling carbonated, or "sparkling," water in the United  States, with sales of about $160 million a year.  </P> <P> "We are in the business of selling purity," Davis said. "We think that this  decision is right because we think in the long run our consumers will come  back," he said. Davis said it would take between two months and three months to  import enough new Perrier from France to resume sales in the United States.  </P> <P> The company will lose about $40 million in sales if the product is off the  market for three months, he said, in addition to any lost business owing to  potential damage to the product's reputation.  </P> <P> William F. Deal, executive vice president of the International Bottled Water  Assn. in Alexandria, Va., said that the Perrier incident would strengthen his  group's argument that the FDA should establish its own standards for acceptable  benzene levels in food and beverages.  </P> <P> Although the FDA does do random testing for benzene, he said, it relies on  standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> TRANSIT BOARD TO CONSIDER RAISING BUS FARE TO 75 CENTS  </P> <P> Long Beach Transit's directors are scheduled to raise bus fares for the first  time when they meet Monday.  </P> <P> Officials said the increase is necessary in part to make up for a staggering  increase in the cost of fuel.  </P> <P> Adults would pay 75 cents, an increase of 15 cents. Student fares would  increase 10 cents to 50 cents, and senior citizens would pay 35 cents, an  increase of 5 cents.  </P> <P> Transit officials say the cost of diesel fuel has more than doubled to nearly  $1.10 a gallon. City buses use about 2 million gallons of fuel a year. "At the  current rate, our fuel costs are going to increase by over $1 million this  year," General Manager Laurence Jackson said.  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Clinton to release more tax returns on Whitewater President Bill Clinton said last night it appeared he had lost less money on the Whitewater land investment in Arkansas than he had previously stated. He promised to release today tax returns dating back to the 1970s which would reveal to the public that he was concealing nothing. In relaxed mood at a nationally televised press conference dominated by Whitewater questions, Mr Clinton insisted that 'the American people should know that I and my administration will not be distracted'. Wryly noting media fascination with Whitewater, he said he was surprised that his poll ratings had not fallen by more than they have. He reiterated that nothing would be withheld from the independent counsel, Mr Robert Fiske. Mr Clinton ducked no questions. He maintained his administration had higher ethical standards than its predecessors and said that, if mistakes had been made, 'we learn as we go along'. His specific confession was that he had simply forgotten that, in 1981, he had raised a short-term personal loan from Mr James MacDougal, his Whitewater partner and formerly chief of an Arkansas savings and loan firm, to help his late mother buy a house in Arkansas. Mr MacDougal has said in interviews he remembers making a personal loan to Mr Clinton. The president said he had racked his brains to remember this and it had only come back to his mind when he was proofreading the unpublished memoirs of his mother, Mrs Virginia Kelley, who died in January. He calculated this meant that his total Whitewater losses, previously stated to be about Dollars 69,000, should be reduced by a further Dollars 22,500. Should he be found liable to any additional back taxes, he would pay them. Mr Clinton denied he had interfered with federal investigations into various aspects of Whitewater. He specifically refuted, though without anger, allegations by respected Congressman Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican, of interference with an investigation by the Kansas City branch of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the savings and loan clean-up agency, into Mr MacDougal's bank. Mr Clinton staunchly defended his wife, Hillary, whose 'moral authority' would emerge from Whitewater 'stronger than it has ever been'. He said she had never earned income as a lawyer in Arkansas from state business while he was governor. Indeed, he showed no animus to anyone. He merely reflected that he had learnt that 'there is a level of suspicion (in Washington) greater than I've been accustomed to in the past'.</p>

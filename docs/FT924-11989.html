			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Syntex in move to cut costs SYNTEX, the US pharma-ceuticals group, said yesterday it was implementing a cost-cutting programme that would involve restructuring some of its administrative and marketing organisations and eliminate a number of positions. The cuts, almost unprecedented in the drugs industry, follow the statement by Eli Lilly, another US group, that it was taking a charge of Dollars 519m to close manufacturing facilities. Syntex said it would reshuffle some of its research and development activities to focus on the most promising programmes. The company said the move followed disappointing results during the first two months of its fiscal 1993 first quarter.</p>

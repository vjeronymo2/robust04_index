			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GOODEN GIVES METS A DEADLINE: SIGN HIM BY START OF SPRING  </P> <P> New York Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden will become a free agent after next season  if the team doesn't sign him to a long-term contract extension before he  reports to spring training, according to a published report.  </P> <P> Gooden wants to avoid the contract uncertainties that teammate Darryl  Strawberry has gone through this season, New York Newsday reported in today's  editions. Strawberry, whose contract expires at the end of this season, has  said he plans to file for free agency.  </P> <P> "I don't want to go through what Straw went through," Gooden told Newsday. "I  don't think that's good for a player. I don't want to have to go out there  every start thinking I have to have a good start because if I don't it'll cost  me money. I don't want to be bothered with it in spring training, either."  </P> <P> Gooden, who signed a three-year, $6.7-million contract after the 1988 season,  said it's up to the Mets to make the first move.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's up to me," Gooden said. "I understand they wanted to see if  I was healthy this year and could pitch like I did before. Well, I think I've  showed them that. I would think that they would want to sign me. But I'm not  going to ask."  </P> <P> Mets General Manager Frank Cashen said the team has not decided how to handle  the situation.  </P> <P> "Do we have a game plan?" Cashen said. "The answer is no. We haven't ruled it  in or out. There are many things you have to consider. Long-term contracts  rarely work out, maybe one in 10 or so. What do you do with everybody else who  is one year away? Do you sign them? Do you trade them? These are things you  have to think about."  </P> <P> Gooden, who finished the season with a 19-7 record after a 9-4 loss to the  Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night, is 119-45 in seven seasons with the Mets.  </P></p>

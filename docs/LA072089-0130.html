			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC OPENS UNIT FOR SMALL BUSINESS;  </P> <P> FOCUS TO BE FIRMS WITH SALES OF UP TO $25 MILLION  </P> <P> Security Pacific National Bank is arming itself for serious combat for the  pocketbooks of small business, a growing market that has long been served  primarily by smaller financial institutions.  </P> <P> The bank on Wednesday named Stephen G. Carpenter as vice chairman in charge of  running Security Pacific's new Middle Market Bank, which was formed a little  more than a week ago to concentrate on businesses with sales ranging from about  $2 million to $25 million.  </P> <P> Security Pacific has three other vice chairmen who head the company's retail,  merchant and business divisions. All four vice chairmen report to Robert H.  Smith, president and chief executive of Security Pacific National Bank.  </P> <P> The new Security Pacific push is part of a move by all the big California banks  to exploit a rapidly growing segment of business that has been credited with  creating many of the economy's new jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Statewide Approach  </P> <P> "This is one of the most attractive markets in banking today," said David C.  Holman, First Interstate Bank of California executive vice president and  divisional manager for Orange County and the Inland Empire.  </P> <P> Holman developed a small business project that was rolled out statewide early  this year. First Interstate's approach is to decentralize decision making and  to have experienced senior officers available to make decisions on local  business loan applications.  </P> <P> Among big banks, Wells Fargo Bank led the race for the business of small  business two years ago when it launched its Business Banking Group. Bank of  America in May announced a return to the small-business commitment of its  founder, A. P. Giannini, by creating what it calls the Small Business Alliance,  a package of discount services including price breaks on publications, payroll  service, car rentals and seminars.  </P> <P> At Security Pacific, the target is to boost small-business lending to the $8  billion-to-$10 billion range in five years from about $1.5 billion now, Smith,  the chief executive, said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sophisticated Services  </P> <P> "It's something that we haven't done a particularly good job on," Smith said.  "It's been something that's been to some degree gnawing at me for some time  now."  </P> <P> Smith said the Middle Market Bank, which will be a separate organization within  Security Pacific, will offer smaller companies the sort of sophisticated  financial products that traditionally have been available only to large firms.  </P> <P> Carpenter -- a banker for more than 25 years -- previously was an executive  vice president with Wells Fargo, heading that bank's middle market operations  in Southern California. Carpenter, 49, also was named a member of Security  Pacific's high-level Office of the Bank and of the management committees of  both the parent Security Pacific Corp. and the bank itself.  </P> <P> Security Pacific named James A. Robinson, 55, and Daniel F. Wheeler, 42, to  executive vice president posts serving the Middle Market Bank.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Renamo rebels criticise UK troop training RENAMO, the Mozambican rebel movement which has been fighting a 16-year civil war, yesterday criticised Britain for training armed forces belonging to the Frelimo government while at the same time advocating peace in the country. Mr Raul Domingas, the movement's chief negotiator at peace talks that have been going on for 18 months in Rome, said in London that Britain's military support for the Mozambique government was 'jeopardising all peace efforts'. Britain was supporting a 'party army', he said. The UK Foreign Office says that by the middle of next year up to 800 Mozambican soldiers will have been trained by Britain. Mr Domingas, visiting London at the invitation of a group of Conservative MPs, said the Rome talks had become deadlocked over the issue of the country's constitution which Renamo says should be reviewed and multi-party democracy institutionalised before a ceasefire could be agreed. He claimed that the country's new constitution, which commits formerly Marxist Mozambique to a mixed economy, freedom of the press, an independence judiciary and multi-party elections, was designed to defend Frelimo interests. Mr Domingas recognised his movement had an 'image problem' but denied reports of Renamo atrocities. Initially backed by Rhodesia and then South Africa, Renamo has reached the negotiating table by way of a harsh guerrilla campaign.</p>

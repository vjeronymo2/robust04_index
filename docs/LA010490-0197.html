			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: FOR EX-BLACK SABBATH STAR BILL WARD, DEMONS ARE IN PAST;  </P> <P> PERSONALITY: HIS LATEST ALBUM CELEBRATES THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW CAREER -- AND A  NEW SELF -- SINCE HE WAS ABLE TO PUSH ALCOHOL OUT OF HIS LIFE.  </P> <P> For most of his adult life, Bill Ward had a role to play and a ready-made mask  to wear.  </P> <P> The role was prominent, and highly remunerative: drummer for Black Sabbath, one  of the earliest, most extravagantly popular heavy metal rock bands.  </P> <P> The mask was what you would expect.  </P> <P> "My ego wanted you to see this heavy metal monster -- Grrrr!" Ward said, hiking  up his shoulders under a navy blue double-breasted blazer as he imitated a  mad-dog rocker's growl. Then he smiled a tolerant smile.  </P> <P> "I know who that guy was, and I look at him sometimes," Ward said Tuesday as he  sat in a diner on Pacific Coast Highway, not far from his home a few blocks  from the ocean in Seal Beach. "I go, 'Yeah, he was OK. But he was pretty messed  up.' Bill Ward the drummer seems like a distant friend these days."  </P> <P> Bill Ward the Black Sabbath drummer died six years ago this week in an alleyway  in Huntington Beach. Once he had been a millionaire rock star, living in a  fine, 19th-Century home on a hill overlooking a village in his native England.  Drinking took all that away. Eventually, Ward's alcohol addiction stripped him  of his ability to function as a musician. Toward the end, it estranged him from  his friends and family. In his last days, Ward the drinker lived in the streets  of Huntington Beach, dogged by pneumonia, looking for a way out. He found it in  that alley, where he stuck a borrowed 12-gauge shotgun in his mouth.  </P> <P> "I didn't have the courage to kill myself," Ward recalled softly. "But as a  human being, I was already dead."  </P> <P> The metal mad-dog drummer never made it out of that alley. In his place walked  a man taking the first steps toward sobriety, and toward a new musical life in  which the pounding headbanger drum beats still figure, but the mask is no  longer required.  </P> <P> The evidence of Ward's artistic rebirth is his first solo album, "Ward One:  Along the Way." Released Wednesday by Chameleon Music Group, it is due in  record stores next week.  </P> <P> The album begins with the ominous crackle of an ambulance radio relaying grim  medical reports -- a sound that Ward says became an almost routine part of his  life in 1983 as it dwindled into a series of physical emergencies and mental  crises fueled by his alcoholism. It ends with the sound of footsteps, first  circumspect, but growing steadily stronger until the steps are joined by the  sound of a light, optimistic whistle. In between, Ward's song cycle probes the  dark, lonely tightrope walk of an addict struggling to reach for hope before he  tumbles into despair.  </P> <P> While much of "Ward One" recalls the brooding tone, wailing guitar and  tromp-and-chug rhythms of vintage Black Sabbath, the album also has a strong  adventurous streak that allows for an unflagging emphasis on melody,  atmospheric textures that recall Pink Floyd, African rhythms not unlike Peter  Gabriel's, and even the softness of a caressing rock lullaby.  </P> <P> Ward sings lead vocals for the first time in his 22-year rock career, in a  voice that is limited, but evocative after the manner of Roger Waters' dramatic  singing in Pink Floyd (minus the screams). Ward gets some all-star help from  Ozzy Osbourne, his old Black Sabbath band mate, and from Cream alumnus Jack  Bruce, each of whom sings the lead on two songs.  </P> <P> As a founding member of Black Sabbath, Ward had some creative input, but he  faced nothing like the wide-ranging demands of writing, singing and arranging  an album of his own.  </P> <P> "I guess I put in what I could, how I could," he said of his creative role in  Black Sabbath, which Ward formed in 1968 along with Osbourne, bassist Terry  (Geezer) Butler and guitarist Tony Iommi.  </P> <P> When it came to writing songs with Black Sabbath, "I'd let things pass. I'd  have an idea, and I'd keep it inside. Finding out what I'm capable of, what's  inside -- that's what this album is about. There's been a whole discovery. I  found a guy who had this inside him, but didn't know how to let it out."  </P> <P> For Ward, 41, the process of finding a musical self began after he gained  sobriety in 1984. First, he rejoined Butler and Iommi in Black Sabbath, but he  soon quit the band, feeling that it had stagnated (Iommi still leads a rump  version of Black Sabbath). Ward tried playing with other musicians for two  years but failed to find a focus.  </P> <P> Then, starting in 1987, he began work on "Ward One" with a nucleus of Southern  California-based musicians, including guitarists Rue Phillips and Keith Lynch,  who helped Ward write the music on several of the album's songs.  </P> <P> Ward contacted Bruce and asked him to sing two songs, even though he had never  met the former Cream singer-bassist. Bruce's clear, emotive tenor serves as the  voice of comfort and encouragement on the lullaby, "Light Up the Candles," and  on "Tall Stories," an affirmative rocker in which Ward writes of regaining the  ability to play music.  </P> <P> "Ozzy invited himself," Ward said. "He said, 'What's all this I hear about you  doing an album? You haven't invited me.' " Ward turned the microphone over to  Osbourne for the album's most Sabbath-like rockers, "Jack's Land" and the  excellent "Bombers (Can Open Bomb Bays)."  </P> <P> Osbourne, whose own successful solo career has been played out against  continuing struggles with drug and alcohol abuse, is the voice of baleful  warning in his two songs, expressing bleak visions of addiction's consequences,  yet also pointing to hope and recovery as open paths.  </P> <P> At least at the start, the guest stars and Sabbath connections will be a big  part of the promotional strategy for Ward's album, according to Stephen Powers,  president of Chameleon, the Hawthorne-based independent record label that has  raised its profile with recent releases by Mary's Danish and John Lee Hooker.  </P> <P> "We're going to get out of the gate based on past history and associations,"  Powers said. "But our long-range goal is to develop Bill as an artist so they  don't see this as a one-off where his friends came in and played and that's the  only reason for the album."  </P> <P> Ward wants no part of the metal-monster baggage that came with Black Sabbath, a  band infamous for its dark musings, occult trappings and demonic imagery.  </P> <P> "I don't want to do death any more. I don't want to do doom and gloom. I want  to do life and love," Ward said.  </P> <P> "I want no burning skulls or demonic interest," he added, speaking of video  plans. "Naked women running across the video set -- no thank you. Get somebody  else to do that. I've had enough of that. If I get the opportunity to do any  videos and you see any skulls in it, you can come over to my house and smack my  head with a big shovel."  </P> <P> Doom-laden imagery aside, Ward said he is still fond of Black Sabbath's  head-banging sound.  </P> <P> "I love its primitivism, its naivete," he said. "A very important rock band and  a very good band. I love 'em. I can be a fan now. I can listen to it and be  outside it."  </P> <P> Ward acknowledges that he remains a fortunate Sabbath insider in one respect:  royalties. "It's been a godsend. I get to feed the kids," he said of catalogue  sales spurred by the advent of compact discs. "I'm hoping I can get in a  position where I'm self-supporting from my own work."  </P> <P> As his first album emerges, Ward is preparing for one of the last but most  difficult steps along the way to a full comeback: touring. In the early '80s,  an alcohol-fogged Ward was capable of suffering a nervous breakdown at the mere  thought of touring. The drummer said he is putting together a band and road  crew for a "noncommittal" round of live shows this spring.  </P> <P> "I could still have mixed feelings" about touring, said Ward, a father of three  who lives with his third wife and his two younger children in a quiet section  of quaint Seal Beach, an old Navy town that couldn't be farther from the rock  'n' roll fast lane.  </P> <P> "That's why I want to go a little slow. I'm looking for a place inside where I  can say, 'Yeah, I feel OK about this.' I want to make the professional  commitment. I want to work through the fears that I have about going on the  road. That's my goal. If that trial run works, we'll get more committed."  </P> <P> This time, Ward won't feel compelled to wear that old heavy metal monster's  mask.  </P> <P> "(With Black Sabbath) I felt I had to perform for everybody the way I thought  they wanted me to be, instead of playing what I am. I feel I've begun to play  what I am instead of playing safe. I'm letting myself be vulnerable nowadays.  I'm being more of a human being these days."  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Floating-rate note revival gathers pace as issues dwindle NEW ISSUE activity in the international bond market ground almost to a halt yesterday, with public holidays in most continental European markets. However, the revival of the floating-rate note market continued to gather pace. Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the double-A rated Italian bank, launched a Dollars 150m deal lead managed by Kidder Peabody. The deal follows Wednesday's Dollars 200m offering by Banco di Roma, and a string of other deals from borrowers in recent weeks ranging from Sumitomo Bank to the City of Stockholm. The five-year paper issued yesterday pays  3/16 per cent - 18.75 basis points - over the six-month London interbank offered rate and was re-offered to investors at par. The pricing was seen as fair by participants in the deal. Banco di Roma offered 25 basis points over Libor, but does not carry a credit rating. Kidder Peabody estimated that around 60 per cent of yesterday's issue was purchased by other banks. Floating-rate notes carry only a 20 per cent risk weighting under the Basle capital adequacy accord, against 100 per cent for corporate bonds. This means banks need to set aside only one-fifth the capital required for corporate debt. The rest of the paper was bought by managers of money market funds, keen to switch out of cash deposits to pick up a higher yield. Syndicate officials said the return of banks to the market in any numbers for the first time since 1990 reflected the improving credit quality of many financial institutions. Investors are now more comfortable holding bank bonds. For example, Bank of American - one of the most improved credits in the US banking sector - returned to the floating-rate note market in February for the first time since 1987. In addition, conditions in the interest rate swaps market have deteriorated. Banks can now achieve a cheaper cost of funds by issuing floating-rate paper directly, rather than issuing fixed-rate bonds and swapping the liability into floating rate. Moreover, other sources of bank funding have dried up. For example, many banks funded themselves by placing structured bonds - paper linked to the Tokyo stock market, for example - with institutional investors in Japan. This ready source of funding has declined with the turbulence of Japanese financial markets. New issue activity is expected to remain subdued today. Next week, however, syndicate officials are anticipating deals in the Eurodollar sector. Among the potential issuers is Spintab, the mortgage subsidiary of Swedbank, rumoured to be planning a five-year issue of around Dollars 250m. Investor AB, the holding company controlled by Sweden's Wallenberg family, plans to make an Ecu-denominated convertible bond issue in the international bond market Yesterday, the company started a series of presentations to international investors and plans to launch an offer 'within the next few weeks'. The company already has Swedish krona-denominated convertibles outstanding in the domestic market. It plans to buy back these bonds from institutional investors, change the currency denomination under provisions already in place, and re-offer the stock on the international market.</p>

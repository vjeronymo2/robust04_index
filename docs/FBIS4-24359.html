			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that China welcomes foreign bankers to invest in  China's power industry and construction on other infrastructures.    Li made the remarks during a meeting with bankers from the  World Bank and representatives from 17 banks of six countries  that are providing loans by means of Expanded Co-Financing (ECO)  to China's Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant here this afternoon.    During the meeting, Li extended his welcome and  congratulations to the bankers for the success of the 120  million U.S. dollar ECO cooperation program for the Chinese  plant, saying that China's economy has had sustained  development, in which the development of the power industry  holds an important position.    Long into the future, he said, China will continue to take  in  foreign funds and equipment to accelerate its development in the  power industry and on other infrastructural construction.    Li said that for the past several decades, China's power  industry has witnessed great progress, but it is still  inadequate for the development of the whole national economy and  the raising of people's living standards.    Therefore, Li said, the Chinese Government has adopted  various measures to speed up power development so that it will  be developed with an annual increase rate of eight to nine  percent in the following five years.    Considering this point, said the Chinese premier, the power  industry market in China is promising.    Li said that in the past 14 years, China and the World Bank  have conducted effective cooperation. China has not only  received loans from the World Bank but also learned experience  in management, he added.    China hopes to strengthen its cooperation with the World  Bank  and other foreign financial institutions in the power industry  and other infrastructure constructions, said Li.    The World Bank has decided to provide a 350 million U.S.  dollar loan for the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant and agreed to  provide a guarantee for those foreign banks which provide the  120 million U.S. dollars in loans for the ECO program.    Li praised the World Bank and other relevant financial  institutions for their efforts in promoting the ECO program with  the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant.    He said that ECO is a good mode of cooperation, adding that  the success of the program shows that the cooperation between  China and the World Bank and other foreign financial  institutions has a bright future.    The Chinese premier said that with development of China's  economy, the enhancement of its economic strength and the  success of its foreign currency system reform, China's ability  to pay back loans in foreign currency is no problem.    The representatives of banks that are providing the ECO loan  said that they are satisfied with the implementation of the  program, which has been accomplished within such a short period  of time.    The World Bank and other foreign banks will use the ECO  program with the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant as reference for  the next ECO program with China, so as to expand the scale of  cooperation with China, they said.    Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and Minister Shi Dazhen  of the power industry took part in the meeting.</p>

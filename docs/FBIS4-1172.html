			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Extreme confusion prevails in Rwanda. Fighting  is continuing in Kigali, while no progress has been made in  Arusha. The meeting between the belligerents announced by the  United Nations has still not taken place. Anne Corpet reports:    [Corpet] In Arusha, these peace talks are still indeed  awaited. They have not been cancelled officially, although the  Rwandan Government delegation has not arrived. The Rwandan  interior minister is believed to be in Goma, in Zaire, with two  army chief officers. A UN plane is ready to take them to  Arusha, but the plane has not taken off yet.    For its part, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] sent its  secretary-general, Theogene Rudasingwa, by land, and we have  just heard that he left Arusha this morning. However, he  proposed a conditional cease-fire yesterday which would come  into force as of tomorrow.    [Announcer] Things seem to be even more complicated since  another mediation is reported to have taken place or to be  taking place in Gbadolite, in Zaire, according to some sources:    [Corpet] Yes, it is believed to be taking place in Zaire  under the aegis of Marshall Mobutu. The Rwandan ambassador in  Belgium has announced that a meeting took place last week  between delegations of the RPF and of the Rwandan Government.  According to the Rwandan ambassador, the two sides reached an  agreement on a text providing for a cease-fire which was  supposed to be signed today. The trouble is that the RPF has  denied meeting the Rwandan Government and denies the existence  of such an agreement. Moreover, the RPF did not attend the  meeting which is reported to have been scheduled for today in  Zaire to sign the cease-fire.    From a diplomatic point of view, confusion has the upper  hand, with two negotiation sites and two cease-fire proposals,  but no official meeting between the two sides. Meanwhile, on  the ground in Rwanda, as you said, fighting is continuing  without respite. [passage omitted]</p>

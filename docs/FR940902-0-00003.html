			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Kiwifruit Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, met on February 10, 1994, and recommended increasing the minimum size requirement from Size 49, which is defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The marketing order authorizes under &sect;920.52(a)(2) the establishment of minimum size requirements. &sect;920.302(a)(2) of the rules and regulations outlines the minimum size requirements for fresh shipments of California kiwifruit. Section 920.302(a)(4)(ii) includes a table that specifies numerical size designations that are used to determine kiwifruit sizes. These size designations are defined by numerical counts, which establish the maximum number of fruit per 8-pound sample for each of the established sizes. The size designation table defines ten different sizes, beginning with Size 21 (the largest size) and ending with Size 49 (the smallest size). The committee recommended eliminating the Size 49 designation (60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample) and redefining the Size 45/46 designation (57 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample) as a Size 45 designation (55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee recommended increasing the minimum size requirement because of the blending and packing of undersized fruit into containers using the Size 49 designation. Current pack requirements specify that kiwifruit designated as Size 45/46 or below must be packed within a 1/4 inch size tolerance. Undersized fruit (Size 49 kiwifruit near or below the lower limit of the size tolerance) is often blended into the Size 49 designation. It is a common practice throughout the industry to blend and pack kiwifruit that could be designated as either undersized fruit, Size 49, or Size 45/46 into a Size 49 container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Blending occurs because adjoining size designations have size tolerances that partially overlap and kiwifruit within either size tolerance may be packed in either size designation. For example, the current Size 49 designation and the current Size 45/46 designation have only a 3-count difference per 8-pound sample. This amounts to only a 0.12 ounce difference per individual fruit. The equipment and time needed to detect such a difference when packing individual fruit would be cost prohibitive, so instead, handlers choose to blend sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Blending has become more prevalent in recent years because a greater percentage of kiwifruit is being packed in volume-fill or bulk containers in which the fruit is packed ``loosely'' instead of in containers with molded trays. Without the constraints of a molded tray, there is more freedom to blend sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee's intention in recommending this increase in the minimum size requirement is to eliminate shipments of undersized fruit that is blended into the Size 49 designation. This undersized kiwifruit tends to soften more rapidly during storage than larger fruit and becomes more susceptible to decay. This tendency for undersized fruit to soften more rapidly than larger fruit becomes more pronounced once it leaves a controlled environment and enters an uncontrolled one such as a retail shelf. The end result is that the consumer is more likely to encounter quality defects with undersized fruit then with larger fruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eliminating fresh shipments of undersized fruit by increasing the minimum size requirement improves overall quality and increases uniformity of pack size. The consumer benefits by being offered a higher quality kiwifruit that ripens properly without prematurely shriveling or softening. Also, grower returns are expected to increase due to less repack loss, better kiwifruit movement, and higher prices because of a better quality product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is also ample evidence to show that the market is adverse to smaller sizes. The California Kiwifruit Commission (commission) funded an independent survey titled ``Fresh Kiwifruit: Views from the Trade,'' in 1993. This survey indicated that 30% of the trade rejects small sizes and that 86.1% of the trade prefers Size 42 (defined as 50 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample) or larger. Also, 92.1% of the merchandisers and produce managers claim that their customers reject small sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

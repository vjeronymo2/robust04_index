			<p>BFN     [Text] Malawian Defense Minister General Mponela has been  in Mozambique since 8 May and has been holding talks with his  Mozambican counterpart, Army General Alberto Chipande.  Mozambique and Malawi have agreed to hold the sixth meeting of  the Joint Defense and Security Commission in Maputo within a few  days, according to a communique released to the press yesterday  at the end of a meeting between the Mozambican defense minister  and his Malawian counterpart.    The meeting in the National Defense Ministry allowed the  Malawian defense minister to get acquainted with the activities  of the countries' joint commission in his capacity as the new  co-president of the commission, replacing John Tembo, minister  of state in the President's Office.    During the talks, the Mozambique-Malawi Joint Defense and  Security Commission reviewed relations between the two countries  in the military field since the signing of the general  cooperation agreement in 1984. The two ministers also exchanged  views on political developments in both countries, after  welcoming the new nonracial and democratic government in South  Africa.    Meanwhile, the sixth meeting of the Joint Defense and  Security Commission, scheduled to be held in Maputo soon, may  discuss such issues as the presence in Mozambique of the Malawi  Young Pioneers, an armed wing of the ruling Malawi Congress  Party. Regarding the presence of the Malawi Young Pioneers in  Mozambique -- which is a serious violation of Mozambican  territory -- it has been reported that the last session of this  commission held in February directed military experts from both  countries to report on the situation for the relevant  authorities to make their decision on the issue. We also  learned yesterday that the commission's experts may meet soon,  before the holding of the sixth meeting of the Mozambique-Malawi  Joint Defense and Security Commission.</p>

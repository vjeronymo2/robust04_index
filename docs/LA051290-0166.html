			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MATTER WHAT, EVANS IS ENDURING;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: AT 38, HE HAS GONE THROUGH A LOT WITH HIS FAMILY AND THE RED SOX, BUT  HIS PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY EXCELLENT.  </P> <P> He is as lasting as the Green Monster that looms over left field in Fenway  Park, as much a landmark in Boston as the Citgo sign perched over the Monster's  shoulder outside the bandbox ballpark.  </P> <P> Dwight Evans is a living link to the few glories the Red Sox have savored in  the last two decades.  </P> <P> He is graying a bit, but the 38-year-old Santa Monica native and Chatsworth  High School graduate is no relic overstaying his welcome. Although a back  problem prevents his playing right field, where he won eight Gold Gloves, Evans  perseveres through trials both personal and professional to remain among the  top craftsmen of the hitting game.  </P> <P> Any suggestion that he is stoic; that he deserves admiration for bearing the  disappointment of 17 years without a World Series championship; that he handles  the pain of an injury that has reduced his role and the heartbreak of a serious  illness that afflicts his two sons, brings a smile to a face that is as  weathered and strong as a New England cottage.  </P> <P> "It's just a game we get paid quite a bit of money for," he said on a recent  blustery spring day at Fenway Park. "I feel fortunate and blessed in my family  and my career. I'm grateful I've played the game this long in this town. When I  see guys packing up and moving, I think of how we've been in the same house  since 1976.  </P> <P> "To play this long is a privilege and an honor. We are New Englanders. I grew  up in Hawaii and was raised in L.A., but what I see out there is nice weather  for New England. I like it here. This is home."  </P> <P> The back woes, which are a stress fracture and a bone spur at the top of his  tailbone, have limited him to designated-hitter duty since last August. To call  him limited, though, is to underestimate Dwight Evans.  </P> <P> His .273 career average is fairly modest by the standards of Carl Yastrzemski  and Ted Williams, whose memories he competes with every day, but Evans is the  only major league player with 100 or more runs batted in the last three  seasons, and his 334 RBIs in those seasons is second only to the 335 amassed by  Toronto's George Bell, who is eight years Evans' junior.  </P> <P> Evans enjoyed his best season in 1987, at 35, when he hit .305 with 34 home  runs and 123 RBIs and tied for the league lead with 106 walks. He hit .285 last  season, including .299 as a DH, fifth-best in the league. With 20 home runs, he  became the only major leaguer to hit 20 or more homers in every season since  1981.  </P> <P> Significantly, he hit .327 with runners in scoring position and had 44 multihit  games.  </P> <P> Evans' RBI total of 1,302 -- including a team-leading 19 this season -- puts  him among the most productive active players and in the top 50 all time. He is  in the top 30 in extra bases, is in the top 50 in games played and is tops in  home runs among active players with 374. This season, he is hitting .248  overall.  </P> <P> Defensively, he was among the best, as will be confirmed by anyone who saw his  spectacular catch to rob the Cincinnati Reds' Joe Morgan of a home run in Game  6 of the 1975 World Series and his ensuing rifle-like throw to double Ken  Griffey off first base.  </P> <P> As much as he would like to return to right field, though, the prospects look  dim. Not only is there the matter of Boston's acquisition of Tom Brunansky from  St. Louis last week, but Evans' balky back simply won't permit it.  </P> <P> "I can play with it. Some days it's better than others, and the only thing I  can do is go day by day," said Evans, who is with the Red Sox this weekend at  Anaheim Stadium. "I'd love to be back in the outfield but I can't, and if I  can't, I just want to help the ballclub.  </P> <P> "It's like a rose bush with a thorn. It doesn't really bother me just walking  and doing normal things, but when I accelerate, there's discomfort. Sometimes  it brings you to your knees and sometimes it's bearable."  </P> <P> He has borne the aches and pains that every player knows -- and other, deeper  aches that bring pain to the heart.  </P> <P> Evans' oldest son, Timothy, 17, was a toddler when it was learned that he had  neurofibromatosis, sometimes called "Elephant Man's disease." Those afflicted  develop soft tumors on or under the skin, and they also can have bone defects.  Timothy had 10 operations between 1975 and '78.  </P> <P> Justin Evans, 13 -- the third child of Dwight Evans and his high school  sweetheart, Susan -- also has the disease and recently underwent surgery to  remove a tumor from the base of his skull. The Evanses' 14-year-old daughter,  Kirstin, has not been affected.  </P> <P> "You don't like to make excuses, but these things hurt," Evans said before  leaving to be with Justin for the latest operation. "They hurt a lot. How do  you handle something like this, when part of your flesh isn't right? How do you  handle it?"  </P> <P> By his own admission, he did not handle his tribulations well when his children  and his career were in their infancy. He was forbidding, given to brooding, in  a clubhouse where levity was never the norm.  </P> <P> "I was probably immature at one time, for a long time," said Evans, who also  credits his Christian faith for much of his strength. "I think I've matured. .  . . The trouble with the children, not knowing how to cope with it being a  young father, coming from the park and going to the hospital. I was booed and  I'd say, 'Why?' But I've matured since then, and I'm glad I've been able to  stay around the game long enough to reap some of the benefits."  </P> <P> He benefited immensely from the tutelage of hitting guru Walt Hriniak, now with  the Chicago White Sox, who began working with him in 1980. Evans was hitting  .194 at that year's All-Star break and was being platooned in right field. His  average for eight seasons through '80 was .262.  </P> <P> In the nine seasons since, through '89, he has hit .281 with 238 home runs --  he had 128 in the previous eight -- and 840 RBIs, compared with 443 before  working with Hriniak.  </P> <P> But Hriniak did more than just change Evans' stance. He changed Evans' outlook  on life, with Hriniak's own devotion to family and baseball serving as a model  for Evans' priorities.  </P> <P> "Walt Hriniak taught me how to approach the game and about a good work ethic,"  he said. "Hard work does pay off. A lot of people say practice makes perfect,  but to me, to practice perfect makes it perfect. Walt taught me a lot on and  off the field about consistency. He helped me out a lot in my life."  </P> <P> What is missing from Evans' life is the kind of adoration Boston fans showered  upon Williams and Yastrzemski late in their careers, yet Evans is unconcerned.  Asked if he ranks himself with that storied pair and with another great Red Sox  outfielder and Hall of Famer, Tris Speaker, Evans demurs.  </P> <P> "I couldn't answer that," said Evans, whose contract calls for a $1.4-million  salary this season, with a club option for the same amount in 1990.  </P> <P> "Yaz was a great player. Ted Williams, I saw pictures of Ted Williams playing.  We've had some great players here, some of the greatest who ever played the  game. I don't look at things like (a place in history).  </P> <P> "For me, things go back to 1980. Looking back at the years since then, I've  averaged 25 home runs and 80 RBIs. It's kind of nice to achieve that. Those  things are nice and good, but I have to say the most important thing is  winning. The reason I've been consistent is because I play to win."  </P> <P> That the Red Sox haven't won a World Series remains a major source of regret.  </P> <P> "We had some great, great power teams, great pitching clubs," he said when  asked if he was surprised that he and the Red Sox had not made it to the World  Series in his career more than their two losing visits, in 1975 to the  Cincinnati Reds and in '86 to the New York Mets.  </P> <P> "In the mid-'70s and '80s we had power-packed clubs," he said. "That should  have been good enough to get us in three or four World Series and win two or  three World championships. We just didn't do it. . . . Of all the years, '75  was the most important.  </P> <P> "It seems like I've always been in a pennant race. In '72, I came up and we  were a half-game out. In '86, I have yet to look at the video highlights  because that really did hurt."  </P> <P> It is a credit to his faith, his strength and his sanity that Dwight Evans has  not become a bitter man. He sees no reason to be.  </P> <P> "God has blessed me with a talent, and I am happy with myself," he said.  "That's the biggest thing, that I can accept myself for what I am. I'm not  going to make everybody happy. I go out and do the best I can and I go home and  sit and analyze it. Whether it's good in anybody else's eyes, I can't say.  Nobody ever hit in 162 games. If you're successful three out of 10 times at the  plate, you're doing well.  </P> <P> "My family's No. 1, but the game has been great to me. I haven't hurt the game,  and I want to keep playing for a long time."  </P> <P> HOW EVANS RANKS AMONG ACTIVE PLAYERS  </P> <P> STATISTICS THROUGH FRIDAY  </P> <P> GAMES  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:2.99IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Player  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Team  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bill Buckner  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Boston  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,509  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dwight Evans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Boston  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,411  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Robin Yount  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Milwaukee  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,318  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dave Winfield  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> N.Y.

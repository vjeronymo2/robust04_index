			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Italian Elections: An upstart in the heart of Bossi country  -A Forza Italia candidate for the right in a Northern League stronghold Mr Raffaele Della Valle is careful not to say so, but as candidate in Monza for a four-party right-wing alliance in this weekend's Italian elections he is a cuckoo in the nest. He belongs to Forza Italia which had a tough job convincing the populist Northern League to accept him as joint candidate. Monza, a town of 125,000 inhabitants on the northern edge of Milan province, has a League-dominated council and the party, led by Mr Umberto Bossi, has grown accustomed in its eight-year life to regarding it as home ground. But an election victory for Mr Della Valle in this first-past-the post lower house seat matters greatly to Forza Italia, both within Lombardy, where Monza is the third largest town, and further afield. He would bring Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new party considerable prestige as a lawyer famous for the successful defence of the TV personality Enzo Tortara, who became Italy's Dreyfus of the 1980s when accused of involvement with drugs and the Camorra. Mr Della Valle's chances are said to be strong but his candidature has thrown up problems for the right wing typical of much of the north. Mr Bossi's wild attacks on Forza Italia, which he regards as an upstart stealing League support, have created tension and Mr Della Valle cannot necessarily count on votes from the more radical League supporters. Moreover, the chairman of the local industrial association has come out in favour of the candidate of the centrist Pact for Italy. Right-wing voters also have the option of the National Alliance, the former neo-fascists, which has a pact with Forza Italia in the south but not in the north where it is anathema to the League. As both the League and Forza Italia have headquarters in Milan, they and the two smaller parties fighting alongside them expect widespread northern success. Indeed, in Milan and province Mr Roberto Cipriani, the Forza Italia co-ordinator, claims the alliance can take 29 of the 31 first-past-the post seats for the lower house. For Prof Guido Martinotti of Milan university's political science faculty the big question is whether Forza Italia backers will vote for League candidates. 'That is what the other parties are capitalising on,' he says. As the senior partner in the alliance, League nominees make up the lion's share of candidates in Milan and province. But the knowledge that they are shored up by reluctant Forza Italia support would weaken the right if it entered government. The measure of support for each party will become apparent in the seats reserved for proportional representation, which parties fight under their own banners. These represent a quarter of all seats and, in Milan and province, total 10, on top of the 31 first-past-the-post seats. Prof Giuseppe Maria Longoni, a historian who lives in Monza, detects falling support there for the League. 'People thought problems would be sorted out but there has proved to be no magic potion,' he says. Among these is the argument over how best to make use of the huge Villa Reale park, inside which is the Formula One racing car circuit. The League says the track is a vital Monza asset but the greens have opposed it. Mr Della Valle's programme, based on making Monza and the neighbouring Brianza an autonomous province, and setting up a university at Monza, is certainly not one with which the Northern League would disagree. 'I want to avoid the risk of Monza becoming absorbed as an outlying district of Milan,' he says. Like other Forza Italia candidates, his is not a new face as he used to be a councillor for the now defunct Liberal party. What Forza Italia is counting on is that the owners of the small textiles and furniture businesses at Monza will find that his face inspires confidence in the party as a credible national force.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> OVERPASS EXPANSION FOE IS THREATENED  </P> <P> A leader in the fight to block expansion of the Yale Avenue pedestrian  overpasses said Tuesday that he had received a death threat.  </P> <P> David Flint, treasurer of a group that wants the bridges to remain restricted  to pedestrians, bicyclists and emergency vehicles, played the tape of the phone  call at a news conference.  </P> <P> The caller said, "How dare you use our money for political causes," and said  Flint's family and home were in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "What the hell is happening behind the nice, glossy, planned community?" Flint  asked. "There are wackos out there."  </P> <P> The threat also prompted outrage from Yale Action, the group advocating  expansion of the overpasses.  </P> <P> "It's not appropriate at all. It's not right," said Gary Vanderpol, the  treasurer of Yale Action. "That's not the kind of campaign we're running."  </P> <P> Flint said the threat followed the distribution of a flyer challenging a  decision by the Deerfield Homeowners Assn. to donate $2,500 to Flint's group,  the Friends of Caution for Neighborhood Preservation. The flyer, which lists  Flint's phone number and address, claims that the homeowners' association will  lose its tax-exempt status if it makes the contribution. The flyer was  distributed by two former officials in the Deerfield Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> But the association doesn't have tax-exempt status now, Flint said. Flint, vice  president of the association, said it has budgeted $6,000 of its $350,000  annual budget for taxes this year.  </P> <P> One of the authors of the flyer said he had assumed that the association had  tax-exempt status.  </P> <P> On June 5, voters will decide whether the bridges on Yale Avenue over the  Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroad tracks and over the San Diego Freeway  should be expanded to accommodate two-lane vehicular traffic.

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Age-old dilemma taxes Japan's Ministry of Finance AMID THE SEA of scandal and profligacy which is Japan's pork barrel politics, the Ministry of Finance is an island of conservatism and fiscal rectitude. Its officials take their role as guardians of the government's finances seriously and were unhappy about the size of the recent budget package. The mere suggestion that it might be a little austere for the Japanese government to be running a budget surplus as the economy slides toward recession is enough to make their blood boil. Not surprisingly, the Ministry of Finance prefers the world to take notice of its central government budget balance. Even after the Y10,800bn (Pounds 57bn) package, the general government budget will be in surplus next year by the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. But the central government budget, as the latest OECD report on the Japanese economy stresses, will be in deficit to the tune of 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1993. The large discrepancy between the Japanese central and general government budgets is explained by the social security fund, the revenues from which are excluded from the central government budget, in contrast to the US where they are included. One reason for emphasising the central government deficit is politics. The Ministry of Finance has bitter memories of the speed with which Japan's politicians allowed the budget deficit to rise in the years following the 1974-1975 recession and the difficulty it subsequently had in bringing the deficit down. The ministry has been fighting an economic guerrilla war to prevent a return to fiscal profligacy. Yet the ministry is also worried about the fiscal implications of Japan's ageing population. The right-hand chart shows the projected dependency ratios of the US, Japan and Germany over the next three decades. The US had the steepest fall in its dependency in the 1960s and 1970s as the post-war baby boom generation moved into the labour force. But Japan is expected to have the largest rise as the baby-boomers move into retirement, and live longer lives. By 2020, over half of the US population, but nearly two-thirds of the Japanese will be either young or retired. This helps explain why Japan has a higher personal sector savings rate than the US or Europe. But Japan also has a national savings rate that is almost twice as high as the US and UK, in part because the government is saving on behalf of its future aged. The social security fund showed a surplus of 3.5 per cent of GDP this year compared to 0.9 per cent in the US. Japan's social security fund assets are equivalent to over 50 per cent of Japanese GDP, explaining how the Japanese government can have a gross debt of over 60 per cent of GDP but a net debt ratio which is 5.4 per cent of GDP and falling, compared to an OECD average of 33 per cent. Does it make sense for the Japanese government to save in this way? Yes, say the OECD and the Ministry of Finance. The health and pension needs of Japan's ageing population could raise the ratio of non-interest spending by 30 per cent between 1990 and 2028, equal to 8 1/2 per cent of GNP. Unless the government saves and repays debt in order to reduce the interest burden, currently a little under 17 per cent of GDP, the general government budget will move into structural deficit and taxes will have to rise. The alternative to higher taxes in the future is higher taxes and lower public spending today. But Japanese incomes per head are rising fast so taxpayers in the year 2028 will be absolutely much better off. The problem is that they will still have to pay a higher proportion of these higher incomes in tax, something the ministry fears they will both resent and oppose. Yet the level of national savings will also determine how fast the Japanese economy grows between now and then. A high national savings rate now means more funds for domestic investment and more accumulated foreign assets. We are all dead in the long run: but taxpayers in the US and UK may soon find themselves lamenting the fact that every year the long run takes longer to arrive.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: MONEY AND FINANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This table shows growth rates for the most widely followed measures of narrow and broad money, a representative short- and long-term interest rate series and an average equity market yield.

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Russian prices rise far higher than predicted SHOCK therapy came to Russia yesterday with prices leaping four or five times - far more than the doubling predicted by the government for the first month of the reform. Shops which last year offered only a few cheap goods were still virtually bare but the few goods available were now expensive, spelling poverty for average wage-earners and real hardship for the low-paid. Ukraine, the second largest republic, also freed its prices yesterday, with journalists reporting rises of between three and six times, in line with the Russian experience. Ukraine is to give its citizens Rbs400 worth of coupons from next week in their salaries as compensation. Belorussia, the third Slav republic, will free its prices today and will also introduce coupons. No disturbances were reported in Moscow yesterday, as the price of 10 eggs rose to Rbs11 from Rbs2, a kilo of indifferent meat to between Rbs21 and Rbs31 from around Rbs8, and butter to Rbs45 where before it had sold for Rbs10. The minimum wage and pension is Rbs342 a month. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, told the evening paper Izvestia that price inflation would run at 100 per cent a month for January and February, and that prices would rise threefold in the first quarter. Production would fall over the year by 10-12 per cent and unemployment would rise sharply. He predicted, however, that the rise in prices would moderate to about 12 per cent a month by the middle of the year and to 'a few per cent' by its end. He said he feared that political pressures to pay extra compensation would prove too great to withstand, and that a new inflationary spiral 'in which money would lose all meaning' would be instituted. Business people and economists were full of foreboding on the effects of the price rises - while conceding that the economic situation had become so desperate that the government had had little choice. Mr Sergei Shibayev, managing director of the Moscow office of accountants Ernst and Young, said: 'This was the only thing available perhaps to make things better by the end of the year.' He added: 'It will give some kind of signal to producers and business: the problem is that other signals are also being given. The top rate of income tax is 60 per cent - you cannot create capital in that way.' Tax rates, agreed in the past few weeks, reflect the government's hunger for both roubles and hard currency in order to balance the budget, after the past year in which almost no income came in. Personal income tax bands rise from 12 per cent to 60 per cent; a new value added tax is set at 28 per cent; profit tax is put at 32 per cent; and the government has retained the system under which enterprises which earn hard currency must sell 40 per cent of it to the government at a low rate. Mr Mikhail Berger, the chief economic commentator of Izvestia, said the government hoped to match Poland's experience, with goods coming through to the shops after a couple of months. Dr Alexei Kireyev, a former Gorbachev adviser, said both the government and the population were badly prepared. 'They are already very poor and I think the therapy may be too shocking for many.'</p>

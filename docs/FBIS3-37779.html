			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Latvian Press Review"] </F>   [Text] Riga, February 22, LETA -- "Skrunda -- Is it a  military or political problem" - it is the question that the  former Latvian Defence Minister Talavs Jundzis, the Director of  the Baltic Center for Strategic Research at the Latvian Academy  of Science, sought to give an answer to on the pages of the  newspaper "Diena". The regiment No. 18591 of the Russian Armed  Forces takes up 500 hectares of land in the district of Ranki,  county of Kuldiga, 5 kilometers from Skrunda where the  controversial radar base is located. Such missile-attack early  warnings radars first appeared in 1960's in the U.S. and the  Soviet Union simultaneously. The radar base in Skrunda is only  one of the eight similar military sites erected along the  perimeter of the former USSR. Jundzis said that the site in  Skrunda could be effectively substituted by radar stations  situated in Mukachevo and Murmansk. The equipment of the base in  Skrunda is worn-out and obsolete. The American experts who  visited the site in 1993 were extremely surprised that the  station was still functioning at all.    According to Jundzis, to keep this Russian military site in  Latvia would mean to preserve the direct Russian military  influence and interests in Latvia for at least five-and-a-half  years which would result in Latvia still being included in the  zone of direct influence of the Russian military doctrine and  its armed forces as well. The agreement on Skrunda turns Latvia  into a voluntary hostage for the collective security of the CIS  countries with unpredictable consequences that makes the Baltic  Republic to undertake a number of unsubstantiated obligations  towards the Russian militaries and army veterans, Jundzis said.  It would be naivete to think that in 1996 Zhirinovsky or any  other similarly-minded person would keep to the agreement signed  by Yeltsin in 1994. For Latvia, it would be more preferable not  to sign the agreement as it might at least induce the  international organizations to observe their own resolutions  calling for fast and complete withdrawal of the Russian troops  from Latvia.</p>

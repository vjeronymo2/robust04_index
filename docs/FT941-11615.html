			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: The importance of being biggest - Andrew Jack looks behind J Sainsbury's plan to switch auditors The high street retailer, J Sainsbury, yesterday confirmed that it is planning to switch auditors from Clark Whitehill to Coopers &amp; Lybrand from the 1994 financial year. The announcement sent a frisson of fear around the remaining medium-sized accountancy firms that audit large quoted companies and who are seeing their clients captured by their largest 'Big Six' competitors. The senior partner of one firm said yesterday: 'I have watched this news with great tension. One is constantly aware that there are fewer and fewer firms outside the Big Six, and there is more and more marketing to obtain them.' For Clark Whitehill, it represents a painful dilution after acting as accountants to Sainsbury since the turn of the century. According to published information, audit fees of the group were Pounds 400,000 in 1991 and Pounds 500,000 in both 1992 and 1993. In addition, non-audit fees such as tax work paid to the auditor were Pounds 800,000 in 1992 and Pounds 700,000 last year. Most of these fees were paid to Clark Whitehill, which audits all Sainsbury subsidiaries except Shaw's, its US supermarket chain, which was audited by Arthur Andersen. The revenues are a significant proportion of the firm's total fee income, which last year was Pounds 53m. That compares with billings reported in the UK by Coopers &amp; Lybrand last year of Pounds 553m. Sainsbury was also Clark Whitehill's most well-known client, although it retains the audits of about 10 other quoted companies. Under the proposals to be put to Sainsbury's shareholders at the annual meeting on July 6, the firm will be superseded by Coopers for the 1995 financial year. During 1994, it will remain joint auditor to ease the transition. After then, it will retain some other work, including auditing the pension fund and acting as a corporate and personal tax adviser. Sainsbury is believed to have already hived off some non-audit work to other accountancy firms in the past few years, and to have felt that until now the audit was a relatively uncontroversial activity since it was satisfied with its own internal controls and financial management. But it decided in the past six months that it needed a larger firm of auditors, and held a competitive tender in which it finally selected Coopers over KPMG Peat Marwick. Coopers' bid emphasised its international strength - as the second-largest network of accountancy firms around the world - as well as its experience in the retail sector. Speculation surrounds the reasons for the change. Sainsbury rejected suggestions that the decision was based on price, although the Coopers audit fee is not expected to be very different from the existing level. It denied that the change had anything to do with substantial changes in accounting policies announced last Friday, when it began to depreciate its buildings and made a one-off Pounds 365m property write-down. The company has also rejected speculation that the change has anything to do with the legal and professional disciplinary action against Clark Whitehill partners in connection with alleged failure to supervise Mr Nick Young, a former executive director of the firm's international network who was convicted for forgery and deception at the Old Bailey three years ago. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement yesterday that it reflected the need for a firm 'with a wide range of international experience and a number of other multinational corporate clients'. The company added last night that the decision was more to do with the need for a well-known accountancy name as part of its desire to raise finance than its own international expansion plans. It is this image of respectability by the Big Six accountancy firms, the large law firms and merchant banks, that presents perhaps the greatest challenge to the middle-sized firms attempting to retain their large clients. The importance of name recognition was illustrated by one adviser to a large company contacted yesterday, who said: 'Clark Whitehead? I've never heard of them.' The Big Six are aggressively marketing their technical strengths and international networks to companies held by their smaller rivals. Their opponents point to the likelihood of larger firms offering less individual attention from partners, costly bureaucracies of larger firms as well as to the writs outstanding suggesting their audits may not be so perfect. However unjustified, it is clear that the trend to larger auditors is likely to continue. Just two FT-SE 100 companies are still audited by a firm outside the Big Six: Pannell Kerr Forster for Williams Holdings and BDO Binder Hamlyn for Southern Electric. Both companies said yesterday that they had no plans to change. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams, said: 'Pannell's auditing standards are excellent and unlike the Big Six firms I am not aware of litigation on their audit work.'</p>

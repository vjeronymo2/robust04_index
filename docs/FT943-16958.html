			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / 'Baby Bell' groups combine cellular forces in new venture Two of America's largest 'Baby Bell' local telecommunications groups - Bell Atlantic and Nynex - are combining their cellular wireless interests in a new company. The new venture, announced yesterday, will compete aggressively with long-distance rivals trying to establish national networks in the fast-growing mobile communications market. The companies said it might have a market value of around Dollars 13bn. Bell Atlantic, which serves the Mid-Atlantic region, and Nynex, which serves New York and New England, are each among the 10 largest cellular telephone companies in the US. The combined group will be in second place, in terms of potential customers, behind McCaw Cellular Communications and ahead of GTE. The deal, which will require the approval of federal regulators, is the first alliance on such a grand scale by two 'Baby Bells' since these companies were spun off from long-distance carrier AT&amp;T in 1984. It comes as America's two largest long-distance carriers are trying to establish networks linking the nation's fragmented patchwork of cellular telephone licence areas, each of which supports two operators. AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance group, is waiting for regulatory approval to buy McCaw for Dollars 12.6bn, while MCI Communications, in which British Telecom has a 20 per cent stake, has allied with wireless operator Nextel Communications. Both local and long-distance companies are also preparing to bid for licences to provide a new kind of wireless communication - personal communications services (PCS) - which the Federal Communications Commission is due to auction at the end of 1994 this year. The various groups want to incorporate PCS into their national wireless networks. Mr Lawrence Babbio, who will head the management committee of the Nynex-Bell Atlantic joint venture, said: 'We have the foundation for building a national wireless presence by obtaining PCS licences and by bringing like-minded PCS providers into our new alliance.' Bell Atlantic will own 62.35 per cent of joint venture and Nynex 37.65 per cent, but it will be controlled equally by both. If approved, the deal could pave the way for other cellular alliances between Baby Bells.</p>

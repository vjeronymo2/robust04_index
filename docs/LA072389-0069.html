			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE PIGEON BY PATRICK SUSKIND (WASHINGTON SQUARE PRESS:  $5.95)  </P> <P> Patrick Suskind's second novel focuses on 24 hours in the life of Jonathan  Noel, an isolated, alienated Parisian bank guard who makes Camus' Mersault seem  like a glad-hander. Noel's remote existence is so meticulously ordered that the  unexpected appearance of an ordinary pigeon in the hallway of his rooming house  plunges him into a crisis of despair and doubt.  </P> <P> Like Job -- to whom he would probably compare himself -- Noel receives a rebuke  from On High. A distant peal of thunder replaces the Voice Out of the  Whirlwind, reminding him of his humanity and the need for companionship.  Grotesque, funny and often moving, this brief book is warmer and more affirming  than Suskind's celebrated first novel, "Perfume."  </P></p>

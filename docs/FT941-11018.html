			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / EU monetary body enjoys Bank approval The European Monetary Institute, which started operating last month, should be able to help European Union central banks control inflation, the Bank of England believes, Peter Norman writes. In an article released ahead of tomorrow's Quarterly Bulletin the Bank says that the institute 'should be able to contribute to robust counter-inflationary monetary policies' by monitoring policies and recommending changes. The article, timed to appear before tomorrow's meeting of the institute's decision-making council, makes clear that the Bank wants the institute to play a constructive role in Europe's economic future.</p>

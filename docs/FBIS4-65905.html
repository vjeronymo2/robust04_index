			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by Valeska </F> von Roques and Marion Schreiber; place and date not given: "More  European Than Our Predecessors"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Minister, Europe is afraid of  the F Factor in the Berlusconi government. Five cabinet members  are believed to belong to the extreme right-wing camp; three of  them come from the Italian Social Movement [MSI], a party that  has never abandoned fascism.    [Martino] Concerns abroad were predictable and are  understandable. The change in Italy was so radical that there  were bound to be problems with its interpretation. But  basically, the five ministers are members of the Alleanza  Nazionale, which is different from the MSI, and the MSI is not  the Fascist Party of the past. For me, the most important thing  is that this alliance has signed our joint program, and this is  not a program of the right-wing, but a program of the  liberal-center.    [DER SPIEGEL] Nonetheless, for the first time since the end  of the war, there are fascists in a West European government.  That was inconceivable until recently. Hasn't a taboo been  broken now?    [Martino] If these people were really neofascists, I would  not be in a government with them.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Alleanza Nazionale clearly represents  revanchist positions in its election program. It wants to  revise the Peace Treaty of 1947 and the Treaty of Osimo, which  confirmed the secession of the Eastern Adriatic region to  Yugoslavia. We quote: "Following German reunification, Italy  must be reunited, too, with Istria, Fiume, and Dalmatia being  returned to Italy."    [Martino] Our foreign political government program has  nothing to do with such ideas. This means, first, that borders  will not be called into question, and, second, treaties will not  be discarded.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is all this really that harmless? On the very  day the government statement was made, news broke that the MSI  moved a draft law calling for the abolition of the ban on  Mussolini's fascist party.    [Martino] That was an unfortunate initiative, but Gianfranco  Fini promptly dissociated himself from it.    [DER SPIEGEL] But he also signed it.    [Martino] Why don't you ask him; there was talk about an  error. For a better understanding of the new political  situation in Italy, the world should know that we have amended  our election law. The former system of proportional  representation allowed political parties with extreme positions  to acquire a strong image and thus fill niches. However, the  system of majority representation creates overlapping alliances,  in which radical positions are smoothed and are even punished to  a certain extent.    [DER SPIEGEL] This hardly mitigates the European neighbors'  concerns. They fear that the apparently more gentle Italian  version of right-wing extremism could encourage aggressive  neofascism in their own countries.    [Martino] Let me be very specific. In the local elections  in December, MSI chairman Gianfranco Fini won 47 percent of the  votes in Rome, his fellow party member Alessandra Mussolini won  44 percent in Naples. If we as Forza Italia had not appeared in  this situation, these right-wing groups would have offered  themselves as the only alternative to the left-wing parties. In  this way, we not only prevented the victory of the left, but  also that of the extreme right wing.    [DER SPIEGEL] Forza Italia as the savior of the fatherland?    [Martino] There are also positive elements of this dramatic  change for us. I wish they were noted abroad and in particular  in Germany.    [DER SPIEGEL] The new government in Rome is currently  causing different concerns among its European partners. Italy  has traditionally always been very pro-European. Will the EC  founding member now join those who intend to put a brake on  European unification?    [Martino] I can hardly have conveyed this impression. I was  less than three days in office, and the government had not even  been confirmed by Parliament, when I took part in the Council  meeting in Brussels and met with European Commission President  Jacques Delors, whom I assured of the continuity of Italy's  European policy.    [DER SPIEGEL] But you are known as a Euroskeptic. For  instance, you took part in the meeting of the Brugge group,  which backs Margaret Thatcher's negative attitude toward  European unity.    [Martino] I admire Mrs. Thatcher for what she has done for  the British economy. She introduced the dynamism of the free  market economy into the antiquated economic system. I took part  in the meetings of this Brugge group twice. At the first  meeting in Brugge in 1989, I said amid general applause that  exaggerated regimentation only creates discord instead of  accord. In London, I was booed for my views on monetary policy.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that you advocate monetary  union?    [Martino] Yes, I think a common currency is desirable for  psychological and economic reasons and as an alternative to the  U.S. dollar on the world market. I doubt, however, that a  common currency can be achieved step by step. For certain  problems, there are no gradual solutions. It is, for instance,  impossible to abolish left-hand traffic in Britain by  introducing right-hand traffic for trucks on the first day, cars  on the second day, and mopeds on the third day.    [DER SPIEGEL] Gradual development has so far been the basic  principle of European integration.    [Martino] Being for Europe does not mean approving every  technical option or strategy. Even though there may be  differences of opinion with European partners on individual  issues, our government possibly is even more European than its  predecessors on the great objectives. By the way, the  conference of Messina in 1955, at which European integration was  initiated, was chaired by a foreign minister called Martino. He  was my father, one of the signatories of the Treaties of Rome.    [DER SPIEGEL] Times have since changed considerably. Today,  problems of the economy, the environment, or traffic can only be  solved internationally. At the same time, national egoism is  growing in all member states. How do you intend to resolve this  contradiction?    [Martino] Experience has shown that trade unites, whereas  policy divides. That is why we should not try to intervene in  the markets by means of too many regulations.    [DER SPIEGEL] But environmental problems today cannot be  solved without European regulations.    [Martino] These are noble ecological views. However, often  enough, environmental protection is a pretext for protectionist  measures.    [DER SPIEGEL] For countries like Spain and Portugal, the  European environmental standards constitute progress. They  received billions from the EU coffers for the modernization of  old industries that are now supposed to emit fewer pollutants.    [Martino] European policy should be focused on the common  great goals and go back to European values. I do not want the  cynical characterization of an American friend to apply to us;  he said Europe is nothing but a collection of valuable old  property. I think rather that Europe should have a voice and  weight in the world.    [DER SPIEGEL] Could that be achieved with a common foreign  and security policy?    [Martino] When my father was foreign minister 40 years ago,  the attempt failed to found a European defense community; it  failed because the French parliament refused to ratify the  project. I still consider a common foreign and security policy  indispensable.    [DER SPIEGEL] Membership of Austria and three Scandinavian  countries within the European Union [EU] is for Germany the  first step of an EU enlargement to the East. What is your  position?    [Martino] Very positive, even though such an enlargement  will slow down the process of integration. Just as we talked  about West Germany until recently and speak about Germany now,  we will also speak about the EU. We will then no longer speak  about West Europe, but about Europe as a whole.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you anticipating a certain German  predominance in Europe, as the French do?    [Martino] Personally I do not have any problems with it. As  for the rest, my motto is that he who predicts catastrophes will  suffer twice -- once when he predicts them, and then when they  take place.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Minister, we thank you for this interview.</p>

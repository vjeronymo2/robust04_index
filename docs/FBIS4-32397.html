			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 23 Jun (MTI) -- The delegations of the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) started what is presumed to be the last session of  coalition talks in Budapest on Thursday.    The goal of the meeting is to appoint the members of the new  cabinet and give the finishing touches to the coalition  agreement.    The two sides are expected to sign the agreement on Friday,  whereupon it will be presented to the MSZP's special congress  and the SZDSZ deputies' conference for ratification this weekend.</p>

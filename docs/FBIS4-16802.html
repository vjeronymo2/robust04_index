			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Minsk Radio Minsk Network in Belarusian  at 0515 GMT on 20 April airs a 10-minute recorded interview with  Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich by reporter Syarhey  Bulatskiy, assessing the signing of the agreement on the  unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. The  date and place of the interview are not given; Kebich speaks in  Russian.    The prime minister begins by responding to accusations by  former legislative speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich and Popular  Front Chairman Zyanon Paznyak who claim that the treaty  "endangers the Republic's sovereignty." Popular Front deputies  have sent a motion to the General Prosecutor's Office demanding  that the signing of the treaty "receive a legal assessment."  Kebich concentrates on the economic advantages of the treaty.  According to him, Belarus will begin receiving duty-free  products from Russia as of 1 May. Customs fees currently make  up 30 to 40 percent of prices for products imported from Russia.  Kebich points out that following the enactment of the treaty,  Belarusian goods will be granted unhampered access to the  Russian market, which will lower production costs. He says that  "Belarusian goods will conquer the Russian market again and, as  a final result, may bring about the reduction of retail prices."    Kebich points out that the reaction of certain political  groups in the Republic to the signing of the treaty came as no  surprise: "I used to tell government officials and members of  the Council of Ministers Presidium that the signing of the  treaty would give rise to hysterical screams by those who would  claim that we betrayed our sovereignty. I categorically reject  these kinds of claims." Kebich adds that the first deputy  general prosecutor had telephoned him and requested access to  documents necessary for conducting an investigation initiated by  the deputies' motion.    Kebich underlines: "I know I did not violate the  Constitution because I only signed that part of the treaty that  lies within the government's competence. Article 5 was not  signed by the National Bank because of existing reservations.  Everything that refers to a change in the monetary system is  under the bank's auspices and the bank voiced its reservations.  Besides, I want to point out that the treaty has not come into  effect because, just like any other treaty, it can be enacted  only after all of its provisions are brought in line with our  legislation. Thus, one way or another, there will be conflicts  with some laws and we will have to amend them. I only did the  Supreme Soviet's will. When the Supreme Soviet ratified the  agreement on the introduction of monetary systems [as heard]  government officials, including me, said that after the treaty  is signed some legal acts will have to be amended and brought in  line with the treaty. Every treaty in general -- why are we  dwelling on the treaty with Russia? -- every treaty should be  submitted to ratification by the legislature."    Asked by the reporter what measures he would suggest to  resolve the dispute if the legislature declines to ratify the  treaty, Kebich says: "I would propose seeking advice from the  people. There are various ways to do this -- an opinion poll,  polls in separate territories, and other forms. This should not  necessarily be a referendum. Please, do not say that Kebich  suggested holding a referendum on the day of presidential  elections. These are futile fabrications of all those who want  to trip me as a candidate for president. One should not think  that Kebich worked here alone -- the entire government did. I  am not a naive person, and I know perfectly well that it would  not be quite ethical and correct to tamper with the Constitution  days after its adoption. That is why, having signed the treaty  and having made it the groundwork for further negotiations, we  did everything not to violate the Constitution. At the recent  CIS summit, both I and Mechyslaw Hryb talked to Boris Yeltsin  and asked him to do everything not to make us meddle in the  Constitution."    Commenting on the future effects of the treaty, Kebich says:  "The exchange of 200,000 Belarusian rubles in cash and 1,000,000  in bank savings accounts is a one-time thing," and underlines  the more permanent effects. He points out that even if the  treaty fails to bring about a reduction in retail prices it  would be a "tangible victory" if further increases in prices  were prevented while wages continued to grow: "To increase  wages, our enterprises have to start working. To do this they  need a free flow of products. The treaty facilitates free  shipment of every producer's goods to the Russian market. We  are not working because we have been flooded with products that  were once manufactured and could not be sold because of their  high cost. Every citizen knows that he will work a full week  now, his wage will be constantly growing, and his living  standard improving. Through some reason, both journalists and  our opponents decline to discuss this aspect of the treaty."    Kebich insists that the issue has been artificially laded  with political sense on the eve of presidential elections.    The prime minister then answers questions regarding public  transportation problems in Minsk and an increase in prices for  postal services.    Asked about his impressions from the CIS summit in Moscow,  Kebich says: "I went to Moscow with a hope that a supranational  economic committee would be created to step up economic  integration among CIS states. However to my regret, this body's  status was downgraded. It was formed within the framework of the  Consultative Committee and of course it will be unable to  perform the full scope of its functions. I am disappointed,  but I do believe that the CIS should continue to function."</p>

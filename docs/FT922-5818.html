			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Roddick puts the emphasis on the 'green' Ms Anita Roddick, the managing director of Body Shop International, yesterday switched attention to the group's 'green' credentials. The move came in the wake of controversy about its stance on the issue of animal testing of cosmetics. At the retailer's first results press conference, Ms Roddick brandished The Green Book, an environmental audit of the Body Shop's workings, which gives details of its findings and the subsequent action taken. On animal testing, Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman (and husband), said that it was better to use a rolling cut-off - banning ingredients only if they had been tested on animals within five years - because it allowed suppliers to be converted to halting such tests.

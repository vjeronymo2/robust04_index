			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Maastricht back on track: Irish voters have brought the EC back from the brink By their two-to-one vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, Irish voters have firmly hoisted the EC's project for political and monetary union back on to the rails. It is still - and will be for many months - an open question whether the Community locomotive will eventually reach Union Station, or hit another set of buffers along the way. Ten more EC states have yet to pronounce on Maastricht. Any repeat of Denmark's June 2 rejection would derail the Maastricht train for good. And, because of Denmark's decision, it is still unclear whether the train will have more than 11 carriages to it. But the 'pleasure and delight' which Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he felt at his people's 'very clear-cut' approval of Maastricht was yesterday felt around Community capitals. In the very short term, the Portuguese presidency of the EC can now expect to host a 'normal' summit next week in Lisbon. That is to say, it can be a summit devoted largely to such traditional Community activities as squabbling about money and sites of its institutions, rather than a crisis session of soul-searching about the Community's future, or even its present existence. Another immediate consequence is that Mr Jacques Delors is sure to be renominated in Lisbon as Commission president. Only a heavy Irish 'no' might have led some EC leaders to question the wisdom of keeping him on in the drivers' cab. Even then, they would have been pushed to find plausible alternatives among Mr Delors' 16 fellow commissioners. The Irish vote bodes well, but not decisively, for a 'yes' to Maastricht in France's autumn referendum. France will be the last of the three countries seeking direct democratic approval of the European Union treaty. For Maastricht's sake, this is probably just as well. An opinion poll yesterday showed 52 per cent of Germans would vote against the treaty, if given the chance. The evidence, from the national parliamentary debates and from the two referenda that have now taken place, is still that what most people think is right or wrong with the future Maastricht Treaty is largely derived from what they already believe to be right or wrong with the existing Community. Many Irish said 'yes' to Maastricht, simply because in 19 years of EC membership they have always got more money out of the EC than they paid in. Likewise, pollsters' subsequent questioning of Danes who voted 'no' on June 2 shows that many were preoccupied by such irritants as EC prescriptions against 'curved cucumbers' (straight ones are easier to pack, deemed the EC). Logically, therefore, the Irish 'yes' does not cancel out the Danish 'no'. These different verdicts largely reflect the Community's differing impact on these two countries. Politically, too, the Irish vote does not mean a return to the status quo ante June 2. Federalists now realise they may have been lucky to get a Maastricht Treaty signed at all. Until June 2, the European Parliament, and to some extent the Commission, carped endlessly about Maastricht's failure to give them more power. No longer. They now praise, and pray for, it. Another consequence is that, in the backwash of the Danish vote, 'the Commission is beginning to see itself as others do', said a senior EC official yesterday. 'That is no bad thing. Mr Delors has taken on the chin the criticism that he has been a grabber of power. In an interview this week, he pledged Brussels would not tread on member states' toes in matters of internal security, justice, local planning, health, culture and education, and said his Eurocrats had started work to return some implementation and supervision of EC environmental rules to governments. The Danish reverse has also killed the notion that there must be further institutional reforms agreed before European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries join the EC during the 1990s. The dominant Brussels' view had been that the Lisbon summit should consider more majority voting, even beyond that contained in Maastricht, as the only way to stop decision-making in a more numerous Community seizing up. Apart from commissioners and ministers from Spain, which is allergic to Eftans joining on almost any terms, this view is espoused only by by Mr Frans Andriessen, the Dutchman who is external affairs commissioner, and by the Belgian government. These developments are welcome to the UK government, which now has 10 days to the start of its EC presidency. 'We want to turn these (Danish-caused) difficulties to good effect,' said a British minister this week, 'to get more progress on subsidiarity and enlargement than we otherwise could have.' How to nail down Mr Delors' pledges, in particular on subsidiarity, in a way that could bring Denmark back into the fold at the year's end, while at the same time avoiding renegotiation of Maastricht, will be a test of British diplomacy. But the glimpse of the abyss provided by Denmark may have a salutary effect. 'There is a 50 per cent chance,' says an EC official, 'that we may come very close at Lisbon to agreeing on sites for our various new institutions', including the European Monetary Institute, planned forerunner of the European Central Bank. Equally, there is the outline of an agreement on future EC financing. These tricky issues have been put into proper perspective by the potential failure of Maastricht - provided the Irish 'yes' does not restore the sense of complacency shattered by the Danish 'no'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Army affairs correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] General Staff is  satisfied with the Cairo agreement signed between the PLO and  Israel on 9 February. A military source yesterday said that  "under the present circumstances, it is the best agreement."  The source asserted that both sides had conceded on points they  would not have compromised on in the past, and the General Staff  feels this is the best possible agreement.    Senior IDF sources said that the test would be the  implementation of the agreement. According to a military  source, the IDF has reacted positively to the agreement, but  many details have yet to be worked out and many difficulties are  to be expected before the agreement can be implemented.    IDF sources stressed that the Cairo agreement is being  perused in detail by top military officials and every detail is  being examined from a professional standpoint. A senior IDF  source said: "in general, it is a good agreement. Most of our  interests have been protected, especially the security interest."    According to the senior source, several issues still remain  unresolved even after the agreement, such as the matter of the  Palestinian police and the way security measures will be handled  at the border crossings.    IDF sources state, for example, that the procedures for  crossing the Palestinian checkpoint remain unclear. According  to the agreement, passengers crossing through the Palestinian  checkpoint will walk through a magnetic gate. An Israeli and  Palestinian guard will stand on each side of the gate, and in  any suspicious case will be permitted to carry out a body search  at the gate and to question the traveler. The IDF anticipates  the possibility of problems and confrontations at the terminal,  with each side demanding to check travelers.    The IDF is still studying the Cairo agreement and will  establish staff teams over the next few days to analyze the  agreements and implement them on the ground. Officers at the  Central and Southern Commands are prepared to withdraw from the  Gaza Strip and Jericho as soon as the political echelon issues  the order. As reported by HA'ARETZ, the General Staff has  formulated a plan that will enable the troops to withdraw from  the Gaza Strip and Jericho within one month.</p>

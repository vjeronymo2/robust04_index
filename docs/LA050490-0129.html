			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS CLAIMS DOCTOR THREATENED HIM;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: THE EX-PARTNER OF A NEWPORT BEACH COSMETIC SURGEON ACCUSED OF  MALPRACTICE SAYS HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIS TESTIMONY.  </P> <P> A nationally known cosmetic surgeon from Newport Beach threatened earlier this  week to create professional and legal problems for his ex-partner if he did not  change his testimony about a face lift on a former Mrs. California, the partner  testified Thursday.  </P> <P> The testimony threatens to severely undercut Dr. Michael Elam's defense against  civil allegations of malpractice and insurance fraud and could also lead to  criminal charges of witness tampering, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Barry Ladendorf  in an interview after Thursday's testimony.  </P> <P> "Any time someone tries to influence a witness to change his testimony, that,  to me, shows the guy's got something to hide -- he doesn't want the truth out,"  said Ladendorf, who is representing the Medical Board of California in its  attempt to take away Elam's license.  </P> <P> Calling the testimony "sour grapes," Elam said in an interview: "Look, I didn't  try to intimidate or threaten (the former partner). . . . I called because I  wanted to find out what he was going to say so it wasn't a big surprise. That  was all."  </P> <P> The 41-year-old Elam, seen regularly on home-shopping cable shows promoting  skin-care products, gained nationwide exposure and a long list of high-paying  clients at his opulent office near Fashion Island after he helped redo  comedienne Phyllis Diller's face in 1983.  </P> <P> But he and ex-partner Frederick Berkowitz, 67, also of Newport Beach, now face  revocation of their medical licenses by the state Medical Board for alleged  malpractice and insurance fraud in connection with two former patients.  </P> <P> One of the patients, 55-year-old Bonnie Luebke, a 1984 Mrs. California pageant  winner from Trabuco Canyon, testified last month before Administrative Law  Judge Rosalyn Chapman in Los Angeles that Elam drugged her into signing consent  forms in 1985 and then gave her a nose job and cheek implants that she  "absolutely never, ever" wanted. She said Elam, insistent on doing the  operation his way, promised: "I'll make you look 30."  </P> <P> The state hearing, expected to conclude next week, took a dramatic turn  Thursday during Ladendorf's cross-examination of Berkowitz, centering on a  phone call Berkowitz got at home from Elam around 7 a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> The topic, Berkowitz testified, was his knowledge of the Luebke operation.  </P> <P> Although Elam and one of his assistants have testified that Berkowitz assisted  at the Luebke surgery, Berkowitz testified that he did not get into the office  that day until after it was finished. Ladendorf asserted that office records  support this.  </P> <P> Berkowitz testified Thursday that Elam tried to persuade him otherwise during  their phone conversation.  </P> <P> Elam attempted to convince Berkowitz that "my memory wasn't too good and that I  couldn't remember if I was there or not and that I should testify to that at  cross-examination," Berkowitz testified.  </P> <P> And, Berkowitz said, Elam suggested that if he did not feign forgetfulness in  court, he might face other problems: Elam's testimony against him in a separate  malpractice claim, as well as Elam's exposure of lax record-keeping by  Berkowitz and alleged drug use by two of his employees.  </P> <P> Berkowitz took this as a threat, he testified.  </P> <P> Elam, who was not present for the testimony, angrily said later: "Dr. Berkowitz  doesn't have a very good memory. . . . He's got the whole thing confused. He's  taken all the facts and thrown them in a big pot and tried to cook something up  against me."  </P> <P> By calling Berkowitz, Elam said, "I wanted to find out what his particular plan  was for his defense. We discussed what he was going to say and what he wasn't  going to say. This is basically what everybody does when they go on trial. . .  . I was trying to encourage Dr. Berkowitz to tell the truth."  </P> <P> Elam also denied using the drug-use issue as a threat. He said he simply wanted  Berkowitz to know that if he put his employees on the witness stand in his own  defense, "he should realize that other things are going to come out -- like the  girls' using drugs and all that."  </P> <P> Elam's attorney, Douglas Reynolds of San Diego, said he does not believe that  his client did anything illegal.  </P> <P> However, Reynolds said, "it would certainly be better if he hadn't (made the  call). . . . There can be misunderstandings, so it's not real advisable."  </P></p>

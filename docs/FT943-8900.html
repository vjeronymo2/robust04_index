			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: An arena for identifying team leaders Dragon boat racing is more than merely an East Asian promotional tool for Nuclear Electric. The crew's success has helped maintain morale in a company engaged in the painful transition from the public to the private sector, while the sport provides an opportunity for management to spot potential leaders. Take Dave Price, the crew's captain, who is part of a change support team which has been established to introduce new working practices at the company's Hartlepool plant. Chosen partly for his organisational abilities that emerged in the way he ran a company football team, and most recently the dragon boat, he said: 'The management wanted people who were good at pulling teams together.' Bill Shirra, formerly the Hartlepool plant's human resources manager and now the company's career development manager at its Gloucester headquarters, emphasises the team-building benefits of the sport. 'There was a time when people were expected to hang up their brains as they walked through the door. That's all changed now. People are expected to think about their jobs and take decisions for themselves.' The foreman's job has been changed to that of team leader and the teams are expected to be more self sufficient in areas such as budgets and personnel decisions. Part of the changes, he said, had been to introduce skills broadening, which entails training people to do 10 per cent of someone else's. 'The idea, in its simplest terms, is that you should no longer need to get an electrician to put a plug on,' he said.</p>

Yatskevich, engineer, Engineering Thermophysics  Institute, Ukraine Ministry of Power and Electrification; UDC  621.311.22]    [Abstract] In 1992, Ukraine's Ministry of Power and  Electrification began financing work to create a new process for  fuel utilization at thermal electric power plants. In the new  process, natural gas is subjected to thermochemical processing  before being burned. As part of research in this direction, a  thermodynamic analysis was performed to compare a natural gas  conversion method with endothermal effects to one with  exothermal effects. The analysis established that endothermal  conversion in steam-gas units would provide the biggest  efficiency gains but would also necessitate the redesign of  equipment currently in place at the republic's thermal electric  power plants. Thermodynamic analysis of the binary unit in which  natural gas is subjected to exothermal conversion before being  burned demonstrated that choosing a thermal layout with a  thermochemical gas-turbine superstructure would result in  improved efficiency thanks to a reduction in unrecoverable  losses in the heat production process. As a result, it would be  possible to modernize existing thermal electric power plants in  such a way that the efficiency of transforming heat to work  could remain unchanged. R&amp;D performed jointly with the Power  Generation Equipment Design Institute [Energoproyekt] confirmed  the possibility of boosting the efficiency of natural gas  utilization without altering existing thermal power generation  equipment. Many of the currently used methods of reducing  NO[.sub]x[/] emissions call for altering the gas-burning  process by reducing the maximum jet temperature and creating  enriched conditions by varying the intensity of mixing fuel and  oxidizing agent. Two-stage combustion is one of the most radical  methods of suppressing NO[.sub]x[/]. A system for burning  natural gas after preliminary exothermal conversion is  essentially no different from conventional two-stage burning  systems. Consequently, modernizing thermal electric power plants  by installing a gas turbine superstructure with thermochemical  natural gas processing not only boosts plant efficiency but also  significantly reduces NO[.sub]x[/] emissions. Calculations of  key operating indicators before and after the proposed  modernization were performed for scenarios assuming  steam-turbine unit efficiencies of 39% and 41%.

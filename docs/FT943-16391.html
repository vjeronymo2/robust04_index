			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Mortgage lenders may adopt code A voluntary code of practice of mortgage lending is being considered by the mortgage lenders' trade association and could be in place by next summer. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies and other lenders, is looking at the idea of introducing a code, and is likely to take a decision in principle by the autumn. The adoption of a code would help to pre-empt any suggestion that there should be new legislation to cover the sale and marketing of mortgages, and would offer a response to some recent criticism of the way mortgages are sold. The CML envisages two options. One would merely cover a 'reason why' letter to a mortgage borrower, setting out the type of mortgage recommended and explaining why it was appropriate for the customer. A more general and ambitious option would deal with the marketing of mortgages, including the use of annualised percentage rates of interest. It might also incorporate existing CML statements of practice on arrears and repossessions and the transfer of mortgages. One potential disadvantage is that the code could not bind intermediaries, such as independent financial advisers, who introduce a large minority of new mortgage business. Lenders might, however, agree to apply the code on a discretionary basis to such business. Last month Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, called for 'greater transparency and choice' in mortgage lending, saying that lenders should give customers more information about mortgage 'packages' in which loans are marketed with associated services such as life or general insurance. Even more recently, the annual report from the building societies ombudsman scheme showed that complaints about the treatment of mortgage customers taken up by the ombudsman rose 15 per cent in 1993-94 compared with the previous year. The CML emphasised yesterday that it was merely exploring the possibility of a code in a tentative way. But raising the prospect publicly in the CML monthly newsletter will make it more difficult for the idea to be rejected.</p>

The poll, prepared in time for today's  Legislative Council [Legco] debate on the bill, casts doubt on  claims by the Governor to have widespread support for his  political reforms. Conducted on Monday and released yesterday,  the poll also shows an overwhelming majority of people -- 78.8  per cent -- either know "very little" or nothing at all about  the bill before Legco today. According to the poll, a small  majority of people support the retention of ex-officio seats in  the Legislative Council for members of the Urban and Regional  Councils and the district boards.    Yesterday the Executive Council gave the go-ahead for the  publication of the second and more controversial stage of the  political reform legislation. The bill, designed to widen the  franchise, will be gazetted on Friday.    The first stage of the reforms, covering the less  contentious  issues, paves the way for the lowering of the voting age to 18,  the scrapping of appointed seats on the district boards and the  establishment of the single-seat single-vote system for the  municipal and Legislative Council elections. This is expected  to be passed into law today.    Legislators are braced for a marathon debate, likely to last  late into the night. The Government is confident that any  attempt by conservative forces to derail the bill will be  defeated. According to today's Oriental Daily News [TUNG FANG  JIH PAO], 256 district board councillors out of a total of 411  are pressing the Governor to withdraw the bill from Legco.    Despite the vigour of the politicians' interest, the Eastern  Express poll, undertaken by the Social Sciences Research Centre  of the University of Hong Kong, shows most people have either  lost interest, or have never been interested in the political  reforms. Only 12.1 percent said they were either very clear or  resonably clear about what was going on. The survey shows that  neither of the amendments proposed by Liberal Party and the  United Democrats has been well received by public. Only 21  percent of those questioned agreed with the Liberal Party's  amendment that arrangements for the 1995 Legco election should  not be included in the bill, compared with 35.9 percent who did  not agree. Only 32 percent supported the United Democrats'  amendment to abolish all appointed or ex-officio seats of the  Regional Council and district boards, compared with 38.8 percent  who did not. There was an even split of opinion over the  amendment raised by one legislator, Eric Li, who favoured a  fixed ratio of one appointed seat to every three elected seats  in the Urban and Regional councils and district boards.  Fractionally more people supported than opposed the tabling and  passage of the original version of the reform bill as proposed  by Patten in autumn 1992 -- 27.6 percent against 26.9 percent.    According to Robert Chung, the research officer in charge of  the survey, none of the bill's proposals commanded the support  of more than half of those questioned. "It shows an  overwhelming indifference by the public with what's going on  between Beijing and the Governor," Chung said. "Most of those  interviewed have either shown no interest or no opinion at all."  The poll provides further evidence of an erosion in public  support for political reform compared with the high ratings for  it seen after the measures were introduced by the Governor in  1992.    The Executive Council [Exco] yesterday endorsed the  disclosure tomorrow of the Foreign Office's account of the 17  rounds of fruitless talks with China on political reform. The  disclosure will take the form of a United Kingdom White Paper.  Yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the New China  News Agency (Xinhua), said China had never objected to the  publication but stressed that it had to be done through  diplomatic channels. Although Exco has approved publication,  the final decision rests with Douglas Hurd, the Foreign  Secretary.    There has been disagreement over whether the second  political  bill should be published in their original form or watered down  as an olive branch to China.</p>

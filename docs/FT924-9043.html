			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New scandal hits Japanese equities ALLEGATIONS that senior officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) tried to pay off an extreme right-wing political group to stop a public campaign against the party depressed activity yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 161.78 at 16,869.81, up 0.6 per cent on the week. The index moved between a high of 17,022.57 at the start and a low of 16,818.46 just before the close on position adjustments ahead of the weekend. Volume remained low at 190m shares against 186m. Declines led advances by 706 to 206 with 163 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 12.41 to 1,275.96 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.20 to 1,021.71. Investors remained inactive as 44 companies listed on the first section announced interim earnings results. They were worried by prosecution statements alleging that senior LDP officials tried to use gang links, money and personal contacts to stop a negative campaign by a far-right party in 1987 against Mr Noboru Takeshita, the then prime minister. Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. The nuclear fusion-related Shoko, the most active issue of the day, fell Y20 to Y550, and Denki Kogyo lost Y10 to Y951. Aids-related stocks were weaker after TSD, a software company listed on the over-the-counter market, admitted that it had misinformed investors that clinical tests of an Aids vaccine had begun in Thailand, and that its Thai joint venture had started production of the vaccine. TSD was suspended from trading yesterday, following reports alleging that it had given false information to prop up its share price ahead of the expiry of its convertible bond exercise. The share, which had fallen to a year's low of Y730 in April, surged to Y3,650 in September on the news. Mr Tsutomu Matsuzaki, president of TSD, apologised for giving false information, but denied allegations of stock price manipulation. NEC fell Y17 to the year's low of Y656 on selling by foreigners on lingering fears that its sales will be hit by cheaper US personal computers. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 205.66 to 18,297.93 in volume of 10m shares. Roundup THE region's sprinters slowed down yesterday as profit-taking emerged ahead of the weekend. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index touched a record intraday high of 6,401.73 before closing 32.76 lower at 6,315.01, up 0.9 per cent on the week. Turnover eased to HKDollars 3.69bn from HKDollars 4.43bn. Dealers attributed the early upturn to interest in Hong Kong Telecom, which jumped 25 cents to HKDollars 9.60 after announcing a 16 per cent rise in earnings late on Thursday. SEOUL's gains were pared back by late selling but the composite index still rose 13.63 to 644.94, up 5.7 per cent on the week, on record 1992 turnover of Won819.22bn, up from Won771.83bn. The market was supported by growing interest from foreign investors and increasing customers' deposits, which rose to Won2.2 trillion on Thursday from Won1.4 trillion in mid-October. KUALA LUMPUR paused for profit-taking and a minor technical correction, the KLSE composite index closing 5.75 down at 654.60, 2.1 per cent higher on the week. AUSTRALIA reflected Westpac's revelations of previously undisclosed tax liabilities as the All Ordinaries index finished 8.9 lower at 1,423.4, fractionally down on the week. Westpac finished at a nine-year low of ADollars 2.51, down 24 cents on the day. News Corp fell 90 cents to ADollars 27.10, on profit-taking after its 82 per cent rise in first-quarter net profits. TAIWAN dropped 1.7 per cent after the 2.5 per cent gain on Thursday, the weighted index closing 60.80 lower at 3,532.61 for a 2.7 per cent fall on the week.</p>

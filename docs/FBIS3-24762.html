			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Whites who fled Rhodesia when it became Zimbabwe and  who are now thinking of returning are not going to be welcomed  back with open arms. Thousands of Rhodies, as they are known,  fled to South Africa. They are now worried about developments  there and are thinking of returning, but the Zimbabwe Government  has plans to tighten up its immigration laws. On the line to  Harare, Alice Martin asked (Fry Mgazi) what the new government  proposals were:    [Begin recording] [(Mgazi)] Well, the proposals will be  tabled in parliament very shortly, and there are four major ones  that I would mention here: First of all, Zimbabwean-born  noncitizens will lose their automatic right to live in the  country, and, secondly, the government will now have the power  to stop what are called marriages of convenience, whereby people  get married in order to stay in this country. The other changes  that are very interesting include the listing of a number of  crimes, if convicted for which somebody can be declared a  prohibited immigrant and, perhaps most interesting of all, is  [word indistinct] 10 years for immigrants to be regarded as  permanent residents. At present, it only takes two years of  local residence in this country, but now it is going to take 10  years.    [Martin] Who do you think these laws are aimed at?    [(Mgazi)] The one that has raised eyebrows is the one that  says that people will now lose the automatic right to live in  this country, even if they are Zimbabwean-born noncitizens.  Now, that is likely to affect most of all people who were  resident in Rhodesia, then, because most of them were  ex-Rhodesians who either emigrated to South Africa or Britain  soon after independence. [sentence as heard] A lot of them have  been applying to come back to Zimbabwe, unsuccessfully, but once  this change becomes law, as it is widely expected to be in a  very short space of time, then it is going to be extra difficult  for them to come back and live in Zimbabwe again.    [Martin] What is the position on their properties and their  land? Would they just be trying to reclaim properties they had  before? Is that what the point of this immigration law is about?    [(Mgazi)] Not really, but when some of them left, they did  not sell their properties. A large number of them did, but the  majority did not. They either left relatives or friends in  charge of their properties, so when they come back, it is not a  question of them having to look for new properties as such.  They will be coming back to their old properties.    [Martin] What is public opinion like, on this issue?    [(Mgazi)] Strangely enough, no voices of disapproval have  been heard. I mean, it is two days since the proposal [word  indistinct] were published in the government gazette, but as yet  nobody has been heard to voice any disapproval of government  intention to overhaul the Immigration Act. I mean, even the  political parties who are known to oppose anything that  government does....[pauses] If there is any resentment, it will  be targeted at the ex-Rhodesians who left after independence  because the main reason why they left was that they could not  live under black majority rule and they decided to go to settle  in South Africa. But black majority is imminent in South  Africa, and they are caught between the devil and the deep blue  sea. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Ukraine near deal on nuclear arsenal The Ukrainian government said at the weekend it had reached a preliminary agreement with the US and Russia on the 'idea of compensation' in exchange for Ukraine's relinquishing of its nuclear arsenal, Jill Barshay reports in Kiev. There was no confirmation of the deal yesterday in Washington or Moscow. However, Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said in Budapest: 'All sides will tell you that progress is being made.' If agreement on financial compensation for uranium is worked out in subsequent talks, it would remove one of the three main conditions Ukraine has imposed for giving up its remaining 176 strategic missiles and becoming a non-nuclear state. Ukraine's other demands are technical aid for dismantlement and security guarantees.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MARINES ARE SEEKING MISSING EXPLOSIVE  </P> <P> Officials at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station are looking for an explosive  cartridge that fell from an aircraft Friday during a routine training flight.  </P> <P> The cartridge, described as a silver cylinder about 1 inch long and 1 inch  wide, has an explosive power similar to that of a blasting cap, according to a  statement from the Marines.  </P> <P> The cartridge is related to fireworks and other pyrotechnic devices, the  statement said. Unlike a blasting cap, however, this cartridge would require a  special electric charge to be detonated.  </P> <P> Anyone finding the cartridge should call police and not try to move the device.  The flight path of the aircraft was over mostly unpopulated areas of eastern  and southern Orange County, northern San Diego County and Riverside County, the  statement said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "A Study Group for Gorazde"] </F>   [Text] This is the hour of truth in Bosnia, and the truth  is that the time is up for the Muslims. The best proof of it is  not provided by the 37 victims of Serbian shells on Sunday [17  April] in Gorazde alone, but the suggestions by French Foreign  Minister Juppe on the following day: The United States, the  United Nations, the European Union [EU], and Russia should set  up a study group for the sake of defining a joint position. In  plain English: Everything remains the way it is. Juppe said  literally: France is "neither for resignation nor for  escalation."    Meanwhile, the Serbs are not planning a study group, but  continue their attacks against the UN safe haven (!) of Gorazde  with twice as much rage. The UNHCR has reported that a shell is  hitting the city center every 20 seconds. After the collapse of  the Muslim resistance, General Rose, the commander of the blue  helmets, has spoken of a "catastrophe." And the Security  Council in New York has expressed its "regret": about the  obstruction and blockade of UN personnel. Of course, it also  "condemned" the "escalating military activities" of the Serbs.    Who is to blame for these terrible events? The answer is  simple: all those who had the possibility to act. The severest  tactical mistake was made on Friday by Yasushi Akashi, the  supreme UN civilian on location. Believing that the Serbs would  keep their cease-fire pledge, he denied Gen. Rose the requested  air support. On Saturday, Serbian tanks forced their way  through Gorazde. On Sunday, Akashi was duped again: The Serbs  again promised to withdraw, but again used the break to better  prepare their attack.  World history is not made by public servants, however. Akashi  read the signs of the times very well, which had been indicating  for days that his bosses in the United Nations -- the  superpowers -- had stripped him of his power to act and sign on  behalf of the firm. After the two half-hearted U.S. bomber  attacks, America's determination was exhausted again: On  Friday, Clinton made it known that one did not want to involve  NATO "in this war to create advantages for one or the other  side." This was the response to the supplication of the Muslims  --and it was music to the ears of the Serbs. On Saturday, when  they got away with shooting down a British Harrier and attacked  a British post, the direction in which they were heading was  clear: Gorazde.    And the Russians? Their dubious game -- one day a mediator,  the other a water bearer -- is the most important background  factor of the tragedy: The harsh words from Moscow have  intimidated the West, which has not been very resolute to begin  with, and encouraged the Serbs, who have reacted sensibly to any  shift of force. Today, Russian mediator Churkin is "deeply  disappointed." Never before have "so many (Serbian) promises  been broken in such a short time." In view of their dual-track  diplomacy, the sympathy with the Russians has to be limited. In  the hour of truth, they and the West showed that the  "international community" is nothing more but the sum total of  conflicting interests.</p>

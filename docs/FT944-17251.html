			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Paris seeks to alter EU talks agenda France's parliament, in a display of anti-Maastricht pique not often associated with Paris, has pushed its government into requesting European finance ministers to refrain today from discussing the French budget deficit. The German presidency of the EU finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg will not want to accede to the French request. Germany is keen to see debate on Maastricht's fiscal disciplines and France is one of 10 countries that figure in a Commission recommendation on 'excessive budget deficits' that the Council of Ministers is being asked to approve. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last July promised MPs they would be consulted on draft EU legislation before it went to the Council of Ministers and that Paris would object to the Council changing its agenda less than 14 days before a meeting. Mr Philippe Seguin, the anti-Maastricht president of the National Assembly, last week leapt on the technicality that the Commission's 'excessive budget' recommendation was only put on the Council agenda five days ago. On Friday he helped persuade the parliament's EU affairs committee to pass a unanimous resolution asking Mr Balladur to carry out his July promise. Later today the parliament's finance committee is to review what transpired in Luxembourg. Mr Seguin has been able to play on the irritation of many MPs that the Luxembourg debate should be taking place a day before the National Assembly starts debate on France's 1995 budget. A spokesman for Mr Seguin said it was 'an encroachment on French parliamentary sovereignty'. But the presidential election season is opening in France and Mr Seguin, who supports Mr Jacques Chirac against rival-Gaullist Mr Balladur, is not averse to stirring up trouble for the government. An Ifop opinion poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche for the first time put Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president and a Socialist, ahead in a first- round vote for the presidency, giving him 20 per cent, 19 per cent for Mr Balladur and 10 per cent for Mr Chirac. In the second round run-off, Mr Delors would be beaten by Mr Balladur (51-49 per cent) but would win against Mr Chirac (54-46 per cent).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 27 Mar (INA)--Yemeni Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid has warned against a scheme aimed at fragmenting  the Arab and Islamic region under the guise of religion to  divert the Arabs and Muslims from the course of development.    In a statement published today in AL-MUSTAQBAL newspaper,  the  paper of the Yemeni Socialist Party, al-Bid disclosed that the  signs of this serious scheme are represented by the acts of  violence, terrorism, and crime from which many Arab and Muslim  countries, including Yemen, are suffering.    Al-Bid noted that this scheme, which stands against every  national and pan-Arab tendency toward unity, takes religion as a  guise. He added that reason and religion reject such backward  plans.</p>

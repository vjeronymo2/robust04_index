The detention of the two main Senegalese opposition  leaders has been extended by 48 hours. As you know, Abdoulaye  Wade, secretary general of the Senegalese Democratic Party  [PDS], and Landing Savane, the leader of the African Party for  Democracy and Socialism, were arrested after the violent  demonstrations which caused the death of seven people in Dakar.  It has been announced in the Senegalese capital that other  arrests may be carried out. The two men are being questioned  separately by investigators. President Abdou Diouf's government  is blaming them for the violent incidents. However, Ousmane  Ngom, the PDS' number two man, told Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou  that Wade and Savane are being detained under restrictive  conditions.    [Begin Ngom recording] Mr. Wade has been totally isolated.  He cannot communicate with anybody. He has not been allowed to  communicate with his wife or his lawyers. He is also not  allowed to read newspapers or listen to the radio and has  therefore been totally deprived of information. We have been  informed that Mr. Savane is being subjected to the same  treatment. He is being detained under totally unacceptable  conditions, in violation of human rights and the most  fundamental freedom. Not only is this arrest arbitrary, it  appears to be more like a kidnapping because it is difficult to  understand how a deputy can be arrested without summons or a  warrant. Also it is difficult to see how the Senegalese  Government has still not given any reasons for the arrests. We  are therefore asking for the immediate removal of these  restrictive conditions as well as the immediate and  unconditional release of Wade, Savane, and all the other people  who were unjustly arrested with them.

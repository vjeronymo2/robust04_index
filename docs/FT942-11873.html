			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Mandela insists on fruits of liberation: Patti Waldmeir and Mark Suzman ask whether the new South Africa can afford them Mr Nelson Mandela made one thing abundantly clear when he claimed electoral victory on Monday night: that he will be moved by the spirit of reconciliation and compromise on all issues bar one - his economic plan for uplifting black South Africans, known as the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). The message of the man who will henceforth dominate South African politics was unambiguous: he will tolerate no opposition in implementing this programme; and anyone who disagrees with it need not bother entering the government of national unity. His comments demonstrate the fact that Mr Mandela and his African National Congress see the advancement of black South Africans as the true goal of decades of liberation struggle. If political power cannot be used to ease black poverty, it is not worth having, they would argue. The foreword to the RDP puts the case even more categorically: 'No political democracy can survive and flourish if the mass of our people remain in poverty, without land, without tangible prospects for a better life.' The ANC cannot expect to remain in power unless it meets these basic needs. Mr Jay Naidoo, who may be appointed to head a special ministry charged with implementing the programme, says its objectives must be met or 'none of us is going to survive'. The programme sets ambitious goals; over the next five years 1m homes are to be built, 2.5m houses electrified, clean water, sanitation and health care provided for all. But it also includes a commitment to fiscal discipline and the need to maintain macro-economic balance. 'We must finance the RDP in ways that do not cause undue inflation or balance of payments difficulties,' it says, adding that 'the vast bulk of the RDP will be financed by existing resources organised, rationalised and directed within RDP guidelines'. But the ANC's plans for 'increasing the efficiency of consumption expenditure and improving the revenue recovery capacities of government' display a touching faith in the powers of the new broom - and a naive belief in the willingness of government to cut defence spending. Mr Naidoo expects a 3 per cent annual rise in the productivity of the civil service. But the ANC's agreement not to sack white civil servants in large numbers, coupled with its commitment to promote blacks through affirmative action, may, conversely, lead to a rise in the cost of the public service. And with nine new provincial administrations set up under the constitution and a host of new parastatal bodies created by the RDP itself, it is hard to share the ANC's optimism about productivity gains. So too is it difficult to believe that R3.83bn (Pounds 717m) will be saved from defence spending. It is also worth noting that though the plan cites the need for fiscal discipline, a commitment to keep the budget deficit at 6 per cent of gross domestic product, included in early drafts, was removed from the final plan. Costing the plan is difficult: the ANC says it has budgeted R39bn for the five-year programme. The National party claims the true cost will be R70bn in the first year alone, rising to more than R600bn for the full five years. Given that the financing of the RDP is at best vague, at worst unrealistic, only time will tell which will turn out to be the true figure. Still, the South African business community does not seem to be panicking over the plan, largely because the ANC has shown such eagerness to consult widely on the programme and seek the commitment of business at every stage. As economist Mr Rudolf Gouws of Rand Merchant Bank points out, the final draft has removed many of the 'rough edges' of earlier drafts, making it more difficult to criticise. And the original heavily 'statist' emphasis of the draft has been substantially softened, with ANC officials keen to play up the party's corporatist intentions, rather than its anti-capitalist past. The real test will come if an ANC government must choose between either implementing the plan or raising taxes and printing money. For the moment, its intentions are virtuous; they will be sorely tested by a spell in power.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTION RESULTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Electorate 23m                                        Votes      % of                                                  total  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- African National Congress (ANC)        7.42m     62.5% National Party (NP)                    2.62m     22.1% Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)            0.99m      8.3% Freedom Front (FF)                     0.32m      2.7% Democratic Party (DP)                  0.21m      1.7% Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)          0.15m      1.3%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Provisional results for the National Assembly based on 12.07m votes counted out of the estimated 23m cast.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

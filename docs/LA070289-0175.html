			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEMP PLEDGES YONKERS HOUSING FUNDS  </P> <P> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp has made a  "multimillion-dollar commitment" to help resolve a longstanding housing  desegregation case in Yonkers, N.Y. He would not specify the amount of U.S.  funds involved.  </P> <P> Kemp's actions include approval of construction, on five sites, of 142 new  units of public housing in Yonkers. He said that the units are an integral part  of a federal court's plan in the Yonkers litigation to provide low-income and  moderate-income housing, open to all races, in predominantly white sections of  the city.  </P> <P> "President Bush and I are committed to fair housing and have made the full  enforcement of laws against discrimination one of our top priorities" at HUD,  Kemp said Friday. "Our actions will help provide low-income housing  opportunities for those in need and promote our goal of fair housing for all."  </P></p>

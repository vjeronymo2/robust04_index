			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Boots first with trading news - Other companies Before the end of the week, Boots is expected to be the first of the big UK retail groups to make a statement on how it fared in the all-important Christmas trading period. Analysts expect sales at Boots the Chemists for the quarter to the end of December - when it usually makes about half its annual profit - to be about 7 per cent up on last year, helped by the recent flu epidemic. Halfords is expected to have benefited from stronger bicycle sales, with Children's World and Boots Opticians also likely to show substantial sales growth. Profits forecasts for the year to March range from Pounds 450m to Pounds 460m.</p>

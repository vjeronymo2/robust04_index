Therefore, they possess traits of  both legal responsibilities and their own.    Civil liabilities possess the following legal traits: 1)  Civil liabilities are enforced by state compulsory measures.  Compulsory enforcement by the state is an important feature of  legal responsibilities, as well as civil liabilities. This is a  major difference between civil liabilities and moral  obligations. 2) Civil liabilities are legal responsibilities  arising from failure to perform civil obligations in violation  of the demands of the Civil Law. Civil liabilities differ from  civil obligations; civil liabilities are not civil obligations  but the legal consequences of not performing such obligations.  In other words, civil liabilities are predicated on civil  obligations. 3) Civil liabilities are mainly responsibilities  regarding property. It is the common task for laws governing  various activities, as well as a task for the Civil Law, to  protect socialist public property and the legitimate rights and  interests of citizens and legal entities. Nevertheless,  protection measures under the Civil Law possess traits different  from those of laws governing other activities. This fact  determines the Civil Law's scope and principles. 4) Citizens  and legal entities are encouraged to conscientiously perform  their civil obligations and fight against lawbreaking acts.    Civil liabilities can be divided into two major categories:  contractual and tortious liabilities. Contractual liabilities,  also called liabilities arising from contractual violations,  mean civil liabilities that should be undertaken by the parties  who violate contracts. Tortious liabilities, also called  liabilities arising from causing people harm, mean civil  liabilities that should be undertaken by the parties who  infringe on state and collectively owned property, as well as  the property and persons of other people.    There are four general principles governing civil  liabilities: 1) The principle of protecting the legitimate civil  rights and interests of civil rights principals. This principle  calls for holding any unit or individual civilly liable for  infringing on other people's civil rights and legitimate rights  and interests. 2) The principle of fixing responsibility for  errors. This is the principle of assigning civil liabilities,  which holds the performer of an act civilly liable for his or  her erroneous act. 3) The principle of fairness in assigning  responsibility. It urges people's courts to seek truth from  facts, show fairness and reasonableness, and abide by the law in  handling civil cases. Courts should uphold the principle of  fixing responsibility for errors without unduly focusing on the  errors. They should consider the interests of both parties and  correctly handle civil disputes so as to enhance harmony and  unity between the parties and benefit their production and  lives. 4) The principle of exoneration as a consequence of  force majeure. Except otherwise provided for by law, the  parties concerned are absolved from responsibility for not  honoring contracts or causing other people harm as a consequence  of force majeure.</p>

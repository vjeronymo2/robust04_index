			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL FEEDBACK POSITIVE ON OTAY MESA BINATIONAL AIRPORT PLAN  </P> <P> Federal officials are enthusiastic about the idea of building a binational  airport at Otay Mesa, San Diego representatives said Friday after a whirlwind  lobbying tour here.  </P> <P> Despite the novel immigration and customs problems posed by a binational  airport, "no one said that it can't be done," said City Councilman Ron Roberts.  </P> <P> In a flurry of meetings with four federal agencies, the State Department, the  Pentagon, Capitol Hill and the Mexican ambassador, San Diego city and county  representatives spent two days promoting their proposal for an international  airport to straddle the territories and jurisdictions of the United States and  Mexico.  </P> <P> Roberts, who has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea, said the  delegation wanted to find out from federal officials whether the idea was  viable from Washington's point of view.  </P> <P> "The answer, clearly, was 'yes,' " he said.  </P> <P> Roberts said government reaction ranged from "cautious optimism" at the  Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service, to  "genuine enthusiasm" at the Department of Transportation and the Federal  Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> "They are really singing our song," concurred Galen J. Reser, an assistant  secretary at the Transportation department. "It is not every city or region in  the country that is thinking about the explosion of air traffic that we are  going to see in the future. They are forward-thinking. They want to be ready  for it."  </P> <P> Last summer, both the INS and Customs voiced initial opposition to the idea. A  binational airport "would severely impact upon Border Patrol operations," the  INS said in a letter to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado), and the Customs  Service complained to him that "such an airport would be a high-risk facility  for the smuggling of aliens and drugs."  </P> <P> But, in meetings Thursday and Friday, these agencies muted their opposition.  </P> <P> "Certainly we would have concerns about security, illegal migration of aliens  and drug flow," said Gene McNary, commissioner of the INS, "but we are always  open to new ideas."  </P> <P> "We have concerns but they are not negative concerns," said Robert Bartol,  director of the Customs Service office of passenger enforcement and  facilitation. "We look at the issues as things to be resolved."  </P> <P> Bartol said the Customs Service is still worried about increased opportunities  for smuggling and the general difficulty of collecting tariffs and conducting  border operations in a "binational enclave." He said they could also face  problems from "tangential activities" like hotels and car rental agencies that  grow up around airports and crowd out land for government facilities.  </P> <P> The delegation traveled to Washington under the auspices of the regional  planning commission, or Sandag (San Diego Assn. of Governments).  </P> <P> Roberts made the trip on behalf of Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who had planned to  make the trip but stayed in California to be with her husband, who is ill.  Other delegation members included Leon Williams, chairman of the San Diego  County Board of Supervisors, Port Commission Chairman Milford Portwood and Lois  Ewen, a Coronado councilwoman.  </P> <P> On Thursday evening, the group had a private meeting with the Mexican  ambassador, Gustavo Petricioli, who advised them on the protocol for pursuing  the airport plan with the Mexican government.  </P> <P> San Diego's representatives in Congress are deeply divided over the idea of a  binational airport. Only two of them, Reps. Ron Packard (R -- Oceanside) and  Bill Lowery (R -- San Diego) -- both supporters -- showed up for a Thursday  afternoon session in Washington. Packard said the airport plan has "great  possibilities.  </P> <P> "We are in a rush because we are rapidly losing airport sites to development,"  he explained. "All available sites will be gone in a few years. My colleagues  may soon find that (Otay Mesa) may be the only logical site."  </P> <P> Division in congressional ranks "won't make it any easier" to gain federal  approval, said Lowery.  </P> <P> Rep. Jim Bates (D -- San Diego), who opposes the airport idea, said he  boycotted the meeting because the lobbying trip is a "charade.  </P> <P> "The proposal is not well-conceived, it is not well-studied, and they are  proceeding in an inadequate manner," he said.  </P> <P> Rep. Hunter also opposes the airport plan, citing the danger of building a  "cocaine gateway."  </P> <P> Bates contended that the delegation had not adequately considered the option of  joint military-civilian use of the Miramar Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> But Roberts reported that, in a meeting with U.S. Navy officials Thursday, the  "message was loud and clear" that the Pentagon would block any joint use of  Miramar.  </P> <P> Roberts said the final two meetings on Friday, with the Transportation  Department and the FAA, were the "capstone" of the trip.  </P> <P> "They were the most familiar with the options," he said, "so they were a little  less scared " by the binational concept.  </P> <P> There is only one operational multinational airport in the world -- the  international airport in Geneva, which is operated jointly by the French and  Swiss governments.  </P> <P> Sandag is planning a trip to Mexico in mid-September to discuss the binational  proposal with Mexican officials. Roberts said the next step after that will be  to draw up a memorandum of understanding for reaching a final plan.  </P> <P> Lowery expressed hope that the proposed airport will be discussed at a  U.S.-Mexican summit meeting between President Bush and Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari next December. Presidential attention could move the issue  forward more quickly, Lowery said, and avoid getting the plan bogged down in  the bureaucracy.  </P></p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: Survival jeopardised by steel price rise Sir, What business in today's marketplace can increase its prices by more than 40 per cent? Answer: the European steel industry. We are a fairly typical engineering company supplying fabricated and machined products to a variety of markets from defence to leisure. We have survived the recession to date by prudent management and a shift in emphasis to exports and new products. We employ 50 people. All this could be in vain now that the steel industry is implementing a 40 per cent-plus increase in its prices. Our markets are extremely fragile - and our best customers refuse to accept any price increases. So we are faced with a huge, totally unrealistic increase which, because of our purchasing power (5 tonnes a month), we can do little to resist and our large customers refuse to accept. We have made inquiries in countries outside the EC to see if we can purchase two or three months' supply from producers there. Consistently we are told that they cannot supply or must be careful on price because EC mills may cause problems for them. So much for a free market. This increase - reasons for which include huge demand from China and capacity reduction - is nothing more than the result of deliberations of a price cartel taking no notice of the realities of the European market. Almost certainly prices paid by China will be extremely low and we are being asked to support the steel mill margins. Apart from being inflationary it hits the medium and small-sized user, the bedrock of UK manufacturing industry. Are we to support China at the expense of the UK?

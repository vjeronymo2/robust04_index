			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Republic Party Chairman Janos Palotas by </F> Aniko Kobli; place and date not given: "One Should Not React to  Stupidity by Hitting"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kobli] Regardless of  society's judgment, do you think it was a mistake to only make  use of your popularity in the campaign? Although this did not  make the Republic Party look like a one-man party, it  nevertheless was based on your person.    [Palotas] We probably need more time to analyze the campaign  strategies, but I do not think this played a role in the  election results. The citizens did not want to choose between  people. No one was interested in what the programs of various  political parties contained.    [Kobli] But one could not know in advance that this would be  the case.    [Palotas] In that case, one cannot know for sure that the  strategy would have failed either. The Republic Party  deliberately placed the responsibility on one person, while it  presented its professional programs with the help of its  experts. I do not want to argue, but the Republic Party  presented the largest number of experts to the public. It is  impossible to tell whether this was a good campaign or a bad one  according to the election results. Therefore, the concept did  not fail; it is another matter whether our campaign could have  focused on other things. It is possible that a simplified  program would have received greater attention. This is where I  see possibilities for analysis. [passage omitted]    [Kobli] Irrespective of the fact that your party has not  made it into parliament, in your view is there any justification  for a nonideological party in Hungary?    [Palotas] The present situation shows that there is no  justification for such a party. We created a political  formation that will be characteristic in Western Europe only in  five or 10 years. I wanted not only to catch up with the  Western processes but also to precede them. However, the  present elections in Hungary were like the ones in the developed  democracies 20 years ago. I do not want to lose my optimism,  and I hope I will not have to come to the conclusion that there  are no chances for such a political formation in Hungary.    [Kobli] According to some views, the small parties should be  gathered together.    [Palotas] It was said at our National Committee meeting that  the appearance of the Entrepreneurs' Party, the Agrarian  Alliance, and the Republic Party as some kind of a common force  would increase the voters' confidence in us. One should not be  hasty, but perhaps we can talk about this after the elections.  However, this requires the will of all the aforementioned  parties, and we should also know better what we want.  Therefore, although I do not want to make a positive result out  of a negative election result, I must nevertheless say that  several quite well-known political parties that have been  present on the Hungarian political arena for four or five years  fared considerably worse than the Republic Party.

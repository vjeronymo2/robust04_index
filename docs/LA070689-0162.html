			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GATT Meeting Postponed: A GATT meeting to consider a bid by China to join the  96-nation trade forum has been postponed "because of difficulties in having  meaningful discussions in present circumstances," a GATT spokesman said. A  special working party that has been studying China's application since its  submission three years ago was scheduled to meet next week to discuss the terms  of a draft document for China's possible accession to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade. The meeting was put off with China's agreement, and a date  for the meeting will be announced later.  </P></p>

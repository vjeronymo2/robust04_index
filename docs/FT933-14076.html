			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Danes pledge to defend the krone AS THE krone came under pressure in the foreign exchange markets yesterday, Danish monetary authorities insisted that the currency would not be devalued. Mrs Marianne Jelved, Denmark's economy minister, reiterated that no devaluation was planned while Mrs Kirsten Mordhorst, head of the National Bank's (central bank) secretariat, denounced as 'crazy' market rumours that the krone would leave the EMS. Mrs Mordhorst said that the speculation could not have arisen among people who knew anything about the situation in Denmark. At the same time, however, the bank raised a key short-term interest rate, the repo rate, from 7.8 to 9 per cent yesterday morning. It also imposed a limit of 30 per cent of assets on access for the commercial banks to repurchase certificates of deposit. This tightened liquidity, sending the one-month Cibor (Copenhagen inter-bank offer rate) from 8.87 per cent on Wednesday to 12.29 per cent yesterday, its highest since March, when the krone was last under significant pressure. The central bank's measures initially firmed the currency but, in the absence of a reduction in German interest rates or a rise in French rates, the krone weakened again. At the end of the day the rate against the D-Mark was 3.8960, slightly weaker than when trading opened. A statement yesterday by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the National Bank, implied a further rise in short-term rates was possible. Describing the rise in the repo rate as a natural reaction to the weakening krone, he added 'time will tell' whether the measure was sufficient. According to Mr Hardy Larsen, head of arbitrage at Unibank, as long as the franc remains weak, so will the krone. 'Unemployment is very high, and outsiders think we must be interested in leaving the EMS system in order to be able to lower interest rates,' he said. The krone's weakness has also hit the bond market, where the yield gap between Danish and German 10-year treasury bonds has widened from 0.21 percentage points at the beginning of last week to about 0.51 points yesterday. The Danish economy has been hit by the devaluation of sterling, the Swedish krona and several other currencies last year, leading to a trade-weighted appreciation of the krone and a 7 per cent drop in the value of exports for the first four months of this year compared with the same period last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Sugak] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov  has qualified the Russian president's decree on urgent measures  for the defence of the population from bandits and other forms  of organised crime as a very important and timely measure.  Luzhkov pointed out that an extremely tense criminal situation  in the country and ways out of it are the most important  problems faced by the city today.    He pointed out that the situation in the city had acquired  an  entirely different character by now. Earlier, mafia structures  used to settle scores between themselves, building up tension in  the city without directly affecting the life of city residents,  whereas today, the level of criminal activities not only  expanded in scope, but acquired an entirely different quality.  It affects major businessmen, bankers and other business people  who are involved in the formation of new economy in the city.    A recent statement made by the board of the "Logovaz" joint  stock society in connection with an attempt on the life of its  director general has exasperated the city authorities, Luzhkov  said. Apart from prominent activists, major state and  commercial agents, common people die, who have nothing to do  with this but and who happened to be on the scene of the tragedy.    "To transfer the police to a reinforced system of  maintenance  of law and order - this is what the new decree provides for,"  the mayor said. He pointed out that the city is prepared to  meet the interests of the most important department for ensuring  the city's well-being as never before: police stations are  being provided with new premises and funds are being allocated,  including hard currency, to provide the police with the  necessary facilities and equipment.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE GROUP BACKS NEW CLEAN AIR PLAN WITH TOUGHER CONTROL OF AUTO EMISSIONS  </P> <P> In a new sign of congressional discontent over President Bush's clean air  proposal, a bipartisan group of senators Friday endorsed a rival plan that  would impose more stringent automobile pollution controls than envisioned by  the Administration.  </P> <P> The measure, backed by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.),  rejects a White House-backed approach that calls for a forced switch from  gasoline to cleaner-burning fuels in the nation's smoggiest cities as a  fundamental solution to the air pollution problem.  </P> <P> Drafted by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), the proposal  instead would significantly tighten pollution controls on all automobiles, no  matter what kind of fuel they burn.  </P> <P> Under the plan, every new car sold in the nation would be required to meet the  current California emissions standard by 1993 and achieve an additional 50%  reduction in pollutants by the year 2003.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposal Faces Changes  </P> <P> In parting company with the White House, the senators provided another  indication that powerful forces in Congress will attempt to reshape the  President's proposal, with some lawmakers favoring tougher provisions and  others attempting to relax restrictions.  </P> <P> The looming battles seem certain to delay approval of a broad-based clean air  plan beyond the Administration's end-of-the-year target, advocates on both  sides of the debate say.  </P> <P> In the House, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) agreed this week to use the  White House proposal as a starting point but made clear that he plans to try to  significantly tighten its motor vehicle provisions.  </P> <P> On the other side of the issue, House Energy Committee Chairman John D. Dingell  (D-Mich.), a principal sponsor of the White House bill, has signaled his intent  to introduce an alternative plan with watered-down restrictions on coal-burning  power plant emissions that cause acid rain.  </P> <P> The strong bipartisan support expressed Friday for the tougher anti-smog  proposal appears to give the measure a strong chance to emerge intact from the  Senate, congressional observers said. It was endorsed by 11 of the 16 members  of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and two senators who are  not on the committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prefers Baucus Plan  </P> <P> The support of Chafee, who is also a principal sponsor of the Administration  plan, could encourage the White House to accept a more stringent approach, at  least on the issue of smog control.  </P> <P> Stressing that he had lent support to the Bush proposal because it was the  "first effort an Administration had made in eight years" to tackle the nation's  air pollution problem, Chafee said he favors the Baucus approach to reducing  smog.  </P> <P> The Senate smog-control plan, endorsed by eight Democrats and five Republicans,  would not significantly accelerate the rate at which air quality in the  nation's cities would be expected to reach healthful levels.  </P> <P> Under both plans, most cities would be expected to attain federal health  standards by the year 2000. Houston, New York and Chicago would be given  another five years, and Los Angeles -- by far the nation's smoggiest city --  would not be required to meet the standards until 2010.  </P> <P> But Baucus and other sponsors of the rival proposal argued that its stringent  requirements would be more likely to ensure that cities actually could meet the  ambitious deadlines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On-Time Finish Predicted  </P> <P> The Administration plan "doesn't do what it purports to do," Baucus said in an  interview. "Our bill will get us across the finish line on time."  </P> <P> In particular, the senators contended that the Administration unrealistically  pinned its hopes of achieving cleaner air on shifting to alternative-fueled  vehicles in the nation's smoggiest cities.  </P> <P> "I personally don't understand how you're going to get X number of people in  Los Angeles to buy alternative cars," Chafee said.  </P> <P> At the same time, they criticized a White House-backed rule that would allow  some automobiles to violate emission requirements as long as an auto maker's  fleet average satisfied the pollution standard.  </P> <P> Some state air quality directors have contended that such an "averaging"  provision could permit an overall increase in emissions of air pollutants,  despite the nationwide adoption of current California tailpipe standards.  </P> <P> Citing such conclusions, the senators advocated a system that would require  every car to comply with the regulations and called for the eventual adoption  of thresholds twice as stringent as those endorsed by the White House. Auto  makers would be permitted to meet the standards by improving current gasoline  engines or by introducing new vehicles capable of burning cleaner fuels.  </P> <P> Although the alternative smog control plan would also address stationary  sources of pollution, such as factories, its primary emphasis is on  automobiles, which produce about half of the hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides  that are the major contributors to urban smog.  </P> <P> "It's the old saying," Chafee said. "You rob banks because that's where the  money is. You regulate cars because that's where the problem is."  </P></p>

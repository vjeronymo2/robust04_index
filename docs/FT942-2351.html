			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Death throes or death wish? - The demise of the British film industry is said to be inevitable. But, argues producer and director Ismail Merchant, we may only have ourselves to blame Barely a week passes without another lamentation: the British film industry, according to hand-wringing obituarists, is mouldering in the grave. Yet each year Britain manages to produce at least two or three films that shatter box office records on both sides of the Atlantic. Merchant Ivory did it with A Room With A View and Howards End. Last year it was The Crying Game and The Remains of the Day, and now it is Four Weddings and A Funeral. Each year a steady stream of British films like Shadowlands, In The Name of the Father and Much Ado About Nothing achieve critical acclaim and commercial success. All these films compete triumphantly, both at the box office and at awards, with the best in the world. This does not seem to indicate even a symptom of ill health let alone death. And how could it be otherwise when British cinema can draw from the best writers, the richest source material, the finest actors and excellent technicians? In addition, it has an enormous advantage over its European neighbours in sharing a common language and culture with the United States, so British films are immediately accessible to one of the largest movie audiences in the world. The morticians of the industry complain that there is no money for films here. As a producer who has spent most of his life parting financiers from their money I believe I am qualified to state with some authority that there is money here. You have to go and get it, and it isn't always easy - but it is there. Despite all the recent vicissitudes London is still a major financial and commercial centre; it is also recognised worldwide for its pre-eminence in the performing arts. It shouldn't take a great leap of the imagination to connect the two and develop the possibilities. I have managed to fund not only British productions, but also Indian and American productions with City money. You have to work at it, but it can be done. Film-makers in this country accuse the government of not adequately supporting and funding the film industry. Of course the government should provide incentives and subsidies, but it doesn't. So why does the industry look to a weak and ineffectual government for help when it has been made clear that the arts are not a priority and barely even on the agenda? The energy that goes into lobbying the government for greater state intervention is wasted, and could be channelled more productively into making movies. Film-makers must take responsibility for their industry, and become more aggressive in fighting for their films. What has died in Britain is not the film industry, nor indeed any section of the arts, which are demonstrably alive and flourishing, but rather the indomitable spirit that once characterised this nation: the enteprising spirit that established empires, the unyielding spirit that stoically endured the hardships of war without a whimper of self-pity. The passive, negative attitudes that are prevalent now, the constant moan of complaint, are not just tiresome but a tragedy for this country. Since I first came here some thirty years ago I have noticed, particularly in the past decade, a gradual deadening of the spirit of the country. Goals, ideologies and even thought seem to have died. It is as if a shroud has descended on this island and everyone is resigned to living in this cocoon instead of ripping it apart and letting the sunlight in. Even as Britain has united with Europe it seems to be isolating itself from its partners. When I work here I can tolerate the climate, the skittish fluctuations of the economy, the food, and even the ridiculous rigidity of shopkeepers who smugly slam their doors in your face punctually at closing time even if you are waving a fistful of money at them; I can deal with any crisis and calamity, but I'm becoming less tolerant of the pessimism and bleakness of spirit that has permeated every aspect of life here. Yet people still gravitate to Britain from every corner of the world seeking a better life. If so many foreigners can see how much Britain still has to offer why are the British so blinkered? When you start to believe that your country is second rate, you are only a step away from creating a second rate country. Equally damaging is Britain's capacity for disparaging her own achievements. When we made A Room With A View in 1986 everyone was delighted with the extraordinary success of the film. By the time we made Howards End six years later, critics were picking holes in Forster's work and questioning why we even bothered to film his novels. But those two films, together with our production of Maurice and David Lean's A Passage to India, brought 28 Academy Award nominations, 10 Oscars and a heap of other awards, as well as considerable revenue and kudos to Britain. No author in the history of cinema can claim as much. Anywhere else Forster would be celebrated as a national hero, a public holiday would be declared on his birthday and streets would be named after him. But in Britain his reward is to be picked over by soi disant intellectuals. The British film industry should applaud its achievements and build on them. British cinema has the talent and the ability, but it needs to rediscover its spirit. The grave diggers should put their shovels away before the death of the British film industry becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

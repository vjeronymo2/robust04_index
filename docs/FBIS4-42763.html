			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Martina Fietz report: "Kanther Wants Security in One </F> Piece"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- FRG Interior Minister Kanther has  appealed to the laender ruled by the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] to agree to the anticrime law in the Bundesrat on  Friday [10 June]. The law does not contain anything that would  not be acceptable to the SPD, the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] politician said.    Kanther indicated that he does not think anything of  "unraveling" the package of laws and of adopting it one part  after the other. Thus, Hesse, for instance, wants to deal with  measures on combating right-wing extremism in a separate draft.  The law must live up to its name, the minister stressed. It  must be directed against all fields of crime, also against  organized crime. Kanther said it is incomprehensible that the  SPD should advocate the bugging of apartments "in an unsuitable  procedure" but rejects the bugging of telephones "in a suitable  procedure." Internal security cannot live with policy out of  the party box. It should be kept out of the election campaign.    Kanther said that he is watching the SPD-led laender's  deportation practices with concern. The CDU politician sees the  deportation of asylum-seekers who are not recognized as having a  right to asylum as an essential pillar of the asylum compromise.  He admonished Rudolf Scharping, SPD chairman and  Rhineland-Palatinate minister-president, not to establish an  independent regulation for old cases. Scharping should  consistently stick to the asylum compromise, which was achieved  across party lines.    To have this compromise be even more effective, securing the  borders remains a great challenge, the minister stressed. The  border police are facing their most difficult task between  Saxony and the Czech Republic. An agreement to return illegal  immigrants, similar to the one with Poland, is in the offing.  Obviously, the adoption of such an agreement has so far failed  because of domestic problems in the Czech Republic. [passage  omitted]</p>

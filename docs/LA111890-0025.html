			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 STRYPER, "AGAINST THE LAW," ENIGMA.  </P> <P> Stryper needed to be born again after its dismal 1988 album "In God We Trust."  So the erstwhile evangelistic heavy-metal band has dropped all Jesus  references, toughened the sound and turned in a credible, stylistically varied  repositioning effort. There's nothing too imaginative here, although Stryper's  continuing profession of Christian values (this time without the dogma) makes  for some interesting contrasts with metal's typically libertine outlook.

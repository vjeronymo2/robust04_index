			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING TABS ON AIDS MEASURES  </P> <P> The Legislature has provided Gov. George Deukmejian with a rare opportunity to  keep California in the vanguard of AIDS programs. It has sent him legislation  that addresses some shortcomings in the system and establishes innovative ways  of reducing future expenses as the pandemic's impact inevitably increases.  </P> <P> Most important among the many bills is AB 1600 by Assembywoman Jackie Speier  (D-San Francisco) to address the crucial issue of early intervention. The  validity of more testing and earlier therapy for those infected with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, has now been demonstrated by new  research. This makes the early interventions provided by AB 1600 all the more  important in extending the lives of infected persons. Unfortunately, the  Legislature has not provided appropriate funding for the program, but at least  the framework is there.  </P> <P> Funding is a problem among other bills as well. Bills to make permanent the  continued subsidy of AZT for lower-income persons, and to extend coverage to  the uninsured (ABs 887 and 2251), would raise state funding at least to $2.8  million. But that is far short of what would be required in state matching  funds to obtain California's share of more than $7 million to be provided in  federal legislation now before Congress.  </P> <P> Federal legislation overshadows another area of state bills -- protection  against discrimination for those infected with HIV. Both AB 65 and AB 1535 have  been amended to place AIDS in the broader context of protection for those with  physical disabilities. This meets Deukmejian's earlier objections to  anti-discrimination measures that singled out AIDS. And it is consistent with  new federal disability legislation. The governor can now give a clear signal  against discrimination with his signature on this legislation.  </P> <P> Long-term economies in the control of the pandemic and in the care of the  HIV-infected population are implicit in a variety of bills to increase support  for and access to home and community-based projects (ABs 960 and 1726); to  support case management (AB 2056); to increase funding for congregate living  facilities while making them eligible for Medi-Cal support (SB 276); to mandate  AIDS education in grades 7 to 12 for all students except those for whom parents  request exemption (AB 11), and to fund demonstration projects in four counties,  including Los Angeles and San Diego, of services such as foster care for  children exposed to HIV, drugs and alcohol (SB 1173).  </P> <P> These bills now await the governor's signature. He has repeatedly called  attention to the state's leadership in funding AIDS programs. These bills give  him an opportunity to assure continued leadership while at the same time  providing for more effective and less costly long-term responses to the  disease.  </P></p>

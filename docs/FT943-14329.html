			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / China slows economy but keeps eye out for unrest: Beijing is walking a tightrope in trying to balance growth with fears of social dislocation Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, was quoted in a pro-Beijing Hong Kong magazine recently urging continued rapid growth in the Chinese economy. But the 'designer' of China's economic reforms will be disappointed if he expected that the breakneck speed of 13 per cent growth in gross domestic product of the past two years would be maintained. At mid-year all the indications are that China's economy is slowing in response to tight money and credit restrictions. Economists are now forecasting growth of 10-11 per cent this year and further slowing to between 7 and 9 per cent in 1995. The key question, however, is whether the slowdown will prove too abrupt and risk a 'hard landing' for the economy with associated dangers of unrest among a fractious population, especially in urban centres where unemployment and under-employment are rising. Chinese officials fear urban unrest almost as much as the continued spiralling inflation of earlier this year when cost of living increases in the 35 biggest urban centres exceeded 25 per cent compared with the same period last year. Western economists in Beijing say the government is 'walking a tightrope' in its continuing efforts to balance the political need for high growth with fears of social dislocation caused by rising prices. In the past month or so efforts to sustain relatively high economic growth appear to have taken precedence over the inflation fight. Credit restrictions have been loosened somewhat to provide working capital for faltering state enterprises which have suffered in the squeeze. Latest statistics reveal the impact on the state sector of the credit restrictions. Losses to April by medium and large state companies were up by 63 per cent compared with the first four months last year. The proportion of loss-making enterprises had increased to about 47 per cent compared with 30 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. By contrast, output of township and village enterprises - mostly small co-operative ventures - was up by 48 per cent in the four months to April compared with last year. Industrial output of foreign joint ventures rose by 68 per cent in the same period. The authorities have also begun to give much greater emphasis to assisting the agricultural sector in response to signs of growing unhappiness in rural areas with growth in peasant incomes lagging well behind urban employees. 'The concern of the government has clearly shifted from macro-stability to agriculture and emerging urban unemployment problems,' said Mr Peter Bottelier, the World Bank's chief representative in Beijing. 'Sectoral problems rather than macro-problems are now dominating the scene.' The annual increase in the national retail price index peaked at 20.8 per cent in February after rising sharply from 8.4 per cent at the beginning of 1993. Cost of living increases of 25.9 per cent also reached their highest level in February before beginning to fall back. Economists forecast that retail inflation would come down to about 16.5 per cent in the June quarter and cost of living rises would be in the order of 18-20 per cent for the half year compared with last year. Producer prices have also been falling - by some 50 per cent since mid-1993. This augurs well for a further reduction in consumer prices through the rest of the year. But western economists also note that the re-introduction of price controls earlier in the year on some 20 basic items, including services, was a significant factor in slowing growth in prices. Among slightly ominous recent developments as far as the continued liberalisation of China's economy is concerned have been signs that the leadership has begun re-emphasising central planning, including the re-introduction of grain production targets. But at this stage in what has proved a difficult process of seeking to stabilise a runaway economy - 1993 economic growth reached an unsustainable 13.4 per cent - Chinese leaders would seem to have reason to be quietly satisfied with developments. Among other positive indications is the slowdown in industrial production to a more manageable 18 per cent in the first quarter compared with a peak of 27 per cent in the second quarter last year. Investment demand is also weakening. Growth of investment by state enterprises fell to about 38 per cent in the first four months of 1994 compared with peak rates of more than 70 per cent last year. In line with the government's attempt to re-direct funds towards infrastructure, investment in transportation and energy has continued to grow while that in machinery, light industry and real estate has been curbed. The government might also be well satisfied with fiscal developments. While information is sketchy about the success of new tax reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax, tax receipts have exceeded targets, according to the Finance Ministry. The sale by the end of June of some Yn100bn (Pounds 7.6bn) of two and three-year treasury bonds surpassed expectations and is being hailed as an important success in the battle to drain liquidity from an overheating economy. National savings rates have also been rising again after wavering last year amid near panic about rising prices which pushed people into buying gold and household durables. Urban and rural savings were forecast to reach Yn1,770bn in the June quarter, a 38 per cent increase over the same period last year. But for all the positive signs, economists say that Chinese economic managers are not out of the woods. Not least of their problems is the debt-crisis among state enterprises caused by companies being unable to pay each other for supplies of raw materials or finished products. This in turn is complicating efforts to push ahead with state enterprise reform and at the same time improve the balance sheets of the specialised banks. As one western official said: 'The leadership continues to be involved in a very difficult balancing act.'</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Spanish keep eye on UK rates A SLIGHT easing in money-market interest rates in Madrid late last week has generated strong speculation in the Spanish capital that the Bank of Spain will trim its official intervention rate at a regular bill auction today. Bank of Spain officials declined to comment on rumours that they might reduce the intervention rate, now at 12.65 per cent. But senior Spanish officials have hinted for the past two weeks that they might be prepared to cut rates if the UK, in an effort to stimulate the British economy ahead of a general election, were to do likewise. The peseta and sterling currently mark the ceiling and floor respectively of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism and their rates of exchange are obliged to remain within 6 per cent of each other. In a newspaper interview at the weekend Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, conceded that Spain might have to follow a UK cut. 'The impact (of a UK cut) on Spanish rates will depend on how deep it is. If the UK cut is small we may not have to cut ours,' he said. There was no indication last night in London of an imminent cut in UK base rates, now at 10.5 per cent. Inflation is likely to continue rising in Spain for most of the first quarter, and most Spanish analysts insist that there are, at present, no pressing domestic reasons for easing monetary policy. But Mr Solchaga also noted that the apparent slowing in wage rises this year would provide some relief for the authorities in case they are forced to cut rates today. The recent strength of the US dollar has also weakened the D-Mark against the Spanish currency, which would allow a rate cut in Madrid to be easily accommodated in the markets.

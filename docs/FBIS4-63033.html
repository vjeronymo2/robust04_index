			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kris Kholki report in the "Power" column: "The State Duma </F> Wanted To Hear Filatov. The Chief Of Staff Was Not Allowed Into  The President's Office"]    [Text] Signs are that the fate of Russian Federation  presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov has been sealed. In  the next few days he will leave his post. The chances of his  retaining the post are extremely slim. Yesterday a senior  official in the presidential apparatus, speaking in a  confidential conversation in the State Duma, told NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA's correspondent that an edict about Mr. Filatov's  resignation has been signed by the president and that only the  date and the document's registration number have not yet been  stamped.    Mr. Filatov himself in an interview with INTERFAX denied  reports about his upcoming resignation, stating that "some  quarters stand to gain from putting about rumors about all sorts  of resignations, dismissal, and reshuffles in the upper reaches  of power. The aim of this permanent campaign is to impede  reform and prevent consolidation of society."    Yet indirect confirmation that Mr. Filatov has fallen from  grace came after the State Duma's plenary session Wednesday  decided to summon Sergey Filatov. This was because at its  previous session, on 13 May, Ruslan Orekhov, chief of the State  Legal Directorate under the Russian Federation president, failed  to respond to many of the State Duma deputies' questions.    State Duma Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mityukov phoned Filatov at  the deputies' demand and invited him to the Duma session.  According to Mityukov, Mr. Filatov agreed but said he wanted to  ask the president's permission for the visit. No permission was  obtained because Mr. Filatov, by his own admission, was not  received by the president, which is very strange for a chief of  staff.    According to information in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  possession,  at the current point in Russia's state history only Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, Yuriy Skokov, Viktor  Ilyushin, and Yuriy Baturin have free access to President  Yeltsin's office.</p>

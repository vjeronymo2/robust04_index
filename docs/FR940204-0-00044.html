			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the December 11, 1992 proposed rule, all interested parties were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the development of a final determination. Appropriate Federal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notices were published in The Los Angeles Times on January 1, 1993, The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> San Francisco Sunday Examiner and Chronicle on January 3, 1993, and The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> San Diego Union-Tribune on February 4, 1993. The public comment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ended on February 9, 1993. A total of 548 comments were received. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service received one letter from a Federal agency, three letters from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State offices, and five from city or county agencies. Five hundred and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ten of the comments were post cards from individuals urging support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the listing of the species. The Service received 29 letters from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and private organizations. Of those, only one expressed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opinion in opposition to listing the tidewater goby as endangered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Park Service (Santa Monica Mountains National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recreation Area) stated support for the listing of the tidewater goby as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered and suggested locations within the recreation area boundaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may be candidates for reintroduction of the species. The National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Park Service also sought assistance from the Service in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential habitat locations on lands not under public ownership that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be acquired under its land acquisition program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three California State agencies offered comments. The Topanga-Las  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virgenes Resource Conservation District, a subdivision of State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government, expressed full support for the listing of the goby. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Coastal Commission stated, ``The acute vulnerability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tidewater goby to man-induced changes of estuarine habitat makes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of comprehensive management strategies and plans, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of recovery plans, for this species imperative.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Department of Fish and Game submitted information pertaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a project to reestablish a population of tidewater gobies on Waddell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek Lagoon. The population was reintroduced in the fall of 1991 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently sampled in November 1992. Gobies were reported from three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites in the lagoon. The Department will continue to obtain information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on that population as it is surveyed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five letters of information were received from city or county  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. Two of these, one from the County of Santa Barbara Resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Department and one from the City of Santa Cruz, detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population occurrences that were already known to the Service. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letters from the cities of San Buenaventura and Santa Barbara cited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible impacts to goby habitat due to proposed or ongoing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These letters listed threats that are discussed under Factor A in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section. The Santa Barbara  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> County Flood Control and Water Conservation District stated support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing, but expressed concerns regarding the designation of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Environmental Defense Center identified three issues concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The critical habitat finding failed to meet the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of section 4 of the Endangered Species Act and under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Northern Spotted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owl <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  758 F. Supp. 621 (W.D. Wash. 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service concurs that critical habitat should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be designated for the tidewater goby. Information needed to complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required economic impact analyses consists of identifying Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions that might be precluded or modified by the destruction/adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification standard but not by the jeopardy standard. Moreover, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be necessary to describe how these actions may be modified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the destruction/adverse modification standard. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information will provide a basis for analyses on the economic effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designating critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Pact with power to fuel worldwide boom - A Uruguay Round services deal could be key to expansion THE draft agreement on services trade negotiated in the Uruguay Round could be as powerful a force for worldwide economic expansion as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which liberalised trade in goods after the second world war. (The creation of Gatt in 1947 was followed by a 20-year boom in world trade and output.) The draft 'final act' presented last December to the 108 governments taking part in the Round includes a comprehensive services accord extending fair trade rules for the first time to banking, insurance, transport, tourism, construction, telecommunications and professional and personal services. The deal is a remarkable achievement, given the outright hostility of many developing countries to discussion of services when the global trade talks were launched in 1986. There was also the need to construct a body of coherent rules from scratch to cover services of every variety, sold across borders or within borders and by individuals or multi-billion dollar corporations. However, the agreement as it stands is only a collection of rules. Still to come are the results of crucial detailed negotiations underway in Geneva on specific commitments by each country to open domestic services markets to foreign suppliers. For the US in particular, big improvements in market access for American companies are seen as essential to sell the services deal to a reluctant Congress. The stakes are enormous. International cross-border trade in services is worth between Dollars 800bn (Pounds 442bn) and Dollars 1,000bn, compared with merchandise trade of about Dollars 3,500bn. But at least as much business again is done by local affiliates of foreign companies, whose activities would be covered by the services accord. In addition, the agreement includes rules on government regulation of all marketed services, whether provided by domestic companies and firms or foreign ones. Thus it potentially touches total commercial services production of perhaps Dollars 12,000bn worldwide, accounting for broadly half of gross domestic product and employment in industrialised countries and a large chunk of those of developing economies. The agreement has three pillars: A framework General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) which extends Gatt-type fair trade principles to services. These include national treatment (treating foreign and domestic service-providers equally); transparency (an obligation to provide information on national rules and practices governing services); and most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment (non-discrimination between trading partners). The Gats, which would have its own council under an umbrella Multilateral Trading Organisation, also sets the ground rules for negotiating services liberalisation. Four annexes which elaborate the rules for financial services, where there is a need for prudential regulation to safeguard investors; stipulate unfettered access to countries' basic telecommunications networks (essential to the sale of many services); exempt for the time being aircraft landing rights now negotiated bilaterally under the Chicago Convention; and permit the temporary movement of workers to provide services abroad. Country schedules incorporating specific market-opening commitments. These initial commitments, analogous to (but much more complex than) the tariff cuts negotiated by the original signatories to Gatt, will emerge from bilateral bargaining but will be extended to other Gats members on an MFN basis. That said, the current negotiations in Geneva are not going well. Some 41 countries (the European Community counting as one), representing more than 90 per cent of world cross-border services trade, have made services offers. But by all accounts they do not add up to much. With a deadline on March 31, when country schedules have to be finalised to meet the Easter target of completing the Round, negotiators are still at first base. Matters have not been helped by industry pressure on Washington to exempt certain sectors such as maritime transport and basic telecommunications from Gats's MFN rule. Applying MFN, it is argued, would mean freezing US markets open and others' markets shut, making it impossible for the US to take bilateral measures under existing domestic legislation against countries refusing to open their shipping or telecommunications markets. The draft Gats accord does not permit any permanent exclusions. But signatories can take temporary exemptions from MFN for up to 10 years, subject to review after five. Apart from shipping and basic telecoms, US negotiators are being urged to exempt one or more financial services from MFN access if country commitments do not come up to scratch. The industry wanted a sectoral non-application clause in Gats, enabling signatories to withdraw benefits in the financial services area alone from a trading partner with an inadequate offer on financial services. But Gats only permits global 'non-application' of all services benefits. In addition, the EC wants a better deal from the US on access for its 'universal' banks, now handicapped by domestic US banking legislation. Developing countries want greater access for their exports of traditional services such as tourism and sophisticated services such as computer programming, film-making and hospital management. For all the uncertainties, the services accord has become a potent incentive for countries to settle elsewhere in the Uruguay Round. For the EC (including France, the second biggest services exporter after the US), services exports dwarf those of agricultural goods. Even Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, while criticising the Uruguay Round agriculture text, last week invited France to draw the appropriate conclusions. Negotiators were having trouble wrapping up the Uruguay Round, the head of the US delegation said, warning of the risk of trade wars if they failed , Reuter reports from Geneva. 'I must admit, we are having our problems in finalising this agreement,' the US ambassador, Mr Rufus Yerxa, told the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce. 'If the major players, Japan, the US and Europe, fail to come to grips with the aggressive efforts to protect and advance their own special interests at the expense of others, we are almost certainly going to see trade and investment wars,' Mr Yerxa said. But he urged the various parties as well as their constituents at home not to throw out an agreement because it was not perfect in their eyes. 'Europe will have to acknowledge the need to curtail agricultural subsidies,' Mr Yerxa said. But he also recognised the need for the US, which has often taken unilateral trade action, to be committed to multilateral rules. Developing nations should also accept rules in intellectual property, services and investment, he added.</p>

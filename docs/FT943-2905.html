			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Defence uncertainties catch up with Meggitt A slowdown in defence and aerospace-related businesses were behind a drop in interim pre-tax profits and sales at Meggitt, the Dorset-based engineering company. Pre-tax profits in the half-year to June 30 fell from Pounds 10.77m to Pounds 8.58m while turnover dropped 10 per cent from Pounds 179.3m to Pounds 161.7m. The aerospace division saw a drop in sales from Pounds 64.9m to Pounds 60m and controls from Pounds 61.1m to Pounds 50.3m. Only electronics increased, from Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 31.6m. The sales decline was due to 'continuing slowing of orders for the defence and aerospace-related businesses and fewer major contract completions', Mr Ken Coates, executive chairman, said. The aerospace division continued to suffer because of fundamental changes in the defence sector and a highly competitive commercial market. But he predicted a return to growth in 1995 provided that trading conditions continued to improve. Orders for the first half of 1994 were up 15 per cent on the second half of last year, and the Asia Pacific market saw a 60 per cent rise in overall sales from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 16m. Mr Coates said he expected growth in the next year to be driven by the electronics division, with the component companies showing the most notable improvement. The rationalisation programme continued with a further 3 per cent reduction in numbers employed to just under 6,000 and the amalgamation of five small businesses with larger ones. A disposal programme would realise cash in excess of Pounds 20m. Gearing had been reduced from 31 per cent to 29 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 3.3p to 2.5p and an interim dividend of 1.3p is maintained. COMMENT There had to come a point when problems in the aerospace industry finally caught up with Meggitt. The moment has arrived, although the severity of the impact had not been anticipated. The company will be able to achieve some earnings progress through the energy and electronics divisions, but they are small and it is unlikely to be enough to excite investors. Even a well-intentioned restructuring programme will be unable to overcome the problems of a declining military aerospace sector and a civilian sector unlikely to pick up before the end of 1996. The market could take some convincing with a forecast of Pounds 18m for 1994 and a prospective p/e of 14.7.</p>

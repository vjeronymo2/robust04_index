			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Still Not Even-handed"] </F>   [Text] The Clinton administration's decision not to go  ahead with its proposal to repeal the Pressler Amendment is a  serious setback to Pakistan. The move was prompted by a shift  in the American policy towards South Asia and as a gesture to  Benazir Bhutto's fledgling government. But what did Washington  expect in return? Did it have any reason to think, for instance,  that by resuming economic and military assistance barred by  Pressler, the US would succeed in persuading Pakistan either to  desist from fuelling terrorism in Kashmir or to roll back its  nuclear-weapons programme? It is, in the final analysis, the  administration's failure to give a reassuring reply to this  crucial question at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs  Sub-committee on South Asia that has led to the retention of the  Pressler Amendment. Senator after Senator assailed the move to  delete the Amendment from the Foreign Assistance Act as an  instance of the Clinton administration's inept policy towards  South Asia. None was taken in by State Department officials'  apparently innocent plea that the idea was simply to remove a  provision which was country-specific -- that is in relation to  assistance to Pakistan. The proffered official explanation was  that deletion of such a provision would make for greater  flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy. This did not wash  because the Senators maintained that removal of Pressler would  be a contradiction of the government's professed  non-proliferation goal in South Asia.    While New Delhi is naturally relieved to find that the  Congressional vigilance has helped scuttle a mischievous  anti-Indian twist to US policy, there is no room for  complacency. The heavily-funded Pakistani lobbies in Washington  must be expected to continue their efforts with redoubled vigour  to play mischief. It is still a long way to go and complex  procedures to be completed before a final foreign assistance act  emerges: These lobbies are unlikely to be disheartened by the  outcome of the deliberations in the Senate Sub- committee  because key aides in the White House have been found to be  vulnerable to their machinations. The more important reason for  India to be ever watchful is the new evidence that the so-called  even-handed approach of the US in South Asia remains in fact  heavily tilted in favour of Pakistan.    In the past the US gave overriding importance to effective  conduct of an anti-Soviet strategy in which Pakistan was a key  element. It is no secret that Washington in return turned a  Nelson's eye to Islamabad's nuclear weapons programme. But even  in the absence of cold war compulsions, the US has not ceased  going out of its way to placate Pakistan on one specious plea or  the other, especially on the Kashmir issue. Whether the policy  is marked by doublethink or confusion, the resulting threat to  India's interests is obvious.</p>

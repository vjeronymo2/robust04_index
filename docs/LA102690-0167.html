			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDANT'S MURDER CONVICTION OVERTURNED; NEW TRIAL IS LIKELY  </P> <P> An appellate court has overturned the first-degree murder conviction of a Los  Angeles man found guilty in the shooting death of an acquaintance whose body  was dumped in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> The ruling means that Luther Austin Edmonson will probably get a new trial if  the Orange County district attorney's office decides to pursue the case.  </P> <P> In a decision issued Tuesday, the 4th District Court of Appeal found that  Edmonson was unfairly denied a request to continue his trial after being  granted permission to represent himself by Orange County Superior Court Judge  David H. Brickner.  </P> <P> "We hold the court abused its discretion in refusing to hear the continuance  motion," the appellate decision read. "The motion itself was based on good  cause . . . a legitimate need for time to obtain the defense file, prepare the  defense case and consult with newly appointed counsel."  </P> <P> Edmonson, who was 41 at the time of the March, 1988, incident, was convicted of  shooting to death Eddie Jerome Greene, 55, of Los Angeles and dumping his body  in a ditch near Rancho Viejo Road in north San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Prosecutors claimed Edmonson killed Greene over a stolen wallet. Court records  show that Greene was shot four times in the head and twice in the shoulder and  that blood was found in Edmonson's car.  </P> <P> Dissatisfied with his defense attorney, Edmonson in February, 1989, received  permission to represent himself in the trial with the help of a court-appointed  legal adviser. The day the adviser was appointed, Edmonson requested that the  trial be continued for another week, allowing the new attorney to familiarize  himself with the case and giving Edmonson time to complete further research of  the evidence from jail.  </P> <P> Judge Brickner denied the request. The Court of Appeal found the denial  inappropriate because the new attorney was not able to effectively  cross-examine witnesses.  </P></p>

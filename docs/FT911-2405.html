			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Jury hears of secret tape A US CUSTOMS undercover agent explained at the Old Bailey yesterday how he secretly tape-recorded a meeting between British-based executives and Iraqis during an alleged plot to export nuclear detonating devices to Iraq. Mr Daniel Supnick posed as Mr Dan Saunders, export manager of CSI, the US manufacturer that made electrical capacitors allegedly wanted by the Iraqis. He said yesterday that with the authorisation of British Customs and Excise he put a miniature tape recorder under his clothes before going to London's Cavendish Hotel for an 8am meeting in September 1989. Mr Ali Daghir, aged 49, a managing director, of Esher, Surrey, Ms Jeanine Speckman, aged 41, of Addlestone, Surrey, and Mr Toufic Amyuni, aged 37, of London, have all denied conspiring to attempt illegally to export 40 electrical capacitors between September 1 1988 and March 29 last year. The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

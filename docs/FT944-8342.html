			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Signing of peace accord fails to allay Angola fears Prospects for peace in Angola remained uncertain last night despite the signing of an agreement to end the country's 19-year civil war which has cost half a million lives. A warm handshake between Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and General Eugenio Manuvakola, who signed on behalf of the Unita rebel movement, did little to allay fears aroused by the absence from the ceremony of its leader, Mr Jonas Savimbi. The agreement, in which the warring parties pledge a ceasefire with effect from midnight tomorrow, envisages the integration of Unita forces into the army, a coalition government and fresh national elections, which will be monitored by a 7,000-strong United Nations force. Although the UN will be relieved that the signing took place, the occasion fell well short of what had been planned. President dos Santos delegated the signing of the document to his foreign minister and the government delegation outnumbered the three-member Unita team led by Gen Manuvakola, Unita's secretary general and chief negotiator. The official programme for the ceremony, held in Lusaka's Mulungushi conference hall and attended by African leaders and senior western officials, listed Mr Savimbi as one of the participants. But over the weekend Unita officials said that an Angolan government military offensive launched a fortnight ago would prevent Mr Savimbi from attending. Although Gen Manuvakola said yesterday that Unita intended to implement the deal, Mr Savimbi has yet to make his position clear. A 1991 peace agreement, negotiated by US and Soviet Union diplomats, collapsed after Mr Savimbi refused to accept defeat by President dos Santos' MPLA party in the following year's election. The renewed conflict has left Angola even more bitterly divided but the recent MPLA offensive may have left the government with the upper hand, with some generals said to be calling for a further push. Government forces recently captured the Unita stronghold of Huambo, 530km south-east of the capital, Luanda. The offensive forced the postponement of the signing, originally due to take place last Tuesday, and may yet imperil the agreement. Privately some western diplomats wonder whether they should have been more forceful in urging restraint on Luanda, but are letting Africa take the initiative. Southern African leaders who attended the signing are understood to have warned Mr Savimbi that they are prepared to offer military assistance to the MPLA government if they decide he is to blame should the peace process collapse a second time. Nicholas Shaxson adds from Luanda: Both sides in Angola have access to substantial funds should war resume. The government is pumping around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) a year of offshore oil. Unita still controls much of the north-eastern diamond trade, last year worth some Dollars 250m, despite substantial advances by government forces this year. Mr Savimbi has an old ally in President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Angola's northern neighbour. Recent US Republican electoral victories will revive the influence of Unita friends, such as Senator Jesse Helms, incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who formerly encouraged military support for Mr Savimbi. The government has ceded to Unita three second-rate provincial governorships as well as four minor ministries. But key governorships including Luanda, Huambo, Benguela and diamond-rich Lunda Norte, as well as the ministries of defence, interior, economy and petroleum, will remain in MPLA hands.</p>

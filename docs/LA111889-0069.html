			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: CONDO'S ROCK AND SHELL SHOP  </P> <P> Who sells seashells by the seashore? Condo's Rock and Shell Shop, 100 yards  from the shore in Seal Beach, that's who. For the last 40 years, Condo's has  been offering shells from around the world to its customers.  </P> <P> Although it seems odd to sell something that Mother Nature offers free, the  population boom in Southern California, as well as tidal and other factors,  have stripped local beaches of many of the popular shells favored by collectors  and souvenir hunters. A storm may bring an unbroken sand dollar or two, but if  you are looking for starfish, sea horses or other gems from the deep, a retail  store is your best bet.  </P> <P> For the serious collector, Condo's offers rare shells from the Philippines,  Indonesia, Australia and Florida. The most expensive item in the store is a  golden cowrie from India, available for $300, said store manager Cookie Turner.  </P> <P> "Our clientele is split about 50-50 between collectors and souvenir hunters,"  Turner said. "I think it's the fascination with Mother Nature, seeing what  comes out of the ocean," that makes people buy shells, she added.  </P> <P> Jewelry featuring shells is available, with shark-tooth necklaces seeming to be  the big favorite. A shark's jaw featuring a whole set of teeth is available for  someone who wants such a conversation piece in the home.  </P> <P> Condo's also has decorative coral and other marine works. So if you want a  little part of the sea in your home, this is the place.  </P> <P> Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday-Saturday  </P> <P> Address: 125 Main St., Seal Beach  </P> <P> Telephone: (213) 431-3890  </P></p>

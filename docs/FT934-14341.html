			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Owner denies money scheme near collapse MR Ioan Stoica, the owner of a Romanian money multiplying scheme which has sucked in about 3m investors and the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars, yesterday denied reports the scheme was about to collapse, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. 'God has helped us. The circuit is strong and healthy. It will never collapse,' Mr Stoica said. Several thousand people chanted their support for the scheme at a sports stadium in Cluj, the Transylvanian town where the venture is based. Mr Stoica, who was accompanied by Mr Gheorghe Funar, the town's mayor and leader of the Romanian parliament's largest nationalist party, said queues had shortened in recent weeks because he had enlarged his computer system and employed more cashiers. Caritas, the largest of many similar unregulated schemes in post-communist Romania, has become a national obsession since the summer. Then, tens of thousands of Romanians, encouraged by tales of Caritas millionaires and Mr Funar's backing of the scheme, descended on Cluj each week. Mr Stoica, a former bookkeeper, blamed a computer error for the four days when the scheme failed to pay out. His profits from Caritas - believed to exceed Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.4m) - would enable him to set up a bank and a supermarket chain and could give other entrepreneurs similar opportunities, he said. 'I beg you to keep investing because through Caritas we can create a middle class wealthy enough to start real privatisation in Romania.'</p>

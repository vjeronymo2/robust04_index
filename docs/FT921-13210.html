			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Northern Telecom profits up 14% NORTHERN Telecom of Canada boosted 1991 revenues by 21 per cent and earnings by 14 per cent with the help of last March's acquisition of STC, the UK-based telecommunications group. Net earnings reached USDollars 514.9m, or Dollars 2.03 a share, last year, up from USDollars 460.2m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, in 1990. Revenues climbed to Dollars 8.2bn from Dollars 6.8bn. Fourth-quarter income was a record Dollars 208m, ahead from Dollars 187.7m a year earlier. Revenues in the final three months of the year advanced to Dollars 2.3bn from Dollars 1.9bn, and order inflows were also at an all-time high of Dollars 2.31bn, compared with Dollars 1.9bn a year earlier. The group does not break out the precise contribution of STC, whose operations have been totally integrated into the parent company. But STC was the main factor in boosting sales outside North America to just over 20 per cent of total revenues last year, from 13 per cent in 1990. Sales of STC's submarine systems grew especially strongly. Dr Paul Stern, Northern Telecom's chairman, maintained that performance would have improved last year even without STC's contribution. For instance, he said the company posted 'impressive' growth in the US, where STC has no presence, thanks to increased market share. He declined, however, to disclose precise figures. The Dollars 2.6bn takeover of STC was the main factor in pushing up interest charges to Dollars 221m last year from Dollars 80m in 1990. But Dr Stern said the debt to capital ratio had fallen to 33 per cent to 34 per cent, compared with the mid-50s at the time of the STC acquisition. 'We're going to continue to drive it down,' Dr Stern said. He predicted a further improvement in performance this year, except for Canada. The optimism is based on continued international expansion, further growth in US market share, and shipments of the new FiberWorld family of transmission and switching products. Nortel's share price has climbed steeply in the past year. It closed on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 55 3/4 , against its 1991 low of CDollars 30.38.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Airtours Airtours' 2 per cent fall yesterday suggests that the equity market is unimpressed by the outbreak of price wars in the travel industry. It does not yet have any serious reason for worry. The much-hyped price-cutting relates to next year's summer holiday range, whereas the crucial factor for package holiday operators is how far they have to discount late bookings in order to soak up surplus capacity. What matters is how well the current season is going. The indications are that 1994 could be a year in which tour operators prove unusually adept at matching supply with demand. Though 1.5m packages remain unsold, this is a relatively small number given the rate at which holidays have been selling. It looks therefore as though price-cutting is largely a publicity stunt. If so, it is not without risks. Advance selling of next summer's holidays could upset sales of winter holidays, or customers could end up simply too confused to part with any money. But this is a small concern given the broader shape of Airtours' strategy. Having diversified into the Scandinavian market, Airtours has no real need of a head-on confrontation with Thomson in the UK to secure its growth. Its track record suggests it should make a success out of its move into the cruise market, while its carefully-controlled hotel purchases protect it against rising room rates. Given the volatility of earnings in the travel business, Airtours inevitably trades at a discount to the market, but the current prospective discount of around 25 per cent looks unnecessarily low. Having cut its brochure prices, Airtours may have indirectly offered investors a bargain.</p>

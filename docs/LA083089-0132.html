			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DEPUTY NOT FAULTED IN HANDLING 911 CALL OF WOMAN SLAIN MINUTES LATER  </P> <P> Sheriff Sherman Block today said a 911 dispatcher properly handled a call from  a woman who was among four women slain 15 minutes later in an East Los Angeles  birthday party rampage allegedly committed by her estranged husband.  </P> <P> "The dispatcher did, in fact, function properly," Block told a news conference.  "She did not violate any department policies or procedures."  </P> <P> Maria Delia Navarro dialed 911 Sunday night after being warned that her husband  was going to shoot up her 27th birthday party. The dispatcher told her to call  back if the man arrived. About 15 minutes later, Raymond Navarro Jr. allegedly  burst into the converted garage that his estranged wife was renting and began  firing a handgun.  </P> <P> Block said the deputy who took the call is a Latina sensitive to the Eastside  community in which she worked. "We don't find any fault with the way she  proceeded," he said.  </P></p>

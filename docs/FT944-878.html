			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Cheap exports infuriate dairies Milk Marque, the farmers' dairy co-operative, sold cut-price milk to Ireland last week after causing a furore in November when it raised prices in England and Wales by as much as 20 per cent. The exports have caused an outcry in the dairy industry where higher prices forced some companies to close processing plants. Dairies are angry that surplus milk has been made available to Irish cheesemakers at about 3p per litre below the cost of supply on the daily UK wholesale market. 'It is infuriating for companies which are locked into high-priced annual contracts. British consumers are clearly being ripped off by this abuse of monopoly power,' said Mr Neil Davidson, president of the Dairy Industry Federation. Dairies and supermarkets raised consumer prices for milk by between 1p and 2p per pint in response to higher wholesale prices when the Pounds 3.3bn market was deregulated in November. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, said the export sales were required to cope with an emergency breakdown of Unigate's large processing plant at Chard, Somerset, and the annual shutdown of several other plants. The current milk surplus is unusual and is partly caused by the mild weather which encourages cows to produce more milk - farmers are producing 2.6 per cent more than their quotas - and partly by farmers' attempts to cash in on high prices. Mr Dare said supply and demand in the run-up to Christmas were always difficult to forecast. Milk Marque's sales system forced dairy companies to bid for yearly supplies at a range of prices. Some companies' bids were scaled back in November because of a shortage of supply at that time. Milk Marque has also put a reserve price on the spot market for daily wholesale sales to stop prices falling below 22p per litre. Sales to Ireland are understood to have been at 19p per litre.</p>

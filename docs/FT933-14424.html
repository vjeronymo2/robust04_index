			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: PaineWebber advances 30% PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, yesterday reported that second-quarter profits climbed to Dollars 59.3m, up 30 per cent on the Dollars 45.8m earned in the same period a year ago. Revenues in the three months totalled Dollars 686.5m, compared with Dollars 592.1m in the second quarter of 1992. The strong quarter took PaineWebber's half-yearly profits to a record Dollars 130.2m. In the first six months of 1992 it earned Dollars 120.1m. PaineWebber said revenues from its four main areas of business - brokerage commissions, principal transactions, investment banking and asset management  -all rose during the quarter. The biggest contribution, apart from interest income, came from commission revenues, which rose 23 per cent to Dollars 239.9m as investor demand for securities products remained strong. Earnings from principal transactions - the firm's trading for its clients and its own account - climbed 8 per cent to Dollars 182.7m, while investment banking revenues edged 5 per cent higher to Dollars 95.8m. Asset management revenues, meanwhile, rose 19 per cent, to 77.4m as client assets under PaineWebber's control climbed from Dollars 107.4bn a year ago to Dollars 127.8bn. Net interest income rose 19 per cent to Dollars 328.1m. Non-interest expenses were Dollars 589.2m, up sharply from a year earlier because of a big rise in performance-related employee compensation. The results had little impact on PaineWebber's shares, which eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 29 at the close in New York. In spite of the decline, the stock remained close to its 52-week high. Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday announced the appointment of Mr James Cayne, the firm's president, as chief executive. Mr Alan Greenberg, chairman, said the move was a recognition of Mr Cayne's contributions to the company.</p>

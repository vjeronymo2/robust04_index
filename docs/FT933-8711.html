			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie edges into higher territory A BUOYANT London stock market again resisted discomforting news from UK industry yesterday by holding on to its newly-established peak levels - but only just. An early gain of 16.3 on the FT-SE Index largely disappeared as the UK government bond market, reinforcing its influence over the investment scene, fell sharply towards the end of the session. By the close, the FT-SE Index was a mere 3 points up on the day at 3,009.1, albeit a new closing high; a new intra-day peak of 3,022.4 was established early. Once again, the equity sector was strongly influenced by stock index futures. The overseas investment institutions remained active but were highly selective in the UK stock market. Anticipation of a cut in UK base rates remained high, encouraged by firmness in the German stock market on hopes of action by the Bundesbank. The Footsie 100 Index was well-outpaced by the rise of 21.2 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to yet another new peak of 3,451.8. The Mid 250 Index, which covers the range of stocks just below Footsie 100 capitalisation levels, and is the favourite area for private client investment, has gained 4.2 per cent since the beginning of the month, compared with 2.8 per cent on the FT-SE 100 Index. Customer business in equities jumped to Pounds 1.82bn on Wednesday as the Footsie Index soared through the 3,000 barrier. Seaq volume increased yesterday to 908.2m shares from the 830.4m of the previous session. Firmness in UK stock prices contrasted with news of a sharp fall of 2.1 per cent in British manufacturing output in June, another increase in unemployment but a contrasting dip in average earnings. Wednesday brought news of dwindling confidence among British regional businessmen. Share prices opened lower and the mid-morning upturn reflected activity in stock index futures but also the initial gains in the UK gilts market. Falling yields on UK government bonds have become a strongly bullish factor for equities. 'Equities crash the gilt party,' commented the strategy team at NatWest Securities yesterday, adding that it is to the gilt market that we must turn to find an explanation for such an exhilarating equity performance. NatWest Securities expects gilts to outperform equities over the next year or so, with its FT-SE target of 3,300 at end-1994 offering a real return of around 10 per cent over the next fifteen months. Across the full range of the market, hopes for recovery in the domestic economy dominated. Leadership was taken by the building materials and construction groups which have everything to gain both from lower interest rates and from increased economic activity. Financial and store issues, which have outperformed the market over the past six months, came in for some profit-taking pressure. An easier trend in sterling worked in favour of the leading export blue chips, which were also driven at first by demand from across the Atlantic. However, US interest slackened when Wall Street opened the new session more than 20 points down on the Dow Industrial Average. The London stock market benefited from improvement in the pharmaceutical leaders whose poor performance has restrained the Footsie Index in recent months.</p>

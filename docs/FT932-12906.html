			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (4): The challenge of freedom - The opportunities for commercial banks BANK lending rates for mortgages in Portugal have fallen from 24 per cent 18 months ago to as little as 14 per cent today. This boost for home-buyers is just one signal of the new spirit of competition that has taken hold among commercial banks, and of the significant improvement in underlying fundamentals such as inflation that has occurred over the past two years. Released from the straitjacket of government-imposed credit limits and with the process of privatisation in the sector close to completion, banks are operating in a new atmosphere of freedom that is both an opportunity for growth and a challenge to their creativity. Despite the increase in competition and the squeezed margins that result, banks, globally speaking, have fared well in this new environment that brings them closer to the operating conditions of their European counterparts. With a few exceptions, net assets and net profits grew solidly in 1991 and 1992. But 1993 will be a year of bigger challenges. 'This year will be relatively difficult for the banking sector,' says a Portuguese banker. 'First, heavy capital investments were made over the past two years to defend and expand market shares when the sector was fully liberalised in 1993. These investments will have to be amortised. 'Secondly, the banking sector will inevitably reflect the marked deceleration of the economy as a whole.' After two years of strong expansion and diversification of their credit portfolios following the abolition of government credit restrictions, banks will now be challenged to exercise constraint and be far more rigorous in their risk assessment. Credit problems are already growing at a slightly faster rate than credit overall. But banks are not too concerned. One of the advantages of the previous credit ceiling system is that the majority of Portuguese banks are well capitalised. The two or three exceptions are all public with the guarantee of the state behind them and are eventually likely to be financially restructured. A key area of attack for Portuguese banks in the less auspicious climate of 1993 will be costs. Higher financial margins in Portugal compared to the rest of Europe tend to allow a higher ratio of costs, enabling banks to accommodate inefficiencies that would otherwise not be tolerated. With few exceptions, Portuguese banks are much more labour-intensive than their European counterparts and investments in information technology are more recent and often far from complete. Routine operations in a great number of banks are still carried out by hand. 'In an environment of falling margins, the crucial objective is cost control,' says Mr Joaquim Gomes, an analyst with Lisbon-based independent stockbrokers Midas Investimento. 'Only by reducing the number of employees per branch, installing information technology and generally growing lean and mean can you assure a decent return on assets in these conditions.' BCP, a classic success story in many respects, cannot afford to ignore its difficulties on the cost side. A bank that has grown to the size of century-old rivals in less than a decade, now with net assets of Es1,522bn, BCP runs several networks for different sectors of the market and is reputedly a text-book story of achievement studied at Insead, the French based European institute of business administration. 'But when you've been growing at such a pace you're bound to pick up a lot of fat,' says one Lisbon analyst. 'When you take it onto yourself to open 40 branches on the same day, you can't be too careful about costs. BCP could be twice as big as it is now, without massive new investments or massive new recruitment.' Because they operate on a vastly different scale, other banks have grown at a rapid pace without gathering so much fat. In 2 1/2 years, Barclays has grown from three corporate offices in Portugal to a network of 65 retail branches catering to medium- and high-worth customers. 'We have now built up the critical mass to establish a viable project,' says Mr Joao Eduardo Freixa, assistant general manager. The Barclays system is based on margins of below 3.5 per cent, cost-consciousness and a low staff ratio - branches are run by three to five people. The project aims for a medium-term payback but cash flow has been positive since the end of last year. 'The nature of our project is competitive interest rates and low delivery costs to make them possible,' says Mr Freixa. 'I believe that is how the business here is going. The margins of 5 or 6 per cent that some Portuguese banks are working at will not be the margins of the future.' Apart from the major Spanish banks, nearly all of which are aggressively expanding in Portugal, Barclays is one of the few foreign banks in Portugal to take the retail path, and as these have at least a two-year head start, other banks seem unlikely to enter that market. As margins shrink, another avenue that Portuguese banks will have to explore is that of commissions. Banking services in Portugal have largely been free because institutions were earning so much on their margins. Now a lot of services that were free, from cheque books to financial intermediation, will attract charges. Banks will also have to become more expert at cross-selling, according to Mr Gomes. 'It will be crucial for banks to turn what have been just bank clerks into fully-fledged sales people, selling insurance, leasing and other products at the bank counter,' he says. Only in this way will they increase premium income to satisfactory levels and get an adequate return from the financial groups they have been building up.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- External trade by product groups (percentage of total)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Exports           Imports                                      1990  1991  1992*   1990   1991  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Agricultural products and foodstuffs  7.2   7.8   7.5    11.5   13.0 Minerals and fuels                    5.9   4.6   4.5    11.1    9.4 Chemicals, plastics and rubber        6.3   5.8   5.4    11.1   11.2 Wood, cork, paper &amp; pulp products    12.2  11.4  10.7     3.4    3.6 Textiles and clothing                29.4  30.3  29.7    10.1   10.2 Leather and footwear                  8.5   8.9   9.1     2.7    2.4 Non-metallic minerals                 4.1   4.4   4.5     1.2    1.3 Metals and metal products             3.5   3.4   3.6     6.8    6.7 Machinery and electrical material    12.9  13.3  13.9    22.7   22.5 Vehicles and transport equipment      6.8   6.5   7.9    14.2   13.9 Other products                        3.2   3.6   3.2     5.2    5.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *January-October: provisional data  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: National Statistics Institute  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Templeton net assets improve The buoyant state of world stock markets helped Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust increase its net asset value by 38.9 per cent in the six months to end-October. Emerging markets are developing countries where economic growth is expected to be higher, and the prospect for corporate earnings better, than in the developed world. Templeton runs the largest investment trust in the sector. Fully diluted net asset value was 343.57p on October 29, compared with 247.3p on April 30 and 214.23p a year earlier. As is the trust's policy, there is no interim dividend. Mr Mark Mobius, the trust's managing director, said 'Emerging markets have shared in the generalised rise in worldwide share prices over the past year with some markets, such as Turkey and Brazil, showing remarkable rises. We continue to find bargains in a wide range of markets.' The current geographical split of the trust's portfolio is as follows (percentages in brackets): Brazil (17.7), Turkey (16.2), Philippines (11.4), Hong Kong (8.5), Indonesia (6), Portugal (5.9), Greece (5.8), Malaysia (5.7), Mexico (5.3), Singapore (4), South Korea (2.7), Argentina (1.2), Chile (1) and others (3.3). The trust also has 5.3 per cent of its assets in cash.</p>

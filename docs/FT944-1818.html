			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Welsh Yeomen The very Englishness of it all only underlines the irony. Through a thick London fog a beefeater arrives to start the show: a cut-out curtain shaped like the Tower of London rises to reveal the huge red-and-white cross of the English flag draped across the stage. The twist is that the venue is in Wales. While English opera companies seem to have lost interest in Gilbert and Sullivan, Welsh National Opera is taking up the cause instead. This new production of The Yeomen of the Guard is the first G&amp;S in the company's history and - to emphasise the irony further - will be the first ever to be staged at the Royal Opera House, when WNO takes it on tour there next year. The production is also shared with Glimmerglass Opera in the US. All this suggests that WNO is confident about what it has taken on. Opera companies essaying G&amp;S for the first time often find the experience chastening, because they treat it as slapstick and promptly fall flat on their face. The Yeomen of the Guard, in particular, is a comparatively sober entertainment and for that reason resistant to vulgar treatment. In case its producer slipped on a banana skin, WNO wisely took out insurance. The cast includes one G&amp;S veteran, a younger G&amp;S specialist and several of the most experienced stage artists in opera today. Donald Adams made his debut as principal bass with the D'Oyly Carte at the New Theatre, Cardiff, back in 1953, so returning to the theatre 40 years later to play Sergeant Meryll again must bring back memories. He is the consummate professional. After his Ko-Ko in London, Richard Suart has G&amp;S patter on the tip of his tongue (sometimes close to leaving Gareth Jones behind in the pit). His Jack Point in this Yeomen looks crestfallen when he walks on and is crushed into a cowering loser by the end, as always a physically telling portrayal. A melodramatic lighting plan catches Felicity Palmer's face at her entrance, sculpting a skeletal mask for her fearsome Dame Carruthers, but then everything this singer does on stage commands attention. Alwyn Mellor and Neill Archer play naturally together, without too much Edwardian winsomeness, as Elsie Maynard and Colonel Fairfax. Pamela Helen Stephen's Phoebe combines temptress and innocent in one, though her seductive singing gives the temptress the upper hand; the big voice of Donald Maxwell makes his Shadbolt an unusually dominating character. Wherever their personalities come across strongly, Tim Hopkins as the producer must take a share of the credit. The best of his production, designed by Peter J. Davison, comes when the words are allowed to make their points unaided and there are mercifully few unwanted visual gags deforming the script, like red noses planted on Gilbert's portrait. Only the restless choreography gets on one's nerves. The chorus behave like mechanical puppets, but with any luck their batteries will have gone flat before the show reaches London.

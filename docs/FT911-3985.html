			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / SED '91 show aims to revive construction equipment industry 'COLD-SELLING' took on a new meaning in a windswept field near Milton Keynes as the construction equipment industry attempted the unenviable task of digging its way out of the recession. About 200 exhibitors at SED (Site Equipment Demonstration) '91, one of the UK's largest shows for construction equipment, spent three days last week watching their products make large holes in a small corner of rural Buckinghamshire while scouring the landscape for the intoxicating sight of a genuine buyer. Sales in the UK construction equipment market fell about 35 per cent last year because of the recession, and SED, organised by Contract Journal, was a chance for the industry to find out if recent cuts in interest rates had prompted a recovery. There are other shows where the backhoe-loaders, wheeled excavators and countless other types of equipment stand in pristine showroom conditions, but the attraction of SED for contractors and plant hirers is the chance to assess the machines in action. As the excavators, driven by men in shirts and ties, dug ever deeper, watched by men in wellies, the men in blazers on the stands adjusted their metaphors to suit the occasion: 'It looks like we've bottomed out', or 'we've turned the corner', or even 'we're still in the slough of despond'. For JCB, the largest British-owned construction equipment group, January was 'the pits', said Mr Howard McCallum, distribution manager. However, the company was now picking up 'pockets of business which simply could not wait any longer' and was receiving a reasonable level of inquiries at the show, which for many was the first chance to see its new Fastrac high-mobility vehicle (above). No one could accuse the industry of turning up its toes in the current downturn. SED, in its first year on a new site, was the biggest-ever, with 70 new exhibiting companies and 38 new products.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Romiti investigated over party political financing MR CESARE ROMITI, chief executive of the Fiat group, is being formally investigated by Turin magistrates for alleged illicit financing of political parties. He was interrogated for three hours on Wednesday. Mr Romiti was placed on the list of people under investigation for alleged illicit party financing by Milan magistrates at the end of May but has yet to be interrogated by them. Earlier he had offered the full co-operation of Fiat in the matter. The Turin action relates to separate episodes. The magistrates' move follows statements by two prominent local Socialists, Mr Giusy La Ganga, an MP for the city, and Mr Beppe Garesio, a former editor of Avanti], the Socialist party's daily newspaper. The two claim discussions were held in Fiat's Turin headquarters on three occasions between 1988 and 1990 about how the group should help fund the Socialists. Mr Romiti is understood to have denied any discussion of funding the party and said the conversations focused on political and cultural matters. Mr La Ganga has been served with seven separate notices from Turin magistrates that he is under investigation for alleged corruption, and a further two from Milan magistrates. Mr Garesio has already received three separate notices. Last week, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, admitted at the annual meeting that the group had paid a previously undeclared L50bn (Pounds 19m) in kick-backs to politicians over the previous 10 years. Mr Francesco Susini, director-general of the Culture Ministry and for more than a decade the most influential official in the Italian arts world, was yesterday arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of office. His arrest coincided with the arrest of Mr Fernando Pinto on charges of masterminding the October 1991 fire that severely damaged the Bari opera house of which he was the director.</p>

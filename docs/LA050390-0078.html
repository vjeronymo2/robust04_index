			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL TO SELL LAND FOR $4.7 MILLION  </P> <P> San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, which has struggled for a year to improve its  finances, is about to sell a parcel of land that holds parking lots and an old  medical building.  </P> <P> "We hope to sell it and raise money for capital projects," hospital President  John Wilson said Tuesday at a public meeting in San Pedro where he released a  report on the hospital's financial condition.  </P> <P> Wilson said the hospital has accepted a $4.7-million offer for 17 contiguous  lots between 6th and 7th streets. He said the identity of the buyer, a local  individual, would not be released until the deal is closed.  </P> <P> The hospital plans to use the money to improve the facilities of its maternal  and child health programs.  </P> <P> The land sale is part of the hospital's drive to pull itself back from severe  financial difficulty. At the beginning of 1989, it had accumulated losses of $9  million on an annual budget of $85 million. Last year it laid off employees,  cut back costly or money-losing programs and expanded programs that made the  most profit. By the end of 1989, the deficit had been reduced to $1.3 million,  Wilson said.  </P></p>

Katyal] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--India today formally conveyed to  Washington its strong feelings and concern over the U.S.  President, Mr. Bill Clinton's references to Punjab in a letter  to a Democratic Congressman.    The Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, told the acting head  of the U.S. Embassy, Mr. Kenneth Brill, that India could not but  take a serious view of the contents of the letter, which were  unacceptable and were seen as having a negative impact on  bilateral relationship. Some of the points made by the Foreign  Secretary were contained in the official reaction, given through  the Foreign Office spokesman yesterday.    Mr. Brill, it is learnt, wanted India not to take seriously  either the fact of despatch of the letter or its contents. This,  according to him, was part of the job of the public  communications division of the White House, which replied to  letters in the President's name, received from the public.    India, it was clear, read a deeper meaning into the letter  episode.  <H5>  Downplaying issue </H5>   C. Raja Mohan reports from Washington:    The reference to "Sikh rights" in the controversial letter  written by Mr. Clinton does not imply that Washington is seeking  special treatment for Sikhs in India, according to sources in  the State Department. In an attempt to down play the  significance of the letter, administration sources are  suggesting that too much should not be read into it. They argue  that the term "Sikh rights" must be understood as a broad  reference to minority rights enshrined in the Indian  Constitution. They point out that both the Indian and American  Constitutions guarantee in a generic way the rights of all  minorities. The sources assert that the United States does not  support the creation of Khalistan. However, they are not ready  to provide a satisfactory answer to the question why the term  "minority rights" was not used in Mr. Clinton's letter  expressing his desire for a "peaceful solution" in Punjab "that  protests Sikh rights."    The reference to the Indian Constitution and the rights  granted by it appears to be a new formulation to take the sting  off the American intervention in India's internal affairs. In  its earlier clarification on Mr. Clinton's letter to the leading  campaigner here for the secession of Kashmir, Dr. Ghulam Nabi  Fai, the State Department suggested that the administration was  only calling on the Indian Government to respect the human  rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.    The State Department sources suggest that the President is  obliged to respond to the concerns expressed on human rights  issues by Congressmen and the letter should be seen in that  context. They note that Mr. Clinton had referred in his letter  to the improvement of the ground reality in Punjab. They also  suggest that the U.S. Government has repeatedly expressed its  concerns on violations of human rights in Punjab to the Indian  Government.</p>

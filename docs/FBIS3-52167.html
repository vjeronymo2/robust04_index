Sa'id Kamal, the PLO's  ambassador in Cairo, confirmed what Peres said to the effect  that the understandings reached in Cairo were not just Israel's  position, as the Palestinian side -- particularly Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh -- tried to argue. Nevertheless, the PLO stressed,  these were not understandings between the two leaderships.  Whatever the case may be, there is a crisis in the talks with  the PLO and everything would seem to have been reopened. Yasir  'Arafat, a tough negotiator, now rejects the understandings  reached in Cairo and demands much more. [passage omitted]    Over the weekend, Yitzhaq Rabin went to great lengths not to  overturn the tables, and emphasized that he is patient. He and  Shim'on Peres must now make up their minds either to go back to  the Taba talks or to illustrate their disappointment with  'Arafat by initiating a delay in the resumption of the talks.    A few minutes ago the foreign minister told us that the  decision would be made tomorrow and that he is in favor, in  spite of everything, of resuming the talks.    [Begin recording] [Peres] The crisis is over who has more  time. We presented proposals. Everything that is written in  the declaration of principles is acceptable to us. We have not  changed anything or retreated from it, and we will not change or  retreat from it. If the PLO has time, that is all right; we  also have time.    [Sukenik] Could you speculate as to what goes on in  'Arafat's mind when he rejects all the understandings his men  reached with you only a few days ago?    [Peres] He does not reject all of them, but he adds demands  which were not discussed either in the first or second set of  Oslo talks, in Cairo, or Versailles. We announced the  understandings, and they were rejected. 'Arafat should know  that Israel will not retreat from three issues: the Declaration  of Principles, our security needs, and our announcement in the  Knesset; we will fully honor what the prime minister and I  stated in the Knesset. In this context, we tried to be as  considerate as possible of Palestinian feelings. We do not want  to humiliate them, but we will stick to our principles. We will  implement everything we promised, but we will not agree to  anything that harms our security. [end recording]</p>

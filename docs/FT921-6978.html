			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Large pension fund pools show disappointing results LARGE PENSION fund pools performed particularly badly last year, according to Caps, the pension fund performance measurement service. Three of the four largest fund managers - Scottish Widows, Scottish Amicable and Provident Mutual - were below the lower-quartile average of 14.5 per cent. Returns on their discretionary pension funds, representing pools of small pension funds totalling up to Pounds 1bn, were 13.8 per cent, 11.6 per cent and 13.9 per cent respectively. The worst performer was Provident Life, yielding 8.8 per cent. Provident Capitol and Scottish Amicable were second and third from the bottom. In the five years to December National Provident, Guardian Royal Exchange and Scottish Provident turned in the poorest performances. They had returns of 7.1 per cent, 7 per cent and 5.8 per cent respectively. The top performer last year was Lloyds Investment Managers, which earned a 20.5 per cent return on assets. Baillie Gifford and Eagle Star were second and third, with returns of 20.3 per cent and 19.9 per cent respectively. Over five years, the top performers were Britannia Life, Lloyds Investment Managers and National Mutual Life. The funds in each pool include property, fixed income and overseas investments. The survey does not identify clients it just names the fund manager. Pools typically contain funds of small pension funds with no more than Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m in assets. The survey covers 80 separate investment institutions managing total assets of more than Pounds 20bn. According to Caps the average pooled pension fund returned 17.4 per cent - well above the 7.5 per cent rise in average earnings and the 4.5 per cent rise in retail prices. The best-performing sectors last year were the North American market, which returned 34.1 per cent, and the Pacific Basin excluding Japan with 30.1 per cent.

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Smith tries to cool Labour row over lessons of Clinton victory MR JOHN SMITH tried to cool the continuing row in the Labour party over the relevance of Mr Bill Clinton's US election victory by insisting yesterday that no one advocated copying his policies in the UK. But, in a gesture to the so-called modernisers in the party, the Labour leader argued that lessons could be learnt from the Democrats' campaigning style and their head-on critique of a 'totally free market' approach to economic management. Within a few hours, however, senior Labour politicians were again publicly debating the significance of the Clinton campaign, adding to the heated controversy that began last week and continued at a conference with the US president-elect's team in London on Saturday. In a series of interviews on BBC radio, critics of the party's image-makers expressed disquiet that too much was being made of the US campaign. Ms Clare Short MP, a national executive committee member, said individuals were using a Clinton 'myth' to try to ditch long-established values and distance Labour from the unions and the poor. Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader, added that while he believed the Clinton campaign had important lessons, those who sought to abandon Labour's goal of more social equality should join the Liberal Democrats or progressive Tories. Earlier, Mr Smith had used his first major public appearance of the new year to give some clues about how far he was ready to embrace reform. In a wide-ranging BBC interview, he indicated that he would push for the substitution of the trade unions' block vote at the annual party conference with an alternative that gives union delegates a role as individuals. Repeating an earlier commitment to base Labour's internal democracy on the principle of one member, one vote, he said:'We must complete the process of modernising our constitution by the conference of this year.' He brushed aside a suggestion that Labour should abandon Clause IV of its constitution  -the controversial commitment to state control  - as unimportant. He also refused to be drawn on whether he supported electoral reform for the Commons. That would be left to the conference to discuss after the review committee, chaired by Lord Plant, had reported its recommendations to the national executive, he said. On the economy, the Labour leader said he opposed any moves to increase taxes in the Budget, adding that the government's top priority should be to tackle rising unemployment.

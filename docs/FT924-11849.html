			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Castle Comms doubles to Pounds 1.36m Castle Communications, the USM-quoted video and audio group, almost doubled pre-tax profits for the year to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 38.2m to Pounds 31.6m as a result of recession and closure of unprofitable activities. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.36m, against Pounds 782,000. The latter figure was restated to reflect the change to a more conservative accounting policy towards origination costs of items such as sleeve design and artwork. Profits this time were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 351,000 against the fall in value of freehold properties. The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest costs of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.44m) and an increased contribution from an associate of Pounds 144,000 (Pounds 55,000). Earnings per share came out at 10.4p (8p). An unchanged final dividend of 4.5p is recommended for a maintained total of 8.5p.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Brazilian markets hit by corruption claims NEW allegations of corruption in Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello's government set off another sharp drop in the country's stock markets yesterday, agencies report from Sao Paulo. The Sao Paulo stock market fell 3.9 per cent - after losing 6.8 per cent on Monday - as the controversy undermined confidence in the government. New evidence purportedly linked Mr Collor to a confidant under congressional investigation for alleged corruption. The latest development in the affair was triggered after the central bank turned over thousands of cancelled cheques on Monday to a congressional panel investigating the corruption claims. The president and a former aide, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, have since May battled corruption charges, initially set off by allegations from a brother of Mr Collor. The panel is probing claims that President Collor profited from an operation allegedly run by Mr Farias.</p>

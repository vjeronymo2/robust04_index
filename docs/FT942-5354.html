			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Books: A haunting memoir - J D F Jones on a real talent DAISY BATES IN THE DESERT by Julia Blackburn Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 15.99, 232 pages At the start, it appears that Julia Blackburn has done it again - by which I mean that she has repeated the feat, and the approach, of her remarkable previous book, The Emperor's Last Island. But after the first chapters of Daisy Bates in the Desert, it is evident that this is a development, a pushing-forward, of a real talent. The Emperor's Last Island was 'about' St Helena, the author's visit, and the last days of Napoleon. It was a blend of travel, imagination, biography, autobiography, whisked together by a beautiful prose stylist to produce - hard to convey the flavour - a haunting and rhapsodical memoir: booksellers found it hard to decide in which section to display her wares. It has now been reissued in paperback (Mandarin, Pounds 5.99) to coincide with Ms Blackburn's new book, in which, this time, the proportions have changed a little - this is more 'biography' than 'travel', more imagination than history. Daisy Bates was an eccentric old lady of Irish extraction who spent most of her long life in a tent in the South Australian sands promoting the cause of the wretched native population. She published The Passing of the Aborigines (1938 and 1966), received a CBE, died in 1951, and is certainly not an unknown figure, quite apart from the fact that she was briefly married to Breaker Morant, the fantasist and adventurer who was court-martialled and shot in the Anglo-Boer War. Julia Blackburn in her St Helena book developed the trick of picking on an autobiographical memory, describing it briefly, and then using it to pole-vault into her main subject. She does it again (and again) here - 'I first heard of Daisy Bates about 25 years ago when I was on the edge of my adult life: back straight, waist narrow, jaws always aching because I clenched my teeth in fear or perhaps in rage. I had established a curious relationship with a woman called Edith Young . . . She had learnt about Daisy Bates, the only interesting person with a white skin who had ever lived in the entire (Australian) continent as far as she was concerned . . .'You must write a book about her,' she said . . .' Soon the author is creeping up on her unlikely target: 'I'll give her a dream from her childhood which is a dream that I used to have when I was a child . . .'. And then, after intense empathy and research, the break-out from the St Helena mode as Blackburn discovers she feels able to become her subject: 'I am Daisy Bates in the desert, stretched out on the floor of my tent, surrounded by the intense heart and dryness that has not let go for months, or is it years . . .' There follow 120 pages which purport, successfully, to describe Daisy Bates' own story of her years in the desert - acceptance by the Aborigines, the years in Ooldea astride the main railway line, with all its corrupting impact on the locals, the onset of frailty and age, the angry retreat. And then Ms Blackburn returns, intrudes, inserts herself back into the story, for the last years. This is a fascinating exercise. Part of the quest is the unravelling of a mystery, because Daisy Bates was a liar who told whopping stories about her grand Anglo-Irish Protestant background (she was a Catholic orphan), her meeting with Queen Victoria (she travelled Down Under as a penniless free migrant, soon to be a bigamist), and so on. As the author observes, 'Some of what she says is true but a great deal of it is not and it is such an odd process trying to separate the person who she was from the person she would have liked to be, pulling the two apart and untangling their embrace.' But Julia Blackburn is concerned for a mythical rather than a literal truth about Daisy Bates. There will be comparisons with Bruce Chatwin's Songlines, but I do not think that means much. I suggest to booksellers that Daisy Bates in the Desert should be stocked, in substantial numbers, either under 'Biography', or 'Travel', or, best of all, under 'Fiction'.</p>

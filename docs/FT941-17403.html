			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / In search of lasting cure for ailing health systems / Review of the problems and reforms in care regimes across the world's wealthier countries Across the advanced capitalist economies, governments are struggling to control the rising costs of healthcare. Average health expenditure in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has risen from 3.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 1960 to 7.8 per cent in 1990. The main drivers of medical cost inflation over this period have been three-fold, according to the OECD: The extension of healthcare to whole populations with the provision of universal coverage. The increasing generosity of healthcare systems, which expanded to include dental benefits, recuperative treatment and new medical techniques such as grafting and transplants. Rising costs, such as the salaries of doctors and nurses. There are, of course, considerable variations between the experience of different countries. Growth in healthcare costs have been much higher than average over this period in the US, and lower than average in the UK. But overall, there is a close relationship between a country's health expenditure per capita and overall income per capita. Healthcare is a merit good, in economists' terms: as people become wealthier, they wish to spend more on health. The good news for policymakers is that there is growing evidence that the growth in healthcare costs can be contained. Reforms in several European countries appear to have been successful in improving the quality of healthcare while controlling costs. More interesting, the means adopted to achieve this have been very similar, despite considerable differences between the health systems in these countries. The key to containing healthcare costs appears to lie in what health economists describe as 'managed competition'. This aims to introduce market-type incentives to raise efficiency, through greater competition among hospitals, doctors and other health organisations. At the same time, health remains largely publicly funded, allowing the government to regulate competition to ensure equity among all citizens. Typical features of managed competition include: Separating the financing of healthcare from delivery - the 'purchaser/provider split' at the centre of the UK health reforms. Strengthening the role of family doctors in controlling access to treatment in hospitals and in providing more treatment without involving hospitals - an important tool in rationing healthcare in President Bill Clinton's plans for US healthcare reform. Contracts for the provision of healthcare rather than paying fees for each service, which leads to 'over-treatment' - Germany and France have both moved towards this. Many countries are looking to provide greater incentives for efficiency in their health services, especially where treatment is currently free at the point of use. Payments by patients, for example, are on the agenda in countries such as the US to encourage them to behave more like consumers in balancing demand against cost. In the Netherlands, the current reform plans will offer citizens a choice of insurance funds, all offering a basic healthcare package but charging different premiums according to the quality of service and additional benefits. Even if the delivery of healthcare becomes more efficient, however, upward pressure on costs will remain a daunting challenge. Medical technology is expensive, but a more basic explanation for rising health costs is demographic change. The proportion of elderly people in the populations of advanced industrial nations is increasing, and the old have insatiably greater healthcare requirements than the young and middle-aged. It is not a picture of unrelieved gloom - elderly people in advanced countries are becoming fitter - but the demands of an ageing population will nonetheless present healthcare systems with severe spending pressures until well into the next century. Apart from trying to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems, governments are responding to rising costs and demand in two ways. One is by encouraging healthier lifestyles on the lines of the World Health Organisation's Health for All strategy and the UK's Health of the Nation campaign. If people can be encouraged to reduce health risks by stopping smoking, adopting healthier diets and taking exercise, the potential financial savings for healthcare systems will be considerable. The more controversial of the two responses is the introduction of rationing for treatment. Healthcare has always been rationed - by waiting list, lack of access to medical insurance, doctors' decisions in individual cases, and other ways - but the financial pressures of recent years have led to the issue being approached more explicitly. Health authorities in parts of the world have involved the public in rationing decisions, most notably in Oregon state in the US, which has developed proposals to withdraw funding for some medical procedures under its Medicaid programme for those on modest incomes. An 11-member commission ranked treatments in priority order according to doctors' opinions of their medical value and public opinion surveys. This produced a list of 688 procedures of which, the state decided, it could afford to fund only the top-ranked 568. Some expensive operations including liver transplants were excluded, alongside cosmetic treatments and fertility and obesity counselling. Introduction of the plan was vetoed by the Bush administration after complaints that it infringed the rights of disabled people, but the Clinton government approved an amended version last year. Authorities in Oregon hope to introduce the scheme - which would bring poor people within the cover of Medicaid - this year although it still faces the possibility of legal challenge. Most governments are unenthusiastic about having such a clear set of excluded treatments, but the purchaser-provider splits introduced by organisational reforms in the UK, New Zealand and elsewhere are pushing policy in this direction. Health authorities must now make explicit decisions about spending priorities, and some have begun testing public opinion through surveys and meetings. Doctors have questioned the value of treating, for example, lung cancer victims who refuse to give up smoking, or performing expensive operations on the very elderly. Many governments have commissioned analyses relating the cost of treatment to improvements in the quality of life. The decisions are moral as well as financial, and many people would prefer that they did not have to be made. But they are being made, and involving the public in them is likely to prove an important element in the development of democracy. This is the 11th article on welfare states around the world.

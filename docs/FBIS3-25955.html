			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press conference given by Wu Yi, minister of the Ministry </F> Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, MOFTEC, and Liu Shaizai,  assistant minsiter of foreign economic trade and cooperation,  with unidentified Chinese and foreign correspondents at the  State Council's Information Office on 28 January]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (XINHUA) -- [Correspondent] What  are the major contents of China's next-phase reform of its  foreign trade system?    [Wu Yi] To deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, it  is necessary to uphold a unified policy, liberalize operations,  compete on an equal footing, take responsibility for one's own  profits and losses, and integrate industry and trade as well as  the agency system. The goal in carrying out reform is the  establishment of a foreign trade operating mechanism suited to  the rules and customs common in international economic  activities. The main contents of our next stage of deepening  the reform of the foreign trade system are as follows: first,  we will further improve the overall administration of foreign  trade. The state will mainly make use of such economic means as  exchange rates, taxation, and credit to regulate foreign trade  activities. Second, we will deepen the reform of foreign trade  enterprises and reorganize state-owned foreign trade enterprises  in accordance with the system of modern enterprises. We will  explore a new path for "large economic and trade operations"  characterized by the integration of trade and industry with  trade and agriculture, with trade and technology, and with trade  and commerce, as well as the integration of foreign trade with  foreign capital and foreign economic activities; we will speed  up the process of granting the right to handle foreign trade to  manufacturing enterprises, science and technology units, and  some commercial and materials supply enterprises which are  imbued with the necessary conditions to do so. Third, we will  establish a sound foreign trade coordinated service mechanism in  order to give full play by associations of import-export  businesses to providing coordinated services. Fourth, we will  maintain a unified foreign trade policy and system, and will  increase the degree of transparency in this regard.    [Correspondent] China is undertaking a major reform of its  foreign exchange system this year. What impact will this have  on the development of its foreign trade?    [Liu Shaizai] Reform of the foreign exchange system is  critical to further deepening the reform of the foreign trade  system. It will play a very important role in expanding  import-export trade because it will create a favorable  environment for all types of export enterprises to compete on an  equal footing; will speed up the transformation of the operating  mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises; and will more  effectively enhance the function of exchange rates in regulating  foreign trade. This reform will bring our country's foreign  exchange and foreign trade systems closer to the requirements of  a socialist market economic structure, will help the  establishment of an operation mechanism suited to the rules and  customs common in international economic activities, and will  play a positive role in restoring our country's status as a  contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    [Correspondent] It has been learned the China Import-Export  Credit Bank went into operation on 1 January this year. What is  the status of this bank in the new foreign trade structure, and  what are its major functions?    [Liu Shanzai] The Import-Export Credit Bank is the product  of the reform of our country's monetary and foreign trade  system. It is a policy-lending monetary institution whose main  function is to provide loans to support the export of China's  capital goods. With further expansion of its business, the bank  will play an important role in the development of China's  foreign trade and in linking China's foreign trade with the  standards of international trade.    [Correspondent] How will China reduce its trade deficit?    [Wu Yi] The basic principle of China's foreign trade is to  maintain a rough balance between imports and exports. Last year  our country suffered a $1.218 billion deficit in foreign trade.  To deal with this situation, we intend to achieve a balance by  actively expanding exports rather than reducing imports. The  purpose of our country's exports is the importation of advanced  technology and equipment needed for China's modernization drive  as well as the importation of goods which are in short supply in  the domestic market. As 80 percent of China's foreign exchange  income comes from exports, if we fail to turn around the  situation in which deficits are caused by the slow growth of  exports, our foreign exchange income is bound to decline, and  imports will also be affected. I hope our trade partners will  increase imports of Chinese products so as to maintain a  coordinated development of bilateral trade.    [Correspondent] Will the question of intellectual property  rights become an obstacle to the development of Sino-U.S.  economic and trade relations?    [Wu Yi] China and the United States concluded a memorandum  of understanding on 16 January 1992. The Chinese Government has  earnestly carried out its promise. This has been acknowledged  by the United States. The level of protection of intellectual  property rights in China surpasses the average level of  protection of intellectual property rights throughout the world.  However, as China is a vast country with a huge population,  protection of intellectual property rights has been undertaken  unevenly in various localities. We will begin with education to  enhance people's awareness regarding intellectual property  rights, and will propose that intellectual property rights  courts be established in some key cities. Whether they are  Chinese or foreigners, if they have clear evidence to prove  their intellectual property rights have been infringed upon,  they may file a law suit with the court. Regrettably, the U.S.  Government does not comprehend nor understand the positive  method of protecting intellectual property rights which China  has adopted, and it is unwise for the U.S. Government to attempt  applying pressure.    [Correspondent] What is the current state of Sino-British  economic and trade relations, and what are their future  prospects?    [Wu Yi] As a whole, Sino-British economic and trade  relations are not bad, and there is great potential for  development. However, it is hard to say whether the  uncooperative attitude adopted by the British Government  regarding Hong Kong will affect bilateral economic and trade  relations. This is what China does not want to see, but the  responsibility rests entirely with the British.    [Correspondent] In order to link up with the world  economically, what new laws and regulations will China enact on  economic and trade relations with foreign countries?    [Wu Yi] With the deepening of the reform of China's foreign  economic relations and trade system, and the progress of the  negotiations on the restoration of China's status as a  contracting party to GATT, China is changing its mode of  administering foreign economic relations and trade, switching  from a reliance mainly on administrative means to a reliance on  legal and economic means. For this purpose, China will enact a  number of laws and regulations on foreign economic relations and  trade, the most important of which is the "Foreign Trade Law."  The draft of this law has been submitted for examination by the  State Council to the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress. China will adopt some methods currently practiced by  the world community to protect domestic industries. We are  drafting the "Anti-Dumping Regulations," the "Anti-Subsidies  Regulations," and the "Regulations on Safeguard Measures."  These three regulations are expected to be submitted to State  Council for examination in the near future. In addition, we  have started drafting other supporting regulations, such as the  "Regulations Governing the Examination and Approval of Foreign  Trade Enterprises" and the "Regulations Governing Import-Export  Chambers of Commerce," both of which are related to the "Foreign  Trade Law."</p>

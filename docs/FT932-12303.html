			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: Cahora Bassa to supply power to S Africa CAHORA BASSA, the Zambesi dam in north-west Mozambique which supplied electricity to South Africa in the 1970s, aims to export its hydroelectric power there again, and to neighbouring Zimbabwe, within three years. The link with the South African grid was destroyed during the long civil war in Mozambique. However, work on restoring it is now expected to start within about six months, according to Mr Manuel Lopez de Costa, Portuguese ambassador in Maputo. He was speaking after a two-day meeting of the tripartite Cahora Bassa permanent commission, which comprises Mozambique, Portugal and South Africa. He put the cost at Dollars 125m (Pounds 81m), of which Dollars 50m would be provided by South Africa. Portugal and Italy would also contribute to the project. It was hoped the line would be functioning again by 1996. Work on rebuilding the 1,800 pylons along 300km of line destroyed during the war could provide employment for hundreds of unskilled workers, including soldiers demobbed from government Frelimo and rebel Renamo forces. The Mozambique and Zimbabwe electricity authorities have also issued three invitations to tender for contracts to build a high-voltage line between Cahora Bassa and the Zimbabwe grid. The first is for the extension of electricity substations at Bindura and Doma, near Mhangura in northeast Zimbabwe, and the second is for the extension of Songo substation in Mozambique. The third is for the construction of a single high-voltage line linking the three substations. Bids must be submitted by mid-June. France is reported to have offered to finance 20 per cent of the estimated Dollars 140m cost, with Scandinavia, Italy and the European Investment Bank also providing funds.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke Gratifying though the improvement in Ladbroke's disclosure is, it obviously has not improved enough. Otherwise the market would have been less confused by the disconcerting news on credit betting in yesterday's trading statement. At first glance, the 8 per cent fall in the shares suggests a need to reassess the quality of Ladbroke's earnings from betting. If a few high spenders can more than wipe out the increase in profits from retail betting during the first four months of a year - when the Grand National actually ran - then perhaps the earnings stream is not worth so much after all. Crockfords, which has a concentration of big spending customers, trades on a historic multiple of less than 10. Even after yesterday's fall Ladbroke's multiple is in the mid-20s. It would help if Ladbroke were to break down the contribution from credit betting to its operating profits. The danger is that investors will conclude that it is bigger than it really is. It seems unlikely that credit betting normally contributes more than 10 per cent. If so, it is big enough to produce the occasional short-term glitch, which is only conspicuous now because progress elsewhere, in hotels for example, remains pedestrian. That does not warrant a wholesale re-rating of the shares. Rather it is the realisation that Ladbroke's new management cannot transform the company overnight which ought to justify yesterday's sharp correction. The shares are now back where they were in early May. The run they had enjoyed looked odd for a company whose newly-cut dividend is still barely covered by adjusted earnings.</p>

Major thefts were perpetrated by  Zhang Wu, Zhao Waixin, and Wang Sheng, who used to be laborers  at the Communist Youth farm of Baotou city's suburban district.  From October 1992 to February 1993, they successively hired  small four-wheeled tractors to steal 53.23 tons of steel  products, such as square steel and skelp, from the seamless  steel tube plant under Baotou Iron and Steel Company. The value  of these stolen goods totaled 114,600 yuan. They earned more  than 87,990 yuan from selling the stolen goods.    Deng Cunyun, Yao Guangli, and Li Aijun, identified as  robbers  and murderers, ganged up with one another in Datong of Shanxi  Province. They took a taxi run by with a driver near the No. 3  hospital of Datong city on 29 April 1993. They caught the  driver off guard, strangled him with a nylon rope, killed him,  and robbed him of 1,550 yuan in cash and other items. They also  pushed the taxi with the corpse inside into a hole, poured  petroleum on it, and burned it down. On 26 September, they fled  to Baotou city. They murdered a taxi driver in front of Golden  Eagle Hotel at the city's Kun District. They robbed the taxi  driver 150 yuan in cash and some other items. They threw the  corpse in a fruit garden and ran away.    The Baotou city intermediate court sentenced them to death  after the first ruling. The second ruling by the regional  higher court dismissed the appeals filed by the defendants and  upheld the decision of the original trial. Zhang Wu, Zhao  Waixin, Wang Sheng Deng Cunjun, and Yao Guangli were executed on  the morning of 17 January.</p>

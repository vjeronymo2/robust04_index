			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Cosea, minister of economic </F> coordination, strategy, and reform, by Gheorghe Cercelescu;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Cercelescu] Mr. Minister, the government has  finally decided to accelerate the process of privatization,  which in Romania has been lagging behind quite a bit. What has  led to the abandonment of the temporizing policy practiced thus  far?    [Cosea] Both the slow pace and the shortcomings to date in  the privatization process have obviously influenced our  decision. But what made us act now was the desire not to let  the opportunities of the moment go unused. We have reached a  stage whereby we managed to score some results in the overall  stabilization of the economy, thanks to certain monetary  measures. However, these results are very fragile and their  consolidation cannot be ensured without key actions in the real  economy.    In our opinion, the most important measure in this respect  is  the privatization, which will lead to changes not only in the  form of ownership, but also in the structure of the economy,  primarily industry. Without such a change, we cannot relaunch  production on sound bases. We also took into consideration the  fact that the acceleration of the privatization process will  consolidate the progress already made and will also help us make  further headway. Through such an action we leave out a good  part of the state sector -- which is a frenetic user of public  moneys -- from the 1995 budget. The results thus obtained will  allow us to direct our attention to other sectors of the reform  -- such as education, health, and culture -- which we have  failed to tackle so far because of the lack of financial means.    [Cercelescu] How is the mechanism for speeding up  privatization conceived?    [Cosea] Our program relies on two pillars, namely involving  the population in the process of privatization of the  enterprises through ownership certificates and large-scale  privatization. More than two years ago, the people received 30  percent of the state's assets free of charge, but only on paper.  Now, the holders of these certificates are going to change them  into shares and thus effectively become owners of the respective  enterprises. Some 3,000 trade companies will be privatized in  1994. They will be presented to the public not only nominally,  but also through a "visit card," which we will issue in order to  enable everybody to form an opinion about each and every  enterprise. Therefore, the citizens will be able to acquaint  themselves with the social capital value of the respective  enterprise, its business turnover in the past three years, its  export activity, its main field of activity, the nominal value  of a share, the overall number of shares, and the profit levels  as a function of the business figures and social capital of that  enterprise.    The citizens have 30 days to choose their preferred  enterprises. Their choice will be written down in a printed  option form, which will be directly sent to the respective  company. The active personnel and the pensioners of the  respective enterprise have priority at the exchange of  certificates for shares. The shares will not be printed on  paper, but we will use -- as everywhere else in the market  economies -- dematerialized shares, that is computer-registered  shares. However, the people who have exchanged their  certificates for the shares will receive a written document  attesting to the fact that they are shareholders.    In this connection, I would like to make the following  clarification: The exchange of certificates for 30 percent of a  given enterprise's shares will not bring money to the respective  enterprise. The only way in which the privatized enterprises  can acquire further capital is by selling the rest of the 70  percent of their shares, which thus becomes part of the  large-scale privatization -- whereby the employees and  pensioners of the respective enterprises again enjoy priority in  the acquisition of shares.    [Cercelescu] Certain developments have taken place between  the time when the people received these ownership certificates  and the time of their utilization, something which has  substantially influenced both their value and distribution. How  will these abnormal situations be solved?    [Cosea] The most delicate problem is that of the value of  these certificates. We now have two values: The value given by  the nonorganized market, which is between 10,000 and 15,000 lei  for each certificate, and the value given by the Private  Property Fund [FPP], which is in excess of 170,000 lei. In both  cases, the value is underestimated. This can be easily proved.  For example, if we just take the 170,000 lei value of the  certificate, the total number of certificates does not cover the  30 percent of the social capital, but much less -- according to  certain calculations, it only covers 8-9 percent of it. We have  a very simple method to calculate the value of a certificate as  closely as possible to the current situation prevailing in the  economy: We divide the 30 percent value of the social capital  as it was on 31 December 1993 by the overall number of  certificates issued. We will thus obtain a much higher value  than is the case now and, what is more, it will be the same for  everybody.    As a matter of fact, the acceleration of the privatization  process will be achieved by granting equal changes to everybody,  from the very beginning, in the most open way possible. This is  what we had in mind when we established the principle of one  certificate per person and enterprise. There have been many  social complaints about the inequalities created by the  concentration of an important number of certificates in the  hands of certain persons or legal entities. In order to reduce  inequalities, at least in the current stage of the process, a  citizen can only choose one certificate per enterprise. If he  has more certificates, he can go to other companies, but also  with a single certificate, something which will disperse his  capital.    [Cercelescu] Some of the enterprises put out for  privatization will be very profitable and most of the people  will be attracted to them, rather than go to the other ones.  What will happen if the exchange options exceed the 30 percent  free-of-charge part?    [Cosea] At the enterprise level, one will be able to go up  to 50 percent of the social capital, following that the State  Property Fund [FPS] and the FPP should agree on mutual  compensations, so as to maintain the proportion of 30 to 70  percent in the overall economy. I would like to add that there  are also other ways of utilizing the ownership certificates.  One is to entrust them to the FPP, which will administer them  and pay dividends. Another possibility is to negotiate the  certificates on the bonds market, which will appear concurrently  with the start of the action of changing the certificates into  shares. On such a market, the certificates can be sold or  bought at prices fixed by the offer and demand. At the same  time, one should take into consideration a possible second wave  of privatizations scheduled for the start of next year -- on the  basis of the same procedure -- when further enterprises will be  privatized, as well as those enterprises left untouched by the  first wave. Until then, the list of the 3,000 enterprises  scheduled to be privatized in the first wave will be finalized  in June; the media will disseminate the action throughout July;  the offer will come out in August; and the exchange of the  ownership certificates will begin on 1 September. We hope that  a good part of the economy will be privatized by the end of the  year, so as to be able to proceed more rapidly along the road of  reform.</p>

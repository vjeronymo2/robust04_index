			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Convergence criteria on public debt to act as safeguard The convergence criteria on public debt agreed as part of the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union will act as a safeguard should markets fail to respond to budgetary excess, according to Mr Chris Boyd, a member of the cabinet of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, writes David Goodhart, Labour Editor. In a paper to the Trades Union Congress in London which seeks to rebut the claim that the convergence criteria are deflationary, he states: 'The criteria may act as a safeguard should the markets, whose judgment is not always perfect, fail to recognise the signs of budgetary excess.' The public debt criteria of the Maastricht treaty set 'reference values' of 60 per cent of GDP for public debt and 3 per cent of GDP for annual public deficits.</p>

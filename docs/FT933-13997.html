			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Management: Jobs for the men - Male inroads into areas dominated by women may be easing unemployment Chuck Savoy, a male secretary in his 40s, may represent the new asexual face of the British labour market. Savoy, who has been temping for Manpower for six years, is still an oddity in the female-dominated secretarial world. But a lot of his male friends who thought they had jobs for life are now unemployed, while Savoy has worked throughout the recession. With male unemployment close to 14 per cent and female unemployment at 5.5 per cent, and most of the new jobs being created in sectors traditionally dominated by women, men could increasingly be forced to compete on women's terrain in the jobs market. Indeed some labour market analysts attribute the earlier than expected fall in unemployment to the fact that men are already starting to abandon their reluctance to take up lower paid, 'female', service-sector work. The theory is that in the early 1980s recession there was a double mismatch of geography and sex: male, heavy industrial jobs, were being lost in the old industrial regions, while female, service sector and light industrial jobs, were being created in the south-east. The more even spread of unemployment in the early 1990s recession has meant that there is less of a geographical mismatch between the old jobs and the new, and changing attitudes among men have alleviated the sex mismatch. There is no hard evidence for such a change of attitude, yet there is also little more than circumstantial evidence for the original assumption that men are excluded, or are excluding themselves, from the new jobs. Some facts are, however, clear. Already nine counties and two Scottish regions have more female than male employees, including traditional industrial areas such as Mid Glamorgan. Recent figures from the Equal Opportunities Commission revealed that 40 per cent of complaints now come from men fighting employer assumptions about the female nature of certain jobs. Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, says: 'It can be very difficult to avoid a kind of discrimination in favour of women.,' In Northern Foods, he says, the male/female balance has shifted from about 65 per cent male to 35 per cent female 10 years ago to 50:50 now. 'Food industry jobs used to require physical strength but a lot of them have now been replaced by light industrial production-line jobs requiring dexterity not strength. Women are usually better at those jobs - you sometimes do see young men surrounded by women on a production line but they look awkward and out of place,' he explains. The Timex dispute appeared to underscore how women have become the dominant group in the UK labour market, at least for unskilled and semi-skilled work. Of the workforce that went on strike to defend its pay and conditions, about 80 per cent were women and the workers who crossed the picket line to undermine those terms and conditions were almost all men. The growth of female preference may not just have been employer led. Alison Scott, a senior lecturer at Essex University, who is writing a book on male/female segregation based on a study of 6,000 people, says: 'Female jobs have low status and as such can be an affront to the male sexual identity. Many would prefer to be unemployed than sell cosmetics in a department store.' Peter Ashby, of Full Employment UK, believes that male reluctance to take female jobs has more to do with money than psychology. If a man is a main bread-winner it is often not financially worthwhile to take a low-paying or part-time job. Alison Scott agrees that the poverty trap is a critical factor. 'A retailing job is probably paying about Pounds 3.20 an hour, which for a 35-hour week comes out at Pounds 112 - hardly a breadwinner's wage.' Some of the ideas currently coming out of Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-funded training and enterprise programmes, are trying to grapple with this problem. Aztec, a Tec in South London, has for example got government funding for a pilot project for what it calls 'portfolio working', which will subsidise individuals seeking to take up two or more part-time jobs. The nature of some of the new jobs may also be helping to break down male/female segregation. Lilian Bennett, who chairs Manpower UK, the largest private sector employment agency in the UK, says that a lot of the new clerical jobs - such as data processing and data entry - are sexless in nature. And Savoy thinks that PCs are starting to de-sexualise secretarial jobs by bringing in a 'male' technology dimension. Susan Cooper, joint managing director of the Mari Group, a private-sector training and information technology group based in Tyneside, agrees. About 50 per cent of trainees on Mari's clerical and computing courses are men, a proportion which she says has increased over the years. Men, she says, are accepting jobs as secretaries and receptionists but feel more comfortable with jobs called computer operator or technician. 'A secretary now is often the information technology manager, and men feel OK with that.' She believes that men's slowness in entering clerical jobs is due partly to their reluctance and partly to that of employers. 'The women on the courses get jobs first.' As regards personnel problems, she says: 'Once the initial step has been taken, employers are surprised at how well things work out. Men do not appear embarrassed to do a job such as receptionist in our company.' The main problem, she says, 'was lack of verbal communication skills, particularly on the telephone'. On pay she says: 'We re-trained a lot of shipworkers from Wearside in clerical and desk-top publishing skills. They were only earning Pounds 7,000 a year, so they were already low-waged.' Some labour market analysts believe the way to make it possible for more men to take female jobs is to establish a 'critical mass' of men in the relevant jobs, mirroring the way that women have broken into areas of traditional male employment. That may take a long time in some sectors. In nursing, the proportion of men has hovered around 10 per cent since 1945, according to Christine Hancock, head of the Royal College of Nursing, and shows no signs of rising.</p>

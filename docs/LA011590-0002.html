			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POPE HAS THE FLU -- AND SENSE OF HUMOR  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II on Sunday said he has the flu, but the wave of influenza that  began sweeping Italy in December has not affected his sense of humor.  </P> <P> During his ritual Sunday afternoon visit to a Rome parish in his role as bishop  of Rome, the Pope joked about his apparently mild illness when he met a group  of converting Catholics and their children, the Italian news agency ANSA  reported.  </P> <P> "Perhaps you're surprised by the fact that the Pope, even though he's a step  away from the children, doesn't hug and kiss them," John Paul said, according  to ANSA."He was about to do so, but then he thought that he has a virus, and  since there's enough influenza going around, there isn't reason to add more."  </P></p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (2): From China to Mexico - Explorers target new and old territories The Tarim basin in northwest China, the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan are among the exotic locations which have drawn the attention of the world's oil and gas companies during the past year as they seek to secure new reserves for the 21st century. They and dozens of other remote areas figure prominently in the 'frontier strategies' under which a growing number of companies are ranging beyond their traditional operating areas. But the focus on trying to find very large oil and gas fields in frontier areas has diverted attention from a surge of renewed interest in mature regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Advances in both exploration and production technology combined with the desire to maximise the heavy investment in the infrastructure of such areas is driving the trend. It has been most evident in the past year in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil production began more than 40 years ago. Exploration of the area dropped sharply in the late 1980s as some of the bigger companies began to look abroad for new reserves. But buoyant US natural gas prices have attracted a large number of independent companies to the region. Their success rate has been enhanced by their ability to gain relatively cheap access to three-dimensional seismic data. This technique, combined with the much greater power of the latest generation of computers, has enabled geologists to 'see' through structures such as salt domes. These structures had blocked views derived from the earlier two-dimensional seismic techniques. The new seismic technology has also helped in the discovery of smaller satellite fields close to existing platforms. Many of these can then be tapped by horizontal drilling from an existing platform. The technique can reach reservoirs as far away as 6km, eliminating in many cases the need and cost of building a new platform. Other new technology, such as tension leg platforms, is allowing companies to move into deeper water. The Mars field, described by Shell and British Petroleum as the largest discovery in the Gulf of Mexico for the past 20 years, lies in 2,933 feet of water. Technology has also played a key role in maintaining production in the North Sea where early fields such as Ekofisk, off Norway, and Brent and Forties in the UK are being re-engineered to prolong their production life. The re-engineering of the Brent field, the UK's largest oil producer, by Shell and Esso, includes a shift in emphasis to gas production. The work, which will cost Pounds 1.3bn and take five years to complete, will add 10 years to the field's production life. Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, believes the life of North Sea production could extend well into the next century 'even if prices never rise again in real terms'. He says that new technology could push recovery rates as high as 70 per cent of reserves within 20 years, compared with the 50-55 per cent achieved in only a few fields at present. Companies are only now beginning to realise the full scope for cost reductions in the North Sea. The UK Offshore Operators Association, whose membership includes all 36 companies producing oil and gas in the UK sector of the North Sea, believes savings of up to 30 per cent in capital costs of offshore platforms could be made if more attention was given to standardisation of designs and equipment. A recent report contained a series of recommendations detailing new codes and practices. It predicted that substantial cost savings were possible within two or three years if the basic proposals were implemented. Mr Browne believes that a 30 per cent cut in capital costs and a 50 per cent cut in operating costs over the next 20 years 'could raise the total volume recoverable from the North Sea by 25 per cent - from around 60bn barrels of oil equivalent to around 75bn'. The way in which technology and higher productivity can prolong the life of mature areas is unlikely, however, to lead to any sharp falloff in oil company interest in frontier areas. But their sheer distance from the world's main markets and lack of local infrastructure make them a long-term proposition. China's Tarim basin, for example, is 2,500 miles from the coast. Studies suggest it could cost as much as Dollars 6 to move a barrel of oil through a proposed pipeline to China's main markets. A similar level of transportation charges is likely in other promising but landlocked areas, such as Kazakhstan. The political uncertainty surrounding the future of such countries and the need to move oil or gas across sometimes unfriendly borders complicates their development, even if the per barrel cost of producing oil or gas is attractive. The growing competition among countries for foreign investment to help develop their petroleum resources is also likely to exert a strong influence on where oil companies look next. Much of the interest in the world's more remote areas can be traced to the withdrawal or exclusion of many western oil companies from Middle Eastern and Latin American countries as a result of nationalisation. There is no prospect that the old concession system in the Middle East will be revived, but some of the barriers to western oil companies in the region are being lowered. There were reports this year that Kuwait was discussing exploration prospects with western companies, while French companies in particular are positioning themselves to take advantage of opportunities in Iraq once United Nations sanctions are lifted. The prospect that western oil companies could become more deeply involved in the Middle East in years to come has been boosted by the fact that many countries in the region cannot afford to develop on their own the new reserves needed to maintain, let alone enlarge, their capacity. The relatively low cost of much oil in the area has obvious appeal to western companies, but the political risks of the region remain relatively high despite the peace agreement between Palestinians and the Israelis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from the Kurdistan Democratic Party's Central Public </F> Relations Office to the London-based Arabic daily AL-HAYAH; date  not given]    [Text] To the esteemed AL-HAYAH newspaper:    Subject: Explanation    Greetings:    In its issue No. 11,386 dated 20 April 1994, your newspaper  published an article by Kamiran Qurrah Daghi under the headline  "Barzani Sets Three Conditions for Acceptance of Damascus  Invitation." In order to shed light and explain the truth about  what was published in the article, we ask that the following  explanation be published:    1. Our party's relations with Syria are strong. They are  based on mutual respect and understanding. We attach great  importance to these relations.    2. His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad has kindly  received Mr. Barzani during all his visits to Syria. Mr.  Barzani has strong and close relations with President Hafiz  al-Asad.    3. We would like to explain that Barzani would not set  conditions for visiting Syria. He regards Syria as his own  country. The doors of Damascus have always been and still are  open and there is no need for friends to set conditions among  themselves.    Please accept our regards.    Signed: The Central Public Relations Office</p>

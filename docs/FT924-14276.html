			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Old Rover learns new Japanese tricks: Michael Smith joined the production line at Longbridge, where the shop stewards act as management, managers dress like workers and workers imitate the Japanese A GROUP of 40 workers at Rover's Longbridge car assembly plant has gathered apprehensively in a rest area. Their shop steward has called them to a meeting and his manner - unsmiling and full of importance - tells them the matter is serious. Behind him, several managers sit in an office, pretending not to be interested. The scene looks dreadfully familiar: Is this an issue that will be stirred up from resentment to anger and then to . . .'Down tools, lads and everybody out'? This time, the managers are on the shop steward's side; or rather, the steward has become a ringmaster enforcing discipline. Speaking slowly, savouring every syllable, the steward says they are here to discuss the smashing down of a door in the toilets the day before. 'That is extremely dangerous; it is unacceptable behaviour. The trade union movement cannot condone it. Anyone who is caught doing it will be sacked and could even be taken to court and sued.' Any questions? There are few. Most of the men are relieved that it was not as serious as they feared. The meeting ends. The managers are pleased, and no wonder; they could have conveyed the message themselves, but with less effect. In another part of the plant, the company is having difficulties on its Rover 200 production line. It is only the second day of production for the 1993 model and the two employees connecting a hose to the radiator are overstretched and sweating. A year or two ago, the line would have stopped while management negotiated a solution with the trade unions. But now every worker knows that this line must keep moving, as the lines are even now moving in Japan, France, Belgium, Germany and elsewhere in the UK. 'You are not too loaded at the moment,' a team leader says to a worker up the line. 'Could you do it?' 'No problem,' he says with a speed that shows he does not even consider calling the shop steward. 'Don't you mind?' I ask him. 'I could do without it but I wasn't exactly stretched before. It'll stop me getting bored.' He goes on to explain how Rover is doing everything it can to compete with the Japanese; if that means he must become more flexible, like a Japanese worker, then so be it. The two incidents are symbolic of an extraordinary change which has come about at Rover as it throws off old habits to meet the competition from the three Japanese companies with manufacturing plants in Britain: Nissan, Honda and Toyota. The new spirit of co-operation between bosses and workers was given form in a Japanese-style New Deal, launched a year ago by the company and agreed with unions in April. Workers were given greater job security and improved conditions. Sick pay, for example, was improved to the level offered to white collar workers. The workers agreed to be more flexible and to give more commitment. Ten to 15 years ago this plant was famous for industrial strife. Clashes between Michael Edwardes, then chairman, and Derek 'Red Robbo' Robinson, the Longbridge union convenor, who was eventually sacked, were headline news week after week. In the worst year, 1977, 7 per cent of working days lost were lost through disputes. Last year the equivalent figure was 0.0001 per cent. Industrial discipline at Rover is benefitting from the employment legislation of the Thatcher years and from the recession which makes men fear for their jobs. But there is more to the improvement than workers' fears and tougher laws. Taking lessons from the Japanese and in particular from Honda, which has a 20 per cent stake in the company, Rover has made a big effort to involve its 34,000 workers more in their jobs and in the company, to increase their training, improve their work environment and to ask them what they think. Every manager uses the word 'empowerment.' Anyone who visits Longbridge will see that the word is not empty one. The work areas are much cleaner than in a traditional British factory; any spilt grease and oil is cleaned up quickly. There is little surplus stock. Production lines are no longer just rows of people staffing machines; they are adorned by notice boards each with a series of charts telling groups of workers how well, or badly, they are doing. Occasionally a group of 10 or 15 workers - now called 'associates' - can be found huddled together discussing how to improve their own or the company's performance. Workers answer to a team leader whom they help to choose. He, or sometimes she, wears the same uniform as the line workers, and so do the managers. At Rover, the days of the 'men in grey suits' - as managers are sometimes called in UK factories - are over. If all this appears thoroughly Japanese, so does the enthusiasm of a surprisingly large number of workers. Everywhere I went in the Longbridge plants, I was accosted by people, particularly team leaders, who were evangelical in explaining the new Rover and their part in it. Dave McDonald, a worker in the power train plant where engines and gear boxes are made, is typical. He became deeply disillusioned with the 'terrible management' eight years ago and resigned as a union shop steward. Since then, he says, the management has become less confrontational and the atmosphere has been transformed. Three years ago he became a team leader, in charge of 10 people. Ordinary line workers tend to be less gushing than team leaders, but their attitude is positive. 'I think the management understand now that everyone on the shop floor is not a dummy,' says Barry Millward a Mini line worker. 'Before, we came to work to do a job and that was it. Now we are asked to give more and we do.' When I watched him and his three colleagues fit the inside panel, the handles and the pocket on a Mini door, I could not see how their job had changed. For their Pounds 240 or so gross pay a week, they must must do dull and repetitive tasks. True, they start the day with a five-minute team briefing, but then it seems to be traditional line-fodder work. The four take one door each from every other car. Each group of tasks takes three minutes - at top speed the 360 metre line of 160 men works on 160 cars a day. One change is that workers try harder to keep the line going. Brian Phillips, who has been at the company for 25 years, says that until a few years ago he and his colleagues would have said nothing if they were running out of, say, door handles. 'It wasn't our job. If the line stopped it did not bother us. Now we know there is more at stake and, because we are more involved, we will tell the team leader.' By far the biggest change in the job results from Phillips' ingenuity. The plastic sheet which the men secure to the door as their first task was his invention. It stops water leaking to the bottom of the door and causing rust. Previously several pieces of sticky tape were used but fitting them took far longer. The system was used on the Metro line but engineers had been unable to perfect it for the Mini. Phillips did so in his garage at home. The result is a saving of Pounds 100,000 a year to the company. Phillips was rewarded by Rover's suggestion scheme with a Pounds 5,000 payment, which he shared with his three colleagues. At Rover, the cult of the team is paramount. Team leaders are a step above the ordinary line worker but, according to the company, definitely not 'management narks.' They monitor the quality and productivity of the group, and keep the team informed. Although elected by team members, potential leaders have to pass tests and to be approved by the company. Sometimes the elections are little more than a formality. When Bob Edden became a team leader on the Rover 200 car production line he was one of seven who stood for election; there were six places available. It is not hard to see why the company wants him and people like him as leaders. Edden, aged 39, left school at 15 and spent 20 years as a milk man. He is a neat and precise man who loves to work with his hands; for years that passion found expression in his hobbies of making model cars and Napoleonic figurines. He considered going to work at Longbridge, but backed off, largely because of the company's industrial relations record. Two years ago he decided to apply and a year later he was a team leader. The energies he once put into model making are now diverted into car production. 'It is like a hobby,' he says. Edden and others like him are the beneficiaries of team working. There are also potential losers, not least the trade unions. In the past, shop stewards were the main conduits for communication within the company; the team system threatens that role. Neil McGreevy, plant convener for the TGWU general workers' union, admits that the union fears that the team system will be used to marginalise the unions. 'But team working is here whether we like it or not and our people will learn to live with it. I think it may even be a plus for the company.' The challenge for Rover is to persuade ordinary workers that they too have an interest in improving quality and in talking and feeling the same way as Brian Phillips. Rover's programme of change has concentrated on the team leaders. Below them there is apathy and even hostility. Dave has done the same job on the Mini production line for 12 years in spite of numerous applications to move. 'I can do it with my eyes closed and it is very boring,' he says. He sees no value in team briefing, doubts the company will keep its promise to avoid compulsory redundancies and pours scorn on the idea that all workers are improved equality. 'It is still them and us as far as I am concerned.' 'You have to put your hand up to go to the toilet these days. It's like being at school. In the old days, I admit, we did not work hard enough, but now it has gone too far the other way.' Peter, a 57-year-old worker in the paint shop with 33 years experience at Rover, applauds the management's emphasis on quality. But he is angry that he has to answer to team leaders who he considers inexperienced. 'It is all the young ones who do not know what they are doing. And as for all that stuff they put on the notice boards, they must be using forests of paper.' Neither Dave nor Peter wants to return to days of strikes and stoppages, but the agenda has changed. If Rover is to compete with the Japanese manufacturers in the UK it must do far more than prevent industrial action. To stand a chance of eroding the quality and productivity gap, it has to win the commitment of its workers. As one manager says: 'We've come a long way and the atmosphere at Longbridge has been transformed. But really we have only just started.'</p>

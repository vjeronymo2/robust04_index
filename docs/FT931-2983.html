			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Italian Liberal leader resigns THE LEADER of Italy's Liberal party resigned yesterday. He is the third party head in a month forced to step down after being implicated in the country's corruption scandals. Mr Renato Altissimo's move came after he was warned on Monday that he was under investigation by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving L50m (Pounds 22,500) in illicit funds from Enel, the national electricity authority. Mr Altissimo, who denied any wrongdoing, was one of 10 parliamentarians this week advised they were under investigation over Enel payments. The small Liberal party is a partner in the four-party government coalition led by Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, but Mr Altissimo's decision is not expected to affect its stability. Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, and Mr Giorgio La Malfa of the Republicans have also had to step down after being accused of accepting illegal payments. Mr Amato again came under fierce attack in parliament yesterday. There were chaotic scenes in the Chamber of Deputies, where opposition MPs from the populist Lombard League at one stage dangled a hangman's noose at government benches. Mr Amato was frequently interrupted by members from the neo-fascist MSI party and the Lombard League as he concluded the debate on how to confront the crisis caused by the wave of corruption being exposed by an increasingly assertive judiciary. He urged parliament to adopt a bipartisan approach. But it was still unclear how the parties would agree on legislation to achieve a political solution to the corruption scandals.</p>

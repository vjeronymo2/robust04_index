			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Castletown falls to IPounds 71,000 Castletown, the Dublin-based stationery and printing group, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 71,000 (Pounds 66,000) for the six months to October 31. The decline from last time's IPounds 114,000 came on turnover of IPounds 1.72m (IPounds 1.43m). Directors said, however, that a combination of recent acquisitions, restructuring, new management and exposure to UK markets should 'generate a strong recovery in the second half'. A dividend of 0.9p (1.26p) is payable from fully diluted earnings of 1.76p (3.13p).</p>

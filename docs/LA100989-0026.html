			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CHARLIE HADEN'S QUARTET TAKES HIGH ROAD  </P> <P> Charlie Haden's Quartet West, which closed Sunday at Catalina's, covers so much  territory in a single set that its slogan might well be "Around the World in  Seven Tunes."  </P> <P> Haden, the composer and bassist who rose to fame in the 1960s with Ornette  Coleman, shares the credits with three equally skilled musicians: Ernie Watts  on tenor sax, Alan Broadbent on piano and Larance Marable on drums.  </P> <P> These are not your everyday be-boppers -- though the opening number might have  given that impression -- because it was an old Charlie Parker line, "Passport,"  for which Watts assumed the melodic responsibility before plunging into the  first several choruses of hard-driving extemporization.  </P> <P> The idiom changed as the group wrapped itself around Pat Metheny's "Hermitage,"  with a minor key and a Latin beat, and with Watts in a more subdued mood.  </P> <P> Haden's all-embracing scope took a turn for the basics with his simple and  charming calypso, "Child's Play," during which the brilliant, harmonically  imaginative Broadbent supplied sensitive chording. Marable, in a long but  rarely boring solo, went through some interesting motions with sticks on his  high-hat cymbal.  </P> <P> Haden himself was the key figure in a long freedom excursion, displaying his  customary finesse, telling stories in long lines and occasional chords. Watts  took some uncivil liberties with his horn, and the whole thing, despite a  splendid Broadbent interlude, went on so interminably that the next number, a  bop line on "All the Things You Are," came as a much-needed contrast.  </P> <P> What is most impressive about Quartet West is its sense of unity. Having worked  together off and on for two or three years, these men are thoroughly attuned to  one another's innovative ideas. If they do stumble now and then in their global  circumnavigation, the passages of smooth sailing make the journey  worthwhile.Leonad Feather  </P></p>

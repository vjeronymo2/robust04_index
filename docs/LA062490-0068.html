			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CONSIDER NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS  </P> <P> As a Manhattan Beach resident since 1947 and having had two girls complete  their education in this area, I have seen school issues change from year to  year. However, the one issue which keeps reoccurring is school unification.  </P> <P> The one priority many seem to overlook is: What is best for all children, not  just mine.  </P> <P> A full unification would be more beneficial to all children because of a more  consistent program and better articulation between schools, staff and support  staff in the K-12 years. Plus, there is the opportunity and more availability  of a proven Adult School Parent Education program involving parents and  children from prenatal to 5-year-olds. It is one of the better preventive  programs offered anywhere.  </P> <P> The cost-effectiveness of unification in regard to purchasing, maintenance,  salaries, administrative costs and duplication of services is a big factor. All  of these would enable the district to offer educational opportunities and  extracurricular activities not now available to all children. The neighborhood  school . . . walking distance . . . can be maintained with possible  inter-school transfers available.  </P> <P> The bottom line is: Let's think of the positive aspects for 10,000 children who  are indeed our future.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN WHITEHEAD  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P> <P> retired founder, Parent Education Program South Bay Adult School  </P></p>

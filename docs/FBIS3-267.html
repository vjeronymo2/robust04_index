The MPLA [Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] have until the end of the month to  reach some agreement. The two sides are responsible for the  death and misery of thousands of people. Now if they do not  reach an agreement, U.S. economic aid will be canceled. Anabela  Gois.    [Gois] [passage omitted] When faced with the ultimatum,  Alcides Sakala [UNITA's representative in Brussels] did not  hesitate: UNITA is negotiating with goodwill, if the talks are  dragging on the blame lies fully with the MPLA.    [Sakala] One cannot put things in those terms. As you  know UNITA has made all the possible concessions in order that  the peace process might advance. At the moment those backing a  war solution are the MPLA who launched this offensive against  our positions. The MPLA is totally responsible.    [Gois] Naturally, the MPLA has a different opinion. Despite  not having official knowledge of the American ultimatum,  Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao [presidential spokesman] said that  only UNITA is creating obstacles to an agreement.    [Conceicao] The process is taking a long time, not only  because of the complexity of the issues being discussed and of  the nature of the conflict, but also because of the time-wasting  tactics by UNITA, who is interested in seeing the process drag  on forever. We will do our utmost to find a solution as soon as  possible.    [Gois] Not even a U.S. ultimatum appears to be enough, for  now, to make UNITA and the Angolan Government express their  willingness to alter their negotiating strategy. Time will tell  whether the United States' threats bear fruit.</p>

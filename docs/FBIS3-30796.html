However, even though the  republic does not exist, the conflicts among its political  leaders are real enough.    Although Shkelzen Maliqi, one of the pioneers of party  pluralism in Kosovo, says in ZERI that the rift among the  Albanian leaders should not be written about, the Albanian press  keeps exploiting this topic to the full. According to ZERI, the  surprise came when Jusuf Buxhovi, one of the founders of the  Democratic League of Kosovo [LDK], was removed from that party.  That triggered off a series of political clashes in the most  populous and influential Albanian party in the Balkans.    The LDK members are wondering what Anton Kolaj, member of  that party's presidency, is doing in the United States while  they, as they say, are here fighting the Serbian authorities.  The explanation that Anton Kolaj is in the United States to  form a branch of the party does not sound convincing enough,  particularly as the party and Kolaj are only interested in the  money of Albanian guest workers in the United States.    According to ZERI, the conflict started in the Parliamentary  Party of Kosovo, when "the entire leadership was removed" from  the party. This was, by the way, a party of young people.  There has also been a rift in the Christian Democratic Party.  Lazer Krasniqi, its leader, is now in Zagreb, according to  ZERI, and academician Mark Krasniqi is now the leader of the  party. Those with a good knowledge of the political trends in  Kosovo and Metohija have from the start doubted that this party  had a future, since most of its members are Albanians of the  Muslim faith, so this must be the only Christian Democratic  Party in the world whose members are predominantly Muslim.    There have also been rifts in UNICOMB (the Party of National  Unity) since its chairman Halit Alildemaj left. He is now in  Tirana. Skelzen Maliqi and Kacusa Jashari have left the  leadership of the Social Democratic Party.    According to BUJKU, there have also been rifts between "the  president of the republic and the government of Kosovo."  BUJKU's commentator wonders whether it is true that there has  also been a rift among the ranks of the LDK and Bukoshi's  government.    Academician Rexhep Qosja told the press about the cause of  the rift:    "The problem is double-edged -- because of the prestige and  the money that Bukoshi is gathering diligently while Rugova  wants to spend it without any controls."    Adem Demaci, chairman of the Commission for Human Rights and  the director of the weekly FORUM, was more open in presenting  the real picture. He sent out an appeal to his fellow-citizens  "not to pay 30 percent of their income in tax to a republic that  is not recognized by anyone. The chances are that they, Edita  Tahiri and Anton Kolaj, are spending that money in the United  States." Demaci also said that many leaders use the money from  that fund to educate their children abroad, while the Albanians  in Kosovo can barely make ends meet.    Following these individual clashes, the supporters of  Rugova's option are now faced by an official opposition. At the  recent gathering of Albanian parties in Tetovo -- which was not  attended by the representatives of Rugova's LDK -- the so-called  democratic bloc was formed. Mahmut Bakalli, who hitherto used  to communicate exclusively in the Ankara-Pristina-Bonn-United  States direction -- made his first public appearance in Tetovo.</p>

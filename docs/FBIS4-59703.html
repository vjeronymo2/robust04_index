			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers shot and  wounded two Palestinians who opened fire on them from a truck  near the settlement Morag. There were no Israeli casualties.  Our reporter Alan Ben-'Ami says the gunmen got away and a joint  Israeli-Palestinian team arrived on the scene to investigate.    Meanwhile, the Israeli pullout from Gaza is nearly complete.  The Civil Administration building was turned over to the  Palestinians this afternoon at a ceremony attended by Brigadier  General David Gazit, Israel's head of the Civil Administration  in the strip. Four hundred more Palestinian policemen are due  to arrive in the Gaza Strip from Egypt today.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Romania close to helicopter pact with Chile Romania is close to signing a long-term support contract to maintain military helicopters for the Chilean armed forces, the first deal of its kind between the two countries. Under the contract, which is due to be signed within two months, Turbomecanica and IAR, two Romanian helicopter manufacturers, will repair the Chilean army's Puma SA 330 helicopters at sites in Romania and Chile. Turbomecanica will repair engines, motorheads and gear boxes in Romania and produce all the new components needed. It will sub-contract to IAR maintenance work on the helicopters' airframes in Chile, according to Turbomecanica officials. The value of the contract has not been disclosed but it is believed to run to several million dollars. The deal is part of a strategy by the two companies to expand their repair and maintenance activities, officials said. The companies, have manufactured the Puma SA 330 military helicopter under licence from Aerospatiale of France since 1975, producing 150 of the 600 helicopters of this type worldwide. Turbomecanica, which employs 400 engineers, also produces engines for civilian and military engines under licence from Rolls Royce of the UK and turbines for gas-pumping stations. Romania is the only country in the former Eastern bloc with an aerospace industry based on western rather than Soviet technology. Since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the country, which has the capacity to manufacture two Puma helicopters a month, has re-oriented sales to western countries. This year it completed a Dollars 37m contract with the United Arab Emirates for 10 Pumas, and also exports the helicopter to France, Ecuador and Pakistan.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Observer: Defence on the offensive Volker Ruhe's elevation to German defence minister may have come a little late for his good friend Chris Patten. For Ruhe, a former English teacher who was to be seen last week campaigning in the Conservative party chairman's wobbly home seat of Bath, will be of little use to Patten in the event of an April 9 upset. Nearer to home, the secretary-general of Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, who has garnered a reputation for ruthless political in-fighting, may be making foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher turn sour for quite a different reason. Ruhe has made little secret of the fact that he is after the job Genscher has had since 1974; he loses few opportunities to snipe at his rival. Making do with second-best for now by taking the poisoned chalice of defence  -five previous incumbents, including Gerhard Stoltenberg, have had to resign prematurely - there is no doubt he will use the post in his campaign to clip Genscher's wings. Ironically, it was probably Free Democrat party leader Genscher who whipped up the issue of German arms supplies to Turkey which has now toppled Stoltenberg. His reward is having to contend with Ruhe across the cabinet table - in place of his affable but ineffectual predecessor.</p>

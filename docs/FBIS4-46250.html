			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Juan de la Fuente Mejia, economist and expert on </F> violence in the Huallaga Valley: "It Is Still Night in Huallaga"]    [Text] This article is part of a study that the Council of  Projects for Latin American Refugees (CPRL) conducted between  October and December of last year on forced relocations in the  Upper Huallaga and Huanuco. It has observed from the Upper  Huallaga that Shining Path (SL), far from being annihilated, is  relocating to the provinces of Huanuco and Ucayali and to the  Central Jungle. Since January, there have been several news  reports of another relocation into the provinces of San Martin  in the Mayo River Basin. Attacks on towns, executions of mayors  and teachers, bloody ambushes, the shutdown of Huanuco  university, and a great many disappearances tell us that the  post-Shining Path era is a long way off there.    Several small children are playing war at six in the evening  on a street in now deserted Uchiza. Most want to be the "firma"  (the cocaine mafia); others want to be "cumpas" (Shining Path)  or "colochos" (Colombians). The littlest one complains that he  does not want to be the "moroco" or army but he has to if he  wants to play.    It seems that Abimael Guzman is playing a very weak hand in  the Upper Huallaga and in the Department of Huanuco, but at the  same time there are few signs that Shining Path is vanishing. At  worst, a respite would diminish uncertainties. This would  presumably be the last great Shining Path battlefront, where the  ultimate outcome of this 14-year-old war would be played out.    The regional committee in the Upper Huallaga was never just  another committee. Its establishment was a victory for the  so-called "black line," spearheaded by Osman Morote, that  opposed Abimael Guzman. Guzman did not want SL to move into an  area that he regarded as a "rotten territory" which could easily  contaminate his cadres and would be taken over only after SL  controlled much of the country. At the Central Committee plenum  that debated the issue, Guzman reportedly said that "the Indians  will never understand Gonzalo's thoughts." The internal  opposition retorted that this is what the "five golden rules"  were for and that the party should not throw away the  opportunities offered by the jungle.    This is why its existence was always a challenge to  "Chairman  Gonzalo's" authority and one of the reasons, aside from the  historical ones, why it did not become the Main Regional  Committee.    The valley had its advantages. It was the area with the  fastest growth, the territory in which SL conducted its  principal experiments. The first "armed work stoppages" were  decreed there, later to be conducted nationwide. The forms of  organization for the "liberated zones" spread throughout its  vast expanses between 1987 and 1990. SL did not even dream of  trying these forms, which were developed according to theory and  corrected in practice (such as the town delegates and the open  grass-roots committees), in Lima and other cities.    It was General Arciniega who altered the course of the war  in  the Huallaga Valley. He radically changed the strategy followed  until then, which regarded SL, drug traffickers, and the  peasants who grew coca leaves as a single military target, and  he vied with SL for peasant grassroots support; he stopped  cracking down on coca growing and tried to restore the people's  trust in the military through assistance efforts.    These were not the only changes. When Arciniega assumed  command of the Huallaga Front in 1989 after SL's bloody takeover  of Uchiza, he shifted the center of operations from the north  (Tarapoto, Juanjui, and the Mayo River) to the south, to the  provinces of Mariscal Caceres (San Martin) and Leoncio Prado  (Huanuco) in the Upper Huallaga.    His successors, Generals Chacon, Brito, and Hanke, moved the  hub of operations back to its former location and made the  crackdown on the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] a  priority. The upshot was a stronger SL that expanded into the  province of Padre Abad (Ucayali), which borders the Huallaga.    In 1993, when it was certain that the MRTA had been broken  up, the Huallaga Front moved its center of operations southward  for the second time, whereupon it became obvious that SL was  feeling the blows and starting to withdraw in several directions.    Its first move was towards the interior. Resigned to the  fact  that the blows to its "territorial networks" would be crushing,  SL chose to shift its "mobile networks," that is to say, the  units of the People's Guerrilla Army (EGP), into the jungle.    The other two moves have not represented much of an exodus,  being more a combination of withdrawal and deployment. On the  one hand, it has moved into the other provinces in the  Department of Huanuco and, from there, via corridors, to La  Libertad and Ancash; on the other, it has moved into the central  jungle through Puerto Inca, Puerto Bermudez, and Codo del Pozuzo.    There were several reasons for this initial movement. First,  the coca market crash has made the civilian population and the  growers less dependent on SL. The chain reaction from this  crisis pushed many of the social and economic players who had  previously sought SL's help out of the area and left it with a  smaller civilian population to vie for. Local observers note  that paradoxically it would seem to be coca, rather than the  army, that is getting the best of Shining Path.    The countryside is becoming depopulated through emigration.  Most of the families that were lured by the coca boom to the  valley from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin, and Ucayali in the 1970's and  1980's are going home.    Second, the aforementioned southward shift of the center of  military operations is putting pressure on SL and forcing it to  relocate further away from towns.    Third, the Armed Forces are following a somewhat different  strategy vis-a-vis the civilian population: less of a presence  in cities and medium-sized towns (Tingo Maria, Aucayacu,  Tocache, and Uchiza) and a stronger role in rural areas and  smaller towns, including civic action programs.    The role that the patrols played in defeating SL in the  central highlands is not the same as in the Upper Huallaga. They  are not very widespread there, and the army is having serious  trouble organizing them. In the central highlands the patrols  were formed using the structure of the peasant communities,  which had to defend territory, internal democracy, and crops,  among other things.    There are very few communities in the Huallaga, but another  factor is even more significant: migration has made the area  cosmopolitan, and owing to this development, combined with the  weak sense of order and democracy and the coca market crash, the  locals are uninterested in defending what they really do not  possess or have ceased to possess.  <H5>  Yankee Go Home </H5>   The old red graffiti can still be seen along the road from  Tingo Maria to Tocache. They are from 1989-90: "Long live the  MLM," "Yankee Go Home," "Long Live Chairman Gonzalo," "Finish  Off the Great Leap With a Gold Seal." None refers to "defending  the life of Chairman Gonzalo" or some other current issue.  Shining Path is not doing graffiti anymore today, nor is it  operating checkpoints along roads, nor does it control the  small, remote coca-growing towns. Its favorite tactics are  ambushes, executions, and a few raids into small towns. During  the first 10 months of 1993 its ambushes alone took the lives of  24 army personnel.    It would be a mistake to conclude that SL does not retain  some of its military reserves. The "main force," which the army  itself estimated at 3,000 men, plus the "local forces" and the  "base forces," totaled more than 6,000 men in 1989. Estimates  are that these forces have declined by 80 percent over the last  two years as a result of arrests, battles, desertions, and  surrenders of reformed SL members. This means that SL would  currently be able to mobilize 1,200 men, still a potent force.  <H5>  Huanuco: Leave or Die </H5>   There are no graffiti, either new or old, in Huanuco, except  for a few at the university. The SL's do not seem to do that  kind of thing there. But a great many people have been killed.  Four university professors, two students, and the woman  president of the mothers clubs have been slain in less than one  year. A student and a leader of the SUTEP [Trade Union of  Education Workers] were severely wounded. SL does allow itself  certain luxuries there, such as its ambush of a patrol car in  the downtown section of the city last September.    Since the SL regional committee in the Upper Huallaga  decided  in early 1992 to no longer consider Huanuco a transit point and  temporary haven, the search for new "support bases" in the once  placid city has turned violent.    Gonzalo's "red line" was in the majority until September of  last year; its goal was to clear out the political scene until  only it and the State remained as adversaries. This faction was  presumably responsible for the attacks of recent years and  executed about one well-known public figure a month. The capture  of an SL commando group in the city of Huanuco last August was  reportedly a severe blow to the Gonzalo faction, leaving it in  the minority.    The other faction seeks to focus on government  representatives. Its main goal is to pursue the tactics of the  war of national liberation, which characterizes the faction of  Osman Morote or the "former opposition" in the area.    Hermilio Valdizan University is reportedly the center of SL  activity. Its objective seems to be to recruit and train cadres,  using the university as a springboard for subsequent development  in the slums. Whoever opposes this approach has two options:  leave or die. Ten professors have left in response to threats,  among them the former president of the region, Andres Avelino  Caceres, and the dean of the Department of Administrative  Sciences, Julio Tarazona Padilla, as well as the former  president of the teachers union, Ruben Sachun, and the former  president of the Women's Network, Denessy Palacios, among others.    Recent raids into the towns of Tantamayo and Monzon in  September suggest that SL has again occupied the northern  corridor of the Huanuco highlands, which it used from 1983 to  1988, its years of expansion. Supporting this deduction is the  fact that the column which attacked Monzon (40 to 50 men in poor  shape, with neither food nor clothing, with few supplies, many  of them suffering from leishmaniasis) is the same one that  raided Tantamayo.    This corridor extends into the Department of Ancash and  presumably enables SL to help out its organizations in Huaraz  and northern Peru, to remove its wounded, and to obtain  supplies. In addition, it is probably using the corridor that  runs from Uchiza through Tayobamba and Huacrachuco to La  Libertad.  <H5>  Ayacucho, Again and Again </H5>   Manuel Milla Pinzas, a former dean of the Bar Association  and  university professor, was killed by an SL commando group at the  gate to the university campus at five in the afternoon last 4  October. One-hundred meters away is the Cayhuayna police  checkpoint, where there were more than 20 agents and one van.  The commando group fled on foot towards Paucarbamba and vanished  from sight 10 minutes later. Rosa del Aguila, the president of  the Federation of Mothers Clubs, was slain two months before  near Calicanto Bridge. She called for help and fought with her  assailants, who left on foot, watched by two policemen standing  guard at the gate to the headquarters of the Technical  Police...less than 100 meters from the scene of the crime.  Ayacucho 1980? Lima 1992? No. Huanuco in recent months.    Several mistakes in the strategy to combat subversion could  have negative repercussions in the short term. In fact, they  already have. Residents of the city are obviously jumpy, and the  exodus of people could be followed by a withdrawal of the  investments that have been trickling in for the past two years.    The military commands have allowed SL to start retreating  into the provinces in the Huanuco highlands and into the city  itself and to use the Huamalies and Huacrachuco corridors  without much difficulty.    The Achilles' heel of the battle against subversion is the  civilian population. In light of the difficulties it has had in  organizing the patrols, the military command is resorting to  territorial control, assistance, then neglect, and so on. But it  does not stop at exclusion; it also cracks down. It would seem  that beyond the sweeps, the mass control of the disadvantaged  population, and whatever arrests it may make, the army has  little to fall back on.    Over the past two years Huanuco has been the department with  the most arrests and missing persons. The Human Rights  Commission of the Constitutional Congress reported recently that  in 1992 there were 144 disappearances, 132 of which are blamed  on the army.    In 1993 there were 89 complaints filed, 32 in relation to  army actions. From January to August of last year alone, the  Ombudsman's Unit of the Attorney General's Office documented 38  missing person reports, most of them implicating troops from  "Los Laureles" barracks in Tingo Maria. The problems are  mounting because neither Tingo Maria nor Huanuco has a human  rights commission.    Other key words for the Upper Huallaga and Huanuco that  neither the government nor the military seem to understand are  "development" and "social support." In a region in which the  State has been clueless for the past 15 years and in which the  absence of democracy is as obvious as the lack of jobs, markets,  investment, education, and health care, the mildest  antigovernment rhetoric will clearly work.    The strategy to combat subversion should take into account  that the clearer the decline in the SL threat becomes, the more  the State will again be the main target of discontent. A long  list of problems persists in the Huanuco jungle and highlands:  towns without electric power, communities in which 80 percent of  the children suffer from leishmaniasis, villages without  schools, harvests that cannot be taken to market because there  are no roads, crops attacked by pests and blights, producers who  cannot get loans, growers who want aid to replace their coca  crops, people without jobs, displaced persons without homes,  work, or hope. The National Compensation and Social Development  Fund is not enough. What is needed is public and private  investment, credit, an expansion of the agricultural frontier,  and the promotion of output and jobs.    Expanded assistance is oh so far away from the Huallaga and  Huanuco!  <H5>  [Box, p 41] </H5> <H5>  The Guerrillas Wear Blue Jeans </H5>   The members of Shining Path in the Upper Huallaga are more  cosmopolitan and frivolous and less ideological. Unlike the  militant Maoists from Ayacucho, the SL people in the Huallaga  have little political and ideological motivation.    We should bear in mind that the area does not have a  tradition of political confrontation (which Ayacucho does), nor  is there a deeply rooted political culture, nor are there elites  or parties that are even halfway organized. So, during SL's peak  years you could see militiamen and activists wearing blue jeans,  hush puppies, and University of Oklahoma sweatshirts, something  that would have been unlikely in other areas, even the hot ones.    SL has gained little from its 10 years in the valley. Unlike  in the highlands and the Andes, it built its relations with the  people in the Huallaga Valley on the defense of coca growing,  not on the assertion of any ideology.    This link is becoming weaker and weaker, because there are  fewer coca crops and less drug trafficking, which will likely  wind up being insignificant. The reason for its success will  eventually turn out to be the reason for its failure. In the  long run, the coca growers and gangland kingpins will wind up  using Gonzalo's men. Perhaps this is why Abimael Guzman, who is  not much of a populist, opposed the opening of this front,  inasmuch as a future alliance with Huallaga society did not  depend on his forces.    But what is easily conquered is easily lost as well. None of  the mass organization arrangements that SL developed is working  today: neither the grass-roots committees nor the militias nor  the groups they created. In a place where it was very easy to  move from being a small-time trafficker to a militiaman or from  being a coca grower (or else a producer of cocaine paste) to a  delegate, it is also very simple to return to one's former  activity, or to emigrate.    These factors are also affecting SL. Most of its members no  longer want to be involved in the war. They are fleeing,  preferring not to become reformed terrorists. Some come to Lima,  others to Pucallpa and from there to Brazil, to Manaus or  Cruzeiro, where SL's, MRTA members, grass-roots leaders, and  peasants accused of terrorism have gathered to live. The more  than 100 members who turned themselves in in January were  probably not commanders or activists; they were likely residents  of the former support bases, militiamen, or collaborators with  the organizations they created.    SL is presumably trying to follow the coca route or move  alongside it. This is the reason for the attack on the  Ashaninkas, which was probably an attempt to clean out the area.  Everyone knows that coca is moving east and south, from Puerto  Inca to the central jungle. The Codo del Pozuzo, which was once  a ranching paradise, is part of the new scene of the coca-SL-war  symbiosis. In the jungle SL is fated to wander around after the  coca growers and drug traffickers from valley to valley, no  longer as a political and military force that aspires to take  over the country but as part of an apparatus that protects the  former from the State.  <H5>  [Box, p 32] </H5> <H5>  The Long Tocache March </H5>   Driven by the need for territorial domination, Shining Path  structured the life of the drug traffickers and each of their  "firms." It did so as only it knows how. One fine day it issued  a decree, the most noteworthy points in which were:    a. Cocaine is for overseas consumption, and domestic use is  punished. The watchword was: "The spider does not consume its  own poison."    b. Defend the right to plant coca shrubs and to work and  prevent the eradication projects from destroying the crops. The  watchword: "Yankee Go Home."    c. The "firms" could not have more than four foreigners. The  purpose of this was to stem the invasion of Colombians and stave  off their violent activities. They stated that Colombian men  married to Peruvian women would be given preference in remaining  here.    d. The "traqueteros" (the people who drove through towns and  along roads on motorcycles buying the packages of cocaine paste)  had to be Peruvian.    e. All sales and "flights" (shipments of cocaine paste to  Colombia) had to be carried out in the presence of the SL  delegate. The slogan: "The Party has a thousand eyes and a  thousand ears."    Many people's disbelief was dispelled when, two weeks after  SL issued its "edict," it dragged four Colombians out of the  "Porkis" discotheque in Uchiza and slit their throats.    SL's first advance guards arrived in the valley seeking jobs  as coca harvesting laborers, the lowest rung on the coca ladder.  During the first stage, from 1983 to late 1984, Shining Path  focused on emphasizing its message to the people (the tactic of  developing bases). In July 1984 an emergency was declared in the  zone, and the military crackdown forced SL to retreat. The  military campaign, which did not distinguish between targets,  helped to bolster its ties with the civilian population. SL did  not waste the opportunity and took charge of administering  justice and daily life in the mid-sized towns that were  flourishing because of coca and coca-dollars. It dealt with  marital conflicts and land disputes and enforced penalties for  minor offenses. Theirs was not a public takeover but rather a  surreptitious presence in civil society, a silent alliance in  which at that time SL was the major beneficiary.    The second stage, from 1987 to 1991, was marked by SL's  intensive and extensive deployment. During it SL scored its  biggest successes. It dealt head-on blows to the State and  easily took over towns, causing the police to flee from many  spots, never to return; it set up checkpoints on roads and  charged tolls to enter certain towns.    SL was able to move in rapidly because its advance guards  were not the first to shatter law and order in the Upper  Huallaga. When they arrived, people in the Peruvian jungle did  not ask who was armed but instead who was not.    The local "mafias" had been armed since the mid-1970's,  first  to defend themselves against gangs of assailants and later to  enforce the law of silence by assassinating mayors, governors,  and newsmen. When Gonzalo's hosts arrived, many of the towns  scattered about the valley had no authorities, and the locals  lived in fear of abuses by the "mafias."    The jungle needed its own brand of law and order, and SL was  the right policeman for the job. "Coca" and "cocaine," not  "eradication," enjoyed the broadest consensus in the zone. In  keeping with the classic literary theme, SL sold its soul  (ideology) for life (territory). The key word in this alliance  was not "socialism," "equality," or "revolution," but rather  "protection." It was the only SL front in which ideology did not  come first and foremost.    SL gained nothing other than the physical territory that it  controlled and the social oversight that it exercised. It could  never command the economy, and the only time that it tried to,  in 1988 when it decreed a strike in Uchiza and outlawed the coca  harvest and the sale of cocaine paste, it met with defeat when  the coca market shifted to the Lower Huallaga and the peasants  rioted.</p>

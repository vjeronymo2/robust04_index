At a press conference following a meeting between Haavisto  and Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec today, the two  ministers assessed relations between their countries as good.  During the meeting, bilateral relations as well as economic  development and European questions were discussed.    Haavisto told journalists that his current two-day visit to  Prague was very important for him.    Zieleniec said the talks provided a good opportunity for  getting acquainted with Finland's experiences in the process of  integration into the European Union (EU) and in its relationship  towards Russia. Zieleniec said the Czech Republic considered an  active promotion of Czech-Finnish relations to be of great use,  adding that Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus would visit Finland next  month and a Finnish parliamentary delegation was expected in  Prague.    Haavisto said Finland was seeking to conclude its  negotiations on membership in the EU by the end of this month.  He said the EU would be one of the most important factors of  future European security and membership in it would thus make it  possible for Finland to participate in its strengthening. He  said Finland was not interested in membership in NATO or any  other new security structures. He described the U.S.  Partnership for Peace project as very good for the development  of security especially in Central and Eastern Europe, adding  that Finland sought to find ways to approach it.    Asked to comment on the statement made by Russian extremist  and chairman of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, that "if Finland was interested in Karelia then  all Finland should go to Russia," Haavisto said that similar  "extraordinary phenomena" also exist elsewhere and that  excessive attention should not be paid to them. He said there  were no problems in relations between Russia and Finland and  that his country has no territorial claims against Russia.    He said that Finland considered its relations with Russia  and  the whole of Europe to be equally important and was striving to  find a solution that would enhance security and stability in  Europe and especially in its northern part.</p>

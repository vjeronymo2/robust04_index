			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / EC ministers pledge tough measures to cut deficits EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday pledged to take tough action to resolve the crisis in public finances among member states and accepted that tax rises might be required to restore budgetary stability. In response to a series of grim warnings from EC central bank governors from the 12 member states, ministers agreed that spending cuts alone might not be enough to reduce public borrowing, which has soared as a result of the recession. Latest estimates by the European Commission show that the aggregate public sector deficit as a proportion of Community gross domestic product is likely to rise to more than 6 per cent this year - the highest level in the Community's 36-year history. Despite mounting evidence of the fiscal crisis facing EC member states, ministers insisted they would stick to the strict targets for economic and monetary union laid down by the Maastricht treaty, including a commitment to reduce individual budget deficits to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Phillipe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister who chaired the meeting, said governments had 'precious little lee-way' for relaxing budget deficits to offset the effects of the recession. Any such move would be short-sighted, he said. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said Britain remained committed to the Maastricht targets. He left open the possibility of tax increases in the November budget to reduce the UK's Pounds 50bn deficit. During yesterday's meeting, ministers gave Mr Clarke a relatively gentle ride over the UK's 'convergence plan' - the forecasts for meeting the Maastricht criteria for Emu. They described the plan as 'ambitious' but 'based on realistic assumptions'. A more vigorous budgetary adjustment might be necessary if the pace of economic recovery proved slower than expected. Two weeks ago, treasury officials from member states meeting in the EC's monetary committee had asked whether the UK was over-estimating the impact of future economic growth on cutting the deficit. Mr Clarke said the UK's forecasts contained tougher targets on spending than convergence plans submitted by other states. He noted the UK was likely to grow faster than its main EC competitors in 1993 and 1994. The meeting was overshadowed by warnings from EC central bank governors and the EC's economic policy committee about the fiscal crisis in the EC. In a submission to the ministers, the central bankers said: 'Concern about the present state of public finances is particularly warranted since the rise in budget deficits over the last few years cannot simply be ascribed to the cyclical downturn. 'They also reflect to a significant extent structural factors which have been adding to imbalances since 1989.' Signalling agreement, finance ministers stressed that structural measures to correct budgetary imbalances were essential so as to return the EC to higher growth.

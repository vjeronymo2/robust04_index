They also expected few impacts from the decision  on their businesses because production in the U.S. now surpasses  exports.    "We view it as an appropriate move amid increasing switches  among Japanese carmakers to local production from exports," said  Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. "We will pursue  a further production shift in the future."    Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., also said  the  Japanese step is in line with an agreement in the Uruguay Round  of multilateral trade talks, completed last December, which  determined voluntary restraints on exports as a "grey-zone"  measure.    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association also said the  step will have "no major impact on Japanese makers because  U.S.-bound Japanese auto shipments have long stayed below annual  ceilings."    Japanese makers, prompted by the yen's appreciation, have  started to boost their production in the U.S. since the latter  half of the 1980s.    In 1993, locally-made cars numbered 1.54 million units,  exceeding exports in volume for the first time ever.    U.S.-bound exports have been below the ceilings since fiscal  1987, and are expected to amount to 1.65 million units in fiscal  1993 through March 31, 300,000 units short of the upper limit.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Observer: PM nabs ex-PM Lady Thatcher has never been noted for her sensitivity but even she must have realised that the idea of a former British PM working for tobacco group Philip Morris would leave some people gasping. After all, Philip Morris sold 640bn cigarettes last year, nearly 12 per cent of the world total, and is second only to the Chinese monopoly in what the anti-smoking lobby says is a lethal business. Lady Thatcher's office was doing its best to limit the damage yesterday, emphasising that Philip Morris was also a purveyor of food, beer and other beverages, and that no contract had yet been signed. If a deal was done, however, Lady Thatcher 'would give ad hoc consultancy advice on geopolitical issues'. Nevertheless, Philip Morris is mainly interested in selling more cigarettes outside the US and the non-smoking Lady Thatcher's international experience and contacts should be invaluable. The consultancy arrangements were supposed to be kept under wraps, which leaves me wondering if Lady Thatcher has signed any other lucrative private deal with public corporations since she gave up full-time politics.</p>

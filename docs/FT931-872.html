			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Closure provisions put Lec in Pounds 2.9m loss LEC Refrigeration, the Bognor Regis-based refrigerator manufacturer, is to close its compressor factory at the end of May, with the loss of 360 jobs, in response to continued weak demand and low margins in the UK market. Lec made the announcement as it reported a Pounds 2.86m before-tax loss in the year to December 31 compared with a Pounds 1.2m profit. The figure was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.46m to cover the cost of the redundancies and restructuring resulting from the closure of the compressor plant, which produced 30,000 units a year. Lec will instead be supplied by Danfoss. Mr Don Durrant, finance director, said EC directives on energy efficiency were 'the last straw' in forcing the closure. The cost of upgrading its compressors to meet EC standards was too great to allow profitable production on the scale of the Bognor plant, he said. The results also suffered from a fall in demand, hit particularly by continued recession in the housing market. Turnover was pushed down by 15 per cent from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 41.1m. What the company called extreme pressure on margins led to an operating loss of Pounds 397,000, compared to a Pounds 1.2m operating profit. Mr Durrant said Lec saw little sign of a sustained upturn. 'Until people start moving house, the cream will not come back into the appliance market,' he said. The company added that there had been a small increase in sales and some signs of a pick up in the housing market. Earnings per share plunged from 13.28p to losses of 31.94p. A reduced final dividend of 5p is recommended for a full year dividend of 9p, compared with 14.5p.</p>

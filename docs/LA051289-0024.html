			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY BASEBALL COACHES TO BOYCOTT GAMES IN EVENT OF STRIKE  </P> <P> A group of City Section baseball coaches said Thursday that they would honor  picket lines and boycott the conclusion of the regular season next week if  teachers carry out a proposed strike against the Los Angeles Unified School  District.  </P> <P> The group of 11 coaches also joined United Teachers-Los Angeles in criticizing  the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn., which has recommended that coaches in all  spring sports continue to supervise their teams even if they participate in the  strike set for Monday.  </P> <P> The position of the coaches' association was unanimously approved by 19  representatives from the 49 City high schools at an emergency meeting Wednesday  at Belmont High. The recommendation conforms to a directive issued this week by  the district, which has reversed its field since the last strike 19 years ago  when coaches who participated in the walkout were forced to the sidelines.  </P> <P> The coaches' association gave its recommendation at the same time the baseball  coaches struck their position. After a seeding meeting for the City 4-A  Division playoffs, the coaches agreed to honor picket lines. They also said  that they will meet Monday to discuss plans for the playoffs if a strike is not  averted. Baseball playoffs begin May 24. The district plans no change in its  athletics schedule and has devised no contingency plan in the event of a  strike.  </P> <P> The union endorsed the baseball coaches and urged the association to change its  stance.  </P> <P> "We're proud of the baseball coaches who took the right stand and are  disappointed in the other coaches," union representative Helen Bernstein said.  "I hope they change their minds. I just don't think they understood the impact  this would have on their colleagues. We're urging the same thing for all  activities, including band and drama. It's not fair to make exceptions for one  group."  </P> <P> Association President Paul Knox, the Dorsey High football and track coach,  lists himself as a strong union supporter. Like most coaches, he has examined  his loyalties this week, weighing his ties to his colleagues against those to  his players. He said that he will strike Monday but will cross picket lines to  coach his athletes in next week's City track semifinals.  </P> <P> "We were trying to come up with something that everyone could live with," he  said. "This is only a recommendation, not a mandate. We're trying now to get  this information out to every school so that this position can be explained. We  don't want people to think we're deliberately doing something detrimental to  the strike."  </P> <P> Some already have reached that conclusion. Chatsworth baseball Coach Bob  Lofrano, the vice president of the coaches association, attended the seeding  meeting instead of the association's emergency meeting. He questioned the right  of the association to make recommendations without consulting more coaches.  </P> <P> "How could they make that decision without having a vote of the rank and file?"  he said. "This is an individual thing, but we don't want coaches to sit on both  sides of the fence. You have to strike as a teacher and a coach. I don't know  how you can differentiate between the two."  </P> <P> Baseball coaches have criticized the district's stance, saying that the  directive was designed to shift parental complaints if sports events are  canceled from the board to the coaches and to undermine union solidarity. Board  and district officials have rejected those charges, saying that the move was  made with the interests of students in mind.  </P> <P> Chatsworth volleyball Coach Steve Berk said that he would urge the other three  coaches whose teams remain alive in the 4-A Division playoffs to honor picket  lines next week at the expense of the semifinal and final rounds.  </P> <P> "I'd love to play and the kids haven't come all this way for nothing. But I  hope the other coaches agree not to play," he said.  </P> <P> Although all coaches believe that the dilemma they face if a strike is called  is severe, those most troubled may be golf and track coaches. A City  championship marks the end of play for other sports, but track and golf finals  also serve as qualifiers for state meets. Taft golf Coach Ray O'Connor and  Birmingham track Coach Scott King said that they will accompany their athletes  next week despite their loyalties to their colleagues.  </P> <P> "For me to walk on my athletes would hurt me for years to come," King said.  "There's no way I could do that. If I have one athlete left, I'll stay with  him. I will come to school because I expect them to come to school. You can't  just walk in in the afternoon and still coach."  </P> <P> Still, some coaches expressed faith in the players' ability to understand  should the coaches boycott events. "The issues here are greater than any one  game," Poly baseball Coach Jerry Cord said. "I know we'll have to face some  seniors who aren't going to be around after this year, but I truly feel the  players will understand."  </P> <P> Some coaches may get the chance to test that understanding Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Observer: Conquering Earl Still on the subject of Earls, Observer doffs his hat to Peter Earl, the 38-year-old merchant banker who helped put Rebecca Stephens on top of the world yesterday. Until now Earl has been better known for organising some of the City's more memorable takeover jaunts than for his extramural activities. However, as joint leader of the 40th anniversary Everest expedition he has set an example which other gung ho corporate finance types might want to ponder. His assistant tells me that Earl will be back at work at the headquarters of his Sloane Corporate Finance boutique first thing on Monday morning.</p>

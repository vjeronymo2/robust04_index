			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Message from His Excellency Khieu Samphan, chairman of the </F> Party of Democratic Kampuchea, to His Majesty the King;" dated  27 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] To His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom  of Cambodia, Royal Palace, Phnom Penh:    Your Majesty, Please allow me to express most profound  thanks  for your message to me dated 24 April 1994. I am happy to  express support for Your Majesty's initiative through the second  formula of convening a roundtable at an appropriate time.    In the current situation, in which insecurity reigns  throughout Cambodia, only a neutral place can provide conditions  for the roundtable meeting to proceed in an atmosphere of  cordiality, national reconciliation, and equality for all  Cambodian sides taking part under the lofty chairmanship of Your  Majesty the King.    Please excuse any improprieties.    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, Party of Democratic Kampuchea  chairman    [Dated] 27 April 1994</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MOVING DAY ARRIVES FOR COLLEGE ANIMALS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: MOORPARK COLLEGE'S NEW TRAINING FACILITY RECEIVES THE FIRST OF 200  INHABITANTS. IT WILL BECOME THE COUNTY'S FIRST PUBLIC ZOO.  </P> <P> With a horde of photographers snapping their every move, Rosie and Fernando  settled into their half-finished $2-million home Friday, high on a windy  hilltop overlooking Moorpark.  </P> <P> Rosie the baboon and Fernando Llama -- a llama, of course -- became the first  animals to move into Moorpark College's new training zoo for the school's  Exotic Animal Training and Management Program.  </P> <P> When the long-awaited facility opens to the public, possibly in September, it  will become Ventura County's first public zoo.  </P> <P> "This facility will be different from any other zoo, in that we train animals,"  said program director Gary Wilson, unveiling the new zoo. "It will emphasize  teaching people about the importance of animals, how they live in the wild and  why we should be concerned about them."  </P> <P> So far, college officials have spent $500,000 to erect cages and fences to hold  the program's nearly 200 animals in the new zoo, Wilson said. The facility,  with a sweeping mountain view, sits on a hill overlooking the original one-acre  compound, which has housed the college's program since it was founded in 1974.  </P> <P> When the new facility is completed, it will encompass about eight acres and  include a 400-seat amphitheater, a replica of a tropical rain forest in a  converted greenhouse, a reptile house, a children's exhibit and a gift shop and  concession stand, Wilson said.  </P> <P> The college has been seeking money to build a large facility ever since  Moorpark officials first raised the idea of a zoo on the campus in 1978.  College district officials subsequently approved the plan in 1985.  </P> <P> The college has raised an additional $500,000 in contributions to continue work  on the zoo but needs $1 million more to complete it, Wilson said.  </P> <P> The Moorpark College Foundation is overseeing the fund raising for the new  facility, officials said.  </P> <P> Lawrence Lloyd, vice president for administrative services, said the college is  counting on grants, private donations and other sources of money to get the zoo  ready for the public by this fall.  </P> <P> Moorpark College is the only school in the nation to offer a scholastic program  in zoo keeping and animal training, Wilson said. Santa Fe Community College in  Gainseville, Fla., has a zoo-keeping program but does not offer animal  training, he said.  </P> <P> About 50 students are enrolled in the program, which teaches them to become  animal trainers and zookeepers. This year's class of 21 students will graduate  next week. Previous graduates have landed jobs in the motion picture industry  as well as in zoos and other animal facilities worldwide, including the Madrid  Zoo and Universal Studios in Florida, said Bill (Briz) Brisby, who founded the  program.  </P> <P> "We started with one wolf on a chain," Brisby said of the program's beginnings  in 1974. At its peak, the program had as many as 800 animals tended by student  zookeepers, he said.  </P> <P> About six years ago, college officials reduced the number of animals by about a  third after the Humane Society found that some animals lacked adequate shelter,  Lloyd said.  </P> <P> Since then, he said, the facility has had "a virtually spotless record."  </P> <P> "We are a place where distressed animals are taken in when we can handle the  situation," Lloyd said. "We have a very good reputation with people who care  about animals."  </P> <P> Next week, college officials will begin transferring other animals to the new  cages. On May 14, two lions and two tigers will move to their new home. The  transfer of all the animals, including a gazelle, a water buffalo, a sea lion  and exotic birds and reptiles, will be completed by early June, officials said.  </P> <P> Before the zoo opens, the school needs to receive accreditation from the  American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. The facility also must be  approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state Department of Fish  and Game.  </P> <P> When it finally opens to the public, however, the zoo will still serve mainly  as a teaching tool, Lloyd said.  </P> <P> "Our primary purpose is not the building of the zoo," Lloyd said. "It's the  expanding of the educational facility for a program that's been in place since  1974."  </P></p>

Ye Bogomolov, A. G. Yankovskiy, Mozhayskiy </F> Military Engineering Institute, St. Petersburg; UDC 519.6:681.3  .06]    [Abstract] Dynamic knowledge is represented in terms of  formulas for the temporal separation of events. Both textual and  graphic descriptions of the formulas are given. The semantics of  the formulas is described. A modification of the rule for  SLD-resolution is the foundation for logical deduction using the  formulas. Dynamic knowledge processing presents the opportunity  to use semantics more flexibly by controlling deduction with  dynamic formation of additional conditions limiting the  combinatorial search of event elements. The recalculation of  attributes is proposed as a way of controlling the search for a  logical deduction. The state of the deduction is represented by  a proof tree, and the values of node attributes can be  recalculated by following different paths through the tree. The  authors used Turbo Pascal to develop a prototype expert system  of dynamic analys is using the principles presented in this  article. Work is continuing on this project: the authors are  creating a more flexible graphic user interface and a subsystem  to automate the formation of dynamic knowledge bases.

In today's programme winter has arrived with temperatures falling to minus 70 and winds rising to 100 mph. All animals bar one try to move away from these, the worst conditions on earth. The exception is the emperor penguin which hunkers down under the southern lights with an egg between its feet (this is the male of the species, of course) as the storms rage (8.00 BBC1).

C4 screens the last in the series about Aids, The Plague (9.00) and BBC2 goes to Northern Ireland for the last of Michael Ignatieff's series about nationalism, Blood And Belonging (9.30).</p>

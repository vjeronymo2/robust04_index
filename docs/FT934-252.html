			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Menem wins vote for second term Argentina's Senate passed early yesterday a bill calling for constitutional reform allowing President Carlos Menem to run for a second term in 1995 and continue his economic reforms, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. The Senate approval, by 38 votes to seven, fulfilled the last requirement for Mr Menem to convene a constitutional assembly next year. The lower house had voted for a reform last week. The reform will permit the removal from the 140-year-old constitution of a clause banning presidents from running for successive terms. Mr Menem struck a deal to that end last month with his predecessor, Mr Raul Alfonsn of the opposition Radical party, who handed over power in a rush in 1989 as hyperinflation threatened to tear the country apart. Four years later, Mr Menem has brought annual consumer price increases down to a single digit from the 5,000 per cent inflation rate during 1989. Mr Menem said this week he was planning to call an election for March 20 to choose delegates to the constitutional assembly. Heeding the terms of the pact between Mr Menem and Mr Alfonsn as the lower house had already done, the Senate went along with the reform bill but stripped it of a clause shortening senatorial terms to four years from nine. The senators say that if presidential terms are to be cut to four years from six, theirs should be cut to six from nine, rather than to four.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Observer: It's a family affair When it comes to open government, Harold Wilson's celebrated kitchen cabinet looks to have been a relatively loosely knit organisation compared with the arrangements being made by Greece's new socialist premier Andreas Papandreou. Far from operating downstairs, his advisory network will reach into the conjugal bedroom, with the appointment of his wife Dimitra to head his private office. It's true that the former Olympic Airways stewardess won't be on the government payroll, and that she has denied having political ambitions. But her influence is already showing, if socialist insiders are to be believed. They claim she was behind the omission from the new official cabinet of another female sharing the prime minister's surname, although not a relation  -Vasso Papandreou, a former trade minister and EC commissioner. Her exclusion certainly seems strange since not only did she get more votes in last week's election than any other parliamentary candidate, but her connections in Brussels could have helped the socialists to woo approval in the European Commission. On the other hand, one who did get a government job, as undersecretary for culture and sport, is journalist George Lianis who, besides having won popularity as a backbencher, happens to be Dimitra Papandreou's cousin. And the junior minister in charge of relations with Greek communities overseas, George Papandreou, is the prime minister's eldest son.</p>

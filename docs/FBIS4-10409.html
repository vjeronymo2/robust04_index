			<p>BFN     [Text] The restriction of consumerism and an increase in  public and private savings will be the guidelines for the  economic policy from now on.    This was announced by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo in an  address to some 60 businessmen during a meeting organized by  Foro, an organization that is headed by Maria Tezanos Pinto and  Eva de Soldati.    The following are the highlights of Cavallo's address:     -  "I am going to continue at the head of the Economy  Ministry for quite a long time. I do not feel that President  Menem is going to ask me to resign in the near future, and I am  not going to submit my resignation."    -  If the Radicals [Radical  Civic Union -- UCR] win the elections and come to head the  government, they will implement the same type of economic policy  that we have implemented.    -  Up to the present time, we have had  favorable international conditions. There was money and a  willingness to invest in Argentina as there was a recession in  the United States, Japan, and Europe. But this recession had an  impact on the markets that receive our exportable products.  Thus to attract a lot of capital to recover the level of  investment and to advance in productive modernization was an  intelligent move.    -  In the future we may not be able to obtain so  much capital for investment. But at the same time there is a  favorable phenomenon -- the recovery of the United States and  the recovery that can be seen on the horizon in Japan and Europe  -- and this will benefit our exports.    -  From now it will be  difficult to obtain resources on the capital market, but it will  be possible to obtain them on the stock market. The difficulty  that could emerge from the international financial markets will  be compensated for by the improved possibilities for placing our  exports.    -  National consumerism will not be able to grow at the  same rate it has grown for the past 3 years. We are going to  have to reduce the growth of consumerism, and thus get the  companies to sell more on the international market.    -  We are not  going to provoke a recession. It would be silly to believe that  the government is going to devalue in order to resolve the  problem of the income of capital.    -  The government is going to  invite families to control the increase in consumer outlays, and  it is going to induce an increase in public and private savings  but without affecting the increase in productive  capability.    -  There will be innovations that will help in the use  of the resources that will be used by the administrations of  pension funds. Article No. 40 of the social welfare reform,  which guarantees the funds that are deposited with the Bank of  the Nation, "is causing problems, and we are going to resolve  these."    -  Cavallo took a poke at Jorge Berardi, the president of  the Stock Exchange, because he had stressed that if the  pensioners waited until 1 August 1994 to sell their YPF  [Government Oil Deposits] shares, the broker would have charged  a lower commission.... "This is very silly, and a lack of  professionalism." He also indicated that if the majority of the  96,000 pensioners that hold shares sold them on that day, then  they would suffer a lot of harm.    -  Regarding brokers, "there are  signs of a lack of maturity and too many individual gambits. It  seems that they play the stock market in the same way one plays  in the casino."</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Halifax acts on confusion over mortgage indemnity Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, has moved to clarify its mortgage indemnity policies by underlining that they do not directly benefit the borrower. The change follows an attack on mortgage indemnity policies by Union Finance, a Southend-based financial adviser, which said that the policies could be interpreted to read that the borrower was indemnified. Most borrowers who take loans of 75 per cent or more of the value of a property have to pay for mortgage indemnity. The policy covers the lender against losing money should the house be sold for less than the outstanding loan. From the beginning of next month Halifax mortgage indemnity policies will be called 'additional mortgage security' and the premiums payable by borrowers are to be called additional mortgage security fees. The society said that the renaming had been planned before Union Finance's challenge to the lenders' interpretation of the policies. Lenders and insurers say that borrowers have no right to protection under mortgage indemnity policies if they cannot pay their mortgage, even though they pay for the cover. Halifax said yesterday: 'Our new definitions should make home buyers more aware of what the policy actually means. It insures the lender, not the borrower.' In a fact sheet sent out to mortgage advisers the society says that customers may misunderstand what mortgage indemnity means. It says: 'This type of additional security is solely for the protection of the society with the costs being met by the customer, who benefits by having access to higher levels of borrowing than would otherwise be available.' Union Finance is charging Pounds 300 to advise home-owners on how to take advantage of the 'loophole' it says it has identified.</p>

HAL has scheduled a stockholders meeting for Oct. 19 to obtain the  required shareholder approval.  </P> <P> Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's largest inter-island airline, also serves Los  Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Anchorage, Las Vegas, Australia, New Zealand,  Guam and other South Pacific islands.  </P></p>

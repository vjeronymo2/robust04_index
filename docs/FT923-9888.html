			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Poles back reforms THE Polish parliament approved constitutional amendments at the weekend giving greater powers to the president and prime minister, agencies report from Warsaw. The Sejm (lower house) adopted the so-called small constitution by 241 votes to 55, with 55 abstentions. The vote was just seven votes above the two-thirds majority needed to pass the amendments, which redefine relations between the government, president and parliament. The package aims to prevent conflicts between the president and the government such as those which accompanied the short-lived goverment of Mr Jan Olszewski, formed in December 1991 and dismissed by the Sejm in June. However, while the amendments allow the president to appoint a cabinet, they prevent him from dismissing it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhao Changchun (6392 7022 2504)] </F>   [Text] Helsinki, 3 May (XINHUA) -- On 3 May, Finnish Prime  Minister Esko Aho met with Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference. The two leaders praised Sino-Finnish  friendship in glowing terms, exchanging views on further  developing friendly relations and cooperation between the two  countries.    Li Ruihuan said: The Chinese and Finnish peoples enjoy a  traditional friendship. Despite changes that have taken place  in the world for an extended period of time since the  establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Finland,  relations between the two countries have always been very good  and can be described as a model of friendly relations and  cooperation between countries with different social systems.  China is satisfied with the smooth development of its relations  with Finland, and appreciates the farsighted China policy  implemented by the Finnish Government.    Li Ruihuan said: The sound development of Sino-Finnish  relations has primarily arisen from mutual respect shown by the  two countries for each other's reality and national conditions,  and for the wishes and political choice of each other's people.  Second, it has stemmed from frequent exchanges, especially  constant exchanges of high-level visits aimed at enhancing  understanding and dispelling misunderstandings. Third, it has  arisen from common development based on equality and  reciprocity. Fourth, it has been brought about by consultation  aimed at seeking common ground while reserving differences.    Li Ruihuan said: China is a developing country engaged in  reform and opening up, whereas Finland is a developed  industrialized nation. There is tremendous potential for  cooperation because both have their own strengths and can  complement each other. China is ready to raise the relations  between the two countries to a new level on the current basis.    Prime Minister Aho said his recent visit to China had been a  great success. He said: Finland and China have successfully  developed their friendly relations and cooperation in all fields  since they established diplomatic relations. Particularly in  recent years, they have made great strides in economic, trade,  scientific, and technological cooperation. Through constant  exchanges of high- level visits in the political arena, the two  sides have found common ground and reached understanding on many  issues. Finland is satisfied with the development of its  relations with China. He said: The Finnish Government attaches  great importance to Chairman Li Ruihuan's current visit, viewing  it as a new effort at developing relations between the two  countries. He expressed the belief that Li Ruihuan's visit  would further the continuous development of mutually beneficial  cooperation between the two countries. Prime Minister Aho asked  Li Ruihuan to convey his regards to Premier Li Peng.</p>

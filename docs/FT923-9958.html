			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Inkatha denounces ANC strike POLITICAL tensions in South Africa heightened yesterday as the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party (IFP) strongly attacked the African National Congress (ANC) 'mass action' campaign, urging supporters to defy the general strike called for Monday. In Johannesburg, Mr Humphrey Ndlovu, a senior IFP official, accused the African National Congress (ANC) of adopting a 'deliberate confrontationist policy of mass action'. An anti-strike march by the IFP is due to take place today in Durban, in the party stronghold of Natal province. The ruling National party made a last-minute plea to the ANC yesterday to call off the strike, saying the country might never recover. The ANC has appealed to strikers and demonstrators to behave peacefully, and said yesterday that leading companies had agreed not to take disciplinary action against striking staff. Between 10 and 12 United Nations observers will be in South Africa to monitor the two-day strike, due to be followed by three days of demonstrations, sit-ins and rallies. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy to South Africa, said last night that he 'hoped and prayed' that the week of protest would pass off peacefully. Mr Vance, speaking shortly before his return to New York last night, will report back to the UN secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, early next week. He made clear that he expects to return to South Africa as part of a UN initiative, and is expected to recommend that the world body attach observers to local institutions, such as the Goldstone commission into township violence, and the National Peace Accord, a body set up last year to help curb political killings. Earlier in the day President FW de Klerk's office said the government and the ANC would hold a further round of talks in 'the near future'. A spokesman confirmed reports of Tuesday's meeting, the first official contact since the ANC suspended negotiations last month, but said no agreement had been reached over the release of remaining political prisoners  - one of the ANC's conditions for the resumption of multi-party constitutional negotiations. In what it called a 'decisive blow' against witness intimidation, the government yesterday announced new laws to protect people testifying about political violence, AP reports from Pretoria.</p>

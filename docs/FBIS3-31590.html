			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Despite the fact that a bill on early elections  sponsored by deputies received the support of as many as 11  deputies from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  yesterday and that another 11 HZDS deputies abstained from the  vote, this movement is still the biggest parliamentary party and  thus a new date for early parliamentary elections cannot be  approved without the HZDS.    Martin Bartisek obtained the answers of Vladimir Meciar, the  movement's chairman and Slovak prime minister, on the following  topical issues.    [Begin recording] [Bartisek] As the word referendum is  likely  to be used with increasing frequency in the days to come, I  would like to ask the following question: Certain political  moves will undoubtedly follow and, as you yourself have said,  there is a chance of reaching a political agreement between  political parties and movements. Following political talks, is  the month of September, when the early elections should be held,  acceptable to you?    [Meciar] [passage omitted] Why should we need such a long  period to organize elections? Who needs it? The later the  elections are held the worse, the worse it will be for the  state, the worse it will be for the economy, and the worse it  will be for the social sphere. That's what the struggle we are  waging with the opposition parties is all about.    As for who is holding the initiative in this respect, then  this is a matter of no consequence. What is important is that  the state benefits, and whether we succeed or not is a matter of  secondary importance to me; the protection of the state has  priority. That's the essence of how I feel and how the HZDS  feels about the elections.    [Bartisek] Still, is September actually realistic for you,  or  will it not be acceptable?    [Meciar] At the moment this is under discussion. All the  parties are engaged in permanent consultations and, until these  talks have ended, I do not want to say anything about their  conclusion.    [Bartisek] In your view, how should the question in the  referendum--the question on which citizens should give their  unequivocal answer--be formulated?.    [Meciar] Let's recall the Slovak Republic's electoral system  and the interpretation of the constitutional provisions which  deputies interpreted to benefit them rather than the people. In  other words, here I am, I have made promises, and I am not  fulfilling my promises. That must not happen. The way in which  the question should be formulated is that the deputies, who  abandoned the initial policies and the parties and movements on  behalf of which they stood, should not thus lose their mandate.  Another reason is that the electoral system is based on  proportional representation of the parties.    The second question should ask whether early elections  should  be held immediately, but no later than June 1994 which is in the  interest of the state.    The third question should ask whether all those are taking  part in privatization should not be compelled to show where  their money for privatization comes from. I would like this to  be included in the referendum, because so far I have been unable  to assert this in any other way. Showing where the money comes  from could be one of the dominant questions in the referendum...    [Bartisek, interrupting] Do you think that you could get  away with putting three questions of such importance to a  citizen in the referendum? Is it actually acceptable?    [Meciar] Yes, I think it is. In technical terms it can be  done. It is possible. These are the three questions which  cannot be answered anywhere else. [end recording]</p>

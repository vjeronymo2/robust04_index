These airplanes are equipped with electrical and electronic systems (such as the digital electronic flight instrument system (EFIS)), which perform critical functions. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions provide the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to ensure that the critical functions performed by these systems are maintained when the airplane is exposed to HIRF. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of these special conditions is October 6, 1994; Comments must be received on or before December 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on these final special conditions; request for comments, may be mailed in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Transport Airplane Directorate (ANM&hyph;100), Docket No. NM&hyph;99, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in triplicate to the Transport Standards Staff at the above address.

This airplane is a derivative of the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100, approved April 21, 1989. The changes include: removal of two plug sections forward and aft of the wing to decrease overall length by 182 inches; two cargo doors in lieu of three; modifications of the aft cargo door due to space constraints associated with the shorter fuselage; one pair of Type III overwing exists in lieu of two pair, and a new nose wheel tire chine. Both the Model F28 Mark 0070 and new production of the Model F28 Mark 0100 will incorporate a hydraulic stick pusher in lieu of a pneumatic stick pusher, new stabilizer control unit, and a new interior. The Model F28 Mark 0070 will have a maximum seating capacity of 79 passengers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amended Type Certification Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Fokker must show that the Model F28 Mark 0070 meets the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU, or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application for the Model F28 Mark 0070. The regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``original type certification basis.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU for the Model F28 Mark 0070 are part 25 of the FAR, as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;60 with certain exceptions which are not relevant to these special conditions. In addition, Fokker has elected to show compliance with certain later requirements which are also not relevant to these special conditions. These special conditions will form an additional part of the certification basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

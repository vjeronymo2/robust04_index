			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: The Chalk Garden Here is a bold revival, especially for this theatre. Enid Bagnold's The Chalk Garden was written in 1956, almost at the same time as John Osborne was writing about Jimmy Porter and the English stage was putting the old upper middle class traditions behind it. Ms Bagnold, as I suppose we would call her now, though she was in fact Lady Jones, the wife of the chairman of Reuters, belonged firmly to the old school of plot, characters, servants and masters, an element of suspense, some symbolism, no swearing and a few witty lines of dialogue. She was different from what came after. Or was she? Watching The Chalk Garden I had an uneasy sense of continuity. The play reminds you of Terence Rattigan, whom the King's Head has also had a shot at reviving. But, in technique, it is not so far apart from Look Back in Anger. It is the social attitudes and the language that have changed. In the Bagnold world it was possible to talk about Aden without guilt and without even mentioning - remember 1956 was the year of Suez - that it was a British colony. There were miscarriages of justice by eminent judges: people went mad, couldn't stand their mother, abandoned their children and went off with lovers. But they referred these matters in an articulate way, sometimes even in front of the servants. The Chalk Garden is a bit heavy on symbolism. Essentially it is that some plants grow on chalk and some do not. 'Whoever tried to grow rhododendrons in a chalk garden? Soil cannot give what it has not got.' says Miss Madrigal, the possible murderess who has served 15 years in prison for a crime we do know if she has committed, or even wholly what it was. And so it goes for people: they need the right environment (not incidentally a word much used in the Bagnold vocabulary). Maitland, the manservant, has been in prison too - for being a conscientious objector. He and the abandoned daughter are fascinated by murders, but so not so much the crime itself as the motivation behind it. In the end it all ends happily enough, though not without a final lump in the throat. The old judge who sentenced Miss Madrigal comes to lunch, the mother returns from the Middle East to pick up her daughter who has been loosely in Miss Madrigal's charge and Miss Madrigal decides to stay with the grandmother determined to grow unexpected plants on chalk. Sentimental perhaps, but dated only in the sense that it belongs to a period. As a vehicle for acting, it is superb. Robert Austin is a marvellous Maitland, Constance Cummings plays the eccentric grandmother in the tradition of the best of English grandes dames and Jean Marsh is full of fluttering feeling as Miss Madrigal. Everyone shines and the piece is directed by Mark Rayment. King's Head Theatre Club 115 Upper Street, N1 Ends May 2 Box Office 071-226 1916</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Coping with recovery Managing the upturn could prove just as demanding as surviving the recession. Businesses frequently run into cash-flow problems when orders increase. London accountants Blick Rothenberg suggest a 10-point programme for managing recovery. Do not try to increase turnover before strengthening your financial position. Speak to your bank manager to ensure that you have adequate facilities. If the bank will not help, consider alternatives such as factoring. Carry out credit checks on your customers. If they become overstretched they may pull you down with them. Review credit limits; use a commercial credit rating agency; chase overdue accounts. Draw up cash-flow plans based on different levels of future sales so that you can see the implications. Be careful about new spending. It may be worth paying comparatively high charges on a short-term lease of a piece of plant in case you need to cancel quickly. Do not be tempted to buy expensive plant, using the 40 per cent first-year tax allowances available until October 1993, unless you had intended to purchase it anyway. The cash-flow benefits could take up to 21 months to come through and you may anyway have 'tax losses' available as a result of the recession. Keep staff levels low and use temporary workers where possible. Review payroll costs each week or month. Monitor the key financial numbers such as order book, sales and debtors each week. Do the same for your stock levels, purchases, creditors and bank balance. Keep a regularly updated three- to four-month cash-flow projection on your desk. Most businesses do not need to prepare profit and loss accounts more than once a quarter. Save time and money by reducing needless paperwork. The weekly information described above will be sufficient. When you have dealt with these immediate issues, draw up a three- or four-year business plan.</p>

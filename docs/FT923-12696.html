			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (2): Keep the customer happy - A look at facilities and services on offer Not too long ago, in the days before the term personnel manager became director of human resources, it used to be the responsibility of the office manager to ensure that a firm's premises were clean and functional; that the lifts worked and the lavatories were supplied; and that any legal matters relating to terms of occupation were drawn to the attention of the board. Not any more. The growth of information technology, together with the recession, has led to companies becoming conscious of the need to monitor costs, as well as making the best use of expensive floorspace. Furthermore, in a highly competitive market landlords are also highly aware of the need to keep existing tenants happy, and to attract new ones with well-managed, attractive and value-for-money working environments. The result is that property management and facilities management are now among the few growth areas in a beleaguered property market. Claims for the benefits of the services offered by the various consultants and contractors in the property management field are becoming increasingly extravagant. A whole new vocabulary of buzz words has developed. The hapless and, understandably, often bewildered successor to the old-fashioned office manager is now bombarded with offers of health checks, smart or intelligent buildings, environmental energy audits, thermographic surveys - and so on. Leaving aside this barrage of hype, there is a growing sophistication in the modern methods of managing property, from both the strategic and the occupational points of view. Moreover, there is no shortage of expertise available to a building owner or occupier, in asset management and in cost effective, comfortable and efficient occupation. Traditional property management techniques have been updated constantly in recent years with the aid of computers. And most firms offering property management as a service now have impressive databases. Martin Clews of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith explains that the firm's computer database includes comprehensive details of all individual properties. Besides basic physical information - which will include site plans and floor plans drawn by computer aided design, and will soon include actual photographs - all leases, covenants and other obligations under leases are recorded, along with schedules of critical dates for such items as lease renewals, service of relevant legal notices and other statutory matters. Other entries will monitor planning consents and their implications; set rolling refurbishment and/or maintenance programmes and log environmental issues, insurance records and valuations for various purposes; for example, a company's balance sheet, rating and insurance. There may also be schedules for internal repairs and inspection and maintenance of plant and machinery such as lifts, water towers, and so on. All are part of the overall strategic management of an individual building or a portfolio. They come up for consideration when wider issues arise - such as whether a property should be sold, sub-let, refurbished or redeveloped for a different use. Further strategic questions could relate to the acquisition of adjacent land, the obtaining of more valuable consents, or entering into joint ventures. The manager will also be responsible for the financial tasks of collecting rents and other dues, the apportionment of service charges, full accounting for income and outgoings. Alongside this strategic management, and in many cases overlapping it, is day-to-day functioning of buildings. This is where the new discipline of facilities management comes in. The facilities manager is responsible for a range of services: cleaning, maintenance, security, heating and air-conditioning, telecommunications, computer networking, electrical and other energy supplies and, sometimes, landscaping and space planning. These may be handled in-house by an on-site manager. But there is a growing trend to sub-contract some or the entire package to outside firms. Besides companies such as BET and P&amp;O, competitors in this relatively new field of specialisation, most of which claim to offer a one-stop shop service, include some with connections with the larger computer companies. One of them, Procord, is the result of a management buy-out of a significant part of IBM's UK property management function. The staff, led by managing director John Jack, IBM's former UK property manager, has a 51 per cent stake in the company; IBM retains 49 per cent. Mr Jack says that, coming as it does from a computer-culture environment, the firm understands the comprehensive changes in the way companies organise their work; and the consequent use of space. He points out that, in today's organisational 'churn,' it is invariably cheaper and more effective to relocate people in computer-networked offices than to move work stations. One possible solution for building owners confused by the claims and counter-claims of property management surveyors and the new facilities management specialists is to use both in a partnership which brings together the two sides of the strategic and day-to-day management equation. For example, IBM appointed Weatherall Green &amp; Smith and Procord to work together in the letting, asset management and on-site management of 103 Wigmore Street, a 106,000 sq ft office building in London's West End which became surplus to IBM's requirements. Both say this has worked well. Another consequence of the competitive, oversupplied office market in the City is that property management surveyors and facilities managers are finding new aspects of their roles; they now also have a part to play in the on-going marketing effort. David Smith of surveyor Richard Ellis cites Royal London's 220,000 sq ft Triton Court in the City, where several measures have been taken to attract new tenants and to retain existing tenants. In this market, says Mr Smith, the landlord/tenant relationship needs to be seen as that of supplier and customer. The building management team must monitor customer feedback - and be the first to know if there are any rumbles of complaint. Tenants at Triton Court can now take advantage of - among other things  - their own gym, a restaurant, a shoe-shine service. They even have a 'tenant's charter.' The aim is to keep customers satisfied.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan will urge China to  persuade North Korea to accept international inspections of its  nuclear facilities, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Wednesday.    Hata made the remarks at the House of Representatives Budget  Committee, answering questions about Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa's scheduled visit this weekend to China and South Korea.    "China has great influence over North Korea. It is making  various kinds of dialogue efforts and I hope it continues them,"  Hata said.    Kakizawa's visit was arranged for emergency consultations on  North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program and potential  punitive measures against Pyongyang, according to government  sources.    Cabinet Legislation Bureau chief Takao Ode said at the same  session that if Japan resorts to force following a possible U.N.  Security Council resolution on sanctions, the action would  violate the war-renouncing Constitution.    At a separate session of the lower house Foreign Affairs  Committee, Kakizawa reiterated Japan's stance that it does not  immediately urge economic sanctions against Pyongyang.    The foreign minister said he hopes the United States keeps  Japan's reluctance in mind at a Security Council meeting now in  session.    Kakizawa denied a possibility that Japan, South Korea and  the  U.S. will impose sanctions outside the framework of the Security  Council if China, Pyongyang's last remaining ally, vetoes them.    The U.S. has called on other Council members to join in a  proposal to slap sanctions on North Korea for downloading some  8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods from a nuclear reactor, a move  that the U.S. warns could lead to the production of several  nuclear bombs.</p>

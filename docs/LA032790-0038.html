			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL OKS DRASTICALLY CUT FUND FOR HOUSING  </P> <P> Following through on a vow to address the city's dire shortage of affordable  homes, a bare majority of the San Diego City Council approved a $12.9-million  trust fund Monday to create low-cost housing and provide rental subsidies for  the working poor.  </P> <P> But the funding, which establishes one of the key legislative initiatives of  Councilman Wes Pratt and the council's more progressive majority, is less than  25% of the $54 million earmarked when the program was first approved in  December.  </P> <P> Faced with a looming budget crisis and strong opposition from four council  members and some segments of the public, the five-member majority agreed Monday  to raise funds from only two sources: $12 million from a fee on new commercial  and industrial developments and $900,000 in hotel room taxes.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Pratt called the 5-4 vote "one of the most important steps in the  history of housing in San Diego."  </P> <P> "I think, finally, this city can say in good conscience that we believe in  housing our working poor and are making efforts to do that," he said.  </P> <P> Pratt was joined by Council Members Abbe Wolfsheimer, John Hartley, Linda  Bernhardt and Bob Filner -- the same coalition that gave conceptual approval to  the trust fund Dec. 11.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Council Members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson and  Judy McCarty opposed the measure, saying the trust fund should be considered  this spring along with other city programs that will be competing for money in  the midst of the city's budget crisis. City Manager John Lockwood has forecast  an $60-million shortfall in the revenue needed to keep city services at current  levels for the fiscal year that begins July 1.  </P> <P> "It is a tax," Roberts said. "It's one of the major taxes in the history of  this city, and we're doing that in the face of a major budget deficit that we  have to resolve."  </P> <P> But Pratt served notice that he wants the council to consider adding money to  the trust fund when it reviews next year's budget.  </P> <P> Henderson repeated his belief that most of the money will go to "income  subsidies" rather than construction of new homes, an approach he condemned.  </P> <P> "How many new housing units will there be (built) in this city from the $13  million?" he asked. "I have the suspicion that the answer is zero."  </P> <P> Under the plan, an 11-member board of trustees will distribute the money to a  variety of programs, including nonprofit home builders, private developers  willing to mix low-cost housing in with their developments,  housing-rehabilitation projects, purchase of existing apartments and direct  income subsidies.  </P> <P> The trustees could allocate as much as $500,000 per project. The council still  must decide whether larger expenditures must go before the city's Housing  Commission for approval.  </P> <P> As envisioned by the Housing Commission, which sponsored the plan, 60% of the  money would be spent on rental housing for families earning less than $18,250  annually; 20% would go for rental housing for families earning between $18,250  and $29,360; 10% would help families earning less than $36,700 buy their first  homes, and 10% would pay for transitional housing for the homeless.  </P> <P> San Diego has been called the nation's least-affordable rental market, based on  the difference between the average income and the average rental price.  According to the city's Planning Department, 80,000 families need affordable  housing, and the number will increase by 4,500 annually. Yet the city has  constructed just 258 apartments in their price range during the past three  years.  </P> <P> In addition, just 21% of San Diegans can afford to buy homes, according to one  study.  </P> <P> With the tourism industry and other business sectors continuing to bring the  city an influx of low-paid service workers, "our biggest need in this city is  for good old, garden-variety rental housing," said Evan Becker, the Housing  Commission's executive director.  </P> <P> The vast majority of the funding for the program will come from a new fee to be  assessed on all non-residential construction, beginning with final passage of  the ordinance, expected next month. The fee ranges from 50 cents per square  foot of newly built warehouse space to $2 per square foot of new office space.  Hotels, research and development facilities, retail stores and manufacturing  plants also will pay the fee.  </P> <P> In addition to the $12.9 million approved Monday, the council will later  determine whether to transfer to the trust fund $4.5 million set aside for  housing by the city's Redevelopment Agency. The transfer would direct the money  to poorer residents and would allow its expenditure outside the downtown area.  </P></p>

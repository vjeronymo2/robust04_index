			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Employers cannot make law on disabled work Sir, Your report ('Most employers found to flout disabled quotas law', August 3) misses the point. Employers cannot make this law work. The quota system is unsatisfactory and there is no obvious way of making it effective, as the Department of Employment's 1990 Consultative Document 'Employment and Training for People with Disabilities' clearly stated. According to a study by Social and Community Planning Research carried out for the government in 1990, if all people with disabilities in work were registered, the likelihood is that the 3 per cent quota level would be exceeded. But there is no compulsion to register and many people with disabilities object strongly to such categorisation. People with disabilities can be exceptionally valuable employees. More employers need to be aware of what they can offer and how they can be developed - many managers, for example, remain unaware of their generally favourable sickness records. For that reason the CBI has urged the government to replace the outmoded and inoperable quota system with a strengthened and improved code of good practice and to create a more effective framework of encouragement, training and support. Until such a change in policy is effected, studies will inevitably show the quota system failing to work.

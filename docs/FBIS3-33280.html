At an official ceremony, the high-ranking  military official disclosed that Julio Martinni, Guatemalan  ambassador to the United Nations, made two requests in which he  asked that Guatemala be allowed to join UN forces that provide  social and defensive support to countries facing armed conflicts.    Enriquez said the Army is preparing four platoons comprising  military policemen, civil affairs specialists, experts in  psychological operations, nurses, and other specialists who will  be able to join the UN peacekeeping forces at any time. He  added that the military forces are currently capable of meeting  the requirement of providing soldiers but that they are not  capable of creating a logistical battalion in Guatemala, as  requested, because of a lack of economic resources.    Minister Enriquez explained that those Guatemalans who will  participate in the peacekeeping forces will remain on reserve or  on waiting lists, beginning in March, enabling them to be ready  whenever their help is needed. He added that this is the first  time the Army will be taking part in such activities.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELF-SERVING SUPERVISORS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisors are trying to settle a voting-rights lawsuit  against them out of court. But the 3-2 vote in favor of the settlement reflects  their bitter division over a proposed settlement that fails to satisfy anyone  involved except the three men who voted for it to protect their political  hides.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Justice Department, which claims that  supervisors violated the Voting Rights Act when they reapportioned their  districts in 1981, deliberately dividing the county's large Latino population  among three districts. The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  and the American Civil Liberties Union later joined the case. Under the plan,  more Latinos would be in Pete Schabarum's district, which already includes some  heavily Latino cities in the eastern county.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Schabarum voted against the plan. So did Mike Antonovich, who  fears the county may be forced to pay some of the attorneys' fees run up by  MALDEF and ACLU -- something he should have thought of when the supervisors  first began dragging their feet on a lost cause. The trio that approved the  plan, Deane Dana, Ed Edelman and Kenneth Hahn, did so because they want to keep  their secure districts and they don't like the often abrasive Schabarum.  </P> <P> The fact that Latinos have been excluded from the board is a wrong that must be  corrected. But when 8 million people are governed by a tiny clique of five  politicians, no one is well-represented.  </P> <P> So before approving the proposed settlement, U.S. Dist. Judge Robert V. Kenyon  -- whose powers of persuasion have gotten the complex case this far along  towards resolution -- should push the supervisors to consider alternatives,  particularly expanding the board to seven or nine members. That would give them  all a chance at political survival. More importantly, it would give all county  voters a chance to elect a more representative board.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD BRIEFS: ABCS OF FOOD SAFETY FOR CHILDREN  </P> <P> A coalition of trade groups has created a food safety educational program for  grade-school children. The effort, called "Play It Safe: Goals for Food  Safety," was developed in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture  and the American Academy of Pediatrics.  </P> <P> The program is designed for students in grades four through six and attempts to  define the role young consumers can play in ensuring a safe food supply.  </P> <P> "Today with more dual-income families, greater numbers of children are  preparing lunches, after-school snacks and family meals. The lesson plans  stress the importance of safe food handling and preparation," the coalition  announced.  </P> <P> The program was distributed to 15,000 elementary schools earlier this year. The  four-lesson plan discusses microbiological contamination, how to reduce  food-borne illnesses and various government agencies' responsibilities in  regulating the food industry.  </P> <P> Among the groups sponsoring "Play It Safe" are the American Meat Institute, the  National Fisheries Institute and the Food Marketing Institute.  </P> <P> Battling 'Junk Food' -- A consumer group also has children's interests in mind  with its announcement of a new nutrition campaign last week.  </P> <P> The effort is being coordinated by the Center for Science and the Public  Interest, a Washington-based advocacy group. Key elements of the "Children's  Nutrition Campaign" will be to prevent manufacturers from promoting "junk food"  to children and to challenge federal agencies to increase regulatory efforts in  this area.  </P> <P> "It's shameful that major companies are knowingly marketing junk foods to  children," said Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director. "Just turn  on Saturday-morning television and you'll see how the nation's cleverest  marketing experts are taking advantage of 5-year-old children."  </P> <P> The importance of such a program, according to the Center for Science, is to  improve the overall health of America's children. The group, for instance,  claims that obesity among young people increased by 54% in the past 20 years.  Further, obesity in teens can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood  pressure or diabetes in adulthood.  </P> <P> The center also reported that high cholesterol levels are beginning to be seen  in adolescents, a condition that can precipitate heart-related illness later in  life.  </P> <P> The campaign will single out those children's products it believes are not  healthful. The group also plans on launching educational efforts on nutrition  in schools.  </P> <P> Upgrading Corn Chips -- One development that may even please the Children's  Nutrition Campaign is a recent reseach report that indicates the protein levels  of fried corn snacks, such as chips, can be doubled.  </P> <P> The study, published by the Journal of Food Science, found that the addition of  soybeans or garbanzo beans to these products "provided two times more protein  than corn flour alone."  </P> <P> The article, written by N.G. Almeida-Dominquez, claimed that "fried corn snacks  popular among children and teens may soon be nutritious options for  between-meal munching."  </P> <P> Fortifying the snacks with soybean or garbanzo beans may be possible at the  same manufacturing cost of current products or may even cost less, the journal  reported.  </P> <P> Communicating Chemicals -- A federal agency is co-sponsoring a toll-free  telephone number that offers callers information on pesticides 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with Texas Tech  University, have launched the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network.  According to a report in Nutrition Week, the line will be staffed by chemical  specialists with backgrounds in agriculture, the environment or public health.  The newsletter expressed hope that the hotline would disseminate "impartial  information."  </P> <P> The pesticide hotline is (800) 858-7378.  </P> <P> Pesticide Correction -- A recent story on the United Fresh Fruit &amp;  Vegetable Assn.'s annual convention incorrectly listed the percentage of  pesticide residues being found on produce by federal health officials.  </P> <P> The actual figure for 1988, or the last year for which data is available,  indicated that the figure varied between imported and domestic produce. For  instance, 49% of the domestic fruit sampled by FDA contained no residues versus  58% of the imported fruit tested. Sixty-five percent of the domestically-grown  vegetables were found to be free of pesticide residues compared to 60% of the  imported samples.  </P> <P> Illegal chemical levels were found in less than 1% of the domestic and imported  produce analyzed. Less than 2% of the 14,336 items sampled were found to be  technical violations, or showed evidence of a compound that was not approved  for use on that particular crop. The remaining 40% to 50% of the total sample  contained legal amounts of pesticide residue, according to the agency.  </P> <P> The figure used in the Feb. 22 story indicated that 96% of the fruit and  vegetables tested did not contain residues. However, this percentage applies to  all foods tested by FDA, including meats, grains and seafoods as well as  produce and includes those items that contained legal chemical residues as well  as no detectable amounts.  </P></p>

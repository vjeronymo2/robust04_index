			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Tarmac says house sales hit by rate rise House sales have halved during the two weeks since UK interest rates rose by a half percentage point, according to Tarmac, the country's second largest housebuilder. Tarmac yesterday announced a nine-fold rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 23.1m during the first six months of this year on turnover down from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.16bn. Its share price fell 9 per cent, from 146p to 132 1/2 p, on fears that UK housing sales, which the company said 'had been patchy over the summer', had been dented further by the interest rate rise. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, said: 'Net reservations after allowing for cancellations have been running at about 50 to 70 a week since the interest rate rise, compared with 100 to 150 previously.' It was too early to tell whether this trend would continue, he said. The weather had been poor recently and might have deterred some potential purchasers from visiting show homes, while mortgages and house prices in relation to earnings remained very cheap. 'The fundamentals are still sound for prospective purchasers. There is nothing to suggest that this is anything more than a hiatus,' Mr Simms said. The autumn is the second most important selling period for housebuilders, after early spring. Tarmac, which had been expected to complete 6,500 to 7,000 house sales this year, said the outcome was likely to be near the lower figure, 'if not below it'. Mr Simms said higher margins meant the UK housing division was still likely to meet its profit forecast for this year. The company, in spite of plans to increase house construction by 10 per cent to 15 per cent next year, expected to reduce the proportion of capital employed in UK housing from 40 per cent in 1988 to 25 per cent by 1996. Housing profits in the first half rose by 23 per cent from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 18.9m in spite of Tarmac's selling 19 per cent fewer homes. The average price, however, rose from Pounds 78,400 to Pounds 83,900 increasing operating margins from 6 per cent to 8.7 per cent. UK profits from sand, gravel, ready mixed concrete and coated stone more than doubled from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 14.2m helped by higher prices and increased volume sales - due in part to increased housebuilding by other UK companies. Profits from UK brick and concrete block sales similarly increased from Pounds 1m to Pounds 4.5m. Tarmac's US operations moved from a Pounds 1.2m loss to a Pounds 1.2m profit. Construction profits, however, declined from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 6m reflecting over-capacity in the UK contracting industry. The company proposed a maintained interim dividend of 3p. Earnings per share of 1.6p compared with a 0.6p restated loss. Stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 105m for this year and Pounds 155m in 1995 after a full-year loss of Pounds 43.1m in 1993.</p>

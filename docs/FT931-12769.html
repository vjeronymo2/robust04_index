			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Sumitomo Bank lowers profits forecast by 84% SUMITOMO Bank yesterday reduced its pre-tax profits forecast by 84 per cent and announced plans for the write-off of Y100bn (Dollars 795m) of exposure to Itoman, a collapsed trading house. Other large Japanese banks are expected to follow Sumitomo in announcing large write-offs and appraisal losses on stocks to take advantage of strong core earnings this year, which have been lifted by favourable margins following a reduction in interest rates. Sumitomo said that its expected revenue for the year ending March remained unchanged at Y3,250bn, but the parent pre-tax profit forecast was cut to Y25bn from Y160bn and the consolidated forecast was reduced to Y35bn from Y180bn. Apart from writing-off Y100bn of exposure to Total Resort Life, an Itoman group company, the bank said that earnings would be hurt by the weakness of the stock market, suggesting that it would report a large appraisal loss on its stock portfolio. The announcement came a day before the formal establishment of the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), an industry body designed to help clear the debris from the collapse of the asset bubble, which has left banks with an increasing burden of non-performing, property-related loans. From next Monday, the CCPC will buy the rights to the collateral of non-performing loans. This will allow banks to write-off their exposure more quickly and, in theory, put a floor under falling property prices through the independent assessment of the collateral. Sumitomo has taken responsibility for dealing with Itoman, which is to be absorbed on April 1 by Sumikin Bussan, a metals trader and another member of the Sumitomo group. As part of that plan, Sumitomo will write-off Y100bn this year, leaving it with an estimated Y500bn in Itoman group loans, which a bank official said would be reduced over the next five to six years. The bank attempted to restructure Itoman, but conceded last year that the trading house, implicated in art and stock scandals, was beyond help and that its reputation had been permanently tarnished.</p>

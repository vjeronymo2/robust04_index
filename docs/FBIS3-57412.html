			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] This morning's meeting between President Yeltsin of  the Russian Federation and Boris Fedorov in the Kremlin, which  took less than a half hour, did not have a positive outcome. As  you know, Fedorov refused to join the reorganized government on  20 January, saying he would only stay on as Finance Minister if  Vice Premier Zaveryukha and the head of the Central Bank, Viktor  Gerashchenko, left the Cabinet of Ministers. Boris Fedorov  declined the invitation to stay on as Minister of Finance in the  reorganized government, justifying his refusal on the grounds  that Boris Yeltsin's offer to him was made without regard for  the conditions which Fedorov put forward.    Boris Yeltsin has accepted Boris Fedorov's resignation.</p>

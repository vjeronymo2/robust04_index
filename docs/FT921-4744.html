			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: My house will be our house THE HOUSE my husband and I live in is in my name only. It is a freehold property, value approximately Pounds 200,000, registered with the Land Registry and we purchased it in October 1987. There is a mortgage of Pounds 30,000 on it with the Halifax Building Society. We would like to transfer the title into our joint names. There would be no transfer of money. This would be a true joint ownership where the property transfers to the survivor if one party dies ie: not the tenancy in common type. What would be involved in doing this? Could we do it ourselves, without using a solicitor? Would the building society insist on also transfering the mortgage to joint names? What would this involve? How much would this cost? You can carry out the work yourself; the cost would be the registration fees if the property is registered land (ie. the title is registered at H M Land Registry). You would need to execute a transfer into joint names and lodge it at the registry for registration. If you transfer the legal estate in this way the mortgagee will require the creation of a fresh charge and the issue of a new charge certificate. The cost, using a solicitor approved by the building society, should not exceed Pounds 200 if there is no further complication in the conveyancing, but you should ask the solicitor to give you a figure in advance of employing him. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAII OPINIONS  </P> <P> We frowned but will accept Jerry Hulse's description of our resort as "gigantic  and expensive." On our size, we need all this space to offer all the activities  we do and still ensure none of our guests are crowded or disturbed in whatever  they care to do.  </P> <P> About our expense, no question about it, we are not cheap. Yet, we absolutely  live by the phrase: "You get what you pay for." If for any reason a guest does  not believe he or she has received the value for the money spent, our entire  staff is trained to rectify the situation immediately.  </P> <P> There is one characterization we take absolute exception to. Again we quote:  "It is representative of other mega-resorts that are out of touch with the old,  unspoiled Hawaii, the fragile beauty of which is rapidly disintegrating --  along with a culture and gentleness of its people that was so special to these  islands."  </P> <P> We built the beach on our man-made lagoon because we did not remove one rock  from our natural lava shoreline. We continue to preserve the same ancient  petroglyphs outside our front door as each of the Kohala Coast hotels take  pride in doing.  </P> <P> Regarding the fragile beauty of the land you accuse us of disintegrating: We  are the first and, to my knowledge, the only resort on the island of Hawaii to  recycle its garbage. It should be added that only because of our size are we  able to afford the expense of recycling.  </P> <P> Lastly, regarding the lost culture and gentleness of our people. On behalf of  the 2,100 employees of the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, most of whom have lived  their entire lives in Hawaii, I defy you to find a group of people, anywhere in  the world, who takes greater pride in practicing its culture and who is more  genuine, friendly and dedicated to service.  </P> <P> Jerry Hulse may prefer smaller, quaint resorts to our alternative, which is his  prerogative. But please don't confuse your preference or our size and array of  activities with a lost commitment on our part to the three most basic elements  that make Hawaii the greatest destination on earth: our water, our land and our  people. We have not lost touch with that reality.  </P> <P> JOE HIGGINS  </P> <P> Sales Manager  </P> <P> Hyatt Regency Waikoloa  </P> <P> Hawaii  </P></p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: English under the kilt? - An anthology of Scottish verse THE FABER BOOK OF 20th CENTURY SCOTTISH POETRY edited by Douglas Dunn Faber Pounds 17.50, 424 pages THERE IS a problem about Scotland, Scots and Scottishness - that much is undeniable. Is she a province and her culture a provincial adjunct to English culture? Or does she possess her own proud national identity and, along with that, a culture that somehow embodies it? Or is English now the true - in fact, the only - language of Scotland? Is it merely an act of emotional recidivism to claim otherwise; to assert, for example, that Gaelic culture (there are only 80,000 Gaelic speakers in Scotland) could expect even to exist without artificial sustenance ? As Douglas Dunn makes clear in what must be the longest introduction to an anthology of contemporary poetry for many a year, Scotland and her writers have been wrestling with these sorts of problems since the Act of Union in 1707, but the arguments were brought to a particularly combative head by the great, impassioned debate between Hugh MacDiarmid and Edwin Muir in the 1920s. Hugh MacDiarmid (he was born CM Grieve and the assumption of the MacDiarmid identity was coterminous with his decision to become the official representative of the Scottish Literary Renascence), a man who could be gentleness itself when in private company but a creature upon whom a red mist seemed to descend when he rose to fulminate from a public platform, held that the Scottish psyche needed to be cleansed of all English influence; the way in which Robert Louis Stevenson had expressed the dissimilarity between the two nations - the Scots, he said, were to be known for 'a strong Scotch accent of the mind' - was simply not good enough. What was needed, argued MacDiarmid, was a movement that, in building a new national literature, would construct a national identity. And that meant the creation of a new language: Lallans. Unfortunately, the language that he devised was a wholly artificial one, consisting of obsolete words culled from out-of-print dictionaries that the inhabitants of the Lowlands merely gaped at. Could such a language as this ever hope to underpin even a literary - let alone a political - nationalism? MacDiarmid's philological verve, his linguistic recklessness, his pillaging of dictionaries for the most abstruse gems imaginable, remind us of his American counterpart, Ezra Pound - they share an eccentricity of scholarship which, when let loose in the real world of politics, quickly moved in the direction of a naive and exceedingly dangerous demagoguery. Edwin Muir, on the other hand, thought English the only authentic language for Scottish poetry; MacDiarmid and others condemned that as lese-majeste. Their quarrel became a celebrated enmity of the kind all-too-familiar to those who have grown up in a small house such as Scotland is. The poetry that Dunn himself has chosen to represent the achievements of Scotland in his century gives us, as one might expect, a whole host of equivocal answers to these questions of theory. The voice of poetry itself seems to say: Scotland is neither a nation nor a province. For some it is one, and to another it is the other. And to a third group - those who exist in the naive state of spending their lives staring at plants, animals and other people - the problem seems not to exist at all. There are, indeed, three languages at work here - Scots, Gaelic and English  -and they provide us with a remarkably rich and complicated story. Gaelic has endured and its poetry does, indeed, possess a nostalgia for a remoter and more harsh civilisation than ours. But to deny that the poets writing in it possess authentic voices is akin to denying the authentic thrill of archaeological discovery. Civilisations do co-exist, one upon another; and to see and to feel with our forebears gives back to us something of what we were and are. But Scotland's poetry also has the capacity to be contemporaneous and richly experimental - consider the 'Glasgow Sonnets' of Edwin Morgan, for example; and it is also being written in Tom Leonard's Glasgow vernacular, the real speech of genuinely uncouth people. And if many of these poems sound at times like the lamentations of a rootless people, is it for us - or them - to condemn a finely-crafted piece of work on the grounds of melancholia? We may as well condemn ourselves for being alive.</p>

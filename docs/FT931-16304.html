			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Profits slip 9% at Swiss bank BANCA del Gottardo, the Lugano-based bank in which Sumitomo Bank of Japan has a 55 per cent interest, said net profit fell 9 per cent last year to SFr42m (Dollars 30m) because of increased provisions for bad loans, writes Ian Rodger. But the directors described the result as 'satisfactory' in a year of volatile financial markets and a fresh deterioration of the debt situation in Switzerland and abroad. They propose to maintain the dividend at SFr20 per share and participation certificate. Cash-flow rose 13 per cent to SFr125m, due to good results in foreign exchange, the satisfactory trend of interest margins and an extraordinary SFr17m dividend from Gotthard Finance International.</p>

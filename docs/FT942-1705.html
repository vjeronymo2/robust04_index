			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Society defends insolvency practice The Society of Practitioners of Insolvency yesterday defended the practice by which bankers can appoint as receivers the same firm of accountants they initially hired to investigate a troubled company. Critics have said there may be a potential conflict of interest in the arrangement and have called for an independent inquiry. The society said a consultation it carried out with the accountancy profession's joint ethics committee two years ago concluded that the 'overwhelming majority' of those asked supported the position. But details from the survey submitted to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last year show that 30 per cent believed there was a conflict.</p>

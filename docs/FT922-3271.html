			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Bark from the Tory pups The Danes, bless them, have put the fun back in British politics. One account of last week's cabinet meeting concerns a junior minister at the foreign office, Mr Douglas Hogg. He read out a paper that affirmed the government's intention to proceed with ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, when the time seems ripe. When he had finished, it is said, he muttered darkly that he did not believe a word of it. This has been written up in some of the newspapers as both a dastardly attack on the absent foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, and a daring charge by a supposed centre-forward of the anti-Maastricht brigade, the self-same Mr Hogg. Other accounts, from several of the grown-up ministers present, have it that when a low-status outsider comes into the cabinet room he or she usually sits in the most conspicuous seat, and reads from a departmentally prepared brief. This sounds a bit like a child creeping shyly downstairs to a posh dinner party, bearing an important telephone message. In Downing Street the appearance of a comic junior like Mr Hogg can be an occasion of some jollity. 'Hoggy,' one minister said, 'was just being Hoggy.' He was, I have been trebly assured, simply adding a characteristic throwaway line. It helps if you picture him in pyjamas and dressing gown, pouting slightly. That pantomime was followed by this week's startling news that the secretary for social security, Mr Peter Lilley, had publicly stated that he supported the government's policy on Europe. He also supported Mr John Major. We were simultaneously informed that Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, agreed with Mr Lilley. Always mindful of duty I thereupon asked a number of other ministers whether they too planned to issue statements in support of the prime minister. The light-hearted nature of the inquiry seemed difficult for them to grasp. 'What - me?' was the common reply. 'My loyalty has never been doubted.' Did that mean that Mr Lilley's was? 'No.' What did it mean? 'It means,' said one senior minister, 'that inexperienced puppies sometimes have to be slapped down.' I would not describe either Mr Lilley or Mr Portillo thus. Both are known to be strongly opposed to an accretion of power by a centralised Brussels bureaucracy, but I have no reason to believe that either of them has been disloyal. Neither seems to have had the slightest intention of resigning from the government. What would they resign for? The cabinet does not disagree with them. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Hurd has argued in favour of a European superstate. The prime minister and the foreign secretary both insist that the Maastricht Treaty represents a victory for the proponents of free co-operation by national governments. Neither would contemplate putting the bill to ratify it back before the Commons until it is certain that it will get through. The tricky question before Mr Major is: will that day ever come? The answer depends on events beyond his control. If the Irish vote Maastricht down next Thursday that will be the end of it. If they vote in favour we will await the French referendum in the autumn. If they say yes, it is back to the Danes. Meanwhile the bill will remain on the shelf. The prime minister, who hugely enjoys the game of day-to-day politics, is not about to risk a head-on clash with his own party, not if he knows he will lose. All of this has enlivened the Conservatives' little Englanders, xenophobes, anti-Europeans, unreconciled members of the Thatcherite Old Right, and Mr Kenneth Baker. They put out scurrilous stories. They inspire mischievous articles. They make unhelpful remarks. Long-winded and learned theses about the biggest split among Conservatives since the last biggest split appear almost daily. The cacophony is sufficient to wake the dead, although not yet, it appears, the Labour party. There are faint stirrings, but the party of Mr Neil Kinnock, soon to be that of Mr John Smith, has not yet appreciated that these are promising times for an opposition. The summer is therefore likely to belong to the Tory anti-Europeans. They appear to believe that the Danes cut the rope, that the British Isles can float away free from the European mainland. They have enjoyed many another summer, until the logic of history and geography has obliged one government or another to participate in whatever the continentals have been up to at the time. The prime minister is aware of this. It is worth noting that at the Earth Summit in Rio he has signed up along with the other Europeans. He has not followed the United States in its opposition to the treaty on biodiversity, as his predecessor might have done. Britain is of Europe and cannot help but fall in with arrangements that suit others as well as itself. Meanwhile we can enjoy the spectacle of the Tories at play. Some of the lads can be rough, but they are always good for a laugh.</p>

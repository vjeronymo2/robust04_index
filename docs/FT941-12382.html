			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / EU in disarray over China trade row: Manufacturers fear rushed decision Plans to end a debilitating row within the European Union over trade with China are in disarray, with only seven days to go until ministers are supposed to settle the issue. EU diplomats will meet in Brussels twice this week to try to decide whether to recommend abolition or harmonisation of national quotas on certain Chinese imports to the EU, including bicycles, kitchenware, training shoes and toys. US and European manufacturers with plants in China are afraid that after more than a year of indecision, foreign and trade ministers may now rush into an agreement on a series of EU-wide quotas at their meeting next Monday. Makers of expensive training shoes, such as Reebok and Nike, are particularly worried about proposals for restrictive quotas on their Chinese-made products. There is also concern about the proposed limit on toys, which the European manufacturers say is unnecessary, and the planned quota for Chinese bicycles, which are already subject to anti-dumping duties. At the same time as approving the Gatt world trade accord on December 15, EU foreign ministers agreed to strengthen the Union's trade defence mechanisms, making it easier to act against dumping and subsidised trade. In principle, that agreement was supposed to lead to an accord at next week's meeting on the abolition or harmonisation of thousands of national quotas on imports from 'state trading countries', the most important of which is China. Most of those national quotas will now disappear, but member states are locked into a familiar row between northern 'liberals' - Germany, the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands - and a southern camp, led by France, about which of the few remaining quotas to harmonise at EU level. They are also unable to decide how strict the quotas should be. Germany is particularly concerned about the situation, because it abolished all its remaining national quotas at the beginning of last year. 'The December 15 compromise was the kind of political deal that you make by providing some nice wording, but with all due respect to the Belgian presidency it wasn't a compromise in the sense of bringing minds together,' said one national official last week. National quotas can no longer be enforced, because last year's abolition of controls on goods at internal EU borders makes it impossible to check on products leaving or entering member states.</p>

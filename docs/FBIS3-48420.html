Before leaving Hanoi for Hue and Ho Chi Minh City on Tuesday 18  January, Gerard Longuet, who headed a delegation of 35  businessmen, said that Vietnam could become "a platform to  reexport" French products in the region.    French aid to Hanoi for 1994 is around 550 million French  francs [Fr], including the Fr85-million contribution to the  payment of the Vietnamese debt to the IMF. The rest is divided  between Treasury donations and loans (Fr250 million), credits  from the French Development Fund (Fr110 million in project  contributions), and the cooperation package (Fr108.5 million).  The funds allocated between 1990 and 1992 under the three  previous financial agreements have been completely exhausted,  and those provided by the fourth, signed in Paris on 8 November,  should also be exhausted.    During a visit to Vietnam from 11 through 13 January,  Jacques  Chirac expressed the Right's desire to "pursue and develop" the  previous governments' Vietnamese policy. This desire to accept  the Socialists' legacy is confirmed by the visits announced for  the next few months by Jacques Toubon (culture and  French-speaking affairs), Simone Veil (social affairs), Edmond  Alphandery (economy), and perhaps Francois Fillon (research).    Mr. Longuet wanted to give a pragmatic tone to bilateral  relations, stating in particular that because of its remoteness,  Vietnam could not form France's "backyard." He also stressed  that because of the "colossal requirements" for restoring the  country's infrastructures, there is room "for everybody" in a  Vietnam which has two main advantages, the "will to succeed" and  a "large and active" population.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (14): User satisfaction - David Lane on Monte Titoli's successful formula ITALY'S Monte Titoli ranks high among the world's most efficient custodians. 'We are very happy with Monte Titoli's service. No problems, and no real complaints,' says Paolo Azzoni, of Milan securities intermediation company, Gamba Azzoni Sim. A similar view comes from Renzo Noris, who heads the securities service at Banca Commerciale Italiano (BCI). 'Monte Titoli has proved a great benefit to banks. BCI used to have securities custody at 150 branches. But the cost was very high, in terms of space, staff and physical security. We have obtained significant savings.' Paolo Basilico, of Milan's Giubergia Warburg Sim, says: 'Monte Titoli works smoothly and efficiently.' He adds that centralised securities custody greatly assists his company's work, and also keeps costs down. 'Though Monte Titoli could be less expensive, we incurred even greater costs before, particularly with items like insurance premiums and delivery.' This seeming paragon was established in February 1978, and became operational four years later. Monte Titoli encountered difficulties at the beginning, however, and growth was held back in early years. It was only after enactment of Law 289 in June 1986, which clarified the giuridical (legal) position of securities custody, that the organisation was able to start developing its full potential. The 1986 law defines Monte Titoli, a joint stock corporation, as an institution for the centralised custody and administration of securities. Its sole objective is the provision of services aimed at rationalising securities custody and negotiation. Shareholdings in Monte Titoli are limited to a small number of permitted categories; banks, active stockbrokers, securities intermediary companies and similar organisations abroad, on the basis of reciprocity. New articles of association, approved in July, restrict the total stake held by stockbrokers to 12.5 per cent of share capital, while the limit for foreign organisations and securities intermediation companies is a total of 10 per cent for each category. No single shareholding must exceed 7 per cent, with one exception: the Bank of Italy, on which no limits are placed. Indeed, the central bank has a 42.3 per cent stake in Monte Titoli's L16bn (Dollars 11.77m) share capital, and the company's results are shown in the Bank of Italy's own financial statements. Should shares or options in new issues not be taken up, shareholders may offer them only to the Bank of Italy. That it has a central role in Monte Titoli is further underlined by its statutory right to appoint a member of the board of directors. Clearly, Italy's centralised securities custody organisation is more than an ordinary joint stock corporation. 'Recognition by specific legislation as a service of public utility gives Monte Titoli a special standing,' says general manager Dino Abbrescia. 'Theoretically, there could be competition, but not in practice,' notes Mr Abbrescia. Monte Titoli's official status has brought strong support from state bodies such as its main shareholder and the companies and stock market commission Consob, and has resulted in an impregnable market position. 'No newcomer could compete on cost, and it would not be able to find business.' Mr Abbrescia says that, given the practice of majority shareholders and members of control syndicates to hold their shares, the quantity of registered shares and similar securities that are deposited with the organisation is about 92 per cent of those that could be realistically centralised. Statistics show that, based on nominal value, 38 per cent of registered shares and similar instruments were held by Monte Titoli at the end of last year. In the case of bearer shares and similar securities, 68 per cent of the total nominal value was deposited with Monte Titoli, while the figure for bonds was 83 per cent. Significant progress has been made for both; figures at the end of 1990 were 58 per cent and 74 per cent respectively. Monte Titoli's service is voluntary, in that owners of securities are not obliged to deposit them. Italy's system permits those who want to hold their securities to do so. Indeed, last year the number of operations of certificate withdrawal from Monte Titoli rose, from 9,500 to 13,000 in the case of shares and from 1,600 to 3,800 in the case of bonds. However, in favour of paperless work, there was a significant increase from 260 to 286 in the number of securities issuing bodies and companies that registered with Monte Titoli last year. At the same time the number of securities admitted to custody rose from 947 to 945. Mr Abbrescia notes that this was due principally to a ruling by Consob which compelled the reticent to come into line. Statistics for the face value of securities held by Monte Titoli at year-end show rapid growth. Ten years ago, Italy's centralised custody organisation held securities with a face value of L706bn. By 1987 the figure had risen to L46,516bn, and at the end of last year it was L97,668bn. It now totals more than L100,000bn. The increase in the number of Monte Titoli's users has been such that often there are no physical exchanges in the daily settlement of transactions in the Bank of Italy's settlement rooms. From 460 at the end of 1990, the number of users (banks, stockbrokers, securities intermediation companies, commission houses and issuers) increased to 460 at the end of last year and passed the 500 mark early this year. However, Monte Titoli is more than a custody service. It administers the securities it holds, dealing with rights issues and dividend payments. 'Rights issues highlight the benefits that Monte Titoli offers the system,' says Mr Basilico. 'In the past these operations created considerable difficulties for the banks. Monte Titoli manages easily, as the recent RAS issue showed.' Payment of dividends is another service handled. Last year this concerned 15.1bn registered and bearer securities for a total net dividend value of L1,731bn. The figures in 1990 were 14.1bn securities and L2,177bn. The addition of securities quoted on Italy's USM will provide new volumes, and so also will Italy's privatisation process which will bring some new names to the main board.</p>

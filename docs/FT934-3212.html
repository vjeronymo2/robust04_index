			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (10): Investment fashion of the 90s  -Emerging Markets Emerging markets look like being the investment fashion of the 1990s. Scarcely a week goes by without a new fund being launched in the field, and enthusiasts are constantly urging institutions to increase their portfolio weightings in emerging markets to between 10 and 20 per cent. But the catch-all phrase 'emerging markets' covers a multitude of countries in Latin America, Asia, southern Europe and some parts of Africa. Many markets are, almost by definition, small and without a long tradition of welcoming international investors. That creates the potential for many custody problems. Until recently, many managers complained that custodians were not committing enough resources to emerging markets. But the growing popularity of these markets means that custodians seem to have improved their service. The pattern seems to be that most managers appoint a global custodian, which in turn appoints sub-custodians in individual markets. There are some exceptions, however. Some managers use regional custodians; specialist country fund managers like to have a direct relationship with a custodian in their particular market. Mr Richard Royds of Mercury Fund Managers says his group has Warburg as overall custodians but then uses Chase Manhattan as custodians in less accessible markets. 'We have found service surprisingly efficient; on the other hand custody is less of a problem when markets are rising' he says. According to one fund manager 'Chase Manhattan is the most important player. There's a fairly big gap after that to Citibank, which has the widest agent network of anybody. What it lacks is a good co-ordinating network.' Another fund manager describes Citibank as 'thinly spread but recovering strongly'. State Street, which the manager ranks third in the list, is described as having 'the best quality of service but is not the cheapest'. Some fund managers found that settlement conditions in the emerging markets were much better than they expected. Mr Kenneth King of Kleinwort Benson says he 'hasn't found any emerging market that has given me anything like as much of a problem as Italy did in the mid-1980s. One always feels nervous when one goes into a new market. But so far, we have not suffered any significant inconveniences. In fact, it is a tribute to the efficiency of the custodians.' 'We have never experienced a counter-party failure. The problem is not so much custodial as the initial set-up,' says another manager. 'Some countries require a lot of documentation before you can invest. Our application to invest in India is a pile of paper 2 1/2 feet high. When you actually get to invest, settlement is not too bad. But managers can have problems keeping track of, and dealing with, bonus issues and corporate restructurings, which can be surprisingly complex.' Whereas managers seem relatively happy with most areas of settlement, foreign currency dealing can be a problem. One manager says: 'If we were doing a share trade in a normal market, then the local currency deal would be separate. In emerging markets, that is not often possible. Often there is no interbank currency market. Then there are repatriation restrictions, which might limit your freedom when you want to sell.' 'Quite a lot of custodians make a lot of money out of trading currencies. They've been beaten down on fee levels but they get it back in the currency markets,' according to another manager. He cites an example of the difficulties. 'The Brazilian cruzeiro is declining at 1.5 per cent a day. One needs to know the time of day the deal was done to know whether one got a good rate.' Conversations with fund managers illustrate why custodians are so eager to advertise their expertise in emerging markets. For while the risks are clearly far greater the potential for profit is correspondingly higher. Inevitably, with such a wide range of countries, the problems vary widely from market to market. 'The Latin American markets are red hot on settlement,' says Dr Arnab Banerji of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets. 'In Latin America, inflation has forced them to have a good banking system,' agrees another manager. 'But some markets are bumpier than others. In Venezuela, it can take over 50 pieces of paper to settle a trade.' One fund manager said: 'India gives me attacks of nerves. The nature of the Indian market is that many brokers have little capital backing. That gives me cause for concern.' It would be wrong to think that every pension fund in the UK is happy to dabble in Chilean equities. Some institutions will only invest directly in the more substantial emerging markets, or in shares which are traded in the form of American Depositary Receipts. If they want to get exposure to one of the smaller emerging markets, they will do so via the growing number of single country funds.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Country focus List  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PRIMARY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA AND PACIFIC                              EUROPE (CONTINUED) Bangladesh                                    Portugal India                                         Turkey Indonesia Korea                                         MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA Malaysia                                      Botswana Pakistan                                      Mauritius Papua New Guinea                              Zambia People's Republic of China                    Zimbabwe Philippines Sri Lanka                                     CARIBBEAN AND LATIN Thailand                                      AMERICA Vietnam                                       Argentina                                               Brazil EUROPE                                        Chile Czech Republic                                Ecuador Greece                                        Mexico Hungary                                       Peru Poland                                        Venezuela  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SECONDARY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA AND PACIFIC                              EUROPE Fiji                                          Slovakia                                               MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA CARIBBEAN AND LATIN                           Egypt AMERICA                                       Ivory Coast Costa Rica                                    Jordan Jamaica                                       Kenya Trinidad and Tobago                           Malawi Bolivia                                       Morocco Colombia                                      Nigeria Uruguay                                       Swaziland                                               Tunisia  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Genesis Investment Management Limited  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / British Gas agrees terms with OFT: Company to trim share of industrial market and form pipeline subsidiary BRITISH GAS will announce details of an agreement with the Office of Fair Trading in the next few days that will lead to the company halving its share of the industrial gas market by 1995 and splitting off its pipeline and storage division into a separate subsidiary, the company said yesterday. The industry retains grave doubts about how British Gas will arrange the sale of significant amounts of its gas to competitors, as is envisaged by the OFT. The first gas sales are due to begin in October. Some observers say that without adequate regulation the auction may push prices higher in the UK. The Office of Gas Supply, the industry regulator, has resisted any deal that would lead to higher prices for domestic and industrial consumers. British Gas yesterday reported an after-tax profit of Pounds 1.16bn for last year. That compares with a profit of Pounds 1.21bn in the year from April 1990 to March 1991. Since the company has changed its financial year, comparisons with previous figures are hard to make. Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, said yesterday the company gained 280,000 customers in 1991 and installed about 500,000 central heating systems in spite of the recession. However, Mr Evans said that the recession had affected some customers' ability to pay and that outstanding debt from non-paying customers had risen to Pounds 40m from about Pounds 30m the year before. During the year, 150,000 additional customers had been forced by financial difficulties to secure special payment arrangements. The company said that slightly fewer than 1m households now pay by special arrangement. The disconnection rate had dropped, Mr Evans said, to 18,000; the lowest yearly rate recorded by the company. In April, British Gas will have to work within the confines of a tough new pricing formula for domestic customers imposed by its regulator. Mr Evans said there would be no change in prices in April, 'but given another year with low inflation and prices will be down in real terms'. Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, said the fact that British Gas saw profit from sales of gas to domestic customers rise by about Pounds 100m in 1991 demonstrated that it had been 'high time for a tariff review'. The rise in domestic profits was offset by a small fall in earnings from the industrial market, where the company lost about 25 per cent of its market share to competitors by the end of 1991, bringing its market share down to about 70 per cent. Mr Evans said the company's capital expenditure for this year would be Pounds 2.5bn - a record - most of which will be invested in the UK. Analysis, Page 22</p>

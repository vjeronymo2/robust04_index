			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] At the Tibet Autonomous Regional Conference on  Propaganda and Ideological Work that opened on 18 April, Chen  Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional CPC committee, stressed:  Tibet's propaganda and ideological front must take Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as its guide, and conscientiously uphold the  party's basic line of one central task and two basic points in  order to promote socialist modernization in Tibet. Meanwhile,  we must safeguard political stability in Tibet, safeguard the  unification of the motherland, and fight splittist forces in and  outside of national borders.    Leaders of the regional CPC Committee who attended the  regional Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work on 18  April were Guo Jinlong, Basang, Danzim, Yang Chuantang, Lieque,  and Puqung.    Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the regional CPC  Committee, presided over the conference. He said that the  guiding ideology and main tasks of this session are as follows:  With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as the guide, implement in an all-around  manner guidelines of the national conference on propaganda and  ideology; analyze the current situation on the propaganda and  ideological front in Tibet; and, in line with the one  fundamental principle and four tasks as well as the actual  conditions in Tibet, study and work out the main tasks regarding  propaganda and ideological work in 1994 and thereafter.    Gyaincain Norbu said: It is hoped that this meeting will  enable party leadership at all levels and comrades on the  propaganda and ideological front to have a better understanding  of the overall situation, unify their thinking, pluck up their  spirits, and do solid work to open up a new situation in  propaganda and ideological work in Tibet. It is essential to  heighten our awareness of the importance of giving equal  emphasis to both spiritual civilization and material progress,  and the importance of ideological and propaganda work in  guaranteeing the success of our cause; and to do a better job in  mobilizing and inspiring the vast number of party members and  the masses to constantly advance reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive.    Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional CPC committee,  delivered an important speech at the meeting on the region's  propaganda and ideological work in the days to come. His speech  focused on four points: 1. Gain a clear understanding of the  situation and make persistent efforts in successfully executing  propaganda and ideological work in Tibet with a clear head; 2.  The basic tasks on the propaganda and ideological front; 3.  Strengthen the ranks of propaganda and ideological cadres; and  4. Party and government leading organs must display greater  interest in propaganda and ideological work, and show greater  care and support for cadres of propaganda and ideological  departments.    First of all, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan analyzed the situation in  China and in Tibet. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, China's economy has been growing and its  political situation has become more and more stable since the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. As  reform and opening up deepen, the political situation in Tibet,  as elsewhere in China, has become increasingly stable and its  economy is undergoing heartening changes. In economic terms,  1993 was the best year ever in Tibet. With the generous support  of the central government and other provinces and  municipalities, Tibet's economic prospects have never been  brighter or broader. Tibet's economy will undergo more profound  and dynamic changes by the turn of the century.    Speaking of the basic tasks on the propaganda and  ideological front in Tibet, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan said: As an  important front in administering state affairs and ensuring  national security, and as the mouthpiece of the party and state,  propaganda work must adhere to the party's theory, line, and  policies; in doing propaganda and ideological work, we must  adherence to principle and address specific issues. We should  dare to address -- not evade or get round to -- the principal  contradictions. Propaganda and ideological work must also be  oriented toward the broad masses of people in and outside the  party, be effective in arousing the people's consciousness,  reflect the fundamental interests of the people, and guide the  masses to advance along the correct path. Propaganda and  ideological departments must provide correct guidance through  the media and remove all sorts of erroneous guidance for public  opinion so the broad masses of people will have a common  understanding and work enthusiastically toward our common goal.    Comrade Chen Kuiyuan pointed out: In implementing socialist  modernization in Tibet, it is essential that -- in addition to  the party and government who are leading the masses to  concentrate on implementing the policy of reform and opening up  and invigorating the economy -- propaganda and ideological  departments vigorously promote Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics so people inside  and outside the party and throughout the region will be able to  better arm themselves with his theory. Propaganda and  ideological departments must also conscientiously publicize  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's noted writings and statements on  correctly handling issues related to nationalities. Only by  acquiring a fuller understanding of the dissertations by Deng  Xiaoping on this subject will we be able to correctly  differentiate right from wrong on many issues concerning Tibet  and to find the correct path to speed up development.    Chen Kuiyuan said: A major obstacle to socialist economic  construction and the implementation of profound reforms in Tibet  is leftist ideas and outmoded ways of thinking. By leftist  ideas we mean sticking to an economic mode that is outdated,  runs counter to the conditions in China, and stands in the way  of the development of productive forces. After living and  working for many years under this mode, we have got used to it  and find it quite hard to free ourselves from its influence.  Emancipation of the mind requires hard work over a long period  of time. This is particularly true of Tibet, which is  economically backward, has a closed market, and where contacts  and exchanges with the outside world are few and far between.  Emancipation of the mind therefore requires even greater  efforts in Tibet. Only by studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics will  we be able to solve this problem, conscientiously adhere to the  policy of reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote  economic development.    Chen Kuiyuan said: One salient feature of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the idea of paying attention to fostering  both material progress and cultural and ideological progress,  and maintaining social and political stability. In other words,  political stability, economic development, material progress,  and cultural and ideological progress are all essential  requirements for building socialism. Only by attaching equal  importance to both and being careful not to emphasize one and  neglect the other can we live up to the requirements of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line. Our primary task is  to build a modern socialist Tibet. Propaganda and ideological  work must serve this main theme today and for quite some time to  come.    After having fully affirmed the achievements scored by the  propaganda and ideological front in the whole region, Chen  Kuiyuan stressed: The contingent of propaganda and ideological  personnel must further improve themselves. The contingent of  propaganda personnel must be one that has indisputable political  qualifications, perfect mastery of ideology, and very high  combat effectiveness. Only when this contingent of ours is very  steadfast can we successfully accomplish the historical mission  we have undertaken. The contingent of propaganda personnel must  pay close attention to its problems, must be good at giving full  play to its strong points and at overcoming its shortcomings,  must continuously enhance its level so as to enable the army of  our propaganda personnel to stand in the forefront of the times,  and must be good at guiding the masses to triumphantly advance  along the course charted by the party. If we want to make this  contingent of ours truly become the mouthpiece of the party and  state as well as an important front army for the party to  maintain contact with and educate the masses, we must be good at  using the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to eliminate leftist influence over us and  leftist patterns of thought. Meanwhile, we must be good at  using patriotism to refute splittism, and must continuously  strengthen the building of the contingent of propaganda and  ideological personnel ideologically and organizationally to make  the contingent more steadfast in ideology, purer in  organization, and more combat effective. We must improve the  level of propaganda to meet the needs of the new situation; we  must justly and forcefully propagandize unity among  nationalities, the need for all fraternal nationalities to stick  together and to depend on each other for survival, and the  goodwill of mutual support; and we absolutely must not allow the  speeches and activities aimed at sowing discord among  nationalities, splitting the motherland, and disrupting its  unification to spread unchecked. Disrupting unity among  nationalities is equivalent to disrupting the unification of the  motherland, and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the  broad masses of the people in Tibet. We must resolutely crack  down on the speeches and activities that disrupt unity among  nationalities and the unification of the motherland; there is no  room whatsoever for us to be vague on this matter.    Chen Kuiyuan called on party committees and governments in  the whole region to show more concern for and give more support  to the work of the propaganda and ideological front as well as  the cadres, staff, and workers on the front, and to eliminate  the phenomenon of taking a tough stand on one link while being  softhearted on the other. He called on the principal leading  cadres at all levels, in particular, to personally guide and  constantly concern themselves with the propaganda work and to  help propaganda departments solve difficulties actually  confronted. He said: The propaganda work is a task that has a  bearing on the overall situation. It constitutes an important,  integral part of the party's strategic objective. Therefore,  leading cadres at all levels must attach importance to and  directly support the propaganda work. Only thus can we  guarantee that we can do a better job in carrying out the  propaganda work.    At the conference, Deputy Secretary Danzim of the Tibet  Autonomous Regional Party Committee relayed the guidelines of  the national work conference on propaganda and ideology. The  conference held in the afternoon of 18 April relayed the  speeches delivered by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding  Guangen at the national work conference on propaganda and  ideology. Among the leaders attending the regional work  conference on propaganda and ideology were Puqung, Luosang  Danzeng, and Zhou Wenbi. Secretaries and administrative  commissioners in charge of propaganda work at prefectures and  cities across the region; directors of the propaganda  departments under prefectural and city party committees;  chairmen of federations of literary and art circles at relevant  prefectures and cities; secretaries of all county party  committees in charge of propaganda and ideological work and  directors of the propaganda departments under all county party  committees; and persons in charge of the autonomous regional  propaganda and ideological department, various regional-level  bureaus, departments, commissions, and offices, and universities  and colleges attended the conference.</p>

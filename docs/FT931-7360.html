			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Ex-Soviet citizens fear the free market A MAJORITY of Russians, Belarussians and Ukrainians believe the creation of a free market economy is a step in the wrong direction, according to an opinion poll, and that life was better under the old communist system. But the same poll reveals that two out of three people in east and central European countries which were not part of the former Soviet Union favour a market economy. Albanians, Romanians, Lithuanians and Slovenians are apparently the most enthusiastic about the free market. Eurobarometer, the European Commission's pollsters, interviewed 1,000 people in each of 18 east and central European countries last autumn and asked them whether they felt a free market economy was 'right or wrong for their country's future'. In 'European Russia', the poll found that only 37 per cent of people favoured the free market route, and 44 per cent were against. Russians are also hankering after the old political system: 59 per cent said life was better before the political reforms. In spite of their scepticism about the free market, the poll reveals that most central and east Europeans believe the economic reform process should be speeded up, and a majority - both within and outside the former Soviet Union - called for acceleration of the privatisation process. EC officials reacted with satisfaction to the poll's findings that a quarter of people in the region, excluding Russia, see their future inextricably linked with the Community, and 44 per cent are 'positive' about the EC.</p>

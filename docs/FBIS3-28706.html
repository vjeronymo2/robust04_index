			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin,  the economic impact on Thailand of the lifting of the U.S. trade  embargo against Vietnam will be assessed and followed closely by  the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand.    He said the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will result in  the Vietnamese economy being more active. This will result in  increased trade and investment activities which will benefit  Thailand. The finance minister believes foreign investment in  Vietnam will increase and that Vietnam will benefit from the  investment and improve its economic position. However, this  will not result in Vietnam drawing the capital market away from  Thailand. This is because Vietnam and Thailand have different  development and technological bases. Foreign investors in  Vietnam will be attracted by the cheap labor, while in Thailand  investors emphasize value added products. As a result, there is  no fear of market competition.    Tharin said: "In fact, increased investment in Vietnam will  benefit Thai businessmen because it will result in investment  opportunities, such as in the construction sector."</p>

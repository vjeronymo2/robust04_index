			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Peace and its pieces: Managing difference is crucial to avoiding war How can people who feel profoundly different from each other live together without fighting? In the present state of the world, it is hard to think of a more urgent question. The disaster of Yugoslavia, not to mention Northern Ireland, has made Europeans more aware of it. But it is no less urgent in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The usual answer is that what is needed is strong authoritarian government, feared equally by all. This has not solved the problem of war between states but it has prevented, or at least contained, conflict within state borders. The British, the Ottoman, and more recently the Soviet, empires all did this while they lasted. In each case, the break-up of empire has been accompanied or followed by bitter inter-communal fighting. Clearly, such conflicts pose a more serious challenge to democracies, where people are supposed to rule themselves and the will of the people is ascertained by majority vote. Majoritarian democracy works only so long as the citizens of a state feel that they constitute one people. If some of them feel that they are actually a different people, or part of one, they will not accept that the others have a right to represent and rule over them simply by virtue of being more numerous within the state's borders. How far does democracy depend on 'shared values'? That question was asked, but not clearly answered, at an Aspen Institute symposium held in Israel two weeks ago. It is a question that bothers Israelis for two reasons. First, Israel is a state based on an ideology, Zionism, which is not shared by two important minorities among its citizens, namely the Arabs and the orthodox religious Jews. Second, even among those who do accept Zionism, there is a wide cultural gap between the founders of the state - European, or Ashkenazi, Jews - and the Sephardi or oriental Jews, who arrived later but now form the majority. Many Ashkenazim feel that democracy can be sustained only if the orientals assimilate European culture and values, whereas many orientals are determined to maintain their culture and feel they are the victims of discrimination. The problem should be familiar to anyone from western Europe, where concern is often voiced about the supposed threat to democracy from minorities who cling to Islamic or other 'imported' value systems. And there are now similar anxieties in the US about the insistence of the Hispanic minority on retaining its own language and culture. This is seen as a rejection of the 'melting-pot', which successfully fused earlier waves of immigration into a homogeneous American culture. At the symposium, a newspaper cutting was handed around, in which it was reported that the French state has now decided to encourage education in regional languages, after 800 years of trying to suppress them. Jacobinism, or forced assimilation, has apparently been abandoned even in its birthplace. Democracy is now seen as inseparable from pluralism, that is from freedom for individuals to assert and maintain whatever group identity seems important to them. Does that mean that 'shared values' are no longer necessary? I am not sure. One value at least needs to be shared, namely the acceptance of democracy itself, or at least willingness to obey the law. Clearly education has a vital part to play in convincing people that they are indeed citizens of the state in which they live, with the rights and obligations that this entails. But attempts to indoctrinate them with an official or national ideology, or to suppress their inherited loyalty and culture, are likely to be counter-productive. Witness the general derision which greeted Lord Tebbit's suggestion, a few years ago, that support for an overseas cricket team was incompatible with the obligations of British citizenship. The problem is more acute where a minority is concentrated in, or historically identified with, a particular part of a state's territory. There is then the temptation to think that 'good fences make good neighbours', and to try and make frontiers correspond to ethnic divisions, by applying the principle of self-determination. But how does one decide the size and shape of the territorial unit to which this principle applies? And, even if applying it solves the problem of the national minority by turning it into a local majority, all too often the problem then simply reproduces itself on a smaller scale with a local minority. Almost inevitably, the process leads to uprooting people from their homes, which can be done only by coercion. This often involves the most vicious brutality, as is happening in Bosnia now. In most cases, it must be preferable for people to find ways of living together without moving either the frontier or the people themselves. Precisely to help them do that, last December the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) appointed a High Commissioner for National Minorities: the former Dutch foreign minister, Mr Max van der Stoel. It has become a commonplace to say that there are now no good solutions in Bosnia, and that Europe is paying now for its failure to avert the conflict through timely preventive diplomacy. Mr van der Stoel is supposed to ensure that such a fatal mistake is not repeated. Yet he has been given an annual budget of just Dollars 250,000, and a staff of four. Surely avoiding further Bosnias deserves a higher priority than that? By the time you read this I shall have started a seven-week sabbatical, during which I hope to explore the linguistic frontier between Latins and Germans, from Dunkirk to Trieste.</p>

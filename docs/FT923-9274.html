			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hongkong Electric earnings rise 23% at halfway HONGKONG Electric, the monopoly supplier of electricity to Victoria Island, yesterday reported a 23 per cent rise in earnings to HKDollars 1.15bn (USDollars 149m) for the six months to June from HKDollars 934m a year earlier, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The company, which is 34.6 per cent owned by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa, boosted turnover by 7.4 per cent to HKDollars 2.34bn from HKDollars 2.18bn. Directors declared an interim dividend of 30 cents a share, 15 per cent higher than the year-earlier period. Earnings per share were 57 cents against 46 cents. Mr Simon Murray, chairman, said record rainfall in the colony and cool weather resulted in a 1.8 per cent growth in electricity unit sales in the first half. Maximum demand for electricity was 6 per cent higher, year-on-year. Hongkong Electric also develops residential property and Mr Murray said that during the half-year the company's associate Secan received an occupation permit for the final block of its phase 1 South Horizons development on Ap Lei Chau. Occupation permits for seven blocks at phase 2 of the development are expected in the second half. Analysts estimate this development will contribute nearly HKDollars 700m to pre-tax profits this year.</p>

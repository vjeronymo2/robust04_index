			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Strikes prompt SPD call for fresh pay talks Leaders of the German opposition Social Democrats yesterday appealed for wage negotiations to resume as thousands of engineering workers across the country held protest strikes over pay increases. Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD) and rival candidate to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, called for trade unions and employers to start negotiations again, saying it was urgent that all the mistrust be put aside. But trade union leaders made clear yesterday that the strike was only a warning in order to bring negotiations back on track. 'We are ready to meet the employers in whichever town they choose to continue the negotiations as long as they are willing to present new proposals,' Mr Walter Riester, deputy chairman of IG Metall, the engineering union, said. Employers' leaders also said they were ready to try to bridge differences. 'We are ready to hold constructive talks with IG Metall any time,' Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, said on German television. Mr Scharping and other SPD leaders issued their warnings as 60,000 workers in 137 companies downed tools to protest against the refusal by employers to grant unions' demands for pay increases of between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent. More than 40,000 workers held morning stoppages in Bavaria, where around 80 companies, including carmakers Audi and BMW, were affected, according to trade unionists. In Baden-Wurttemberg, 9,000 engineering workers stopped work for up to three hours. Other protests took place in the states of Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin. Talks between IG Metall and Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, broke down last week after a two-week deadline during which employers refused to discuss the pay increases demanded. Gesamtmetall is instead offering pay deals which would lower the workers' real purchasing power.</p>

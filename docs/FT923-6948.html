			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Interest charges hit McKay Securities Higher interest charges resulted in pre-tax profits of McKay Securities falling from Pounds 3.81m to Pounds 3.17m in the year to March 31. Net interest payable by this property investment and development group rose Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 3.3m following the cessation of capitalisation of interest on certain developments prior to becoming income-producing. Pre-tax profits in the current year will be depressed further because of recession, directors said. There were no schemes under development or planned to start in the near future. Earnings per share came through at 10.4p (11.6p). The final dividend is 3.5p, for a total of 6.7p (6.4p).</p>

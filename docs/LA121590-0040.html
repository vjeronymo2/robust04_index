			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VAQUERO TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> CANYONS TOPPLES GLENDALE, ADVANCES TO TITLE GAME  </P> <P> Glendale College, which has been making a habit of winning its own tournament,  will be watching rather than participating during tonight's final, thanks to  the College of the Canyons.  </P> <P> The Cougars, despite a rash of turnovers, led throughout and won easily to  eliminate the defending champions, 83-75, Friday night in the semifinal game of  the Vaquero tournament.  </P> <P> Glendale (6-6) had won the tournament three of the past four years.  </P> <P> Canyons (6-5), which will play L. A. City for the championship tonight at 7,  survived 29 turnovers and got a monster game from center Reggie Bell, who  scored 19 points and had 18 rebounds.  </P> <P> Four Cougar players scored 12 points each -- Nick Sanderson, David Langley,  Jeff Dorst and Marquis Wilborn.  </P> <P> Glendale was led by sophomore forward Kelly Crosby, who scored 17 points before  fouling out with 2 minutes 21 seconds to play.  </P> <P> Enoch Mack added 15 points for Glendale.  </P> <P> Glendale fell behind, 9-0, to start the game, rallied behind the shooting of  Crosby, who scored nine of the Vaqueros' first 14 points and had 13 points in  the first half.  </P> <P> Canyons spread the points around in the first half (four players had eight  points at halftime) and led the entire way, settling for a 43-38 advantage at  intermission.  </P> <P> In another game:  </P> <P> El Camino 72, Valley 62 -- Valley led by six points with five minutes to play,  but then collapsed down the stretch and was eliminated from the tournament.  </P> <P> El Camino (11-5), getting eight points from forward Keishaun Darthard, went on  a 14-0 run and took a commanding 68-60 lead with less than two minutes to play.  Darthard led all scorers with 26 points, including 10 in the last five minutes.  </P> <P> Center Art Kirksey scored Valley's only basket in the final five minutes.  Valley Coach Jim Stephens took part of the blame for his team's collapse.  </P> <P> "I made a mistake. I put a couple of players in the game, but they couldn't get  open for their shots," Stephens said.  </P> <P> "El Camino is a veteran team. They just took us out of our game. They knew  where we were going."  </P> <P> Valley (7-5) trailed by as many as nine points in the first half but outscored  El Camino, 12-3, in the final four minutes to tie the score, 35-35, at  intermission.  </P> <P> Sophomore guard Rick Garrick led Valley's second-half charge, scoring 13 of his  team-leading 22 points on an assortment of twisting drives and outside jump  shots.  </P> <P> Garrick didn't get much help. Guard Tory Stephens, who had 10 points at  halftime, missed all eight of his second-half shots.  </P> <P> Valley converted just 27% of its field-goal attempts in the second half.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leader of the Russia's Choice [RC] group Yegor  Gaydar is "absolutely convinced that the amnesty resolution  which also covers those involved in the events of August 1991  and September-October 1993 is a step to unsettling the situation  in Russia".    Speaking on Wednesday, Gaydar said all those people were  most  likely "to take newly-formed militant units to the streets in  the next few months and I am sure there will be renewed  violence".    The RC leader also said that under the new constitution, the  president has no powers to veto the Duma resolution.    One other RC leader Gennadiy Burbulis who also voted against  the resolution said: "It is very enticing to speak in terms of  civic peace or being destined for accord but there is great  concern when such noble ideas are being resolved with political  impropriety and legal incorrectness".    For his part, Communist Party chief Gennadiy Zyuganov said  the amnesty for those imprisoned on charges of involvement in  last October's events meant that those people "who defended the  Constitution will now be able to do so not in Lefortovo Prison  but in normal conditions".    One other Communist deputy and defendant in the case of the  1991 failed coup Anatoliy Lukyanov told Interfax that the  amnesty resolution was "a logical step on the way to internal  stability". However, he is perfectly sure that there can be "no  genuine reconciliation unless the government changes its policy  by dropping shock treatment of the economy".    Lukyanov does not believe that the situation will go out of  hand just because about 50 prisoners will be released and  charges against them dropped.    In his view, leader of the right-wing Russian National Unity  Aleksandr Barkashov and leader of the Russian Workers' Communist  Party Viktor Anpilov "had enough time for a rethink to prevent  what happened from being repeated". "I am sure that fascist  ideas will not work here", Lukyanov said.    LDP [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy has described the Duma resolution as "a historic  moment of reconciliation and shedding the burden of historic  mistakes". In a speech to the Duma, he called to close "dark  pages and express sympathy and forgive all victims".    At the same time, Zhirinovskiy called on the president "not  to sabotage the Duma resolution" and the government to take  measures to enforce it.    One other deputy Vasiliy Lipitskiy says that former Vice  President Aleksandr Rutskoy will again lead the People's Party  of Free Russia when set free.    For his part, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord  Sergey Shakhray stressed that he and the PRUC were opposed to  spreading the amnesty for those "taking up arms and perpetrating  criminal offences during the events of last September and  October".</p>

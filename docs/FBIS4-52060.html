			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuclear Arms Development Must Be Promptly Stopped"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today urges  the South Korean rulers to immediately stop the development of a  fast breeder reactor, open to the public the truth behind their  secret development of nuclear weapons and apologize to the  nation.    The news analyst says:    The May 2 white paper of the Central Committee of the South  Korean National Democratic Front on the truth and purpose of the  South Korean rulers' development of a fast breeder reactor is  another stern indictment against their development of nuclear  weapons.    To tell the truth, the economic advantage and stability of  the fast breeder reactor are not guaranteed in the world. That  is why other countries which built reactors of this type have  suspended their operation or closed them.    The South Korean puppets' desperate efforts to develop a  fast  breeder reactor are directly linked with their ambition for  nuclear arms development. Through the development of the  reactor, they plan to secure large quantities of plutonium and  possess reprocessing facilities.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam signed an agreement on joint  nuclear  development with Japan some time ago. The South Korean puppets  hosted an "international symposium on the reactors of the next  generation" in Seoul in October last year, where they wrested a  promise from some officials of the International Atomic Energy  Agency to "cooperate in the development of the next-generation  reactor in South Korea."    Facts prove that the South Korean rulers' development of  nuclear weapons has reached a very dangerous stage.    It is all the more disgusting that the South Korean rulers  are continuously making a fuss over "suspected nuclear arms  development" of the North while promoting their own nuclear arms  development in secrecy. With a view to concealing its criminal  acts, the Kim Yong-sam clique is doing all evils as a shock  brigade in the "campaign for pressure" on the DPRK. This  reminds us of "the guilty party filing the suit first."    So long as such fellows are left alone, the disaster of  nuclear war cannot be avoided nor can the North-South relations  be improved.    If the Kim Yong-sam group continues developing nuclear  weapons, it will be held wholly responsible for all the  consequences arising therefrom.</p>

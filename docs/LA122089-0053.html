"It has become evident that our  franchise was not moving in a positive direction."  </P> <P> The Kings (6-14) are in last place in the Pacific Division. There was no  comment from Russell.  </P> <P> Reynolds will continue as interim coach until a permanent replacement is  selected. Rick Benner, vice president for business, will replace Russell.  </P> <P> Russell coached the Boston Celtics and the Seattle SuperSonics after concluding  a playing career in which he was a five-time NBA Most Valuable Player. He was a  basketball television commentator for 10 years before becoming coach of the  Kings in 1987, where he compiled a 17-41 record over 11 months before being  relieved as coach.  </P></p>

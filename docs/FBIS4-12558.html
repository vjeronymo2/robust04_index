			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: In the wake of the Palestinian  resistance martyrdom operation in 'Afula, where eight Israelis  were killed and scores of others were wounded, Israel clamped a  military siege on Arab citizens in the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip. It raised a premeditated hue and cry over the  'Afula operation in order to cover up two serious crimes it  recently committed: The holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the  subsequent Israeli Army killings, and the Zionist special  forces' execution of six Palestinians in the Jabaliya camp. The  latter was described by world circles at the time as the most  serious violation of human rights in the occupied Arab  territories. Israel also imposed a military siege on our people  in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the pretext of providing  security to its Jewish inhabitants.    Security, as all know, cannot be provided under occupation.  If Israel was really concerned about security, it would have  accepted the Security Council resolutions governing the peace  process and it would have negotiated on that basis in a way that  leads to the withdrawal of its forces and settlers from occupied  Arab territory and to the establishment of an independent  Palestinian state where people can live a free and honorable  life. But Israel does not want to withdraw from the occupied  territories. The flimsy security pretext it uses to confront  the world will not stand up to the test. The Israeli occupation  is a source of danger to the Israelis themselves and the very  reason of the lack of security. The more the occupation steps  up its bestial acts, the more resistance escalates and violence  aggravates.    The Arabs have taken part in the Madrid conference and  presented objective proposals in the Washington talks for the  sake of establishing a real, just, and comprehensive peace  because only a just and comprehensive peace based on the  international community resolutions, charters, and principles  can provide security and stability in the region and end the  cycle of violence. Instead of responding to Arab proposals,  particularly the Syrian ones, Israel continued its maneuvers and  prevarications in a bid to avoid the principles on which the  peace process was based. These principles are land for peace,  namely, full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories as stipulated by the UN resolutions.    The Israeli rulers refuse to admit facts. They turn a blind  eye to developments and try to delude themselves into believing  that it is possible to achieve peace through the continuation of  occupation. If they think so, they will undoubtedly reap further  bitter fruit. Peace and occupation cannot coexist. There can be  no peace in the Middle East without full Israeli withdrawal from  all the occupied territories and without the realization of the  Palestinian people's real hopes and aspirations, led by freedom,  dignity, and self- determination.    Only a just and comprehensive peace can provide security and  stability. A just and comprehensive peace should be based on  specific international resolutions that should be implemented in  full and lead to Israel's withdrawal from every inch of the  occupied territories. Otherwise, not one Israeli will enjoy  peace or security.</p>

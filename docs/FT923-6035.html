			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Exports surge by 50% at British Nuclear Fuels A 50 PER CENT surge in export sales helped British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned company that supplies and reprocesses fuel for the nuclear power industry, increase its annual pre-tax profit by Pounds 5m to Pounds 161m. Turnover increased by Pounds 40m to Pounds 1,028m, although the rise in export sales to Pounds 268m was partly offset by what BNFL said was a temporary reduction in UK sales. The company increased its dividend to the government, its sole shareholder, by Pounds 2m to Pounds 52m. Mr Neville Chamberlain, chief executive, said increased exports were the key to future growth. BNFL had opened an office in Seoul in response to South Korea's expanding nuclear programme, and it could also have a valuable role in Russia in improving nuclear safety and by dismantling nuclear weapons. Two-thirds of BNFL's business is covered by fixed-price deals with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, worth Pounds 17bn over the next 15 years. Mr Chamberlain said: 'Our future income is largely secured. Whether we prosper or not depends on how well we control our costs.' The company's cost-cutting programme has already involved 750 job losses at its head office at Risley, Cheshire. In May it announced that 550 jobs were to be lost at its uranium enrichment plant in Capenhurst, Cheshire, because of the collapse of the market since the end of the cold war. In addition to providing fuel for other nuclear plants, BNFL operates two power stations at Calder Hall on the Sellafield site in Cumbria, and Chapelcross in southern Scotland. Its Pounds 2.8bn thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield is due to open early next year and already has an order book worth about Pounds 9bn. Sir Christopher Harding, former company chairman, said: 'Those who see global warming, exacerbated by the burning of fossil fuels, as one of the main long-term threats to the environment cannot long ignore the benign contribution to rising world energy demand which nuclear power represents.'</p>

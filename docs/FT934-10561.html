			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: W Europe gas needs 'to rise 60%' WESTERN EUROPE'S demand for natural gas is forecast to rise to 400bn cubic metres by 2010 from 250 bcm in 1990, according to Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. Mr Peter Mellbye, Statoil's president of natural gas, said Eastern Europe would require about 100 bcm of gas on top of the west's 400 bcm. But he said that if Europe's current economic climate continued, his projection would be too optimistic. Presenting the forecast at a gas conference in Brussels, Mr Mellbye said Norway's gas export commitments to Europe would increase rapidly over coming years, reaching a plateau of 51 bcm annually, nearly double the current annual export level of 27 bcm. 'Gas delivered to Europe covered by Norway's Troll sales agreement will reach a plateau level of 18 bcm annually around the year 2000 and be sustained for 20 years.' Mr Mellbye's forecast assumed annual European gross domestic product growth rates at about 2-3 per cent, Brent blend reference oil prices at Dollars 20 a barrel, low inflation and stable exchange rates, and also that gas sustained its current competitive position against alternative fuels. He said the European demand forecast was driven mainly by economic growth, which would lead to increased gas demand in the industrial and residential sectors. An implicit result of Statoil's forecast assumptions is that gas will continue to capture market shares from competing fuels. 'Until now, this process has been most harmful to the market for fuels, heavy fuel in particular,' Mr Mellbye said. 'There seem to be new opportunities emerging for gas suppliers after the turn of the century. A substantial part of the growth in future demand (for gas) is forecast to materialise in (Europe's) southern markets,' markets farthest away from Norway's gas resources.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Council speeds up tendering - 'No case for white-collar sacred cows' says Westminster leader WESTMINSTER City Council, the Tory-controlled London authority, has set an ambitious timetable for subjecting its main white-collar services to compulsory competitive tendering, in advance of government plans to force all local authorities to do so. Westminster's contracts committee is likely to award the council's public relations and publicity business - worth about Pounds 500,000 a year - to two private companies tomorrow. Contracts for managing the council's property investment portfolio have been awarded to the private sector. Under the timetable, parts of Westminster's information technology, planning and legal work will be put out for competitive tender in batches late this year and early next. Housing management is to go to tender by April 1994, when a market-testing exercise is to be completed for the council's libraries, legal, planning and building control services. Although a few adventurous Tory councils contracted out services in the mid 1980s, compulsory tendering officially began less than four years ago. Before then, councillors of all parties had resisted the idea. In the early 1980s, Westminster pioneered the tendering of blue-collar services. The council's present plans are in advance of the government's proposals for white-collar services, which have met fierce hostility from unions and local-authority associations. They argue that it is far more difficult to set effective quality standards for white-collar than for blue-collar services. Mr David Weeks, Westminster's Tory leader, said: 'We are succeeding in setting quality targets. There is no case for white-collar sacred cows.' Westminster is also extending tendering to more blue-collar functions. Contracts for waste transfer are likely to be awarded tomorrow to MRS Environmental Services - the management buy-out that already runs the council's refuse collection. Mr Weeks says the investment portfolio contract might yield savings of Pounds 650,000 over five years, while the waste transfer contracts might save more than Pounds 1m over three years. Contracts issued by Westminster are worth nearly Pounds 50m a year - more than a fifth of its non-education budget. Of the 35 contracts already let, all but eight have been awarded to the private sector. Nationally, more than 80 per cent of contracts have been won by internal teams, but private contractors have penetrated to most authorities. According to a survey of 444 councils published yesterday by the Local Government Management Board, 60 per cent of authorities have at least one outside contract.</p>

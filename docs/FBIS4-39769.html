			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 110 (600): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] The leader of the team of experts under the  president Alexander Lifshits believes that the bill on the  federal budget for 1994 which was approved on Wednesday in the  second reading reflects the maximum possibilities of the State  Duma. It is better to have this version of the budget than none  at all, he said.    IF Note: The State Duma approved on June 8 in the second  reading the bill of a federal budget for 1994 without any  changes into the past of revenue and of expenditures and its  deficit. The deputies approved proposals of the budget  committee of the lower house abut more expenditures for defense  purposes (from 37.1 trillion to 40.6 trillion rubles) at the  expense of the internal redistribution of means in the budget.  The Duma Defense Committee insisted on more money for defense  purposes (up to 55 trillion rubles).    Lifshits stated that the problem was still topical. He  believes there is a need to search for mechanisms to resolve the  issue on additional financing of the defense order and other  needs of the "power" structures. The proposals for the use for  this purpose of part of the privatization campaign should,  believes Lifshits, be formed as a concrete legal act. This  spells serious restrictions for the process of post-voucher  privatization, he believes.    According to the leader of the group of experts, now is the  time to start thinking on the ideology of the budget for 1995,  which should be principally different from the present one.  Lifshits believes that the process should be built from above,  not from below. First determined should be the principles of  the structural policies, the concept or the strategy of the  budget and later it should be considered by the Finance Ministry.    Meanwhile, the speaker of the upper house of parliament  Vladimir Shumeyko criticized the budget approved on Wednesday by  the State Duma. The Federation Council will not agree to such a  budget, at least me, said Shumeyko on Thursday speaking with  journalists in Moscow.    He believes the budget has no political orientation. It  seems that the Duma believes like this: The worse the better.  The Duma creates grounds for the change of power, said Shumeyko.    The current budget indicates that the country has no budget  policy. He favored the need for greater expenditures for  defense purposes.    In an exclusive interview for Interfax, the Duma speaker  Rybkin expressed concern over the fact that the upper house of  parliament, the Federation Council, may not approve the budget.  He warned that if someone in the Federation Council takes an  attempt to destroy the budget, he was prepared to make a public  speech to tell the people of Russia who they were earlier and  why they destroyed the budget for four years.    IF Note: If the upper house does not approve the federal  budget, it will be returned to the Duma which should collect  two-thirds of votes for the second approval. If the Duma fails  to collect the necessary number of votes, the document will have  to voted again at all levels. According to the chairman of the  Duma Budget Committee, Mikhail Zadornov, there will be needed  2-3 weeks for coordination of new budget version. If so, the  parliament will consider the budget of the 3-4 quarters of the  year, said Zadornov.</p>

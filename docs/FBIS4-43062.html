			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Antonio Guterrres, secretary general of the </F> Socialist Party, from party headquarters in Lisbon -- live]    [Excerpts] [Guterres] First, I would like to congratulate  all the Portuguese and in particular, those who voted today, who  today understood that it was important to exercise that  fundamental civic right in a democracy.    I would like to warmly thank Socialist Party [PS] members  and  Socialist candidates whose dedication, strength, and courage  made this new Socialist victory possible. Please allow me a word  of special thanks and admiration for Antonio Vitorino. For me,  in all honesty, he is the big winner of these European  elections, and I believe that the country and the PS have in him  a top political figure who will make a decisive contribution to  our democracy in the future.    This Socialist victory, I must confess, is particularly  welcome. Above all because of the difficult circumstances under  which the Socialist Party had to fight this electoral battle.  Not long ago it was said that these were the most difficult  elections for the PS. Even so, and according to the official  forecasts available at the moment, the PS has managed to win.  In so doing it has won elections in Portugal for the second  consecutive time -- which had not happened since 1976. [passage  omitted]    This victory strengthens the relation of trust between the  country, between the Portuguese and the PS. But it also  strengthens our responsibility in preparing a serious  alternative government for Portugal. An alternative that we do  not want to prepare alone. We want to do it with an intense  dialogue with the whole of civil society, with the many  independent candidates who are willing to collaborate with us to  provide a future for our country that is better than the  present. [passage omitted]    In our opinion it is not enough to change the government. It  is necessary to change the way Portugal is governed. It is  necessary to have a better democracy in Portugal. A democracy  with more dialogue, with more participation, where power and  resources will be more decentralized toward the regions and  local government. Also, a democracy with more transparency in  order to combat more effectively favoritism and corruption that  have disappointed so many with Portuguese political life.    It is also necessary that those who govern are more  attentive  to the need to give an absolute priority to education, or rather  to the education-professional training sector. It is through  people's qualifications, through a complete backing of society  for people's training that the success of our joint building of  an European future may depend on. The success of our ability to  compete in world markets -- that are increasingly more difficult  for a country such as Portugal -- may also depend on this.    We want more backing for economic growth, more support for  those who produce and work. Above all we want a total  nonacceptance of the unemployment figures, with the spread of  poverty and with the lack of safety in the streets that poverty  helps to nurture in our country.    We also want greater justice in our taxes and the social  services to which we have access, health, education, housing,  and social security. It is the preparation of this alternative  that we want to carry out together with Portuguese society,  aware that it is today increasingly more needed in the country.  [passage omitted]    We want to help to nurture a new hope in Portugal, a new  confidence in our future as nation, affirmed in Europe, and  universally, as always.    Allow me a last word on the abstention rate. In our opinion,  this has penalized above all the PS. A party whose electoral  support comes increasingly from the youth sector and the cities.  Therefore, it is natural that there was some discrepancy between  the opinion polls, which did not forecast it, and the final  result that marks the extent of the Socialist victory.    I disagree totally with the prime minister over the meaning  of this abstention rate. I believe an important part of this is  connected to the disappointment among Portuguese with regard to  political life and the way the government is being governed. I  am not only talking about the government. I am talking about  the institutions and the political parties themselves.    Therefore, I would like to reiterate here, as Dr. Antonio  Vitorino has already done, our total commitment to a reform of  the political system. I would like to call on the leaders of  the other parties to collaborate with us, within the framework  of the revision of the Constitution, toward obtaining a new  balance between the participation of citizens and representative  democracy, and that this new balance helps to overcome this  relative disappointment, this relative ill at ease, and enables  once more to reconcile the Portuguese with the functioning of  our democratic political system. [passage omitted]    I would like to end by reiterating, once more, that in the  same way the Portuguese have placed their trust in the PS, they  can do so in the future, and that we will do out utmost to  justify the hope that has been placed on us.</p>

In October 1986,  the authors found this disease in Nanjing and carried out a  series of studies in 1986-1992. The results were as follows:  Tsutsugamushi disease was epidemic in Nanjing and north of  Jiangsu (including: Dongtai, Haian, Rudong, Jinhu, Hanjiang,  Jiangdu); which was found to be autumn-winter type, with main  reservoir hosts being Apodemus agrarius, Rattus  confucianus, R. norvegicus and Crocidura  lasiura; and transmitting vector L. (L.)  scutellare. The pathogen of tsutsugamushi disease of the  autumn-winter type -- Rickettsia tsutsugamushi  belonged to low-virulent strain, and could not easily be  detected. After the inoculated mice were treated with diluted  cyclophosphamide solution, 14 strains of R.  tsutsugamushi were isolated from rats, mites and patients,  and serological typing of their sera showed that they belonged  to the Gilliam type. Natural foci in Jiangsu could be divided  into two types -- flat land and hilly land.</p>

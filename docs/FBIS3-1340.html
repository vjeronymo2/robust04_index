Among the key  points being guarded were government buildings and fuel depots,  as well as the police armoury.    Striking public servants, including nurses and members of  the  Lebowa police, gathered and toyi-toyied [protest dancing]  outside the main entrance to the government offices at  Lebowakgomo.    Lebowa Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike called on the South  African Government to report personally to striking workers on  why promotions and salary increases had been withheld,  apparently a key factor behind the strike.    The South African Government took over the financial  administration of Lebowa in September 1993, following charges of  maladministration and irregular promotions which led to serious  cash-flow problems in the homeland.    About 30,000 public servants are reported to be  participating  in the strike.    Mr Ramodike said that since the SA Government had taken over  the running of Lebowa's financial affairs, labour unrest had  increased.    He called the take-over a political ploy with a view to the  election and earlier this week suggested the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] assume responsibility for Lebowa's  finances.    Late on Thursday, thousands of striking public servants  waited at the homeland government buildings for members of the  Transitional Executive Council to address them.    A spokesperson for the public servants said the TEC was  expected to arrive at Lebowakgomo on Thursday afternoon to  discuss their problems. He said a full report regarding the  issue of their promotions would be given to given to the TEC.    The South African minister of regional and land affairs, Mr  Andre Fourie, on Thursday denied allegations by Mr Ramodike that  matters had worsened in Lebowa under his department's control.    Mr Fourie said in a statement "maladministration and  mismanagement were the trademarks of Mr Ramodike's  administration and as chief executive, he is responsible for the  lack of proper and responsible government in Lebowa".    Regarding Mr Ramodike's statement that "the takeover and the  subsequent reversal of promotions of the civil servants by  Minister Andre Fourie had led to a series of strike and sit-ins  that had the effect of disrupting services in the region", Mr  Fourie said the civil servants themselves were to blame for  salaries not yet being ready.    "Due to the fact that civil servants have been striking most  of the time and wasting the South African taxpayer's money, only  to return to work at the time when salaries are being processed,  I have given instructions that their salaries may only be  processed after the claims of suppliers and contractors had been  attended to," Mr Fourie said.    He also claimed the civil service strike was directly  responsible for pensions not being paid in Lebowa. He said the  pension money was available at the banks, "but the officials  responsible for the payment of pensions are on strike".</p>

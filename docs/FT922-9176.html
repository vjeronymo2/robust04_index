			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / New car sales in UK rise by 9.1% NEW CAR sales in the UK rose by 9.1 per cent in April, the first year-on-year increase in 30 months and the first sign that the most severe recession in the market since the second world war may have ended. The motor industry warned, however, that the April figures should be treated 'with a degree of caution'. New car sales a year ago were already low because of the recession and were further depressed by the impact of the increase in value added tax on April 1 1991. This means that the size of the increase last month could be misleading. Optimism yesterday was also damped by the continuing decline in new commercial vehicle registrations, which fell in April by 11.3 per cent from the same month a year ago. New commercial vehicle sales have suffered a year-on-year fall for 31 months in succession. Some carmakers insisted that consumer confidence was showing signs of improvement. Mr Ian Coomber, Vauxhall's sales director, said the April figures reflected what had been happening at the company's dealers. 'Consumer confidence has clearly returned after both the Budget and the election and customers are now coming in to buy rather than just to window-shop.' Mr Michael Hollingsworth, chief economist of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the figures were 'clearly encouraging' as the first tangible sign of improvement for 29 months. New car sales in April rose to 138,106 from 126,588 in the same month a year ago, according to the figures released by the society yesterday. In the first four months, sales were 6.7 per cent lower at 544,317 compared with 583,318 in the corresponding period a year ago. New car sales last year suffered the steepest year-on-year decline since 1974, and at 1.59m were 31 per cent lower than the 2.3m achieved in 1989. Vauxhall said sales for the whole of 1992 could rise by 6 per cent to 1.69m, but this implies an accelerating rate of recovery in the second half of the year following the 11.1 per cent year-on-year decline in the first quarter. Ford, the UK new car market leader, welcomed the April figures with 'cautious optimism'. It warned that it was already taking significant orders for the key August sales month, however, which could restrain the rate of recovery in the three months from May to July. August, which traditionally accounts for more than a fifth of annual car sales because of the change in the registration prefix, will be the crucial factor in determining the level for the rest of the year. Imported cars took a 55.4 per cent share of UK new car sales in April compared with 56.3 per cent a year ago, while the import share in the first four months was slightly higher than a year ago at 54.9 per cent.

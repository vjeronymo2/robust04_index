			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina and its future market are  becoming interesting for certain states that would like to take  part in the country's reconstruction. Our correspondent  Aleksander Mlac will tell us what Slovenia's place in this is  and what attitude Sarajevo has toward our state:    [Begin Mlac recording] Bosnia-Herzegovina will never forget  the positive attitude the state of Slovenia and the Slovenes  have held on the crisis in our country. This is what Dr. Haris  Silajdzic, prime minister in the Government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and of the Bosnian-Croatian Federation, said  in a statement for Slovene radio. He assessed the relations  between the two states as very good and at the same time pointed  out that Slovene economy would be welcome in Bosnia, which has  already begun preparations for the reconstruction.    Prime Minister Silajdzic also pointed out that the  international competition on the Bosnian market is more  satisfactory day by day. In an one-hour statement he made for  Slovene Radio, among other things, Dr.Haris Silajdzic touched  upon the refugee issue. He cannot promise Bosnian refugees a  quick return home. One needs many preconditions for such a  thing, above all peace.    Silajdzic sees peace between Bosniaks and Croats as the  greatest achievement of the Bosnian-Croatian Federation. What  is involved is a necessary compromise that has saved many lives.  He sees the new government as not being burdened by party  affiliations, being an expert body. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz met with Austrian  Foreign Minister Alois Mock in Vienna today. They discussed the  obligations the UN Security Council should fulfill toward Iraq,  particularly in terms of implementing Paragraph 22 of Resolution  687 and lifting the unfair embargo since Iraq has implemented  all pertinent clauses in Resolution 687.    They also discussed bilateral ties.    Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz also met with Hans Blix,  director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA]. They discussed the IAEA's responsibility to acknowledge  what Iraq had implemented in the field as stipulated by  Resolution 687 and the need to fully inform the UN Security  Council of such as soon as possible, so the Security Council can  assume its responsibility and immediately start considering the  implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 as soon as  possible.    The two meetings were attended by Barzan al-Tikriti, Iraq's  permanent envoy to the UN Headquarters in Geneva; Dr. Rahim al-  Kital, Iraq's ambassador to Austria; and the deputy director of  the Iraqi Atomic Energy Organization. Professor Zifferero and a  number of assistants to the IAEA director attended the meeting  for the IAEA.</p>

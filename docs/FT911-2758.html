			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Why London failed LONDON, beaten by Manchester in the contest for Britain's Olympics bid, had hoped the games would have proved a fillip for development in Docklands and a spur to transport and other spending. The London Docklands Development Corporation yesterday played down the significance of the Olympics in helping to regenerate London. The LDDC said it had provided advice to the London Olympic Campaign but had begun meeting the organisers only recently. London's bid failed on several grounds, according to those at the selection meeting. Lack of preparation: two rival groups were making competing bids for London until the end of January. Hazy details: many aspects of the London bid reflected the lack of preparation, with vague pledges for transport links and sports facilities which were expected to be completed in time but could not be guaranteed Lack of leadership: Sebastian Coe, the former Olympic medal winner who was leading the team, admitted to the committee that his first priority was his campaign for election as a Conservative MP. Insufficient backing: there was lukewarm support from the London boroughs and a refusal by the City of London to be titular head.</p>

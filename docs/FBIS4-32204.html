			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aasmund Willersrud: "Romania Does Not Want To </F> End Up Last in Line"]    [Text] Bucarest -- There are scarcely any other capitals  in the former East bloc where you immediatley meet with  expressions of satisfaction with the integration process in  Europe. The government in Bucarest was the first to grasp --  and to do so with great eagerness -- NATO's offer of Partnership  for Peace. Openly and pragmatically the Romanians realize that  it will take time before both NATO and the EU [European Union]  open their doors for full membership for former Warsaw Pact  countries. But when this finally happens, these countries must  join as a group.    "Nondiscrimination is a clear precondition," Foreign  Ministry  Under Secretary of State Ion Gorita told AFTENPOSTEN.  "Partnership expressly lays this down and opens up a host of  possibilities, from Bucarest's viewpoint. Integration in  Atlantic cooperation has absolute priority in Romanian foreign  policy."    For good or ill Romania sees itself as a Balkan country.  Ideally an "island of stability" in the most troubled region in  Europe, a diplomatic intermediary with open channels to all the  republics in the former Yugoslavia. But in strategic terms a  country without allies, wedged between areas of explosive  conflict in the Balkans and in the former Soviet empire.    The conflict surrounding the lifting of the arms embargo  against the sides in the Yugoslavia conflict is causing cold  shivers in Bucarest. People are convinced that more arms and  military intervention from the East or West would lead  inevitably to the spread of the war. The rest of the world must  continue to apply political pressure, but today no one other  than the partners themselves can resolve the conflict, in the  view of the Romanians.    The Romanians' traditional friendship with Serbia gave rise  to some skepticism in Western circles, but the government says  that it is endeavoring to loyally observe the international  blockade. Even thought this means enormous losses for a country  which was already poor.    Romania is a large nation with 23 million inhabitants. A  unified state, the government points out, despite all the unrest  surrounding the Hungarian minority which is calling for  autonomy. The most repressed and backward of the countries of  Eastern Europe also emerged from 1989, the year of revolution,  with the greatest number of problems. Despite all the economic  and democratic shortcomings today's leaders refuse to accept a  place last in line for Europe.    "Romania has strongly opposed the more rapid integration  into  NATO of certain states. Hungary before Romania is therefore out  of the question," Defense Ministry Under Secretary of State  Ioan-Mircea Pascu said. "This would not solve any of the  problems, but rather reinforce the divisions in Europe," he  warned.    Well aware that the four richer Visegrad states -- Hungary,  Poland, the Czech Republic, and in part Slovakia -- consider  themselves to be in a group of their own on the doorstep of both  NATO and the EU, the leaders in Romania reel off  counterarguments. Relations with Hungary are and will remain the  stumbling block, even though there is a confidence that  socialist leader Gyula Horn will bring more pragmatism into  foreign policy.    "The outgoing government were historians almost to a man.  Could you expect anything other than history to become the  driving force in politics?" Pascu asked. Now he sees a chance  of directing the gaze toward the future instead.    "But until we achieve an agreement between the two  countries as a guarantee of stable and normal good-neighborly  relations, it is unthinkable that Hungary should be integrated  before Romania. We are not asking for special friendly  relations, only ordinary civilized relations," the under  secretary said.    These are strong, but significant words about the situation  today. Ion Gorita of the Foreign Ministry gave the direct  warning: "A NATO frontier between Hungary and Romania would be  a new Iron Curtain -- a frontier that would offer a new conflict  situation."    Nor do the Romanians see any reason why Russia should be  given special status, even though the country is one of the most  sensitive security problems in Europe at present.    But the Romanians have to ask themselves the key question:  When will Romania become "mature" enough for admission to the  European Union and to security structures? Certain economic and  democratic minimum standards must be met.    "From the democratic viewpoint we are already mature  enough,"  Gorita claimed. "All the institutions are in place, and we have  been found worthy of admission to the Council of Europe in line  with similar standards."    Many officials I spoke to in Bucarest admit that President  Ion Iliescu was a problem in relations with foreign countries in  the initial phase. He was a figure symbolic of the "stillborn  revolution," a communist who refused to reform the old  structures. Today this "psychological barrier" has been removed,  Gorita claimed. And this week Czech President Vaclav Havel is  coming to pay an official visit -- a figure symbolic of  democracy in Europe.    Economically a good deal remains before Romania comes up to  the EU's standards, but the under secretary of state sent back  the challenge to Brussels: "You must help us with investment  and capital; alone Romania has scarcely a chance."</p>

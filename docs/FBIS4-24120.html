			<p>BFN     [Text] In the city of Kuito in Bie Province, despite minor  interruptions in the shelling by the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], the situation has not  improved. More than one dozen people were killed and many more  wounded in the city today. After the heavy defeats it has  suffered, it is thought that the rebel army is reorganizing to  mount another offensive against the city of Kuito and its  outskirts. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports.    [Begin Abraao recording] UNITA on several occasions  interrupted the shelling of the city today. This was followed  by snipers' fire. A source from the government forces'  operational command views the relative calm in the city of Kuito  today as a preparation for future actions by the Black  Cockerel's troops against the city and its outskirts, after the  heavy defeats they suffered over the past 48 hours. Thus, it is  expected that the city of Kuito will experience fierce clashes  and violent shellings at a time when many people are dying in  the war and from lack of medicine. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] On Sunday, an explosion occurred in the area of the  No. 2 plant at one of the PPG [anti-cholesterol agent]  production complexes. A commission created for this purpose is  currently investigating the causes of this incident.    The commandos of La Coronela and the No. 8 Unit of the  Minint  [Interior Ministry] National Fire Prevention and Extinguishing  Directorate were the first to arrive following the emergency  which occurred at 1100 on Sunday at the No. 2 plant of Western  Scientific Center.    The determined participation of the young firemen prevented  the fire from spreading. Emilio Gomez Hernandez, a delegate of  the 95th Sector of the Fifth Arroyo Arenas Council, also played  an important and courageous role. Eva Alvarez arrived  immediately and was able to interview him.    [Begin recording] [Alvarez] What did you do when you heard  the explosion?    [Gomez] I was in the yard. I quickly evacuated the  personnel over to the river, as we have been instructed to do.    [Alvarez] In which yard were you?    [Gomez] In my back yard. I was going into the house, coming  from the backyard.    [Alvarez] Do you live across the street?    [Gomez] I live exactly across the street from the plant.  When I heard the explosion I looked up and saw red flames. I  thought it was an air raid or a bomb. Then I quickly...  [pauses] I expected another explosion so I quickly evacuated  the personnel across the river. I mean all the personnel in the  area.    [Alvarez] And the neighbors.    [Gomez] And the neighbors. There are 18 houses in the area.  I evacuated them toward the river. Then I quickly ran over to  the plant [words indistinct].    [Alvarez] What did you do at the plant?    [Gomez] I tried to close the valves, meaning the boiler's  valves.    [Alvarez] Do you know about that?    [Gomez] Yes, I know where they are because I have been here  with them. There are three valves at the plant.    [Alvarez] The plant where the accident occurred?    [Gomez] Yes, the plant where the accident occurred. Then I  checked this side and had someone close down the street which  leads to the freeway and the street which leads to Lazaro Pena.    [Alvarez] To facilitate the firemen's arrival?    [Gomez] To facilitate the firemen's arrival and to keep  public transit vehicles away. Then I checked the neighborhood  in case someone had been injured. That is what we did.    [Alvarez] Did you have anything to do with the injured  comrades?    [Gomez] No.    [Alvarez] Did they sustain minor injuries?    [Gomez] Yes.    [Alvarez] I understand nine of them sustained injuries but  were able to walk.    [Gomez] I saw when they left and they were able to walk.  That is what I saw.    [Alvarez] Then you made sure the valves were secure.    [Gomez] I secured the vales and the neighborhood, afraid  another explosion would occur. In other words, everyone in the  neighborhood was led to the river. [end recording]    Emilio Gomez Hernandez surpassed his responsibility as a  delegate. He evacuated the neighbors and, thanks to his  knowledge about the plant, he was able to close the valves  connected to the boilers -- despite a shower of glass which  threatened his own life. This man, a retired officer from the  explosives team, honored the motto of the Minint, which today  marks its 33rd anniversary -- our strength is the people's  strength.</p>

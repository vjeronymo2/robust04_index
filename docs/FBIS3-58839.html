			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ari.": "BDI Expects Stimulation of Foreign </F> Demand"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- In the opinion of the Federal  Association of German Industry (BDI), the possible gradual  economic recovery will not yet lead to a relaxation of the labor  market.    Rather, the Association proceeds on the assumption that the  employment problem will even increase in 1994. The latest  economic report substantiates this by the statement that the  expected stimulation of foreign demand can only result in a  modest growth impulse. With the new increase of the burden of  rates and taxes, the economy has been burdened with an  additional "field pack for the way out of the economic  depression." According to this assumption, it will not be  possible to return to a dynamic investment boom and thus to  solve the employment problem in 1994, it was stated.    The industrial enterprises reacted to the economic  deterioration with rationalization and staff cuts. The measures  have not failed to be effective. While in the first quarter of  1993, the unit labor costs, which increased by more than 10  percent, almost exploded, they were only about 1.5 percent  higher than last year in the past three available months.  However, the cost crisis has not yet been overcome. While  producer prices continue to decline, the profit situation  remains tense.    The improvement of the cost situation does not suffice for  economic recovery. In addition, relative competitiveness has to  be improved and demand has to be developed. At present,  however, this is complicated by the increasing tax burden. As  early as now, the job reduction caused by rationalization goes  far beyond comparable developments of former cycles. A  considerable part of it also contains structural adjustments  because of deteriorated conditions of business locations, it was  stated.    Almost all job losses fell to industry in 1993. While in the  economy as a whole there were still about 1.3 million employees  more than in 1989, in the west German industry there were  already 100,000 fewer employees than in the recession year 1983.  Here it has been taken into account that the building trade was  the only industrial branch to slightly increase its employment  once again in 1993.    The BDI is convinced that the job reduction will gradually  end in eastern Germany. Production expanded in many branches in  1993. This process will broaden and become more dynamic this  year. Despite considerable success in the improvement of  production, the level of costs in the east is still higher than  in western Germany. This is an important reason for the  previous small success of east German enterprises in the world  market, it was stated.    Apart from Great Britain, in the countries of the European  Union (EU) the economic situation is still marked by weak  economic activity. However, the downward trend slowed  perceptibly in the second half of 1993. Meanwhile, the bottom  of recession has probably been reached almost everywhere.  Private consumption has stagnated. As a result of the  increasing surplus capacity and the pessimistic business  expectations, the enterprises' investments have decreased  considerably.    The economic development is still suffering from the  sluggish  domestic demand. Therefore, industry in the EU countries  suffered most from recession in 1993. From June to August,  production decreased by 3.8 percent and the production of  capital goods by even 6.4 percent, it was stated.    At the end of the year, however, there were the first signs  of a recovery of the EU economy. The world economic  surroundings have improved further. Thus, the export chances of  European enterprises have clearly increased. The stimulation of  exports will initiate a modest recovery, but without a change in  the trend in domestic demand it will not be possible to achieve  sufficient dynamism, which is required for the reduction of  unemployment. The BDI assesses it positively that, with 3.2  percent, the inflation rate in the European Union has fallen to  a new low in November and may decrease further, since the  pressure from wage costs will presumably decrease. Then  monetary policy will be able to stick to its course, which  supports economic activity.    The improvement of the economic climate in the European  Union  itself also points to a further economic stimulation. The  latest poll signals decreasing pessimism in industry in nine out  of 12 countries. Capacity utilization amounted to 77.5 percent  in October, and thus it was slightly higher than in the previous  quarter. In the opinion of the BDI, the capacity utilization  rate will increase gradually in the next few months.</p>

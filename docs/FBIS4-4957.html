			<p>BFN     [Text] President Kim Yong-sam yesterday expressed strong  displeasure over the illicit election campaigning cases in which  his close associates were implicated. Kim also said he was  dissatisfied with the way the administration handled the  revision of the country schedule of the Uruguay Round world  trade pact.    "I had made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate any illegality and wrongdoing in elections," the  President said in a breakfast meeting with the cabinet members.  Some people acquainted with past practices may commit  wrongdoings, but (this administration's) commitment to clean  elections should not be blemished under any circumstances, Kim  said.    Kim made the tough remarks apparently in reference to the  controversies created by his own close associates, including  Inchon Mayor Choe Ki-son and South Chungchong Province Gov. Pak  Tae-kwon.    Choe has already been formally warned by the Central  Election  Management Committee (CEMC) for distributing umbrellas to Inchon  citizens in February. The election watchdog took the action  after it concluded Choe, a former lawmaker, had conducted what  amounted to campaigning for next year's local elections.    The CEMC is also investigating similar alleged illegal  campaign activities by Pak, also a former member of the national  legislature. Choe allegedly sponsored mountain climbing and  overseas trips for South Chungchong Province citizens.    Both Choe and Pak were appointed by President Kim, and the  opposition Democratic Party has been strongly demanding that Kim  fire them.    A top Chongwadae [presidential office] official, however,  indicated yesterday that President Kim will not take any  punitive action against either Choe or Pak.    "The President's remarks emphasizing clean elections (at  yesterday's meeting with the cabinet) should not be interpreted  as meaning that he will take action against the two," said Yi  Won- chong, the senior presidential secretary for political  affairs.    Regarding the dispute over the Uruguay Round country  schedule, President Kim urged the cabinet to reveal the truth to  the people. "I hardly understand why we should have this kind of  a dispute," Kim said. The administration should either seek the  people's understanding or make apologies in accordance with the  truth, he said.    Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang expressed his regrets over both  the alleged illegal election campaign cases and the Uruguay  Round controversy.    Opposition parties and news media have been criticizing the  administration on the assumption that the government modified  the country schedule in secret, Yi said. "But the Uruguay Round  agreement entitles each country to make some changes to the  country schedule," he said. The administration did nothing  dishonest or immoral because the changes were made in  consideration of the interest of farmers, the prime minister  said.</p>

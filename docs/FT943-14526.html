			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Ex-power chief's options net Pounds  1/2 m Mr John Wilson, who retired as chairman of London Electricity in April, made a paper profit of Pounds 516,000 through the company's executive share option scheme earlier this year. According to the company's annual report, Mr Wilson exercised options on 150,000 shares at Pounds 2.61 each at a time when the share price stood at Pounds 6.05p. Three other directors also cashed in options, netting a paper profit of Pounds 660,000. Other annual reports showed that directors at Eastern Electricity, Northern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity exercised options this year, making substantial profits. They included Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, who made a profit of more than Pounds 250,000 on his options on 85,000 shares. The latest disclosures bring the total profits made on executive share option schemes in the privatised electricity industry to almost Pounds 10m - with several companies still due to report. The profits have been denounced as 'blatant profiteering' by the Labour party, but the companies have defended them as a way of providing incentives to their top staff. The options were granted shortly after privatisation in 1989, but only became exercisable at the beginning of this year for tax reasons. Over the intervening period, electricity share prices soared, offering the prospect of large profits for option holders.</p>

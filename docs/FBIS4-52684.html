			<p>BFN     [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN, in cooperation with Gallup  Organization Inc., conducted in March the 11th opinion poll  covering five nations (Japan, the United States, the United  Kingdom, Germany, and France), and surveyed how those countries  place trust in one another. The United States has been the most  trustworthy nation for Japan since 1978, but the percentage of  trust has fallen below 50 percent for the first time in 12  years. In addition, 20 percent of people in both Japan and the  United States cited the other country as a potential military  threat, displaying a swing in the sense of trust by citizens of  both nations. The survey demonstrated anew that one of the most  crucial problems confronting the cabinet of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata is to restore Japan-U.S. relations which have been  strained by trade friction. The trade issue appears to have  chilled the feelings Japanese and Americans have for each other.  Japan was the most important nation for U.S. economic  interests, third for British, German, and French economic  interests, but was judged the 13th most trustworthy nation in  the United States, the 10th in the United Kingdom, and the 11th  in Germany and France. Moreover, according to a U.S. opinion  poll complied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 29 April,  the trust that the Americans place in Japan has clearly declined  to the lowest level in the last 20 years.    Asked to pick five nations from a list of 31 they considered  the most trustworthy, 45 percent of Japanese respondents placed  the United States at the top. However, the figure showed a drop  of 6 percentage points from the previous survey conducted in  1992, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time in 12  years (a 1982 poll recorded 49.6 percent). The degree of  Japanese trust in the United States has been on the decline  since the start of the 1990's because of worsening bilateral  economic friction, but Japan's backlash against the  administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton for its pressure  to open Japanese markets seems to have rebounded as seen in the  poll.    In terms of how others see Japan, 10 percent of those  surveyed in the United States said Japan was trustworthy, two  percentage points more than the record low recorded in 1992 and  the second lowest since the polls began.    Japan obtained low marks in the survey on its  trustworthiness  as viewed by Europeans, scoring 12 percent (11th) in the United  Kingdom, 18 percent (10th) in Germany, and 17 percent (11th) in  France. In a similar query, Japanese respondents had a higher  evaluation of these countries, giving the United Kingdom 40  percent (second), Germany 27 percent (fourth), and France 26  percent (fifth).    However, the perception that Japan is economically important  has filtered down to the countries where the survey took place.  Japan sharply outdistanced Canada and the European Union as the  nation most important to U.S. economic interests, gaining the  top position with 53 percent. It also placed third in the  United Kingdom, Germany, and France. In Japan, the United  States overwhelmed other countries with 82 percent.    Fifty-six percent of Japanese respondents put North Korea at  the top of the list of nations that could become a military  threat to their country, while the Middle East topped all others  as an area that could become a military threat to the United  States, the United Kingdom, and France. The former Soviet Union  occupied first place in the survey in Germany. In addition, 21  percent of respondents in Japan listed the United States while  20 percent of the Americans cited Japan.    Regarding Japan's economic clout in the 21st century, the  predominant feeling is that it has reached its zenith since 39  percent of Japanese respondents said the economy will not change  and 31 percent said it will become weaker, outnumbering 25  percent who said it will become stronger. However, respondents  in the United States and the three European countries said the  Japanese economy will grown stronger since they apparently see  it as a primary factor pressuring their own economies.</p>

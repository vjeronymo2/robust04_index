			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> K mart Sales Down: K mart Corp.'s May sales are falling behind the company's  expectations, but the Troy, Mich.-based retailer said it still hopes to meet  its 1989 sales targets. At a news conference following K mart's annual  shareholders' meeting, Chairman Joseph Antonini said sales this month are  behind K mart's goal of 3.5% growth. The soft May sales come on top of a  disappointing first quarter in which K mart's net income fell 22% to $94.1  million from $120.8 million in the same period last year.  </P></p>

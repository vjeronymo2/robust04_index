			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Domtar to spin off gypsum and wallboard businesses Domtar, the big Canadian construction materials, pulp and paper and packaging group, plans to spin off its gypsum, wallboard and decorative panels business with an initial public offer in the US and possibly Canada that could raise more than CDollars 400m (USDollars 289.8m). The assets, valued at about CDollars 380m, have already been put into a new 100 per cent-owned subsidiary called America North Industries (ANI), including 16 wallboard plants plus gypsum mining operations, located mostly across the US and also Canada. Domtar ranks as North America's third-biggest wallboard producer. The business is recovering sharply with a rising US home building market. ANI also includes Domtar's highly-profitable decorative panels business. The initial public offer will be made through Kidder Peabody and Salomon Bros as lead underwriters. Concurrently ANI will raise another USDollars 125m via a public note issue. Domtar could retain up to 40 per cent of ANI. It has already spun off its newsprint unit in a CDollars 289m initial public offer. It wants to concentrate now on its communications and business papers unit, speciality fine papers and packaging. It is trying to negotiate management buy-outs of two pulp mills in eastern Canada.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Directors' transactions THE SHARE price performance of electronics group Vistec over the past 2 1/2 years has been strong. Robert Morton, the group's high-profile chairman, capitalised when he bought 1.8m at between 10-13p in 1991. Now, chief executive Adrian Wallis has sold 350,000 at 29p, having disposed of 650,000 for 26p at the start of the year. Having slumbered peacefully for most of the past five years, Norbain Electronics' share price burst into life at the turn of the year, rising from a low of 58p to the present level, a record high. John Nicol, chairman and managing director, has sold 350,000 shares at 155p. But perhaps this disposal should be viewed in the context of two previous sales - one of 1m shares at 37p, the other of 350,000 for the same price - in September 1991 and 1992 respectively. There was selling this week in another electronics company, Logica. Logica has had its fair share of problems in recent times but seems to have got over the worst. In September 1990, Leonard Taylor, a non-executive director, bought 100,000 shares at 155p and sold them for 236p a few months later. This time, he and a colleague have each sold sold 75,000 at 245p, leaving Taylor with about 1.4m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           No of Company                  Sector     Shares   Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Electron House            Elns     122,000    123          1 Emap                       Med       7,782     27          1* Fletcher King             Prop      30,000     17          1 Hunting                   EngA      39,796     89          2* Logica                    Elns     150,000    368          2 Lynx Holdings             Elns      96,000     33          1 Norbain Electronics       Misc     350,000    543          1 Parkland Textiles         Text      20,000     31          1 Salvesen Christian        BuSe      72,902    254          1* Vistec                    Elns     350,000    102          1 VSEL Consortium           EngG       2,000     17          1 Yorkshire Water           Watr      27,584    137          1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alexandra Workwear        Text      10,000     15          1 Ascot Holdings            Prop     500,000     21          1 Betterware                Stor       6,900     17          1 Carclo Engineering        EngG      20,000     48          1 Finlay (James)            FdMa      14,000     10          1 Global Group              Misc     100,000     95          1 Gt Universal Stores       Stor       5,000     95          1 Jeyes Group                H&amp;H      27,000     78          2 Mining &amp; Allied Supl      EngG     157,000     32          3 Secure Trust              OthF      20,000    102          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 3 (AFP) -- The PLO wants Islamic  militant prisoners held by Israel to be included in any accord  on the release of Palestinian detainees, PLO chief negotiator  Nabil Sha'th said here Sunday [3 April].    "All Palestinian prisoners are our responsibility, whether  they belong to (the Islamic Resistance Movement) Hamas or not,"  Sha'th told AFP.    "The question of the release of prisoners will be examined  today (Sunday) or tomorrow, and the Hamas prisoners remain the  main problem," Sha'th said, adding that the releases would take  place in stages after an accord to launch Palestinian autonomy  was signed.    Israel and the PLO started intensive negotiations here  Sunday  to launch Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho within 10  days, after a break of five weeks because of the Hebron massacre.    Israel has freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners since  the autonomy negotiations began last October.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin announced Sunday that more  Palestinian prisoners would be freed and others who had been  deported or fled would be allowed to return to the territories.    "These measures will concern only those wanted or expelled,  who do not have blood on their hands, grassroots militants and  not frontline political leaders," he said.    A Foreign Ministry official said the majority of the 10,000  Palestinians still in Israeli jails would be released in several  stages.</p>

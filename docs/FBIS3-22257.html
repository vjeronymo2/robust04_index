The attack by Prof. David Pearce, proposer of the  Government's ``green'' taxes on fuel, will cause embarrassment  on the eve of the Prime Minister's launch tomorrow of  environmental strategy for the next 20 years.    Prof. Pearce will publish research this week showing that  the  &pound;15 billion raised from road taxes each year is dwarfed by  &pound;25 billion in ``social costs'' of road use -- noise,  pollution, wear and tear on roads, congestion and accidents to  pedestrians. If the motorist was to pay the real cost of using a  car, he said, road taxes would need to be nearly &pound;10  billion  more, nearly double what they are now.    Prof. Pearce, adviser to former Environment Secretaries  Patten and Heseltine, says his research demolishes the argument  of lobby groups such as the AA and RAC that motorists get ``a  rough deal'' because he pays &pound;15 billion a year in tax and  only &pound;6 billion is spent on road building.    ``We have done something that the Department of Transport  should have done. If they did their sums properly we wouldn't  have such a rosy picture of the benefits we get from the roads  programme,'' said Prof. Pearce, head of environmental economics  at University College London.    ``If you were to start to charge for using the road, you  would need to charge the motorist for the pedestrians killed  each year and the fact that he causes congestion to someone  else.''    ``Similarly, no one currently charges the motorist for the  social cost of the nitrogen oxides and the carbon dioxide that  his car emits.''    Prof. Pearce, who sits on two Government advisory  committees,  says the Government's proposals for motorway charging, aimed at  raising money to spend on roads, do not go far enough to stop  escalating traffic growth.    He said: ``I'm highly sensitive to the argument that giving  a  higher priority to protecting the environment would cost  industry money. But the Government has done no work on how much  it would cost, or how it could be paid. It has simply dropped  the idea.''    ``I believe that this change can be engineered to be good  for  the individual, good for the country, good for economic growth  and good for the environment.''    He said his attack on Government policies arose from ``sheer  frustration.'' He had ``finally run out of patience'' after five  year of working with Government.    ``We've all been extremely fair to them, addressing our  criticisms internally. I remember saying when I got a copy of  that White Paper, `Is this it?' It was all the repackaging of  old policies.''    ``There was nothing new and no imagination. I expect the  Sustainable Development Strategy, which Mr. Major publishes this  week, will be exactly the same thing.''    Prof. Pearce reflects the frustration of a mounting number  of  the Government's closest advisers who feel that Mr. Major's  Government has promised to use market incentives instead of  regulation to address environmental problems, but has held back  from introducing measures such as motorway charges and landfill  taxes to back its convictions.    He is critical of leading civil servants, whom he accuses of  having ``a vested interest in not upsetting the applecart.''    ``Somewhere along the line we've run out of imagination. And  nothing has been helped by Downing Street,'' he added, in a  veiled reference to Mr. Major.    Prof. Pearce's new book Blueprint 3: Measuring  Sustainable Development -- a follow up to Blueprint  for a Green Economy commissioned by the Department of the  Environment -- contains the first account of how in the 1980s  Britain was living on capital rather than new income.    He looked at the five percent savings made nationally in the  1980s and subtracted the depreciation of assets such as North  Sea oil and gas reserves, the increase in pollution and the loss  of recreational opportunities through new development.    He found Britain was using up capital faster than it was  generating income from economic growth. ``What tips us into the  red is the failure to take account of the environment,'' he said.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / SIB orders building society to check advice NORTH of England Building Society, the UK's 20th largest society, has been ordered by regulators to contact 600 customers who may have been misled when sold pensions or investment products. The Securities and Investments Board, which regulates the society, conducted an inspection visit last October. The Department of Social Security has asked regulators overseeing the sale of personal pensions to ensure that they are not sold to those for whom they are inappropriate. The board, along with Lautro and Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisations for life insurers and independent financial advisers respectively, had told sales agents not to encourage members of occupational schemes to transfer to personal pensions. The board, which has been criticised by the retail financial services industry for being less rigorous a regulator than the self-regulatory bodies, has stepped up its reviews of sales tactics. Recently, Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank, both regulated by SIB, have said they will stop accepting pensions transfers. The board's review at North of England raised questions about the quality of advice given to those who had transferred out of their existing pension arrangements and those who had purchased so-called single premium with-profits bonds. Regulators had been concerned that with-profits bonds had been sold as high-yielding alternatives to building society deposit accounts and that customers did not understand the heavy penalties for early withdrawal. The society said SIB had ordered it to offer all 600 customers the chance to have their cases reviewed by an separate independent financial adviser and make restitution where necessary. So far, 163 have requested advice. North of England has announced it will no longer be an independent financial adviser and said it would sell only the products of General Accident Company from September 1. It added: 'We felt the cost of compliance for an independent financial adviser was too great for a building society of our size,' it said.</p>

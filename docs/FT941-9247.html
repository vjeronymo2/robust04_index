			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Japan's pump-priming package approved Japan's cabinet yesterday approved a final draft budget worth Y73,080bn (Pounds 465bn) for the fiscal year starting April 1, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The budget, aimed at pulling Japan out of its worst post-war recession, is expected to go to parliament for approval in early March. The recession has caused sharp tax revenue shortfalls, prompting the government to draw up an austere budget for 1994/95 which marked only 1 per cent growth from the budget for 1993/94. The draft budget backs up last Tuesday's Y15,250bn pump-priming package, which cuts income and other taxes by Y6,000bn.</p>

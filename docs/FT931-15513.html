			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P sees improved quality of US credit in certain areas STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, one of the largest Wall Street credit rating agencies, yesterday maintained that the slump in credit quality in the US had reached its nadir, and was now improving in certain areas. But it suggested that a declining trend was still underway outside the US, and that credit standings of non-US corporations could worsen further this year. Mr Leo O'Neill, S&amp;P's chairman, attributed the improving US picture to four factors: the improving economy; the restructuring of corporate balance sheets, which produced record levels of debt and equity issuance last year; better capital ratios and improving asset quality in the banking sectors; and on the municipal front, efforts by state and local governmental organisations to balance their budgets. The improved US situation is relative, however. S&amp;P revealed that, in 1992, it still made 492 downgrades, representing Dollars 383bn of debt, compared with 252 upgrades, representing Dollars 126bn worth. But the margin between down and upgrades narrowed significantly. In 1991, for example, there were 695 downgrades overall, covering Dollars 504bn of debt - and for US industrial corporations, upgrades and downgrades were roughly similar in number last year. S&amp;P said there were 189 downgrades representing Dollars 141bn of debt, compared with 150 upgrades, covering Dollars 66bn-worth. Looking ahead, Mr O'Neill suggested that S&amp;P saw continued pressure on credit ratings in some sectors of the US economy, notably retailing, airlines, computers, publishing, and the property-casualty insurance sector where the costs of Hurricane Andrew are still taking a toll. But he also forecast improvements for the banking, telecommunications, environmental waste, supermarket, and electric utilities sectors. Outside the US, S&amp;P painted a bleaker picture. Mr O'Neill forecast a further year of rating downgrades for Europe generally, including the banking and corporate sectors.</p>

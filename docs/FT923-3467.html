			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira closes below ERM floor BOTH THE Italian lira and sterling remained under intense pressure in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, in spite of attempts in Rome and London to support the currencies, writes James Blitz. The Italian authorities are making a huge attempt to support the lira, but the currency spent most of the European trading day on or near its ERM floor of L765.40 to the D-Mark. Last week, Italy raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points and, on Wednesday, the government announced that it would be seeking emergency powers to alter taxation and investment in the economy where necessary. Neither of these moves is having much effect on the markets. 'Dealers increasingly believe that the lira will be devalued, irrespective of the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior American adviser at Bank of America in London. Yesterday, Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Bank of Italy's governor, criticised the Bundesbank for having 'excessively high' interest rates, and said they should be cut. Some dealers saw this as a particularly ominous development because the criticism came as the German central bank was helping to support the Italian currency by buying lira through open market intervention. The Italians may have been frustrated that the German intervention, which is required under European Monetary System rules, was not large enough. Several analysts said the intervention had been too small, and the lira closed in London below its ERM floor at L765.70 per D-Mark. The pound was under less pressure than it had been on Wednesday evening, but hovered around the DM2.79 level for most of the day, near its ERM floor of DM2.7780. It was partly supported by a statement from the British government that sterling would remain fixed to its central ERM rate of DM2.95. Compounding this were unofficial suggestions that the Bundesbank may lower rates before the end of the year. Mr Eberhard Martini, president of Germany's main banking trade group, said German interest rates could come down 'at the beginning of next year at the latest, possibly in December'. But the pound closed in London unchanged at DM2.7875. The dollar rallied sharply to a high of DM1.4198 in the European morning, partly on comments from Mr Wayne Angell, a US Federal Reserve governor, that the US currency was seriously undervalued. However, a substantial sell order by a large Far Eastern investor wiped out the gain and the dollar ended virtually unchanged in London at DM1.4105. A good rally was later staged in New York by the dollar, leaving a DM1.4258 close.</p>

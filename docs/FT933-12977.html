Alcan and Alusuisse will be supplying technology for the project. According to Mr Tapan Mitra, managing director of Indian Aluminium, the Rs22.5bn (Pounds 485m) project should start production by 1996-97. Nearly 25 per cent of the cost will be in foreign exchange. Some of the alumina will be sold in advance to raise finance for the unit. It is also proposed to get some toll smelted into aluminium abroad. The new company to be formed to implement the project will take on leases of bauxite (aluminium ore) mines in Orissa with estimated deposits of 200m tonnes.</p>

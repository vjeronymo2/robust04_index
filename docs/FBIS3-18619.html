			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mia Doornaert commentary: "Russia and Europe"] </F>   [Text] The fact that Russia is joining the Partnership for  Peace offered by NATO is good news. Cooperation between the  armed forces of NATO and Russia will contribute to reciprocal  transparency and trust. It is not in the interest of European  security for Russia to position itself, or be kept, outside  Europe.    However, a statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin is raising questions. Churkin saw "a great potential  for partnership in the interest of peace" for NATO and Russia.    This is reminiscent of the Russian proposal for a  partnership  between NATO and Russia to guarantee security in Central and  East Europe. The reaction of the Central European countries,  which would like to join NATO, was an unequivocal "No."    What those countries want, and what they are striving hard  to  achieve, is to join forces with West Europe, not live under  continued Russian tutelage, which produced little of positive  value over the last 40 years. Moreover, Russia recently made  some statements that were hardly reassuring.    A kind of condominium between the United States and Russia,  a  subtle continuation of Yalta, and of the dividing line of the  Cold War, cannot be the aim of the Partnership for Peace .    The question as to whether Russia will play a constructive  role in European security via that partnership depends not only  on the Western understanding of Russian sensibilities, but also  on Russia itself, and its determination of its legitimate  interests.    If Russia includes continued limited sovereignty over the  countries in Central and East Europe among its legitimate  interests, then it will be making a mistake. And there is no  enmity or Cold War dogma behind pointing out that it is  inconceivable in the new Europe that state sovereignty should  stop at the eastern border of the unified Germany.    Then again, the manner in which Russia effectively belongs  to  Europe also depends on Russia itself, on its choices regarding  internal development, but, more importantly, on its attitude  vis-a-vis the outside world.    No one has a hold on internal Russian development, not even  the United States. However, the United States and the member  states of the European Union can certainly influence Russian  foreign policy. They can make it clear that constructive,  friendly cooperation, which accepts the new situation in Europe  and the regained sovereignty of the countries of Central and  East Europe, will elicit a better response than the language of  threats, and claims to "traditional spheres of influence."    One cannot celebrate the end of the Cold War while at the  same time sticking to its borders. There need be no conflict  between a constructive, active role for Russia in the area of  European security and the legitimate demands of the countries of  Central and East Europe.    If this is the spirit in which Russia joins the Partnership  for Peace, then there will be every reason to applaud such a  step.</p>

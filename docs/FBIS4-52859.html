			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Uzbekistan's President Islam  Karimov arrived Monday [16 May] on a four-day visit for talks  with Japanese Government and business leaders.    Karimov, 56, will meet with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on  Tuesday evening after an audience with Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko in the morning, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Hata is expected to express Japan's interest in securing  stability in Central Asia and voice support for Uzbekistan's  reform efforts, the officials said.    Supporting Uzbekistan's reform efforts is important since  the  country has the largest population in Central Asia.    Hata is also likely to tell Karimov that Japan is interested  in helping solve environmental problems surrounding the Aral  Sea. He will also call for expanding personnel exchanges  between Japan and Uzbekistan.    The two leaders are also expected to discuss international  affairs.    During Karimov's visit, Japan will pledge cultural  grant-in-aid, humanitarian aid and technical cooperation to  Uzbekistan, the officials said.    Officials accompanying the Uzbek leader include Deputy Prime  Minister Otkir Sultanov, who is also minister of foreign  economic relations, and Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Saidqasymov.    Karimov will visit the western Japan cities of Kyoto and  Osaka before leaving for home Thursday.</p>

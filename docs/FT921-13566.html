			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sharp fourth quarter fall at Bowater BOWATER, a leading US manufacturer of newsprint, yesterday reported a sharp drop in fourth-quarter net income because of the US economic downturn, but said it saw some encouraging signs for the second half of 1992. Net income in the period fell to Dollars 1.6m, or 2 cents a share, from Dollars 18.3m, or 48 cents, on sales down to Dollars 326m from Dollars 353m. Full-year income totalled Dollars 45.6m, down from Dollars 78.4m in 1990. Mr Anthony Gammie, chairman, said the most important factors behind this were falling prices for all major product lines over the past few quarters and stoppages in the final period to control newsprint inventories. He added there was as yet no apparent pick-up in the economy of the kind needed to improve newspaper advertising demand and thus newsprint prices. However, he said encouraging signs included an apparent end to the decline in newsprint consumption and major capacity closings by the Canadian industry.</p>

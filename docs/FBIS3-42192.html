			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A year and four months after his imprisonment the  image of Shining Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman, who will spend  the rest of his life in prison, is deteriorating in the eyes of  dissident members of his criminal organization.    The number of attacks carried out by this gang on the  birthdays of Abimael Guzman and Mao Zedong last December in Lima  shows that the SL "commemorated" Mao's birthday with a greater  number of actions than they did for "President Gonzalo," which  demonstrates the deterioration of his image. This can be  understood from statistics recorded by the Institute for  National Defense Research (Iniden).    According to Iniden, during the second half of 1993 Shining  Path carried out 346 actions, killing 308 people -- including  civilian and military -- which is a lower figure compared to the  same period of the previous year.    In a document sent to this newspaper, Iniden states that  most  of the SL actions in December were concentrated near two dates:  December 3, Abimael Guzman's birthday, and December 26, Mao's  100th birthday.    Faithful to the purest SL style, the document states, the  two  "commemorations" consisted of a wave of terrorist attacks. This  means that from 2 to 5 December, the Shining Path carried out 18  attacks, and from 24 to 29 December, 24 attacks.    By the quality of the targets and the number of attacks, the  document states, it can be deduced that Mao was much more  "commemorated" than Guzman.    Iniden states that the attacks must not be considered as the  Shining Path's last resort, or as isolated attacks, although "it  must not be ignored that such low figures for SL attacks have  not been seen since 1992."    In a long, thorough analysis Iniden reports that the Shining  Path has ceased to be a threat to Peruvian political  feasibility. It nonetheless counsels the public not to be  overly optimistic given the escalation of its attacks.    The document states that for some people the new wave of SL  violence was carried out apparently with the pretext of  "commemorating" the birthday of Abimael Guzman and Mao's 100th  birthday.    For some analysts, the escalation of the violence was meant  to "maintain Guzman's negotiating capacity" and to make the SL  members in prison considered political or war prisoners, in  order to obtain their freedom once peace is "negotiated."    The document also points out the existence of a radical SL  group that does not accept a solution other than continuing with  the "armed struggle," a situation that does not allow them to  carry out negotiations for peace.    "This latter group does not think in the same way as the  imprisoned SL leaders and their followers," the Iniden document  states.</p>

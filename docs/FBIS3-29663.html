			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials from 19 February ROK vernacular newspapers on the  government's attitude toward North Korea regarding the nuclear  issue.    The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3  a 800-word editorial entitled "Lessons Two Years After the  North-South Agreement." The editorial reports "it is natural  that the government has set the exchange of special envoys as a  precondition for U.S.-North Korean talks," referring to the  government's decision to announce the conditional suspension of  the Team Spirit exercise when the exchange, as well as  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, are made.  The editorial suggests that North Korea may use the exchange of  special envoys to approach the United States.    The editorial notes that North Korea was not interested in  implementing the 4 July North-South joint statement and the 19  December North-South basic agreement. Noting North Korea's  insincere and capricious attitude toward South Korea, the  editorial indicates "it is regrettable that the government  assumes an ambiguous position toward North Korea's nuclear  issue."    The editorial concludes that "the government must make North  Korea aware that the Team Spirit exercise will be suspended and  that the third U.S.-North Korean talks may be possible only if  practical dialogues -- such as the discussion of simultaneous  inspection of the North and South, the holding of summit talks,  and exchange and cooperation between the North and South -- are  held through the exchange of special envoys."    The moderate Seoul KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on  page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Where Is the Spirit of  Agreement?" Referring to the significance and background of the  North-South agreement and to the government's effort to  implement it, the editorial reports that the South has allowed  Yi In-mo to reunite with his family in the North and that it has  proposed to the North side to establish a location in Panmunjom  where separated family members can meet.    The editorial adds that North Korea should respond to the  North- South dialogue and the exchange of special envoys if it  decides to accept the nuclear inspections.    The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes  on  page 3 an 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Government Must  Exercise its Right to Participate in Resolving the Nuclear  Issue." The editorial notes that "in a meeting of  unification-related ministries on 17 February, the government  decided to respond to North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear  inspections." The editorial reports this decision eased the  people's worry about the North Korean nuclear issue.    The editorial stresses that the government is very  interested  in realizing the exchange of special envoys, referring to  President Kim Yong-sam's letter to U.S. President Clinton  emphasizing the importance of progress in the North-South  dialogue for the complete settlement of the nuclear issue.    Noting the possibility of North Korea's active participation  in the future North-South dialogue to realize the third  U.S.-North Korean talks, the editorial reports that "the  government should exercise its right to participate in an issue  related to the fate of the nation, such as the North Korean  nuclear issue."    The independent moderate Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN in  Korean  publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The  Government's Ability To Deal With the Korean Peninsula Issue."  The editorial notes that the government should properly  formulate a reunification policy in view of the recent changes  in the international community and the complicated situation  surrounding the Korean peninsula.    Noting the people's attention to the government's  reunification policy, the editorial reports that the North and  South are the parties concerned in the reunification issue, even  though they need cooperation from the United States and Japan.    The editorial concludes that economic cooperation will  hasten  national reunification and points out the need to make plans for  economic cooperation.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Joint bid for Australian telephone unit THE Australian government said yesterday it had received a joint bid for the national telephone directory service from Australia Post and GTE Corporation, the US telecommunications group. The offer would remove control of National Directory Services (NDS) from Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC), the government-owned telecommunications carrier. Australia Post, which is government owned, would not comment. The bid would provide an initial payment of ADollars 400m, (USDollars 298.5) followed by further payments of up to ADollars 2bn over 15 years, depending on performance. The bid offers the Labor federal government a small contribution towards reducing the 1992-93 budget deficit, expected to exceed ADollars 10.5bn, following a deficit of more than ADollars 9bn in the year to June. However, it is likely to be opposed by backbench Labor MPs because it would transfer majority ownership of NDS to GTE, which would hold a 52 per cent stake through its subsidiary GTE Directories Corporation. The bid will be opposed fiercely by AOTC, which said it had not seen the proposal and claimed that overseas experience showed it would be a mistake to split the directory service from the main telecommunications carrier.</p>

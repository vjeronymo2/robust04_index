			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: RATING NEW RELEASES OF ORANGE COUNTY-BASED MUSICIANS;  </P> <P> ALBUMS: WALTER TROUT SCORES WITH FIRST SOLO RELEASE WHILE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S  GANG REACTION DEPENDS ON HOW STAGEY YOU LIKE YOUR SONGS.  </P> <P> For this week's Pop Beat, we'll catch up on some recent releases by Orange  County-based performers: The scale is * (poor) to ***** (a classic).  </P> <P> Walter Trout Band  </P> <P> "Life In The Jungle." (Bozz of Electra): ****  </P> <P> Trout, who lives in Huntington Beach, gave up a steady, high-profile gig when  he left John Mayall's Bluesbreakers to go on his own earlier this year. Now we  can see why -- "Life In The Jungle" heralds the arrival of a blues-rock talent  of the first order. The album, recorded in Denmark and issued in Europe (it's  available as an import at Music Market in Costa Mesa), showcases a performer  who is confident, mature and strikingly well rounded. Trout's sizzling guitar  work alone makes "Life In The Jungle" a must for six-string aficionados, but  there is much more than that here. Among the album's five original songs are  two ebullient, good-timey rockers and a couple of lovely, pop-flavored ballads  sung with a wistful soulfulness. The stormy title song conjures up the fear  brought on by a murder in Trout's own neighborhood.  </P> <P> At various times, Trout's approach can recall the stately blues balladry of  Eric Clapton ("The Mountain Song,"), the warmth of Little Feat ("Frederica"),  or the animal spirits of Lynyrd Skynyrd ("Good Enough To Eat"). A live version  of Jimi Hendrix's "Red House" finds Trout indulging his old tendency to overdo  the speed and flash. But elsewhere, he reaches an effective balance between  wildness and control with playing that serves his material rather than his ego.  </P> <P> Trout and his versatile backing trio are at their most potent on stage: The  album ends with a searing, 15-minute psychodrama built around live renditions  of the blues standards "Cold Cold Feeling" and "Serve Me Right to Suffer." The  two connected songs become an epiphany of anguish and remorse in a performance  that can stand as a textbook example of blues musicians tapping the deepest  reaches of their chosen calling's well of emotions.  </P> <P> National People's Gang  </P> <P> "Orange." (Dr. Dream): *** 1/2  </P> <P> One's attitude toward National People's Gang depends largely on one's response  to Chad Jasmine's calculatedly theatrical singing. Listeners who like their  rock vocals in the offhanded vernacular might not go for Jasmine's stagey act,  which can seem archly Anglicized and overdone. But there is nothing wrong with  theatricality when it brings a meaty role to life, and NPG's songs come off  like one-act monologues in which Jasmine gets inside the skin of obsessed  characters placed at emotional extremes. "Love Button," for example, finds him  doing a wired, James Woods-type turn as a gambling junkie going bust in Vegas.  </P> <P> Some of these playlets are abstract, but they never lack an intriguing,  off-center point: "Breaking Ground," an evocative, thought-provoking song about  detachment, seems to look down upon the sweat and heartbreak of humanity from  somewhere above the stratosphere. "White Boxes" is an unsettling examination of  the disguises that dysfunctional families don in an attempt to appear normal. A  feverish version of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin'  Groovy)" becomes a simultaneously mocking and exhilarating demolition derby  ride over the song that sounds as if Johnny Rotten is in the driver's seat.  </P> <P> Stylistically, NPG is an art-rock band with a strong command of textures  ranging from shimmering pop brightness to furious, focused pounding. The rhythm  section is deft and strong, with new bassist Deyo Glines adding some funkiness.  Chad Forrello is the do-everything MVP of NPG, a guitarist of commendable  selflessness whose playing is exciting without being obtrusive. Perhaps best of  all, the band steers clear of fashionable cynicism. Without sacrificing the  right to be ironic, National People's Gang shows that you don't have to lose a  sense of innocence, idealism and heart to prove that you're smart. After last  year's fine debut album, "The Hard Swing," NPG serves notice with "Orange" that  its creative reserves run deep.  </P> <P> Exude  </P> <P> "Testosterone Tapdance." (Rah! Rah!): ***  </P> <P> Lust and love is the subject, and while that's nothing novel, Exude's strongly  melodic pop craftsmanship keeps the oldest theme of all from getting stale.  Hunkering down in its Anaheim garage, this look-ma-no-guitars trio was able to  fashion a danceable techno-pop sound that is warm and human instead of coldly  mechanized. Frank Rogala's grainy, breathy vocals deserve some credit for that.  Rogala's voice is limited, but by borrowing resourcefully from such non-techno  sources as Mick Jagger, Tom Petty and Peter Wolf, he pieces together a singing  style that makes up in verve and personality what it lacks in purity and  strength. That's where Exude's savvy comes in: The band is smart enough to  surround the lead vocal parts with catchy ensemble harmonies that offset  Rogala's roughness and round out the sound. Younger brother Vince Rogala's  saxophone riffing provides another attractive voice to bolster the framework,  while Robin Canada's runs on conventional keyboards are a nice antidote to the  usual dance pop synths and samples.  </P> <P> On "359 Directions," an otherwise promising ballad that aims to recreate the  Stones' "Angie"/"Wild Horses" mode, Frank Rogala falters by trying to reach too  far beyond his ability. Exude's other false step (besides the off-putting album  cover) is a brooding instrumental finale that has nothing to do with anything  that comes before it on the album.  </P> <P> Exude celebrates lust while giving romance its due, and it frequently brings to  bear a light and clever lyrical touch ("You got me ga ga from the get go/You  did a tap dance right on my testosterone") that is missing from most  dance-oriented pop.  </P> <P> Big Drill Car  </P> <P> "Album Type Thing." (Cruz): ** 1/2  </P> <P> The title tells a lot: Big Drill Car's music is direct, plain-spoken and  economical, while its lyrics deal with the awkwardness that comes from facing  the emotional growing pains of youth.  </P> <P> There is a lot to admire here. For one thing, Big Drill Car hits with a force  that fully justifies its name. There is nothing fancy going on: the ensemble  delivers a heavy, rhythmic throb and crunch, with occasional brief solo jabs  from a metallic lead guitar. Melody never gets steamrollered, though. Big Drill  Car's aim is to be a punked-up pop band, hard-edged but catchy, and it usually  succeeds. The lyrics, and singer Frank Daly's delivery, are honest and  straightforward reflections of what it's like to be living in the aftermath of  adolescence, with its intense loves, regrets and frustrations. While the songs  deal with facing problems and failures, they also carry an appealing sense of  hopefulness and optimism that experience can be the foundation for growth.  </P> <P> The problem is that the four-man band is a little too single-minded and direct.  The songs take no unexpected turns -- the music is all headlong attack, with  the occasional Led Zeppelin-style tromp beat the only minor relief. The lyrics  don't move beyond the earnest, unadorned depiction of immediate feeling. And  those consistently catchy melodic hooks are a little too consistent: while each  song stands well on its own, a sense of sameness sets in over the course of the  album.  </P> <P> Word play, humor and a musical approach more conscious of the need for variety  and dynamic shifts should be on Big Drill Car's agenda the next time out. But  for now, this young band has laid a good foundation. (Big Drill Car plays  Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano).  </P></p>

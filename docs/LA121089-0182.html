			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POOR FOUL SHOOTING COSTLY TO MASTER'S  </P> <P> Were it not for some foul shooting that was indeed foul shooting Saturday  night, The Master's College might have pulled out a win comparable to a  Washington Generals' victory over the Harlem Globetrotters.  </P> <P> Master's built a four-point halftime lead and held a two-point edge with less  than two minutes remaining but could not stave off Westmont College in a 59-55  NAIA District 3 loss at home before 850 spectators.  </P> <P> Westmont won for the 26th time in the schools' 27 meetings, but a miserable  10-of-22 performance at the free-throw line did not help Master's.  </P> <P> "I think if we make our foul shots, we certainly had plenty of opportunities to  win," Master's Coach Mel Hankinson said.  </P> <P> Master's (6-4) was nursing a 52-50 lead when Westmont's Noel Matthews made a  three-point basket. Teammate Peter Partain followed with a three-point play.  </P> <P> The Master's Tom Bruner missed the front end of a one-and-one with 35 seconds  left, but the Mustangs had a chance to tie with nine seconds left. However,  Jason Webster's short jump shot skittered off the rim.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Hankinson was pleased with his team's performance against Westmont  (6-1), a perennial District 3 power.  </P> <P> "This program has come a light-year in just two years," Hankinson said.  </P> <P> Master's lost by 19 points to Westmont last season, but Hankinson has a player,  guard Damon Greer, who he thinks could close the gap.  </P> <P> "I think Damon Greer would have certainly been worth three points," Hankinson  said. Greer, a transfer from San Jose State and a former Cleveland High star,  will become eligible at the end of the semester on Dec. 18.  </P> <P> After learning that the final score was 59-55, however, Hankinson decided that  "Damon would have been good for five points tonight."  </P> <P> Bruner led Master's with 18 points and Webster added 17 but struggled with his  shooting, making only six of 16 from the field and four of nine free throws.  </P> <P> Matthews and forward Chris Hahs led Westmont with 16 and 14 points.  </P></p>

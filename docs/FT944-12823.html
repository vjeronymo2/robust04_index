			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / This Week: Television Verbal tics and visual trickery now dominate TV news bulletins, and Allison Pearson aims a few kicks below the console desk in Without Walls (Tuesday, 9.00-9.30pm, C4) - a powerful polemic that takes the genre to task for being 'splendidly idiotic' in its mannerisms. She also accuses it of political bias, parochialism, sexism and a tendency towards tabloidism. Thank God Reginald Bosanquet, the famed ITV newscaster, isn't alive to see this. Phillip Larkin was wrong: sex did not arrive in Britain between the trial of Lady Chatterley and the Beatles' first LP. A new series, Forbidden Britain (Thursday, 9.45-10.30pm, BBC2), examines what remained unspoken until recently. It includes interviews with a woman who was considered a criminal because she had sex before the age of consent. And memories of the second world war as a time when Britons pulled together are belied by figures showing that between 1939 and 1941, crime against children and young people rose by half. Eye-opening stuff. There could be a sense of deja vu in Harry Enfield and Chums (Friday, 9.30-10.00pm, BBC1). If you think you have seen many of the characters - you have. His sidekick, Paul Whitehouse, has just finished his first comedy series, which owes a debt to Enfield's comic personae. However, there are plenty of new characters, including the Self-Righteous Brothers, who can solve all problems from the comfort of a bar stool, and Brian Bewildered, who can't tie a shoelace without getting confused over the ins and outs. Watch for Merchant-Ivory's Terminator III. There is a touch of opportunism in the casting of Juliet Aubrey as Isabella in one of Shakespeare's most problematic plays, Measure For Measure (Saturday, 9.30-11.20pm, BBC2). Having made Dorothea Brooke, the most priggish heroine in English literature, seem sympathetic, Aubrey may well prove a success as Shakespeare's morally riven nun, a part which has defeated many a more experienced actress. The popularity of Aubrey's performance in Middlemarch should help draw viewers.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTERIORS: LOFTS IN SUBURBIA;  </P> <P> A SANTA MONICA-BASED ARCHITECTURAL FIRM SAW A NEED -- AND FILLED IT  </P> <P> INNOVATIVE ARCHITECTURE ALWAYS provokes dissent. Leading Parisians hated the  Eiffel Tower when it was new, and critics panned the first designs for  Rockefeller Center. So it was no surprise that the neighbors were up in arms  when two young Australian architects -- Hank Koning and Julie Eizenberg --  proposed a pair of stark towers for a picture-perfect street in the Hollywood  Hills.  </P> <P> Two years later, the buildings remain controversial, but a close look reveals  how ingeniously the Santa Monica-based firm of Koning Eizenberg Architecture  accommodated special needs on a steep, narrow site. Koning and Eizenberg had  discovered that there was an unsatisfied demand for what they called "suburban  lofts" -- flexible open spaces that working couples could use as home-studios  if they didn't want to live in a commercial zone. Each tower is three  20-square-foot rooms stacked above a double garage. The small base reduced the  cost of excavation and allowed the towers to be set well apart and aligned with  the converging boundaries of the pie-shaped lot, creating a dramatic  composition.  </P> <P> The kitchen, bathroom and storage areas of each tower extend to the hillside  behind. These two-story structures with gently bowed roof lines project out at  angles that are calculated to give all rooms natural light without having views  of the neighbors. An architect and interior designer work out of one tower, a  theater producer and a movie director share the other, and both have put their  spaces to inventive use.  </P> <P> The street facades are still raw, but within a few years they should be  submerged in a riot of honeysuckle, passion vines and bougainvillea to the  height of the steel mesh balconies. In fact, half the houses nearby are white  stucco cubes, but flowering trees make them as acceptable as the red-tiled  Spanish cottages. The architects have picked up on other local features. The  sheer profile of their towers echoes that of a 1920s landmark, a free-standing  elevator shaft called High Tower, which serves a cluster of hillside homes just  a block away. The steps that climb steeply from the street to sheltered patios  at the top of the site recall other pedestrian ways in the neighborhood, such  as Alta Loma Terrace. Even the deer still come down to feed.  </P></p>

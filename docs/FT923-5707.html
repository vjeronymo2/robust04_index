			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (14): Supplier to the multinationals IN THE early 1960s, Mr Low Kim Teow ran a small business in Penang making grills for windows and doors. Mr Low's shophouse was like many hundreds that can still be seen in the streets of Penang: a bustling workshop in front, with a table for meals in the midst of all the grease and the tools. In the back there was a storeroom and kitchen, and upstairs was the living area. But Mr Low and his family have long since left the shophouse behind them. He and his two sons now run an engineering company, supplying machines and fixtures to the multinational electronics plants of Penang. In the 1970s Mr Low saw that the newly arrived multinationals needed a variety of local components and services - and set about supplying them. Now the Lowcompany provides Intel and other companies with a range of fabrication equipment, much of it highly sophisticated. The company - like most Chinese businesses very much a family-run, privately-held concern - employs more than 100 and had a turnover of MDollars 13m last year. In some cases a multinational will ask Low Kim Teow to make a particuar piece of equipment. More often the Low company will use its own design and engineering workshops to come up with machines that streamline the production processes in the big plants. This includes a machine for loading computer chips for Intel, and recently the company has moved into the business of making moulds for computer housings and other electronics goods. 'We now want to diversify as much as possible,' says Mr Low Kee Lin, one of the sons, who is company managing director. 'We want to make a big push with exports. Despite the labour shortages, we still feel we can produce mouldings, fabrication equiment and other items more cheaply and efficiently here. We are already making some sales abroad.' Back in the 1960s, when Mr Low was still making iron door grills, unemployment in Penang was nearly 20 per cent, and people were leaving the island in search of jobs. But that was before the electronics companies arrived in Penang. Low Kim Teow Engineering recently had to go to India - to recruit engineers for its plant.</p>

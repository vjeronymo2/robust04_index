This was announced by  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the end of the session. He  added that there was no fundamental dispute among the four  coalition parties about the powers of the higher-level  territorial administrative entities. The ministers agreed,  above all, on powers to be transferred from central bodies to  regional bodies and on the principle that regional  self-administration bodies would not deprive villages of their  current powers.

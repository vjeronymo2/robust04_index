			<p>BFN     [Text] The former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy was  summoned to the office of the Moscow Prosecutor on Thursday.  This was reported to Interfax by a member of the Duma and the  leader of the People's Party of Free Russia Vasiliy Lipitskiy.    The office of the Prosecutor General has given instructions  to the Moscow Prosecutor to check the lawfulness of a number of  statements and calls by opposition leaders during mass actions  on May 9 in Moscow, including calls to destroy the current  regime, and to evaluate the burning of the Russian flag in  public.    Other summons have been sent to the leader of Working Russia  Victor Anpilov, the head of the National Salvation Front Ilya  Konstantinov who together with Rutskoy were released from jail  last February under an amnesty of the Duma.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia 'has lost control' over state oil exporters MR ALEXANDER Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said yesterday that the government had 'lost control' over state-owned oil exporters and that it wanted to recentralise purchases to meet obligations to foreign states. He was responding to a query about a report that Rosnefteprodukt, the state exporter of oil products, had suspended deliveries to Japan and Western Europe. An official told the Reuters news agency that deliveries had been suspended because fuel was needed for Russia's far north and to collect the harvest. Mr Shokhin said the state wanted to buy oil, 'hopefully for roubles', direct from producers so it could meet deliveries to former Soviet republics and further afield. He did not give details of how a new system would differ from the old. But he said that the government was not receiving all the oil it was to supposed to obtain under the present state procurement system.</p>

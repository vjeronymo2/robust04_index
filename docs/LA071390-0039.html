			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RECREATION: SIMI VALLEY DUO USES BICYCLING TO SHIFT GEARS;  </P> <P> EXERCISE: IN TANDEM, FRANTZ AND MONTANO SATISFY APPETITES FOR COMPETITION WHILE  SHEDDING WEIGHT.  </P> <P> Roger Frantz embraced tandem bicycling 4 1/2 years ago as if his life depended  on it.  </P> <P> Frantz, beset by heart and blood problems, turned to bicycle riding to regain  his health. He hooked up with Abbey Montano on the tandem bicycle and the two  Simi Valley residents set a record in the L.A. Wheelmen's Grand Tour 400-mile  ultra-marathon last month by finishing in 21 hours 54 minutes. The previous  record was 22 hours 32 minutes.  </P> <P> "I had blood disorders and light heart problems and this was all due to the  extra stress my body was going through," recalled Frantz, 43. "The doctor just  took me aside and said, 'You're on a collision course. You're not going to live  much longer if you keep on being this size, so you're going to have to get out  there and exercise.' "  </P> <P> Frantz started his new activity at "a shade under 300 pounds." At the same  time, Montano weighed 250. Nearly half a decade later, Frantz is a trim 190 and  Montano hovers between 155 and 160.  </P> <P> Frantz first tried his hand at racquetball for exercise 4 1/2 years ago, but  was disappointed at not losing enough weight. "I became proficient at  racquetball but I didn't have to lose a lot of weight to become proficient,"  Frantz said. "I stood in the middle of the court and engineered my shots rather  than running after them."  </P> <P> Dave Brown, a friend of Frantz's and a cycling enthusiast, suggested that he  take his 12-speed from his garage and take to the streets.  </P> <P> "We jumped on our bikes and rode to the top of Santa Susana Pass," Brown said.  "He had a huge stomach on him and I didn't think he was going to make it.  </P> <P> "The girl I was seeing at the time passed him like he wasn't even moving, and  Roger didn't take to that too well."  </P> <P> But the challenge of bicycle riding appealed to Frantz. "I remember the first  couple of times I set up a program I was gonna go out and ride, I couldn't ride  around the block twice," Frantz said. "Breathing hard, sweating like there's no  tomorrow. I'd come back and lie down on the couch."  </P> <P> Montano tried to get into shape by starting a running program in 1984 but did  not continue because of injuries, primarily shin splints.  </P> <P> "I ended up getting on the bike to recuperate (after running) and wound up  staying on the bike," said Montano, 38. "I spent less time at the doctor's  office (for injuries) that way."  </P> <P> The cycling relationship Frantz and Montano built over the past four years  arose after the two were riding single bicycles in Moorpark.  </P> <P> "He was riding by himself and I was riding by myself and I caught up with him  and I thought, 'Oh boy, someone to have a little fun with,' " Frantz said.  </P> <P> A competitive urge seemed to take root as Frantz pedaled past Montano on a  surface street. Montano, not to be outdone, answered with a surge of his own.  The two continued to compete back to Simi Valley, where they decided to ride  together on a regular basis.  </P> <P> "We said, 'Hey, we're pretty good at this. Why don't we ride together?' And  that's how it got started," Frantz said.  </P> <P> Frantz and Montano are 9-0 on the amateur circuit, excluding their latest  effort in the Grand Tour.  </P> <P> The pair began the event at 4:35 a.m. June 23 at the Los Angeles County  sheriff's substation in Malibu and rode through Port Hueneme, Oxnard,  Camarillo, Ventura, Ojai and Santa Barbara before reaching the turnaround point  at Gaviota, about 26 miles north of Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Frantz and Montano finished back in Malibu at 2:29 a.m. June 24.  </P> <P> About 200 miles into the event, four chain links snapped from the force exerted  by Frantz and Montano and delayed the riders nearly 30 minutes for repairs.  </P> <P> "Actually, I think we were crushing it," Frantz said. "The bearings themselves  couldn't take the stress against the gears and that's what started metal  fatigue.  </P> <P> "Usually a chain will last you 3,000 to 4,000 miles but this chain probably had  800 miles on it at most."  </P> <P> The tough part came after the chain was repaired. Generally, a 30-minute loss  would be considered insurmountable, but Frantz and Montano, the only tandem  crew in the field of 29 riders, overcame their disadvantage.  </P> <P> Riders were released at the start in five-minute intervals and Frantz and  Montano caught and rode even with a pair of singles until the chain started  jumping gears and broke. Frantz and Montano steadily made up the deficit over  the final 200 miles and crossed the finish line simultaneously with two  singles. Frantz and Montano were technically five minutes ahead because they  started five minutes behind the two singles.  </P> <P> "I didn't think we would catch up," Montano said. "(But) as we got into each  check-in area, as we were checking in, they were checking out."  </P> <P> Check-in stations were 50 to 60 miles apart, said Montano, who rode in the back  of the team's black, 14-speed Cannondale.  </P> <P> Both Frantz and Montano have suffered injuries riding bicycles. Montano once  sustained a broken arm while crossing railroad tracks on a narrow road in  Moorpark, but that was not nearly as life-threatening as Frantz's accident.  </P> <P> In January 1985, about nine months before meeting Montano, Frantz was  broadsided and run over by a car where Los Angeles and Emory avenues intersect  in Simi Valley. Though swept underneath the moving vehicle, which proceeded to  cross the intersection, Frantz miraculously was missed by all four tires.  </P> <P> Even more amazing was that Frantz sustained no broken bones. However, he did  suffer a bruised kidney, liver and pancreas.  </P> <P> "I don't know why it didn't kill me and I don't know why I didn't break any  bones," Frantz said. "All I could remember was that I saw the car coming and I  just thought, 'It's over.' "  </P></p>

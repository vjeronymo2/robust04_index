			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with K. Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma </F> Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen, by I.  Rotar; place and date not given: "Become Our Satellites or  Perish]"    [Text]  <H5>  That is the view held by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the </H5> State Duma Comittee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen.  <H5>  Revelations </H5>   [Zatulin] I am an admirer of the empire if it is understood  as imperial peace. I am not a proponent of ultranationalist  empires and regard that concept as a means for the maintenance  of peace. There is such a concept as sphere of influence, sphere  of vital interest, regardless of whether you are a democrat or  not. A small country must be happy that it is within the sphere  of influence of a big power. A vivid example of that is the  economic blossoming of postwar Japan when it was under the aegis  of the U.S.A. The policy in the CIS is the domestic policy of  Russia whether that offends anyone or not. We must win our  special role in the near abroad.    [Rotar] Do you recognize the territorial integrity of  countries of the near abroad?    [Zatulin] It is impossible to be pulling chestnuts out of  the  fire for others and recognize the territorial integrity of  states which never existed within those borders. With all due  respect for those states, many of them are destined to become  our satellites or perish and I recognize their territorial  integrity right up to that degree.    [Rotar] What meaning do you attach to the concept of a  satellite?    [Zatulin] Countries of the near abroad must conclude special  agreements establishing their special relations with Russia.  That is neither relations within the framework of the USSR nor  is it simply membership in the CIS the effectiveness of which is  under question. Our special relations must deal primarily with  the economy and the problem of national minorities living in  those states. Russia must assume the protection of Russians  living in the near abroad. If the national minorities live in  compact groups, they must be granted autonomy--the state must  become a federation. The special status of regions populated by  national minorities must be backed up with guarantees from  Moscow.    [Rotar] Could you indicate specifically which of the  countries in the near abroad should have autonomies?    [Zatulin] Georgia--Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Moldova--the  Dniester Region and Gagaus. Kazakhstan--northern part of the  republic. Ukraine--eastern regions and Crimea.    [Rotar] How do you view the political situation in Georgia?    [Zatulin] The viewpoint that everyone, except the Georgians,  is responsible for its troubles is still prevalent in Georgia.  Recently, for instance, we had a meeting with a Georgian  parliamentary delegation and one of its members consistently  stressed that Russia must grant every concession since Georgia  made a sacrifice by joining the CIS. This is some kind of a  hypertrophied concept of reality. Let us begin with the fact  that Russia helped the current leader of Georgia win in the most  acute domestic confrontation with the, by the way, legal,  president Eduard Gamsakhurdia. That gave Shevardnadze a great  advantage (I am not even going to mention that Russia saved him  from death in Abkhazia). Russia confirmed the territorial  integrity of Georgia whereas in reality it does not exist,  helped the republic economically, and in return received only  the entry of that state into the CIS which thus far is a rather  amorphous formation.    [Rotar] In your opinion what future awaits Ukraine?    [Zatulin] This is a complicated question. I believe that  here  there are fewer chances than in Moldova and Georgia that  objective realities will be recognized. One political wing  (mainly those who came from Western Ukraine) is adamantly  dreaming of participation in all foreign political blocs hostile  to Russia and visualizes the only possibility for existence of  an independent Ukrainian state to be with the support of the  enemies of Russia. But I am still hoping that the resolution of  the problem will be the same as in Moldova and Georgia: alliance  with Russia and a special status reinforced with guarantees by  Moscow for eastern regions and Crimea. This is the only  relatively peaceful outcome. The other variant means the  disintegration of Ukraine.    [Rotar] Today Russian soldiers are dying in Tajikistan. One  of the more widespread explanations of the reason for  nonwithdrawal of the Russian army from that country consists is  that Russia has no funds for the maintenance of a new border  region. But even today Moscow is compelled to invest significant  sums in that country. Tajikistan may turn into a bottomless pit  for Russian money.    [Zatulin] Any expenditure is justified to preserve that  outpost.    [Rotar] Do you have disagreements with the Russian MID  [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]?    [Zatulin] After December, you understand what I am referring  to, the Russian MID sharply changed its positions and our  official positions are practically the same. It is true, I do  lack confidence that declarations of the Russian MID will be  implemented in practice.</p>

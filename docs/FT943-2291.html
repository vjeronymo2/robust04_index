			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: France Telecom to take stake in Russia's MTS France Telecom, the French state-owned telecoms operator, yesterday took a further step in its international expansion, announcing it would take an 11 per cent stake in MTS, a Russian mobile telephones joint venture. The stake in the Russian venture also represents a strengthening of France Telecom's alliance with Deutsche Telekom, the German operator from which it will buy the stake. After the sale, Deutsche Telekom will have a 28 per cent stake in MTS. MTS, which holds a 10-year exclusive operating licence for mobile communications in the Moscow area, is 51 per cent owned by Russian interests. These include MGTS, Moscow's public telecoms operator. The joint venture, to invest about Dollars 90m in the Moscow mobile communications network, launched operations in July. It has about 2,000 subscribers for its GSM systems, a digital radio telephone system used by about 60 countries. France Telecom is present in Russia in fixed telephone communications. Since 1992 it has jointly operated a network in Kaliningrad. Last year, it signed an agreement to help modernise the Russian telephone network.</p>

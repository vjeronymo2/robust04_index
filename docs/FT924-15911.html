			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Suez warns that provisions will affect interim profits SUEZ, one of France's most powerful financial and industrial groups, yesterday warned that first-half profits would fall below expectations this year because of the impact of the fragile French property market on Indosuez and La Henin, its main banking subsidiaries. Suez yesterday announced that its net profits would be significantly below the FFr1.8bn (Dollars 350m) it made in the first six months of last year, because of a hefty rise in provisions, mainly on property. The group anticipates an increase in provisions from FFr400m in the first half of 1991 to at least FFr2bn in the same period this year. However, Suez stressed that it expected to remain profitable in 1992 and said its dividend policy would remain unchanged. In spite of this assurance its shares fell on the profits warning, tumbling as low as FFr226 then recovering to close at FFr236.2, down FFr3.3 on the day. The Suez announcement follows a series of lacklustre interim results from French financial groups, all of which have been hit by falling property values and the rise in small business fail-ures. The French property market has come under intense pressure this year because of the sluggish economic climate and the relatively high rate of real interest rates. Paribas, the investment banking group, announced on Tuesday that it was only able to avoid a steep fall in interim profits because of the pro-ceeds of its disposal programme. Credit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest banks, last week disclosed that it only just broke even in the first half. Indosuez saw its net profits fall sharply to just FFr81m during the first half from FFr517m in the same period last year. Operating profits mustered growth of 10 per cent to FFr1.66bn, against FFr1.5bn, on net banking income which rose by 8 per cent to FFr5.49bn. But the precarious state of the property market forced the bank to raise provisions from FFr544m to FFr1.39bn. Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman, warned that provisions would remain high in the second half. Meanwhile, Banque La Henin barely broke even during the first half with net profits of just FFr6m compared with FFr66m in the first six months of 1991. The group mustered a marginal increase in operating profits, but was hit by the need to make hefty provisions on its property interests.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Calls for Welsh assembly rejected MR DAVID HUNT, the Welsh secretary, yesterday rejected vigorous calls for an elected Welsh assembly made at a meeting in Cardiff of the Welsh grand committee of MPs, the first time the committee has met outside Westminster. Demands for an assembly, led by Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour leader, and Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, dominated the committee's debate on the structure of government in Wales. Mr Davies said an assembly was needed to correct the 'democratic deficit,' as only six of the 38 Welsh constituencies are represented by Conservatives. The Welsh secretary, who in a white paper last week outlined plans for 21 unitary authorities to replace the eight county councils and 37 district councils, said he sought to move forward with local government reforms on a basis of consensus. An assembly 'would reduce the influence of the unitary authorities'. Mr Davies, MP for Caerphilly, said unitary authorities only made sense with a strategic decision-making body accountable to the people of Wales. The grand committee, a standing committee of the Commons, includes all MPs representing Welsh constituencies as well as five nominated members. Yesterday's meeting was boycotted by Wales's only Liberal Democrat MP, Mr Alex Carlile, as a protest at the lack of an assembly and on the grounds that the committee was an undemocratic way of dealing with local government reform.</p>

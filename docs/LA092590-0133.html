			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTOR COREY FELDMAN FACES NEW DRUG CHARGE  </P> <P> Actor Corey Feldman, who has campaigned against drug use and is featured in an  upcoming video about drug addiction, was charged Monday with possession of  heroin after his second arrest on drug charges since March, authorities said.  </P> <P> Feldman, 19, who has appeared in such films as "The Goonies," "Gremlins" and  "Stand by Me," was arrested Thursday in North Hollywood after Los Angeles  Police detained him because they believed he had stolen a car, a suspicion that  proved false, Sgt. Gil Rivera said.  </P> <P> But a check of Feldman's record showed that he had three outstanding traffic  warrants, and officers conducting a pre-booking search found two balloons  containing one-third of a gram of heroin in Feldman's socks, Rivera said.  </P> <P> In March, Feldman was arrested after officers who had stopped him for a traffic  violation found 25 balloons of heroin and cocaine in his car. He has pleaded  not guilty to felony drug charges stemming from that arrest.  </P></p>

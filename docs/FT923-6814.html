			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Forced to prove the efficacy of its formula  -After a period of rapid growth Medeva's strategy is under the spotlight HAS THE music stopped for Medeva, one of the newest and most intriguing additions to the exclusive club of world pharmaceutical companies? As recently as last March, with its share price riding near 300p and a runaway stock market rating, Medeva had its eyes firmly fixed on joining the FT-SE 100 by the middle of the decade, less than six years after it was founded. Five months later, a significant brake has been applied to the Medeva merry-go-round. At one point last week, Medeva's share price had halved to 150p - though it has subsequently bounced to 175p - and its market capitalisation had fallen to just over Pounds 330m. Acquisitions backed by the issue of shares have been put on the back burner and the company is being forced to prove, earlier than expected, that it can generate the organic growth it has promised. Medeva's management, led by Mr Bernard Taylor, former chief executive of Glaxo, and Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, a successful Australian financial engineer, has consistently followed a neat and compelling game plan. In their first two years they began buying companies and mature drug portfolios from large groups such as Wellcome, with the chunkiest acquisitions financed by the issue of highly-rated shares. Because the assets Medeva acquired were on much lower ratings, each acquisition automatically enhanced earnings, even before the benefits of any operational synergies. At the same time, Medeva has been looking for companies that would push it into international markets. And finally, it has started its own development effort by acquiring drugs that other companies have taken close to the registration stage. While this plan has not changed, the market has clearly had second thoughts. US disenchantment with the health care sector is partly to blame, as the fall in the number of shares held in American Depositary Receipt form suggests. And a self-fulfilling downward spin may have developed; investors who were looking for heady acquisition-driven growth may have sold as it became increasingly unlikely that Medeva would issue paper as its shares fell. More seriously, however, sceptics say Medeva may be an echo of some racy 1980s companies that ground to a halt when they were no longer able to maintain their high ratings. The spotlight is therefore firmly fixed on Medeva's interim results in September when investors will get a better picture of organic growth from the 10 acquisitions to date. Mr Taylor accepts that the share price fall has temporarily ruled out the issue of paper and that this will limit the pace and size of acquisitions. But it will only slow, rather than halt, the transition to a viable medium-sized pharmaceutical company within the next three to four years, the chief executive says. To reach that critical mass - sales of about Pounds 500m, compared with Pounds 82m last year - Mr Taylor says Medeva probably needs to add two or three more product areas to its vaccines, pain management and respiratory products businesses. It also needs to expand internationally, particularly in the US, which is likely to be its largest market as it has decided not to try to break into Japan, Germany, France and Italy. The likely route will be to buy small companies with sales forces. It will also need to buy more development products that are in the late stage of clinical development, like the hepatitis B technology bought in March. But with new share issues temporarily ruled out and the company uncomfortable about higher gearing after it bought International Medical Systems of the US largely for debt in June, cash from operations becomes Medeva's main source of acquisition finance. 'There is a prolongation of risk,' says Mr Taylor. But it does not mean Medeva has run into the buffers. Investors, he says, have focused too much on the group's acquisitions and not enough on its organic growth potential and the quality of its pharmaceutical management. 'What we have to do is show that we are building a pharmaceutical company through acquisitions; we are not acquiring companies that happen to be pharmaceutical companies,' he says. 'Perhaps it is not recognised that the majority of our directors are the salt of the pharmaceutical earth.' One obvious blot on the Medeva copybook is its involvement in unbranded generic drugs, a fiercely competitive business which still accounts for a large, though decreasing percentage of sales. But analysts are also wary about the quality of earnings from unbranded generics, a part of Medeva Mr Taylor does want to remain in long-term. Not that forecasts of pre-tax profits have changed very much between the peak of Medeva's share price in March and the recent low; pre-tax profits forecasts range at about Pounds 36m for the year to December, more than double that of 1991 because of the effect of acquisitions. 'But there is a debate about what sort of rating you should give to a stock like this,' says one sector analyst. Medeva's purchase of a range of smaller and older drugs which are not followed as closely as blockbusters such as Zantac, means investors have to take much more about its markets on trust from the company. 'It's getting harder to extrapolate how much security of earnings you have got in there,' the broker says. September's interims may hold some of the answers. And a sharp share price recovery would re-open the market for new issues. But until Medeva has attained a greater critical mass, investors must be prepared to be subjected to a bumpy ride.</p>

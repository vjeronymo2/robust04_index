			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2-HOUR DELAY IN RESPONSE TO 911 CALL  INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officials Thursday were investigating what was apparently a  nearly two-hour delay in responding to a 911 call from a Brentwood restaurant  manager who was reporting the robbery of a customer.  </P> <P> Although the manager of the Hamburger Hamlet on San Vicente Boulevard maintains  that he called 911 three times -- including one call during the Wednesday night  robbery -- officers were not notified and dispatched to the restaurant until  almost two hours later, long after the robber had fled with the victim's watch,  reportedly worth $8,000.  </P> <P> Lt. Ron Hall, detective commander at the West Los Angeles Division, admitted  that a faster response might have resulted in the arrest of the robber, who was  briefly detained by other restaurant customers after the robbery.  </P> <P> "We're trying to determine how many calls were made, what the subject of each  call was and why there was not a sooner response," said Cmdr. William Booth,  LAPD spokesman. He added that investigators are combing through phone records  and interviewing police detectives to find out what happened.  </P> <P> "It certainly appears that the call we responded to was not the first call," he  said.  </P></p>

Recent statistics also indicate  that local steel output reached 1.15 million metric tons, the  output of 10 nonferrous metals amounted to more than 100,000  metric tons, and gold output fulfilled the annual plan two  months earlier. Steel trades and undertakings gained a sales  income of 22.8 billion yuan, an increase of 42.5 percent over  the previous year, materialized profits and taxes of 4.5 billion  yuan, an increase of 67.3 percent, and gained profits of 1.89  billion yuan, an increase of 113 percent. Hubei's steel output  ranked third in the country last year.    In 1993, metallurgical undertakings throughout the province  flexibly adjusted their production mix in accordance with market  demands. Take local metallurgical trades as an example. Last  year, when steel was selling well, metallurgical undertakings  throughout the province still put quality first and 94.2 percent  of their products were up to standards. In the meantime, they  also ensured the implementation of state procurement contracts  and supported the construction of the three gorges project, the  Beijing-Kowloon railway, and the Geheyuan hydropower station.</p>

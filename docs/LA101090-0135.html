			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> 2 OF 7 CANDIDATES FILE SPANISH TEXTS  </P> <P> In a city where 1989 estimates put the Latino population at 44% -- just under  half the residents of Anaheim -- only two of the seven City Council candidates  included Spanish versions of their campaign statements filed with the registrar  of voters.  </P> <P> Candidates in any county election can have their statements printed in both  English and Spanish if they pay double the registration fee, or $600. But  according to the registrar, the Spanish-language version is not required by  law.  </P> <P> In sample ballots flooding the homes of registered voters in Anaheim this week,  Mayor Fred Hunter, who is seeking reelection, and one of his rivals, Councilman  Irv Pickler, address their Spanish-speaking constituents.  </P> <P> In English as well as in Spanish, Hunter states: "As mayor for the past two  years, I have focused on quality-of-life issues. Many goals have been  accomplished because we've worked together."  </P> <P> Just next to that appears Pickler's statement, also in both languages: "Anaheim  citizens deserve effective leadership which solves problems and works to  improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods."  </P> <P> Other candidates said the higher fee was the reason they did not file their  statements in both languages.  </P> <P> "I intended to run a close, grass-roots campaign, saving every dollar I could,"  said Frank Feldhaus, a planning commissioner who is running for council.  </P> <P> Feldhaus, who speaks fluent Spanish, said he would rather spend the time  walking door-to-door meeting potential supporters personally, and talking to  them directly in Spanish.  </P> <P> "I ran across one (Spanish-speaking) household the other day. . . . I must have  spent 20 minutes there," said Feldhaus, adding that taking the time to talk  with the family was worthwhile. "I got five of 'em."  </P> <P> Others cited the general expense of running a campaign and the need to cut  corners whenever possible. One candidate, political maverick John Schaffer, is  not raising campaign funds, he said, so did not pay the extra $300. LISA  MASCARO  </P></p>

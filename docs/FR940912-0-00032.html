			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure the quality of the report to investors, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA believes that each annual or quarterly report should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed by the SAC in its entirety. Under &sect;630.6(a)(2),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provides that ``members shall be knowledgeable in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public and corporate finance and financial reporting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure,'' members selected to serve on the SAC should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the expertise to review the entire report to investors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including both financial and nonfinancial information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the FCA agrees that the essence of press releases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to provide timely release of interim information and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted the requirement for a review of press releases by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SAC from &sect;630.6(a)(4)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Section 630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC suggested that the word ``oversee'' contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility of the SAC and the bank audit committee be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced with the word ``review'' because the proposed wording  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implies that the audit committee would perform a management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function in the System or the bank. The FCC also suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other changes to proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) to avoid this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The audit committee is commonly recognized as an entity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established to perform an oversight function in the areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial reporting, internal control, and corporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governance. The word ``oversee'' contained in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is consistent with the customary role of audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committees. The FCA has retained the word ``oversee'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii). The FCA notes that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the responsibility of the board of each System institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the steps the audit committee should perform to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill its oversight responsibilities. Thus, the boards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual System institutions could charter their audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee to review and direct management to take necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective actions or merely to review and make corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations to the board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Subpart B_Annual Report to Investors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 630.20(c)(2)_Description of Legal Proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Enforcement Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC suggested that the proposed &sect;630.20(c)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure requirement for a summary of FCA enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions against individual institutions be clarified and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that any required discussion of the impact of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement actions on the System's operations be linked to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materiality. The FCA agrees with this suggestion and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised the language of &sect;630.20(c)(2) of the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 630.20(d)_Description of Liabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC expressed the view that the information called  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for by &sect;630.20(d)(1) regarding System debt obligations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> too detailed and, thus, impractical. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 630.20(d)(1)(ii) is, in large part, based upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure currently furnished by the System in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Statements. Unless otherwise needed to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readers of the report to investors with information needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to understand the characteristics of System debt, the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not expect extensive detail regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of specific debt offerings. To clarify this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position, the FCA has deleted the words ``terms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions'' and added prefatory language to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.20(d)(1)(ii) requiring a description of debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations statutorily authorized to be issued and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently issued by the System, as well as other pertinent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCC also requested that the regulation clearly set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth the option of incorporating by reference the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and quarterly reports to investors into specific offering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents. The FCA notes that the focus of this regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is on periodic reports of the System to investors. It does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not govern offering circulars or specific offering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents. Nothing in this regulation precludes the System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from incorporating by reference information contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual or quarterly reports to investors into specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering documents if otherwise appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 630.20(g)(1)_Loan Portfolio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(ii) required disclosure of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of loans outstanding that were used to finance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases of stock or other equities of System institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCC expressed concern regarding the System's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with this requirement and questioned its relevance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors. The FCC opined that disclosures currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the System in its annual Information Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are sufficient. The System's 1993 annual Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement states that association borrowers do not typically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase capital stock for cash, but instead add the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate par value of stock to the principal amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related loan obligation. The 1993 report also provided the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of capital stock and participation certificates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outstanding at December 31, 1993. The FCC indicated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System compliance with the proposed requirement could only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be on a prospective basis because System banks do not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system in place to track needed information. Further, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCC argued that the costs involved in complying with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed requirement would outweigh the benefits derived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

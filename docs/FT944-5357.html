			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (26): Income high? Keep an eye on the capital - Yield The yield is the annual rate of income on a share or bond which an investor would earn from the security at the current price. It is usually expressed as a percentage. Investors calculate yields on gilt-edged stock and other fixed interest securities in two different ways: the interest yield, or current yield, only takes account of the actual income you get; the redemption yield, or yield to maturity, also takes account of any capital gain or loss over the remaining life of the bond. If the market price of a bond falls, its yield rises and vice versa. The interest rate the bond pays - called the 'coupon' - relates to its nominal value: for example, Treasury 7pc 2001 will pay Pounds 7 for every Pounds 100 nominal of stock every year until it is repaid in the year 2001. In the middle of this week, the price of this gilt was Pounds 92 13/32 , and the current yield was 7.58 per cent. But the redemption yield was higher - 8.47 per cent, because anyone holding it until it is repaid will make a capital profit of over Pounds 7, and this is added to the annual income over that period to calculate the redemption yield. But what investors actually get from a bond may be reduced because they have to pay tax on the income. The yield after deducting the tax due is called the net yield. It is comparatively easy to calculate net current yields. But calculating net redemption yields is complicated, because any capital profit will not be subject to tax whereas the interest will be. This means that gilts which deliver a higher proportion of their total return in the form of a capital gain tend to be more attractive for higher-rate taxpayers. High-coupon gilts, which often look attractive if you consider gross redemption yields (that is, without taking account of any tax liability) , tend to be good value only for people who do not pay tax. The FT prints a list of gilts which are good value for different types of taxpayer every week. Yields on shares are based on the annual dividend the company pays: hence the term 'dividend yield'. Since dividend payments can rise or fall, and since shares do not normally have a fixed repayment date, there is no equivalent of a redemption yield. Dividend yields can be historic (that is, based on what a company has actually paid recently) or prospective (based on what it is expected to pay). Unit and investment trusts that target income-oriented investors are prone to use various devices to get as high a yield as possible. Many of these devices are likely to hamper capital growth or actually eat into the investor's capital. They include charging management costs against capital, rather than income; investing in shares whose high yield is a sign of their poor growth prospects; and using derivatives to enhance the yield. If you are thinking of buying a share or trust offering an abnormally high yield, always check how it manages to get that yield before investing.</p>

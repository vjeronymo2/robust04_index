			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE BOLAND ASSAILED  </P> <P> I continue to be amazed! When will these politicians learn that we the people  put them in office or remove them from office?  </P> <P> On Oct. 10, I was one of the 20 or so people who demonstrated against Paula  Boland, the Republican candidate for the 38th Assembly District.  </P> <P> Boland and her anti-choice position are the reasons that I -- a registered  Republican since 1958 -- have re-registered as a Democrat.  </P> <P> To quote Boland: Her position on abortion is "a dumb story. I've given all the  time I'm going to give those airheads down there. This is my governor's  luncheon."  </P> <P> The last time I heard such offensive, stupid language regarding Americans  making a political statement was from the infamous Spiro Agnew, who said of the  Kent State protesters: "They are nothing but a bunch of effete intellectuals.  They are all Johnny One Notes, single-issue people that do not represent the  silent majority in this country."  </P> <P> Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew underestimated the depth and the seriousness of  that "single issue." Obviously, Boland is not bright enough to see the  correlation. Perhaps she should talk to the people whose privacy and rights she  would deny; perhaps she should feel the depth of their commitment; perhaps she  should have been out with our group in our nonpartisan effort to register  voters. We registered 670 voters, of which more than half were Republican women  switching parties. Not only does this airhead vote, I also organize. I, for  one, will work as hard and as actively as I can against Boland and the  Republican Party.  </P> <P> LOIS APPELBAUM  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Caution dominates steadier Tokyo market BARGAIN HUNTERS helped to steady the Tokyo stock market in initial trading early today, after the sharp drop yesterday despite a cut in the official discount rate. But sentiment remained predominantly cautious as Japan weighed the likely impact of the rate cut and of the emergency package announced by the government on Tuesday to try to stimulate the economy. The Nikkei average was up 200 points in early trading. The steadier tone came after the Nikkei plunged 764.16 to close at 18,581.79 in the previous day's trading. It was the first time since early 1987 that the market had slid through the 19,000-level. The fall was partly because investors who had bought shares last autumn liquidated positions into a market with no buyers in sight. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, the central bank, yesterday left no doubt that the official discount rate, lowered by 0.75 points to 3.75 per cent, had hit bottom, at least for the time being. He said monetary policy was limited in its ability to stimulate the economy. He described the rate cut as the final phase of credit easing, and said the level was low by historical standards. At the same time, Mr Mieno expressed confidence that the process of reducing excess manufacturing inventories would continue. A build-up of unsold inventories has caused manufacturing companies to cut output and has slowed the pace of the economy. Mr Mieno said, however, that the interest rate cut, combined with the government's financial package, would restore the economy to a path of stable expansion. The measures failed to coax investors in a large way back into the market immediately. Life assurers, which were leading buyers of equities in the late 1980s, have started to move from stock investments and into direct corporate lending. The flow of money into investment trusts has also dried up as individual investors have grown weary of the scandal-tainted market. Investors with funds have been staying on the sidelines, convinced the market may fall further. Analysts, nonetheless, said the decline would have little effect on the broader economy. 'We don't think it will have any economic implications except for confidence,' said Mr Paul Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming. 'The sources of growth in the Japanese economy are less dependent on the stock market than in the last cycle.' Ms Rie Ota, analyst at Baring Securities, said the decline in the market had contributed to an erosion of capital asset ratios at Japan's commercial and long-term credit banks. The rate cut and the financial package were broadly welcomed by industrial leaders. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, praised the timing. Mr Keizo Saji, chairman of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, however, said the rate cut by itself was insufficient, and called for lower taxes.

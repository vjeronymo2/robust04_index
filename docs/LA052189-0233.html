			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATE!;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY'S FIRST 100 YEARS;  </P> <P> THE IRVINE EXPERIMENT;  </P> <P> UC IRVINE THE BUZZWORD IS 'DESTINY'  </P> <P> Twenty-five years and 37,331 degrees since it was founded, the university  appears poised for the big leagues. The aim, today as in 1965, is to rival UC  Berkeley and Harvard. 'The question is, will UCI achieve greatness? The  opportunity is there.'  </P> <P> In the sunny, book-lined office of UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, a  dozen distinguished academics gathered recently to honor one of their own.  </P> <P> It was an important, even a historic moment, but there was nothing stiff about  it. Champagne flowed along with effusive toasts, and Peltason beamed like a  coach whose underdog team had just run away with the championship.  </P> <P> UCI chemistry professor F. Sherwood (Sherry) Rowland, a founding faculty  member, had received the Japan Prize for his research on the destruction of the  Earth's ozone shield. The prize included $400,000 in cash, enough loot to  inspire enthusiastic chest-thumping, even if the award were not second in  international status only to the Nobel Prize.  </P> <P> "Sherry Rowland's work is significant to the whole world, and the world has  recognized him," Peltason proclaimed. "And that work took place at our  university."  </P> <P> UCI and UC Santa Cruz, both of which opened in 1965, are the newest  universities in the 120-year-old University of California system, but it is UCI  that is competing in many disciplines with hallowed Berkeley, UCLA and other  top institutions across the country for the most prestigious prizes, elite  professors and brightest students.  </P> <P> In recent years, UCI has grown in political muscle and brainpower with the  additions of the Beckman Laser Institute, a medical research center, the  western headquarters of the National Academy of Sciences and the Humanities  Research Institute, a UC think-tank. UCI has also lured world-renowned scholars  with above-scale salaries and, increasingly, has had to fend off outside bids  for faculty members such as Rowland, who have done pioneering research at  Irvine and now are celebrated themselves.  </P> <P> Always land-rich, UCI is beginning to bring in big bucks, too. Private  donations reached a record $24 million in 1987-88, and research grants, the  fuel that propels scholarly study beyond state-funded basics, totaled $61  million. The university, which employs 10,336 administrators, professors,  clerks, groundskeepers and others, also pumped an estimated $544 million in  personal income into the economy, with three-quarters of that spent in Orange  County.  </P> <P> The momentum shows no signs of slowing. Twenty-five years and 37,331 degrees  since UCI was founded, the university appears poised for the big leagues.  </P> <P> "I think UCI is one of the most exciting places in the world of higher  education," Peltason says. "We're like a kid entering adolescence -- we're  maturing. UCI is going to be good, and it is going to be big. The question is,  will UCI achieve greatness? The opportunity is there."  </P> <P> The aim, today as in 1965, is to rival UC Berkeley and Harvard University, and  the buzzword is destiny. Some caution that striving to accomplish so much in so  short a time may result in shortcuts in quality, but no one disputes the  remarkable strides the newcomer already has made.  </P> <P> PLANS FOR A UC campus in East Los Angeles or Orange County began in the 1950s  when soaring enrollment projections and a suburban building boom convinced the  UC Board of Regents that Disneyland wouldn't be surrounded by orange groves for  long and that UCLA alone would not be able to serve the growing metropolis.  </P> <P> And so the search began. More than 20 sites were considered, then rejected, as  communities competed for the university and the development it would bring. In  March, 1959, the Regents selected 1,000 acres of gently rolling property on the  Irvine Ranch because of its sweeping view of the Santa Ana basin, its location  in the center of an urbanizing county and the planned web of freeways that  would link it to metropolitan Los Angeles.  </P> <P> UC officials also saw a rare and exciting opportunity to nurture a new  community around the campus in cooperation with the Irvine Co., the development  firm that owned the more than 100,000 surrounding acres of Irvine Ranch land.  </P> <P> About the same time, a bitter two-year battle within the Irvine Co. was coming  to a head. Joan Irvine Smith, then 26 and the only descendant of founder James  Irvine II on the company's board of directors, wanted to make the 1,000-acre  tract a gift to UC but faced a wall of opposition from other board members.  Exasperated, Smith took her campaign public. She called news conferences, wrote  letters and spoke at rallies.  </P> <P> It worked. In December, 1959, the Irvine Co. agreed to donate the 1,000 acres  selected by UC. The university's landholdings were completed three years later  when the Regents purchased from the Irvine Co. an additional 510 acres for $3.3  million.  </P> <P> Smith, who declined interviews pending the outcome of a suit she filed against  the Irvine Co. after she was bought out in 1983, wrote in a 1977 account of the  land fight, "I must admit in all candor my motivations were not entirely  philanthropic.  </P> <P> "It took no crystal ball to see what the location of UCLA had done for (the  development of) Westwood in Los Angeles. The value of the Irvine Ranch property  would be greatly enhanced, and there would be great benefits both financially  and intellectually for the entire surrounding community."  </P> <P> Athalie Clark, Smith's mother, recalled that "Joan was adamant, and she did a  magnificent job. We all thought the university could do so much for the  community. It was very much an agrarian community at the time."  </P> <P> The university "gave an entirely different tone to the county," says Clark, now  in her 80s and active as a philanthropist and a member of the UCI Foundation  Board of Overseers. "Twenty-five years ago, the future of UCI was unknown  because it was a new campus. I don't think anyone could have foretold the great  impact it has had even outside the county."  </P> <P> THE EARLY YEARS of the university were exciting and experimental for students,  administrators and planners. Daniel G. Aldrich, dean of agriculture for the UC  system, who was chosen to be UCI's first chancellor in 1962, three years before  the university opened, assembled the founding faculty and provided a vision  that lasted until his retirement in 1984.  </P> <P> One of Aldrich's first appointments was Peltason, who in 1964 was lured from  the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to be vice chancellor of student  affairs. Twenty years later, in September, 1984, Peltason succeeded Aldrich to  become UCI's second chancellor.  </P> <P> Now chancellor emeritus, Aldrich, 71, calls himself "the institutional memory."  </P> <P> Aldrich saw a relationship between campus design and academic goals and, with  architect William L. Pereira, set out to create "a sense of destiny, a focal  point for the campus and . . . the feeling that (the Irvine campus) was part of  a major institution."  </P> <P> On the dry, sloping ranchland, Pereira, who also was the architect for the  first village in what became the city of Irvine, carved concentric circles,  with half a dozen boxy, modernistic buildings clustered around the campus ring.  At the center, a 35-acre arboretum was planted with trees and shrubs from  around the world. Now called Aldrich Park, it is the heart of UCI. The vigorous  founding chancellor, who often can be found strolling there, never walks past a  scrap of litter without stooping to pick it up.  </P> <P> Looking back to 1962, what did Aldrich expect UCI to become? "Exactly what it  is," he replies. What kinds of advances will occur in the next 25 years? "More  of the same," he says succinctly. "It all goes back to what we who came to  Irvine were charged with building. UCI was a research university from the day  we opened our doors. We did not begin as a two-year school that would one day  become a four-year university. We offered Ph.D. programs on the day we  started."  </P> <P> During the late 1960s and early '70s, while Berkeley and other campuses were  torn by angry, destructive Vietnam War protests, Irvine was distinguished by  relative calm. When Gov. Ronald Reagan declared a state of emergency at  Berkeley in May, 1969, and sent in the California National Guard, UCI students  staged a peaceful boycott of classes. And when nine UCI students who traveled  to Berkeley to observe and report on the conflict were arrested there, Aldrich  used $900 from his own pocket to bail them out.  </P> <P> "We weren't caught up with a whole mess of regulations, telling students, 'You  can't do this; you can't do that.' There was an atmosphere of responsiveness,"  Aldrich says. "And unlike a campus in an urban setting where a rally would move  into city streets, and frustrated students would look for things to lash out  against, there was nothing surrounding Irvine but fields. After walking a few  miles across fields, the enthusiasm flags."  </P> <P> A potentially serious clash between students and administrators at UCI occurred  in February, 1969, when about 40 students staged a five-day sit-in in an  English department writing lounge to protest the firing of three popular  teachers. The students laid in for a siege with sleeping bags, peanut  butter-and-jelly sandwiches and stacks of stereo records. They were "vexed,"  according to a newspaper account of the time, to discover that a professor had  taken the stylus out of the stereo in the lounge.  </P> <P> Even though the sit-in was more of a slumber party than a hostile takeover,  some campus officials and community residents urged Aldrich to call police.  </P> <P> "These students were very intent on expressing their concerns, and I said, 'So  long as they are not obstructive or destructive, so be it,' " Aldrich says. But  he told the student leader of the protesters that "'the moment some faculty  member says to me, 'I've got to use the writing center for my class,' you'll be  obstructing the business of the university. You'll have to leave or you will be  trespassing and you will be arrested."  </P> <P> The standoff that Aldrich dreaded came four days into the protest, when a  professor told the chancellor that his class was scheduled to meet in the  lounge. Aldrich called the student leader, Mike Krisman, and told him he had to  clear out in time for the Monday class.  </P> <P> "Over the weekend, I did a lot of second-guessing. I thought I had set myself  up for a confrontation," Aldrich recalls. "I thought on Monday I was going to  have to go out there and arrest them and the whole thing was going to blow up."  </P> <P> Then, late Saturday night, Aldrich got a call from Krisman. "He said,  'Chancellor, we'll be out.' And the next day, they were. They cleaned up the  place and had it all spic and span."  </P> <P> Violence did visit UCI during the Vietnam era -- when an arson fire gutted a  campus Bank of America branch in October, 1970. Revolutionary slogans had been  painted on the building, but the arsonist was never caught, so authorities were  unable to prove who was responsible.  </P> <P> Characteristically, Aldrich said, UCI students reacted in a positive way.  Dozens came to the bank site after the fire to help board up the building and  clear away debris.  </P> <P> COMPARED WITH THE political involvement of the Vietnam era, the late 1970s and  early '80s were marked by a quiet, internal focus. Students at UCI and around  the country were interested in career paths, and the university's energies  returned to its academic and research roots. Student activism meant adding a  video-game contest to the annual "Nerd Week" festivities in 1980 and  celebrating the UCI water polo team's first National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  championship the following year.  </P> <P> Faced in 1978 with allowing the struggling engineering program to languish or  making the commitment necessary for it to grow, UCI officials concluded that a  great university needs strong professional programs. The result: a commitment  of new funds and a 30% increase in the engineering faculty during a single  school year, 1978-79.  </P> <P> The university's efforts to solicit private donations began to pay off when, in  1981, the Marilyn and Richard Hausman Chair of Ophthalmology, UCI's first  endowed chair, was established with a $250,000 gift.  </P> <P> In 1983, Rowland released his findings that showed that chlorofluorocarbons, a  substance that causes the breakdown of the ozone, had tripled in the earth's  atmosphere in 10 years.  </P> <P> And UCI's research partnership with private industry was launched that same  year, when the Nelson Research &amp; Development Co. agreed to build offices  and laboratories on campus that would be shared with medical school  researchers.  </P> <P> Also in 1983, UCI gave up its longstanding plans to build a research hospital  on campus. UC Regents killed the plan because of fierce opposition from  community leaders who backed the proposed Irvine Medical Center (now under  construction). Aldrich bowed to the Regents, but UCI Medical School Dean  Stanley van den Noort did not, leading to a split that resulted in Van den  Noort's replacement as dean in 1985.  </P> <P> UCI remained an enclave of liberal thought in Republican-dominated Orange  County. It was one of several sites under consideration for Richard M. Nixon's  presidential library until spring, 1983, when the Academic Senate voted to  accept the archives only if the former President would relinquish all claims to  control of materials displayed there. The Nixon Archives Foundation then  scratched UCI off its list and later found a home in Yorba Linda, Nixon's  birthplace.  </P> <P> Such independence continues today, with UCI faculty members among the most  vociferous community opponents to the planned San Joaquin Hills toll road,  which would stretch between the Costa Mesa Freeway and San Juan Capistrano,  running parallel to the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways. UCI administrators,  however, strongly favor construction of the county's first toll road, which  would make the university's undeveloped acreage easily accessible and  commercially valuable. At issue is the preservation of the fragile wildlife  environment.  </P> <P> RAY WATSON, vice chairman of the Irvine Co., has watched the university, city  and company grow together and, on some issues, grow apart since he came to  Orange County in 1960. In actions such as the Nixon Library vote and the  faculty opposition to the toll road plan, UCI has influenced thought in Irvine  and throughout the county, he says.  </P> <P> "The university was at first the stimulus but ultimately the conscience of the  community," Watson says. "Historically, universities have walls around them,  figuratively, and professors like to think that it is more important to discuss  the problems of the world than to participate in the community. But there has  always been an interrelationship with UCI and the community."  </P> <P> Watson, now 62, accepted a job as the Irvine Co.'s first architectural planner  in 1960 because he was intrigued by the chance to design a city in cooperation  with a new university. He set up his shop on the first floor of the old Irvine  family home, and Aldrich worked upstairs in temporary university offices.  </P> <P> "We worked together, trying to figure out how this great university and this  town could reinforce each other," Watson says. "We had a lot of expectations  that the campus would be something special. The university was the glue that  held together a very special group of men and women during those early days."  </P> <P> The relationship among the Irvine Co., the university and the city of Irvine,  incorporated in 1971, has shifted with the interests of each partner. Watson  likens the relationship to a stool, with all the partners thrown out of kilter  if one leg grows longer and stronger than the others.  </P> <P> "For that stool to be stabilized, all the legs have to be the same length,"  Watson said.  </P> <P> The stool teetered precariously in the late 1970s when UC Regents considered  taking the company to court over a 15-year-old contract that binds the parties  together to this day. The Regents challenged a deed restriction prohibiting  commercial development on the 510 acres purchased from the Irvine Co. in 1964,  arguing that times -- and Orange County land values -- had dramatically  changed. Legal proceedings were never pursued, and when Donald Bren bought the  company in 1983, negotiations were renewed.  </P> <P> Bren and Peltason finally reached an agreement last summer: UCI will be  permitted to develop 2 million square feet of office space on the property,  clearing the way for its long-planned research park, and all lease profits will  be used fund a special endowment, the Bren Fellows. Bren, who has contributed  millions to UCI for projects including the Bren Events Center, also donated $1  million to begin the endowment.  </P> <P> Peltason has called the agreement "a clarification" of the original deed terms;  Watson refers to it as limited permission for the university "to compete with  the Irvine Co. in the real estate business."  </P> <P> The city of Irvine also has battled with the patriarchal company over  development proposals, but has maintained a generally friendly relationship  with UCI, according to Mayor Larry Agran. Growing pains -- usually related to  parking shortages and traffic excesses -- have caused occasional flare-ups, but  the city and university have more often worked in partnership.  </P> <P> The Irvine Theater, a 750-seat showplace now under construction on a 2.3-acre  site donated by UCI, is perhaps the best example of this cooperation. Plans for  the theater, originally proposed more than 15 years ago, nearly fell through  late last year when the low bid came in at $17.6 million, more than $5 million  over budget estimates. UCI, one of the three partners in the construction,  kicked in an additional $1.8 million and the city and the Irvine Theater  Operating Co. raised the remaining $3.6 million.  </P> <P> When the first shovelful of earth for the theater was turned in March, it was a  triumph for university and community supporters.  </P> <P> "We have come a long way," Peltason said at the ground-breaking ceremony. "We  have just a little bit more to go. And then it will be opening night."  </P> <P> Agran, who supported the theater project, says he would like to draw on the  energies and intellect of the university in future projects.  </P> <P> "Our relationship has been strengthened because we need each other to  accomplish mutual goals," he says. "Our challenge now is to involve the  engineers, the social scientists, those who are knowledgeable about air  pollution or toxins in the environment in the urban problems we face. We need  to involve that intellect in the day-to-day life of the city." Irvine residents  feel great pride that theirs is a university town, Agran says. "I think without  UCI, Irvine would be largely indistinguishable from the other suburban  municipalities along the freeways to San Diego."  </P> <P> DEVELOPING THOSE community ties is part of UCI's maturation and a priority for  the chancellor. Peltason, 65, who spent a decade as chancellor of the  University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and started his academic career as a  political science instructor at the University of Missouri, uses those  communities as models.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see UCI and Irvine become like a Midwestern university town," he  said. "An Ann Arbor, a Champaign-Urbana, a Columbia, Mo. Those were  agricultural centers that gave rise to universities, and there is community  support and interaction that goes back for years and years. We're still young,  but we're getting there."  </P> <P> Peltason's overtures to the community have taken many forms. He formed the  Chancellor's Club, a circle of wealthy and influential county residents who  offer advice and bring other potential donors into the fold, and he has  launched community-support groups to strengthen university ties with citizens.  The chancellor has also encouraged university officials to participate in  Irvine affairs, take appointive posts and run for local office.  </P> <P> The emphasis on private donations has paid off. The university's fund-raising  office, headed by Vice Chancellor John Miltner, brought in a record $24 million  last year and has begun an ambitious five-year capital campaign to raise  another $195 million.  </P> <P> One prominent professor, who once was skeptical of the power push, is now a  believer.  </P> <P> "Jack is doing more on community outreach and touching bases with the ruling  elite of Orange County," says the professor, who has held leadership roles at  UCI for more than 20 years. "He is doing very well at that, and some who didn't  see the need, including me, have become convinced that it is very useful for  the university. It is bringing in enormous amounts of money."  </P> <P> Peltason also has presided over UCI's entrance into the high-stakes competition  for star scholars from around the world. In recent years, the university has  recruited literary critic J. Hillis Miller from Yale University, evolutionary  biologist Francisco Ayala from UC Davis and French literary critic and  philosopher Jacques Derrida, who travels to UCI from Paris to teach one quarter  each year.  </P> <P> Next on the chancellor's recruiting list are top graduate students, the next  generation of university professors and undergraduate honors students.  </P> <P> "The real future of the university is in people," Peltason says. "One of my  most important jobs is bringing the best, smartest people to UCI and supporting  the ones we've already got."  </P> <P> Peltason, who is expected to retire in 1991, is the bridge to that future. And  the next century is almost tangible at UCI, where 30 buildings are under  construction and student enrollment is expected to nearly double, from 15,000  to 27,000 by the year 2005. In a few years, the direction for the coming  quarter century will be set.  </P> <P> The next boom is inevitable. The challenge for UCI is to rise in quality as it  swells in size.  </P></p>

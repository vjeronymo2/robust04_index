			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WON'T SEEK NORIEGA DEAL: BUSH;  </P> <P> HE SAYS 'CASE IS STRONG,' BUT WON'T RULE OUT TALKS  </P> <P> President Bush declared today that the U.S. government "is not seeking a deal"  with former Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega to reduce the criminal charges  against him in exchange for  </P> <P> information about drug trafficking.  </P> <P> During a White House news conference, his first public comment since Noriega  was brought to the United States and arraigned Thursday on drug charges in  Miami, Bush trod lightly in discussing the case against the deposed dictator.  </P> <P> "We are committed to a fair trial and to providing all the protections  guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws," Bush said.  </P> <P> Bush said he had been informed by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh earlier in the day  "that our case is strong, our resolve is firm and our legal representations are  sound."  </P> <P> But while insisting there was no plan to pursue a plea-bargain arrangement, the  President suggested the government might listen if the idea is raised by  Noriega, saying, "The man's entitled to do whatever is granted him under our  laws."  </P> <P> "He's got his rights," Bush said, "and we ought not to stand up here and try to  define narrowly what they are."  </P> <P> That noncommittal line was echoed at the Justice Department, where spokesman  David Runkel told reporters that "as in any case, if the defendant has  something to say, we have an obligation to listen, to hear that person out."  </P> <P> In bringing Noriega to the United States to stand trial after his surrender  Wednesday night to U.S. authorities in Panama City, the Administration left  open the question of any reduction of or addition to the charges against him.  </P> <P> Bush served notice that he will not comment in the weeks and months ahead "on  any aspect of this prosecution or any matters that could even inadvertently  affect the outcome."  </P> <P> "Our government is not seeking a deal with Noriega," Bush said. "Our policy  remains that we have brought him to this country for prosecution."  </P> <P> The President said the thousands of American troops who were deployed to Panama  on Dec. 20 to oust Noriega and install a democratic government would return  home "as soon as possible. . . . I would look for an early return."  </P> <P> As for a timetable, he said, "Can't help you." He said he had no current plans  to visit Panama.  </P> <P> The Pentagon said about 24,500 troops were still there, about 900 fewer than  the previous day, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, was in Panama today to develop a timetable for withdrawal.  </P> <P> Shifting from the military aspects of the invasion to its political and  economic consequences, Bush said he is sending Vice President Dan Quayle on a  fence-mending mission to Latin America, where the U.S. action was denounced.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] State Minister Aykun Dogan has said that the banks  have sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and that freezing  citizens' foreign exchange accounts in the banks and converting  them into Turkish lira is absolutely out of the question.    In a written statement, Dogan pointed out that certain  newspapers recently reported that in the wake of the exchange  rate readjustments made in January, foreign exchange accounts  will be frozen and converted into Turkish lira. These reports  are completely unfounded, Dogan said, adding: The balanced  value of foreign exchange is determined by the supply and demand  in the market. There is no need to intervene. There is no  shortage of foreign exchange in the market. There is no need  for a transfer of foreign exchange in the banks or in the  Central Bank. Foreign payments are being made with no delay.  On the other hand, citizens' foreign exchange accounts are  totally under the management of private banks. Our banks have  sufficient supplies of foreign exchange. It is absolutely out  of the question as well as unnecessary to freeze citizens'  foreign exchange accounts and convert them into Turkish lira.  Everything is working securely and in line with economic rules.  Any statements or commentaries to the contrary are aimed at  confusing the citizens.    Turkey has opted for an open and growing economy.  Consequently, a return to the policy of bans is out of the  question. The free market mechanism will determine the areas to  which savings will be channeled, as has been the case until now.  Consequently, with the greatest peace of mind, our citizens  must invest their savings in the way most suitable to their  economic interests -- as far as terms, interest rates, and other  conditions are concerned -- including foreign exchange accounts.  Our citizens must ignore these rumors, which are contray to  their own interests and to those of the country.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Merck president resigns unexpectedly MR Richard Markham, president of Merck &amp; Company, the world's largest prescription drugs group, has resigned unexpectedly after seven months in the post. The 42-year-old Mr Markham, who was also Merck's chief operating officer, was widely viewed as heir apparent to the company's chairman, Mr Roy Vagelos. Merck said Mr Markham had left for 'personal reasons' which he did not wish to spell out. Mr Vagelos said: 'While Mr Markham's departure is disappointing, one of Merck's strengths is the quality and depth of its management team.' Those executives who reported directly to Mr Markham will now report to Mr Vagelos. The upheaval at Merck follows the ousting in March of Dr Ernest Mario as chief executive and deputy chairman of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs company, after apparent disagreements over management style and strategy. The Merck announcement surprised Wall Street analysts who suggested there was nothing in the company's recent financial performance to account for Mr Markham's departure. Mr Markham had spent more than two decades at Merck, becoming senior vice-president for Europe in 1989 and taking charge of the company's human health business worldwide in 1991. The New Jersey-based company's share price has fallen sharply this year from the high Dollars 40s to close unchanged at Dollars 34 3/4 last Friday. The resignation announcement came after the market's close and Merck shares may drop in reaction to the news this morning. Analysts have been cutting their earnings forecasts for the company in recent weeks amid concern that it will be unable to sustain its strong growth record. The concerns are due partly to pressures from the Clinton administration for the drug industry to cut prices and partly to doubts about the market potential of one of its new products, Proscar, a treatment for enlarged prostates. Merck, best known for anti-hypertensive and cardiovascular drugs, reported net profits of Dollars 1.98bn, (Pounds 1.32bn) or Dollars 2.12 a share for 1992, on sales of Dollars 9.7bn. Fourth quarter earnings rose 17 per cent on sales up 12 per cent. Mr Markham is the second top executive of a major US drugs company to quit in the past few weeks. In late June, Mr Vaughn Bryson resigned as head of Eli Lilly after boardroom disputes.</p>

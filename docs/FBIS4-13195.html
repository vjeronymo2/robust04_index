			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian  delegation to the Gaza-Jericho Committee meetings, has announced  that some progress has been made in the talks currently taking  place in Cairo on Palestinian autonomy, despite the fact that  the Israeli side has refused to give total amnesty to all the  Palestinian detainees. Sha'th clarified that the two sides have  come close to reaching agreement over the powers of the  Palestinian judiciary and other issues pertaining to air  transportation, communications, and some security matters. He  expected that concentration during the talks this week will be  on important security and civilian matters dealing with Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and on the powers of  Palestinian autonomy.    At the same time, Faysal al-Husayni, the prominent  Palestinian figure in the occupied territories, warned that any  delay in reaching agreement on implementing the Declaration of  Principles will have negative repercussions. He expressed his  belief that the situation in the occupied territories is very  dangerous.</p>

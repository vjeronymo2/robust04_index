			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Observer: Bottoms up for Greece You'd think Greece would have had enough of presidencies after recent events at Corfu. Not a bit of it. Now it's taken the helm of Black Sea Economic Co-operation. Set up by Turkey in 1992, B-SEC (as it's pronounced) has the tricky job of welding together 11 member states, some of which have severe bilateral disputes, not least war. Never mind. The members - including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey - are now establishing a Black Sea trade and development bank. Wasn't the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development set up for a similar purpose? Apparently even the EBRD's intended clients have overlooked its existence. Previous B-SEC president was Alexandre Chikvaidze, Georgia's foreign minister and a tough act to follow, at least in the joke department. Chikvaidze says he merits space in the Guinness Book of Records - as the only Georgian minister in living memory who relinquished a political post while sober and healthy.</p>

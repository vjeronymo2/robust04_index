			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Cosmo chiefs quit over Y36bn claim THE chairman and vice-president of Cosmo Securities, a Japanese stockbroking company, are to resign to take responsibility for a Y36bn (Dollars 280m) loss suffered in a dispute with an investment client. Cosmo accepted the loss in a court-mediated settlement with Skylark, a restaurant operator which invested considerable amounts in securities through Cosmo and other brokers. The losses arose during the mishandling of complicated transfers of securities by Cosmo from one client account to another. The transfers are carried out near client company year-ends to avoid clients booking appraisal losses.</p>

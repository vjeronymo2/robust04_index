			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> $648-MILLION LOSS HITS UNISYS  </P> <P> Unisys Corp., the nation's No. 3 computer company, today reported a huge  third-quarter loss of $648.7 million and only modestly higher revenues owing to  slack demand for its computers.  </P> <P> The company had earlier announced plans for a reduction of 8,000 people in its  work force and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities.  </P> <P> The staff reductions resulted in a special charge of $230 million. Unisys also  had charges of $150 million for defense division losses related to fixed price  contracts.  </P> <P> A number of defense contractors have reported losses on such fixed contracts,  introduced by Washington to put a cap on defense costs.  </P> <P> The Unisys quarterly loss, which worked out to $4.25 a share, compares with a  profit of $151 million or 77 cents a share a year ago. Revenues climbed to  $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion. Growth in the defense business helped  revenues.  </P></p>

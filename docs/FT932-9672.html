			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Political polecat treats Danes to a Maastricht mauling THE BRITISH hijacked Denmark's Maastricht referendum contest yesterday to the bemusement - and some irritation - of the Danes. British politicians, trailed by British camera crews and British reporters, traded insults and doled out advice to the Danes in the ante-chambers of the Folketing, the Danish parliament - all in English of course. In one corner was Lord Tebbit, erstwhile Conservative cabinet minister, scourge of Maastricht and political street-fighter of repute. Lord Tebbit was invited to Copenhagen by the June Movement, fellow-travellers campaigning for a repeat of last June's No vote in Denmark. In the other, seeking to blunt whatever impact Lord Tebbit might have, was the scholarly Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP, more sheepdog than polecat, and guest of the governing Social Democratic party. Lord Tebbit, Mr Radice warned at a press conference, was a 'xenophobic meddler' with no genuine concern for Denmark. The referendum, he said earnestly, was 'not something the British should interfere with at all', glossing over what Mr Radice was doing in Denmark himself. Summoning up a look of injured indignation, Lord Tebbit protested. His objections to Maastricht were based not on xenophobia but on a belief that it would do great damage to the European Community. 'Is it meddling to tell the Danish people what I as a European citizen believe?' he asked reasonably enough. 'Are we to have free movement of goods but thought police at our borders?' It is a moot point what effect - if any - such interventions will have on Tuesday's vote. A Gallup poll to be published today showed that the long-standing Yes lead was hardening. It showed 49 per cent in favour and 33 per cent against, compared with a gap of 46-34 at the weekend, with 14 per cent undecided and the balance resolved not to vote. Another poll, also to be published today, showed 52 per cent in favour, 36 per cent against, 8 per cent undecided and 4 per cent resolved not to vote. The respected pro-Maastricht newspaper Berlingske Tidende had sharp words for the British visitors, also taking a swipe at Sir James Goldsmith, financier turned crusader, who has paid for full-page advertisements in Danish newspapers advocating a No vote. The British, said Berlingske Tidende, 'are not welcome to consider the vote as a substitute for the referendum which they themselves will not have, let alone treat the Danish voters as puppets who can be used to vote no for reasons of British domestic politics'. Ulterior motive or no, Lord Tebbit said a second Danish No vote would stop British ratification of Maastricht and that Denmark would not subsequently be isolated or pushed out of the European Community. Yes campaign propaganda to that effect played on 'fear, ignorance and sheer misstatement of facts', added Britain's most celebrated Maastricht mauler.

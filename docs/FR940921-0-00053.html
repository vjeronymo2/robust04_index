			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Aftermarket Conversions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the Agency's policy that, based on the tampering provisions of section 203(a)(3) of the Act, aftermarket conversions should not degrade the emissions performance of the vehicle being converted, and that following a conversion a vehicle should still meet the emission standards it was originally certified as meeting on any fuels it is capable of using. Under this policy any conversion which degrades the emissions performance of the vehicle is considered tampering. In order to clarify how compliance with this policy can be demonstrated, the Agency proposed that converters can certify as new vehicle manufacturers using the current new vehicle certification procedures applicable to small volume manufacturers. The Agency requested comment on whether the volume limit of 10,000 units that currently defines a small volume manufacturer should apply to conversions as well, or whether, as proposed, the small volume procedures should apply to all converters, regardless of the conversion sales volume of the company seeking the certification. These certification requirements were proposed to apply to all aftermarket conversions performed or sold after December 31, 1993, regardless of the class or model year of the vehicle being converted. In the proposal the Agency stated its belief that this rule would not require any leadtime for technology development and that the only leadtime required would be for the actual certification process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the comments received on the aftermarket conversion provisions were very supportive, with several commenters expressing the need for such requirements, and none completely opposed. One commenter suggested that these requirements should only apply to conversions in areas which are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards. Comments were received both in favor of and opposed to applying the 10,000 limit to the use of the small volume procedures for conversions. Other comments received indicated that there was some confusion as to the applicability of the proposed requirements to conversions done before 1994, as well as to conversions of pre-1994 model year vehicles performed after December 31, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was stated in the description of today's rule, an aftermarket conversion company can choose to comply with these provisions to obtain an exemption from the tampering prohibition. Only conversions which are intended to generate some form of credit, such as clean-fueled fleet vehicle purchase credits, will be required to comply with these provisions. Converters which choose not to obtain an exemption from the tampering prohibition under this procedure will be handled under the current tampering policy. Given that this is an optional certification procedure for conversions the issues of leadtime and mandatory start date are less relevant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees with the comment that the production volume limits that currently define a small volume manufacturer also apply to converters seeking to certify as manufacturers under today's program. The Agency expects that the demand for aftermarket conversions will grow dramatically over the next few years in response to a variety of state and federal programs. It seems reasonable to require the larger conversion companies to undergo full new vehicle certification if they choose to get an exemption from the tampering prohibition by certifying as a manufacturer. Thus, the volume limits that currently apply to manufacturers seeking to certify under the small volume manufacturers provisions will also apply to converters seeking to certify as manufacturers. The Agency recognizes that, while the current small volume manufacturers limit applies to sales for a particular model year, conversions are routinely performed on older vehicles, and a conversion company may offer conversion systems for vehicles from several different model years at any given time. Thus, the 10,000 sales volume limit for certifying under the small volume manufacturers procedures will apply to calendar year sales for the purposes of aftermarket conversions. For a further discussion of how this volume limit will be applied see the summary and analysis of comments document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Test Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM the Agency proposed using the same test procedures for conversions that are used for new vehicle and engine certification. This approach was proposed because the Agency believes that this is the only way of truly measuring the emissions performance of a conversion relative to the emission standards applicable to the original vehicle or engine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the comments received on the issue of test procedures for aftermarket conversions concerned the differences between EPA's proposed procedures and those adopted by CARB. In general, where there are differences between CARB's procedures and those proposed by EPA the commenters requested that the Agency adopt the CARB procedures instead of what it proposed. In the case of procedures for converted light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks EPA's proposed test procedures are essentially the same as CARB's. Thus, there is no issue in the case of light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck certification procedures for aftermarket conversions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

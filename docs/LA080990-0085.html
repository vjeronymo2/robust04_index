			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT BRACES FOR CUTS OF $3.8 MILLION;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: LOWER STATE FUNDING AND RISING COSTS LEAD TO PREDICTIONS OF A  SHORTFALL BY 1991-92. THIS YEAR, OFFICIALS PLAN TO REDUCE SPENDING BY $500,000  OR DIP INTO RESERVES.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's vetoes of state education funding and rising employee  health costs may lead to reductions of $3.8 million in Glendale education  spending during the next two years, district officials said this week.  </P> <P> The Glendale Unified School District Board of Education was somewhat prepared  for the vetoes, having adopted a cautious preliminary budget in June. But  members said they hoped for more state money to protect the district from the  cuts it may have to make.  </P> <P> "We're a very, very conservative district, and we always budget like that, so  when it comes down to matters like this, we thank our lucky stars that we do it  that way," board President Sharon Beauchamp said. "But this was kind of a  shock. I hope that legislators can reinstate as much of the cuts as possible."  </P> <P> Officials will trim about $500,000 from the district's 1990-91 budget of $103.5  million or dip into reserves and postpone the cuts until next year. An  additional $3.3 million in cuts or reductions is projected for 1991-92.  </P> <P> District staff will not decide on what cuts to recommend until it examines the  budget program by program, beginning in September. But one option is a $300,000  reduction in data processing, said David Kanthak, the district's assistant  superintendent of business services.  </P> <P> Kanthak and others predicted that they could minimize the effect of the cuts on  classroom and student programs. Plans to install air-conditioning at six  elementary schools scheduled to go year-round in July, 1991, and the addition  of classrooms at several Glendale schools will be unaffected by the budget  changes, they said.  </P> <P> Student enrollment is expected to grow by 3.7%, to about 25,000 students, this  school year.  </P> <P> "We're talking about something that is workable," Kanthak said. "It will  definitely affect people. It will definitely affect the schools. But it is  manageable."  </P> <P> Deukmejian vetoed about $480 million from the proposed education budget by  reducing cost-of-living increases and moving Proposition 98 money into school  reserve funds, where it can be used only for an emergency.  </P> <P> The Legislature had approved a 4.7% cost-of-living increase for schools, but  Deukmejian reduced it to 3% and cut items such as California Assessment Program  testing and driver's training.  </P> <P> "The priority of the governor happens to be somewhere besides education and  young people," Beauchamp said. "He's not leaving a very good legacy for Pete  Wilson or Dianne Feinstein. He's leaving a mess."  </P> <P> The board, which was required to adopt a budget by the end of June, had  projected a 3% cost-of-living increase and adopted a budget that was $9.5  million higher than the $94 million budgeted by the district for 1989-90.  Initially, that budget included a $600,000 reduction in administrative spending  for items such as supplies, but did not touch classroom programs or a 3%  reserve, as mandated by the state.  </P> <P> But after adopting the budget, the district learned that a shortfall in state  lottery and general funds would necessitate the additional $500,000 in cuts,  Kanthak said.  </P> <P> A 7.2% salary increase for teachers in 1990-91 and an estimated $2-million  increase in health-care costs are expected to force the district to make about  $3.3 million in reductions in 1991-92. That means the district may have to  modify employee benefit packages or curtail salary increases, Kanthak said.  </P> <P> A 4.7% cost-of-living increase most likely would have covered the shortfall  from last year and substantially reduced cuts in 1991-92, he said.  </P> <P> The budget scenario caused concern among teachers' union representatives, who  will begin new contract negotiations with the district next summer.  </P> <P> "When you talk about, 'Well, the options are no pay raise or a change in the  benefits,' that's telling teachers they're going to balance the budget," said  Mark Desetti, president of the Glendale Teachers Assn. "I think it's too early  to tell what's going to happen. A lot could happen in a year."  </P> <P> For the next school year, district officials either will trim $500,000 or  postpone the cuts until next year by dipping into a 3% reserve. But because  that reserve level is mandated by the state, such a move would merely postpone  reductions in the district budget until 1991-92, Kanthak said.  </P> <P> In addition, students ready to obtain driver's licenses may have to take  driver's training through private companies if the district cannot foot the  $195,000 cost of its program, Kanthak said.  </P> <P> The district's budget has grown substantially in recent years. Student  enrollment has increased 22% since 1985, with 24,400 students now enrolled and  projections for as many as 28,300 by 1992. Most newcomers are immigrants or  refugees who must go through costly special programs to learn English and other  skills, Kanthak said.  </P></p>

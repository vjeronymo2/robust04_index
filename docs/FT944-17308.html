			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Travel: Renaissance flowers again in Florence - Derek Wilson enjoys 20th century comfort in 16th century surroundings For years, visitors to Florence have opted to inspect the Renaissance by day and to give it a miss by night, preferring to sleep in comfort rather than rough it in some derelict 16th century palazzo without hot water. Change is afoot. You can now sleep the Renaissance as well as see it - and in comfort. A small group of hoteliers has pioneered the restoration of Renaissance properties to make them suitable for the most choosy tourist. In so doing, they have resisted the cheap - and easy - path of wholesale conversion of buildings which has been followed by all but a handful of the 359 hotels in Florence. Four have chosen the hard way. In each case, family pride has been a principal reason. Encouragement, too, came from the Florence town council, which has a new policy aimed at making greater use of historic buildings. All the emphasis in these four instances has been on re-creating the physical setting of the Renaissance, with less regard for other matters such as food. Only one, in fact, has a restaurant, although all four provide lavish breakfasts. The most spectacular is Torre di Bellosguardo, a big, sturdy 16th century villa on a hill beyond the Arno. 'I simply wanted to save the place,' says Amerigo Franchetti, the owner. He says that 180 day-school pupils used to arrive at 8am and wreak destruction. 'I had to get rid of them. In another five years they would have wrecked the lot.' The core of the hotel is a stumpy tower built perhaps as a hunting lodge before 1300 by Guido Cavalcanti, poet of courtly love, and a friend of Dante. Later confiscated from the Medici, it passed to the land-owning Roti Michelozzi family who much later ceded it to Franchetti's romantic grandmother. 'She was a German from Munich called Marion Hornstein. She took one look at this place and decided it was the abode of her dreams and all that rot,' says the owner. 'She married an Italian. Then my father told her one day in 1913: 'If you like this place so much, here's the money'. He'd married into the Rothschilds, Paris branch. When she died in 1948, the family let it to finishing schools, then to that terrible day-school.' The restorers took 10 years. Already the high facade is peeling, but inside the building wallows in space: a mirror of spartan Tuscan luxury. Reception is a table in a great ball-room frescoed by one Bernardino Poccetti, a prolific 16th century hack. The music-room boasts a fine sculpted chimney-piece and is bare; a stone ramp does for stairs; canopied beds, sticks of medieval furniture and coats-of-arms in huge rooms complete the feeling, as do aged carpets. Frigo-bars and TV sets have been banned and superb bathrooms are ingeniously dissimulated. Concealing the swimming-pool in gardens ablaze with flowers proved a tougher proposition. A friend of Franchetti's, Rodolfo Budini Gattai, runs what was a guest-house for clerics built in 1518. Discreetly tucked away under the arches of the very central Piazza della Santissima Annunziata, this is the Loggiato dei Serviti. It faces Brunelleschi's Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundlings' hospital, and was included in the matching portico designed by Antonio da Sangallo. The fathers kept their lodgings for visiting prelates. They were clearly well-heeled since the rooms are commodious chambers: you wake up to Tuscan coffered ceilings and lofty ribbed vaulting. 'My family bought the Loggiato in 1870 after the confiscation of church property', says Gattai. 'At first it was rented out as flats, but in 1924 my grandmother's coachman was allowed to open a boarding-house here. Well, he married an Irish lady, one Katherine Doyle, and in the 1930s their pensione was popular with the English and Irish. I and my brothers took over in 1984. We wanted to resurrect the original.' The most stylish of the four is the Monna Lisa in nearby Borgo Pinti - a superbly preserved 15th century patrician dwelling set around a small courtyard with a garden in the back. The dominant artist on display is Giovanni Dupre, a 19th century Sienese sculptor whose descendents own the place. Oslavia Ciardi Dupre bought out the Marzichi-Lenzi family, its owners for generations, in 1956. At the Monna Lisa, Florentine good taste comes with a touch of clutter: there is Dupre family treasure scattered about, including five centuries' of furniture and a plaster model by Giambologna for his Rape of the Sabines in Piazza della Signoria. There is a tasteful restaurant amid pillars and pictures. Cheaper is the oddly-named Aprile, near the station. It is as Renaissance as they come, a pugnacious three-storey clan fortress with huge eaves and no nonsense. Once known as the Palazzo dei Medici, and then as Palazzo del Borgo, this is a warren of a place with a lived-in feel to it. The old structure survives intact, bumps, wasted space, crannies and all, each one deftly exploited. 'My family has been there since 1815,' says Marcella Ascoli-Bollaffi. 'We were textile merchants. I was born there and my mother stayed on until the '50s.' Why Aprile? 'Oh, I was young and silly and when we let it to the Cantini Zucconi family 40 years ago, I let them call it after the month they moved in. I've regretted it ever since.'

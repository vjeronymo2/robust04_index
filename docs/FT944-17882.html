			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Howard seeks to reassure police Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, yesterday sought to reassure senior police officers over proposals they fear may lead to greater private-sector involvement in policing. He told the Police Superintendents' Association conference in Leicestershire it was 'simply not true' that a Home Office review of police tasks was considering encouraging companies or local authorities to patrol the streets and deal with traffic. The review aimed to ensure the money devoted to policing achieved the best results. 'It is about getting highly trained officers out of time-wasting duties and into productive ones where their training will be used to full effect,' he said. It was not about looking for ways to cut the number of police constables. But the Police Federation of England and Wales said yesterday that the privatisation of prisoner escort services had not released one extra police officer to fight street crime. Mr Fred Broughton, the federation chairman, told a Labour conference fringe meeting in Blackpool that police numbers had instead been cut in line with the number of officers relieved of the task. He said: 'There is a bit of a myth about transferring police duties to civilians because it does not lead to those thousands of extra police officers on the streets that the government suggests it does.' A speech to the Leicester conference by Chief Superintendent David Golding, association president, was thought by some observers to have been watered down. A hard-hitting draft had been available to journalists earlier this week but Mr Golding omitted some passages when he delivered the speech. Later Mr Howard denied that he or his department put any pressure on Mr Golding to amend the speech. Mr Golding said he had changed his script after it became clear that some of his fears and concerns were being addressed.</p>

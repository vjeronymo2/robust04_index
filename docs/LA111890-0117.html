			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> THE INIMITABLE JEEVES by P.G. Wodehouse (Penguin: $4.95) Typical pandemonium  reigns when that regular chappie, unsuccessful arbiter of fashion and  upper-class twit, Bertie Wooster, and his unflappably competent valet, Jeeves,  are called to assist the scatterbrained Bingo Little in his pursuit of several  delightfully improbable ladies, including Honoria Glossop and Charlotte Corday  Rowbotham. Jeeves naturally saves the day, sorting out the myriad complications  with his singular mixture of unfailing good sense, knowledge of human nature  and inside information. "The Inimitable Jeeves" is one of four volumes of  Wodehouse's popular comedy of manners that have been dramatized for  "Masterpiece Theatre" on PBS. Charles Solomon  </P></p>

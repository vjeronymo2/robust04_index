			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNBEATEN COUGARS WON'T CATCH TROJANS NAPPING IN PULLMAN  </P> <P> Pullman, Wash., a town named for railroad sleeping car inventor George Pullman,  is itself a sleepy little town near the Idaho border. Its serene state is in  contrast to the aggressive football that is sometimes played there.  </P> <P> USC has had its problems in Pullman as recently as 1986, when the heavily  favored Trojans were routed, 34-14. Only a few USC players remain from that  team, but the memory of the game will be with them when the Trojans meet the  Cougars today at Martin Stadium.  </P> <P> "I remember we were 4-0 and coming off big wins over Baylor and Washington,"  recalled All-American defensive tackle Tim Ryan, who was a freshman at the  time.  </P> <P> "We didn't think they were a very good team (2-2-1 at the time) and we got  stunned. We really got worked over by their option cutback play. It's one of  the ugliest feelings I've had since I've been at USC."  </P> <P> The game was significant inasmuch as it was the first loss of a 7-5 season that  led to the firing of USC Coach Ted Tollner. In that sense it was a watershed  game.  </P> <P> As for Washington State, it didn't win another game the rest of the season, an  embarrassing footnote for the Trojans.  </P> <P> However, the Cougars aren't a sleeper team this season. They're 4-0 under new  Coach Mike Price after being written off as a second division Pac-10 team.  Washington State lost its coach, Dennis Erickson, who moved on to the  University of Miami.  </P> <P> Price, a former Washington State player and assistant coach, who replaced  Erickson after eight seasons at Weber State, inherited a team that had lost 14  starting players and most of the offensive line.  </P> <P> Price, who took his staff to a positive-thinking retreat and had a similar  on-campus program for his players, is working every psychological angle.  </P> <P> For example, instead of wringing his hands at the prospect of meeting the  Trojans, who are 9 1/2-point favorites, Price is challenging them.  </P> <P> "I don't mean to be bragging when I say this, but I think we have to adjust our  mental framework," Price said. "I think USC has got to come in here and beat  us. I don't think we have to worry about beating USC.  </P> <P> "If we don't think we can win, we're never going to win."  </P> <P> If Washington State wins, Price wouldn't view it as an upset and wouldn't want  his team labeled as giant-killers. He would prefer to regard it as evidence  that the Cougars are a factor in the conference.  </P> <P> Even though Washington State has beaten USC only once since 1957 and has won  only five games while tying four and losing 40 in the series, Price is trying  to convince his players that there isn't any mystique in playing the Trojans.  </P> <P> Beating USC isn't any bigger deal than beating Oregon State, he says. Merely  another conference game. That's a tough sell.  </P> <P> Price was asked on his weekly television show for his response to a comment by  former UCLA coach Dick Vermeil, who said on ABC's telecast of the Ohio  State-USC game that the Washington State game would be "a gimme" for the  Trojans.  </P> <P> "He'll be all right after he sobers up," Price quipped.  </P> <P> Vermeil's remarks would make Larry Smith wince.  </P> <P> Smith has an enviable Pac-10 record, losing only to Oregon on the road since he  became USC's coach in 1987. To keep that record intact, he's trying to impress  on his team that Washington State is not a "gimme" game.  </P> <P> "They're a fine team, the best combination of offensive and defensive players  we've met," Smith said. "And they're by far the quickest team we've met."  </P> <P> Ryan and linemate Dan Owens, who were in on 70 plays when the Cougars upset the  Trojans in 1986, don't need Smith to remind them of the possible pitfalls in  Pullman.  </P> <P> "I personally look forward to the challenge," Ryan said. "We're going up to do  a job and we're going to get it done."  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> The game will televised on Channel 7 at 12:30 p.m. . . . USC has a 2-1 record  after losing to Illinois and beating Utah State and Ohio State. . . . Tailback  Scott Lockwood did not make the trip. Lockwood recently had a cast removed from  his injured thumb and will start practicing with the team Monday. Tailback  Calvin Holmes has a sprained ankle but he made the trip. . . . USC quarterback  Todd Marinovich hasn't missed any practices because of his sprained left  (passing) wrist. . . . Tom Dabasinskas, a reserve center, had arthroscopic knee  surgery and will be sidelined from three to four weeks.  </P> <P> USC outside linebacker Junior Seau said he is dedicating his season to Colorado  quarterback Sal Aunese, who died last Saturday of inoperable stomach cancer.  They're second cousins and grew up together in Oceanside. . . . Seau has five  of USC's 14 quarterback sacks this season, causing Coach Larry Smith to  comment: "He's one heck of a football player and is the first outside  (line)backer since Marcus Cotton who has been a knife in a guy's side. He puts  pressure on the quarterback, whether it's a blitz or a three-man rush. We do a  lot of things to use his ability. Just let Junior go."  </P> <P> USC is top-ranked in the Pacific 10 in rushing (267.7 yards a game), total  offense (448) and total defense (237.7). The Trojans are also fourth-ranked  nationally in rushing defense, yielding an average of 49 yards. . . . USC  tailback Ricky Ervins is the conference's second-leading rusher, averaging  109.3 yards a game. . . . Washington State has the league's leading punter in  Rob Meyers. He's averaging 46.4 yards a punt.  </P></p>

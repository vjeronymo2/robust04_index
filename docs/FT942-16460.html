			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Perchance to dream - Lynn MacRitchie finds an artist sharing her bed with visitors in an art gallery We are such stuff as dreams are made on . . .' and dreams themselves provide the stuff that Janine Antoni has used to make a work especially for the Anthony D'Offay Gallery. There she sits, in the recently-opened exhibition space dedicated to showing young artists, at a simple loom, weaving an endless blanket of undyed wool. Through the neutral warp and weft run two parallel curving lines of blue cloth, their shapes based on the mappings of the artist's dream activity, as drawn by the polyosomnograph machine which stands in the opposite corner, the folded heaps of graph paper on the floor beside it echoing the fall of the cloth. Beneath the loom stands a bed, where the artist sleeps each night, tearing a strip from her blue cotton nightgown the next morning to become the marker of her dreams. Above the bed, like a canopy, stretch the woollen threads which form the warp, curving up to a wooden rack which rests against the wall, stacking the 316 spools of wool in neat rows. It is a charming tableau. The artist welcomes visitors, explaining the work to them. In turn, they tell her their dreams and often, their secrets too, the quiet ambience encouraging confidences. Antoni, from the Bahamas and now based in New York, describes her work as an attempt to render ordinary human activities, those things that everyone must do  - sleep, eat, wash, clean up  -into sculpture. This starting point leads to the creation of works various in form and complex in reference. She has made self portrait busts out of soap, washed art gallery floors with her hair and, at last year's Whitney Biennial in New York, showed two huge blocks, one of chocolate, one of lard. She used part of each to make models of lipsticks and cosmetic boxes by biting lumps off and chewing until the material was malleable enough to form into the counterfeits. Such work throws up a veritable maze of references. These are both artistic  -the rectangles of minimal sculpture, for example, or the fat so favoured as a material by Joseph Beuys - and political, the relation of women to domestic work for one, or the ambiguous nature of 'beauty', enhanced by products made almost entirely of its supposed enemy, fat. Antoni is conscious of what could be a heavy PC loading for her work; it remains essentially serene, however, unlike the sometimes shrill protest art favoured by some of her contemporaries. The questions in her work are muted, raised and resolved as an integral part of its realisation rather than screaming slogans. Following through the creation of Slumber illustrates how its final form, unusual though it may be, was arrived at by a carefully considered process. Realising that she wished to do a work based on sleep, Antoni, who is diligent in her research, turned first to 'all the classics', including the work of the Surrealists and their mentor Freud. She then decided that she did not want to work with dream 'contents' such as they had striven to depict or describe. Turning to the world of science, she discovered at a sleep disorder clinic in Yonkers, a doctor who collected art work about sleeping. He taught her how to use a polyosomnograph, which gave her what she had been looking for - a means of representing the dream state, achieved by plotting periods of rapid eye movement during sleep. These became her pattern, weaving her process, chosen because of its own fundamental status as a human activity, rendering the fragile filaments of thread into an object of substance. She learned to weave, designed a loom small enough to fit into the gallery space and, her own Rumplestiltskin, set about transforming not straw into gold, but sleep into art. Although not seeking to be a performance or process artist, she accepts her 'live' role during this piece, trying to get a couple of hours weaving done in the morning before the number of visitors gets too great, sleeping peacefully in her woollen nest at night. A selection of work by gallery artists celebrates the opening of the new space, including a powerful new video installation by Bruce Nauman, whose important retrospective is about to begin its progress across the US. Antoni is pleased to be surrounded by her older contemporaries, many of whom she recognises as influences. 'It's good to have Kiki Smith around the corner and Bruce Nauman upstairs,' she says, and the show is indeed a useful anthology of some of the most significant artists of the last 15 years, including Johns, Hamilton, Baselitz, Gilbert &amp; George and more. It is a handy marker to set against Picasso at the Tate and Dali at the Hayward. Antoni is grateful for this contextualisation of her work, appreciating the boost to its understanding this gathering of her elders may bring. And it has other benefits. Aren't you frightened, I ask, sleeping here alone? 'No,' she says quick as a flash, 'with all this art around, the security must be good]' Sweet dreams. At the Anthony D'Offay Gallery, 24 Dering Street, London, until April 15.</p>

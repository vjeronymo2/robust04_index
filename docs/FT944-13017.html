			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods details trends in businesses Attwoods, the waste services company, yesterday laid another brick in the wall of its defence against the hostile Pounds 364m bid from Browning'Ferris Industries of the US with a circular detailing trends in each of its five businesses. The circular precedes a third defence document, which is expected to include a valuation of the business and results for the first quarter. This is likely to be published on November 11, the last day Attwoods may release new financial information under takeover rules. Attwoods said yesterday the circular, which included few hard numbers for 1995, was intended to be a discussion document for investors. Profits forecasts would be difficult, given the recent end of the company's financial year. 'It is another brick and it is not a huge brick by any means,' said one adviser. 'But there is a lot more to come.' Attwoods said this document set out 'the specific factors underlying our confidence in the future'. These included: price increases and population growth in Florida, where Attwoods' claims 32 per cent of the market. Cost-cutting, which would more than offset the pressure on municipal contract renewals in that state. Resolution of legal problems in the mid-Atlantic states and economic recovery; plus a return to profitability in the medical incineration business and restructuring in the German business. BFI responded with derision. 'We wonder why they even bothered to release this document,' the company said. 'They have provided little, if any, substance as to why shareholders should feel confident in the future. The arguments advanced for looking forward to a brighter 1995 just are not there.' BFI is offering shareholders 109p cash for Attwoods ordinary shares and 85p per preference share. At current exchange rates this represents about Dollars 9.20 per American Depositary Receipt, equivalent to five ordinary shares. Laidlaw of Canada, Attwoods largest shareholder, has accepted the offer. Fidelity Investments, which holds almost 12 per cent of Attwoods and has been selling recently, this week disclosed that it had purchased 46,100 ADRS. BFI has said that it will pay the declared final net dividend of 3.25p, if successful. Attwoods shares closed steady at 113p.</p>

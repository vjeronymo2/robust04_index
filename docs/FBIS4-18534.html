			<p>CSO     [Text] Ankara--The president of the Council of State, Metin  Guven, said that secularism, a basic attribute of the republic,  must not be a subject of debate. He said: "One cannot speak  about a democratic system or a state of law without secularism.  The secular state is a safeguard even for those who express  ideas against secularism."    Guven, who will retire on 15 March because of age limits,  expressed his views on debates about secularism and the work of  the judiciary.    Guven said that one cannot say lawsuits are settled  expeditiously in legal or administrative cases and noted that  the Council of State takes at least a year to decide a case.    Guven explained that work is under way to solve this problem  in administrative trials by adding two more departments to the  Council of State and expanding its staff to adequate levels. He  added:    "Because of the slow operation of the judiciary, the  benefits  expected from it are reduced to a minimum, and unfair practices  persist. At a time when economic relations are expanding and  inflation is soaring the losses of those who are harmed by these  procedures are also growing. As a result it is necessary to go  to the source of the problem."  <H5>  Making Laws </H5>   Stating that the source of the problem is the way laws are  drafted, Guven said: "Above all, one cannot say that the  necessary attention is paid to the drafting of the laws. A law  must be drafted not just for the administration but with the  participation and input of professional groups and other  organizations which may be affected by that law. If that is  done, the number of disputes and therefore lawsuits may be  reduced. This is a very important approach whose implementation,  however, is difficult."    Guven noted that the administration must comply with  administrative judicial decisions and that contrary situations  are not encountered very frequently in Turkey. He continued:    "However, sometimes the administration complies only  formally  while weakening the effectiveness of the decision. When someone  is removed from office, the administration rehires him or  appoints him to an equivalent office. Then it goes and dismisses  him again. That starts an unending process of lawsuits. One must  not forget that the administrator who does not comply with the  judiciary's decision may need the same judiciary's decision if  he is removed from office some day in the future."  <H5>  Ottoman State Not Secular </H5>   Commenting on debates about secularism that have intensified  recently, Guven said that there can be no republic, democratic  system or state of law without the principle of secularism and  that this principle must not be debated.    Stating that there are attempts to interpret secularism in  Turkey in a way other than how it is defined at its source,  Guven said:    "There is an attempt to interpret secularism as freedom of  religion and noninterference of the state in religion. This has  absolutely nothing to do with secularism. A basic concept like  secularism must be well-defined and its limits must be properly  set. It is one thing for a state to be secular, it is another  for it not to interfere in religion, beliefs, and thoughts. The  noninterference of the state in religion means individual  freedom of religion and conscience. A state which is not secular  may also respect freedom of religion and conscience. Take for  example the Ottoman Empire. But the Ottoman State was not  secular. It was run by Islamic rules, Islamic codes of law and  the provisions of the Koran, but it did not interfere in the  religion of its subjects. That shows not that the Ottoman state  was secular but that it was extremely respectful toward freedom  of religion and conscience."  <H5>  Secular State </H5>   Stating that a secular state cannot be under the influence  of  any religion, Guven said:    "From this standpoint a secular system is in fact a  safeguard  of protection for all religions. A secular state is a safeguard  even for those who express ideas against secularism. Every  religion has its own denominations and sects. If we assume that  the state is not secular, which of those sects will be dominant  in the state? The dominance of any of those sects means that  people who share the same religion will be even less protected  than people from another religion. That is because there is  closer rivalry between different sects of the same religion.  Thus in a nonsecular state there would be no protection even for  people who share the same religion as those who hold power."</p>

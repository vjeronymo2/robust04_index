			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "M.P.": "Drugs Worth 4 Million Schillings </F> Smuggled to Austria in Car Tank"]    [Text] Eric de Zwart (32) has been traveling to Austria  from his home country, the Netherlands, several times a year to  sell drugs.    The disguise was perfect: In the winter months, he was  studying to become a skiing instructor. In a number of winter  holiday resorts, this smart "sunny boy" was a welcome visitor.  He also traveled regularly to Vienna and Lower Austria.    Everywhere he was received by "friends," who waited for his  deliveries. The man from Rotterdam had intensive contacts with  Austrian drug dealers. He sold them hashish that he heat-sealed  in plastic bags, hid in the gasoline tank of his car, and  smuggled into Austria.    Over the past two years, Eric de Zwart smuggled at least 38  kg of hashish worth 4 million schillings from the Netherlands to  Austria.    He has now been arrested by Lower Austrian criminal police  officers at the Walserberg highway border crossing, carrying 4  kg of cannabis resin. Eric de Zwart was to have handed over the  drugs to an Austrian dealer at the highway restaurant in  Mondsee. No information on his contacts has been revealed.  Detailed investigations are under way.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Charles Hornberger: "Uruguay Final Act Good for </F> Czech Goods"]    [Text] Following the closure of the decade-long Uruguay  Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),  Czech government officials are predicting an annual GDP boost of  1 to 2 percent as a result of increased trade.    After months of frantic argument and compromise among the  world's largest industrial powers, the signing of the GATT Final  Act is expected to usher in the broadest program ever for  reforming trade and tuning up international markets. Czech  political leaders, as a result, are predicting increased  import-export business at home and claiming small victories for  the Czech domestic marketplace.    "I'm convinced that GATT is not only important for big  exporters like the U.S. and Japan, but also for transitional  countries like the Czech Republic," said Minister of Industry  and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy at an April 22 press conference, one  week after signing the document in Marrakesh, Morocco.    With expanded export possibilities, Dlouhy said, the  country's economy is poised to begin real improvement, after  years of falling production levels and sluggish growth during  its transformation from a planned economy to a free market.    Demand on the Czech domestic market alone, with only 10  million consumers, "will never be enough to allow for growth,"  Dlouhy said.    For Czech political and business leaders, economic  liberalization has long been a rallying cry at home and abroad,  and nowhere more so than in the government halls of foreign  countries whose markets seemed a tad too tightly managed for  Czech tastes.    One of the biggest gains for Czech producers may well be  increased access to West European markets. The Czech Republic  has been quietly booming on the European Union (EU) market, the  world's largest trading area. With its heavy industrial  background and low labor costs, the Czech Republic has become a  serious competitor in many areas.    During much of GATT's long negotiating process,  protectionist  policies in the EU were one of the thorniest obstacles.  Especially in agriculture, textiles and steel--three markets in  which Czechs are strong--domestic farm subsidies and foreign  import quotas made access, especially for the newly emerging  economies of Central and Eastern Europe, difficult to obtain.    "Those are the areas where the EU protects its markets,"  said  Kamil Cermak, a press spokesman for Dlouhy.    Such barriers have in the past attracted criticism from  many,  including GATT General Director Peter Sutherland, for leaving  the post-Communist countries out in the cold.    "Many of these new democracies are fragile politically and  economically. Their leaders have often acted with great courage  in their policies of economic liberalization. What these  countries need is full assimilation into the multilateral  trading system, not rejection by the most successful  beneficiaries of that system," Sutherland wrote in late 1993 for  the WALL STREET JOURNAL.    The Uruguay Final Act will cut subsidies, quotas and tariffs  significantly, ostensibly giving Czech products a leg up. In  addition, the Czechs have continued to negotiate with the EU  headquarters in Brussels, which has imposed quotas on Czech  goods in many areas.    "There are improvements [already], because there is a lot of  communication between Brussels and Prague, but GATT will help  this," Cermak said.    Czech trade with the EU has soared over the last four years,  jumping by 169 percent despite the EU's restrictions. "In  general, Czech trade has exploded," said Gerhard Sabathil, first  secretary of the European Commission's permanent delegation to  the Czech Republic. "The Czech Republic is the only Central  European country to have a trade surplus with the EU."    Also, with the implementation of GATT, Sabathil said, EU  officials may modify the so-called "European Agreements," which  form the basis of economic relations between Central and Eastern  European countries and the EU. If, for instance, GATT dictates  lowering a specific tariff, the agreements may be adapted to  remain in harmony with the new levels prescribed by GATT,  Sabathil said.    GATT "definitely stands to benefit us," said Milan Tomanek,  press spokesman for the Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka (CSOB),  which handles half of the country's export business. "The field  where we feel we are specifically strong, traditionally strong,  is the area of international trade."    For instance, Tomanek said, CSOB has already run up against  the caps on steel exports to the EU. "The steel companies in the  north of Moravia are clients of the bank, so we have seen a  tremendous drop there," he said.    As the numbers break down, GATT will lower tariffs in  developed countries by an average of 38 percent and leave  approximately 40 percent of imports tariff-free.    The 124 members of GATT also agreed the world's major  trading  powers, such as the EU, Japan, the U.S. and Canada, would  gradually eliminate tariffs on pharmaceuticals, construction  equipment, medical equipment, steel, furniture, agricultural  machinery, wood, paper, toys, beer and liquor. Also, quotas,  which have been a thorn in the side of free traders, will be  lifted on textile products and clothing over the next 10 years.    In addition, domestic subsidies for agricultural products  will drop by an average of 20 percent over the next six years,  while export subsidies will drop by 36 percent. To make the  transformation complete, all non-tariff barriers, such as  quotas, will be transformed into the form of tariffs, which will  then be lowered on average by 36 percent.    In the Czech government's report on the Final Act, Dlouhy  and  Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec wrote that the Czech side came  out ahead in the final results.    For instance, they wrote, the Czechs will lower tariffs on  industrial goods entering the domestic market. Reduction for  GATT member-states is one-third. After fully implementing this  reduction, the average incidence of tariffs (i.e., the  percentage of goods on which tariffs are levied) on the Czech  industrial goods market, which is already relatively open to  exports from abroad, will be roughly 3.8 percent, a figure that  "approaches the rates of the EU," Dlouhy's report says.    Czech firms also stand to gain considerable market access as  a result of the Final Act, as the developed market economies  will either "completely eliminate tariffs on industrial products  or reduce them to a very low level," the report says.    At home, however, Czech producers will not see such stiff  reductions, says the report; since protectionism abroad and  particularly in Western Europe has been disadvantageous to the  Czech Republic in the past, it will not have to subject its  businesses to outside competition as quickly.    "Through this approach, it has balanced out the various  levels of market protection through tariffs, which had been up  to now unfavorable for the Czech Republic in comparison with  countries [with developed market economies] as a whole," the  report claims.    Although in sensitive sectors such as steel exports, one of  the Czech Republic's real powerhouses, GATT often either spreads  out reductions in EU tariffs over long periods of time or lowers  them less than Czech firms might want, the Czech side will still  not have to reciprocate.    But Dlouhy and Zieleniec also predict that, especially in  the  textile and clothing markets, where domestic subsidies will drop  by 20 percent and export subsidies by 36 percent, Czech  producers will have to take some bad with the good.    Says the Czech government report: "In addition to new  possibilities for access to markets of other countries, however,  Czech producers must count on stiffer competition on foreign and  domestic markets from developing countries whose exports to the  markets of developed countries have been strongly restricted."    Currently, however, the Czech Republic does not have an  extremely liberal import regime, the report says, which ought to  lessen the impact of tariff reductions. Also, the reductions  here will be spread over 10 years to give domestic producers a  chance to adjust, whereas reductions elsewhere will take effect  much more quickly.    The final victory for developing economies like the Czech  Republic's, where costs for labor and outlays for social welfare  remain low, was in persuading GATT members not to concentrate on  "social dumping" clauses in the final agreement, said the  Ministry of Industry and Trade's Cermak.    "Some West European countries and the United States want to  talk about social conditions and labor standards," he said, "and  that's uncomfortable for us, because that can become another  form of protectionism."    GATT feared that the more developed economic players, like  the U.S. or the EU, might insist that Czech producers were  engaging in "social dumping"--in other words, keeping pay rates  down at home in order to dump their goods on other markets  cheaply.    "Other countries could use antidumping [measures] because  our  wages are very low," said Cermak. But, he added, "That's our  biggest comparative advantage."</p>

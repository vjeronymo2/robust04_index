			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Ecu Bonds: Hopes for European monetary union fail to live up to their promise EVEN champions of the European currency unit are sounding a diffident note in their claims for the Ecu bond market in 1993. Above all, the market needs some proof that the process of European monetary union is back on track, according to Mr David Ovenden, Ecu product manager at J. P. Morgan Securities in London. While most traders are expecting an improvement on last year, few are nursing hopes that the market will regain the impetus of recent years, when its potential status as Europe's main bond market and the promise of seemingly limitless liquidity, attracted a large flow of institutional investment. It is widely agreed that the sweeping assumptions made about the likelihood of European monetary union pushed the market too far ahead of events, while competition for market share among financial intermediaries created an artificially high level of liquidity. The market's adjustment to Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last June and the subsequent turmoil within the exchange rate mechanism, caused heavy losses for investors and market participants, and a decline in liquidity, from which the market has not recovered. There are a number of issues of political concern to be settled, chief among them the need to accommodate Denmark following its rejection of the treaty and the failure of Denmark and the UK to ratify the treaty. If the treaty had been ratified by all 12 countries, the Ecu would have been frozen. Without that, there is a risk of recomposition in September 1994. Without ratification, many analysts believe that some form of monetary union will go ahead. 'I would still hang on to the belief that a group of currencies will move closer together . . . and that will require a currency other than the D-Mark,' said Mr Kit Juckes, an international economist at S. G. Warburg. Given this outlook, the Ecu market does offer 'an option on European unity, but it's not yet a desperately cheap one'. Other analysts take a more positive view. According to Credit Lyonnais, at current yield levels, 'Ecu bonds do not discount the possibility of the Ecu becoming the single European currency in any future monetary union. A problematic, delayed ratification process for the UK and Denmark is already discounted'. While the probability of two-speed monetary union has increased, this need not be negative for the Ecu, says Credit Lyonnais. While the crux of the market's problems lies on the demand side, the supply side is a cause for concern. The market's success in attracting institutional investors has been due in large part to the enthusiastic sponsorship of a number of European governments, which have set up programmes for issuing Ecu paper, even when terms were not always favourable. Last year's political problems over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty have caused a number of European governments to tone down their commitment to the Ecu. However, with many European governments facing growing financing needs as a result of the economic slowdown, they could welcome the chance to return to the Ecu market. Dealers are hoping that medium-sized deals for the likes of the UK, France, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in the early part of the year may help to stir investor interest. The change in the structure of the market is unlikely to be reversed, at least in the short-term. The market was vaunted as offering similar or better liquidity than Europe's largest government bond markets. The largest Ecu bonds were among the most actively traded bonds, and the commissions charged were lower than in many other markets. However, after the market's meltdown it became evident that much of that liquidity had been created not by investors but by traders. Mr Ovenden argues that investors in the large, high-quality bonds are still being serviced, although liquidity in smaller bonds for weaker credits has suffered. However, without the aggressive speculative activity by investment banks and securities houses trading on their own accounts, which is believed to have made up as much as 70 per cent of the market's turnover, the level of liquidity is likely to remain poor. At a meeting last month of ISMA's Ecu sub-committee, it was decided that it was too early to revert to a traditional style of marketmaking with compulsory bid/offer spreads. Without more confidence in the market's long-term liquidity, institutional investors, having been badly burnt, are unlikely to rush back to the market. Dealers say there are signs that some institutional investors are returning to the market, but Ecu bonds are viewed as a specialised investment, rather than an alternative to government bonds.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER WILL ASK ALLIES IF THEY ARE WILLING TO SHARE FIGHTING IN GULF;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: HIS MISSION ABROAD IS TO 'LAY THE FOUNDATION' FOR MILITARY ACTION IF  THE EMBARGO FAILS.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, starting a weeklong trip to the Persian  Gulf and Europe, said Saturday that he wants to find out if other members of  the international coalition will share the fighting if the confrontation with  Iraq escalates into war.  </P> <P> "We've got some questions we want to propound to some of our coalition  partners," Baker said. "We'd like to know under what conditions and subject to  what restraints they would be willing to consider certain types of actions.  </P> <P> "Some questions need to be answered if certain operations are going to be  considered."  </P> <P> He said the purpose of his talks with the leaders of seven nations and the  exiled government of Kuwait is to "lay the foundation" for military action to  drive Iraq out of Kuwait, should the U.N. trade embargo prove inadequate to do  the job.  </P> <P> Although Baker often cloaks his meaning in euphemisms, his comments to  reporters, made aboard his jet en route from Washington to a refueling stop in  Ireland, are the most direct indication so far that the Bush Administration is  actively discussing with its allies the terms for the use of military force in  the gulf.  </P> <P> "The overall purpose of this trip is to discuss with our coalition partners  strengthening the full range of measures that we have employed to isolate  (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein -- political measures, economic measures and  military measures -- and thereby lay the foundation for the possible future  exercise of all options," Baker said.  </P> <P> "This will improve the prospects for a peaceful resolution (of the crisis) and  at the same time permit us to be prepared to consider all the options if the  peaceful ones don't work," he added.  </P> <P> Baker's first meetings are set for today in Bahrain, the island nation off the  coast of Saudi Arabia that for more than 40 years has been the home port for  the American naval presence in the gulf.  </P> <P> Later, Baker will meet with kings, presidents and prime ministers in Saudi  Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Britain and France before returning to  Washington next Saturday.  </P> <P> Although Baker insisted that the United States hopes the trade embargo and  other political and economic measures will ultimately force Iraq to end its  occupation of Kuwait, he made it clear that Washington is not willing to wait  forever. U.S. officials have said that the embargo has begun to cause real  economic pain in Iraq but that Hussein appears able to hold out for months, if  not years.  </P> <P> Baker declined to give a time frame for U.S. action, but he said additional  steps are being considered "in the short term."  </P> <P> From a purely military standpoint, the United States apparently could initiate  combat with Iraq on its own. About two-thirds of the military personnel in the  international coalition are Americans. But Baker made it clear that the  Administration wants to make sure its allies will go along if war breaks out.  </P> <P> "The President has said on several occasions that in moving to deal with this  problem, he would like to maintain as much of the international consensus as he  can," Baker said. "His actions to date certainly make that very clear."  </P> <P> As part of the effort to maintain the consensus, Baker said the Administration  may ask the U.N. Security Council to specifically authorize the use of force --  although he said such a step is not necessary as a matter of international law.  He repeated the Administration's position that Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,  permitting "collective self-defense," provides all the authorization that would  be needed.  </P> <P> Baker said he will discuss the U.N. option with leaders of the four other  permanent members of the Security Council during this trip. He will visit the  Soviet Union, Britain and France, and he plans to meet with Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen in Cairo.  </P> <P> Some of the allies clearly are more eager to use force than others. For  instance, President Turgut Ozal of Turkey has said his country would  participate militarily against Iraq only if the action is specifically  authorized by the Security Council.  </P> <P> Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, would be invaluable in any  armed confrontation with Iraq because of its strategic location on Iraq's  northern border.  </P></p>

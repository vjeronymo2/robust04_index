			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / No reformist spring on Ukraine farms: Jill Barshay tests the political climate in the countryside before parliamentary elections on Sunday The only outspoken reformist candidate in Ukraine's poor farm village of Yaroslavka, who promised to privatise the land and let the collective farm workers sell their sugar beets and milk to whomever they wanted, died in a car accident recently. He was travelling the poor roads that link the 80 isolated, backward villages in his electoral district, 90 miles north east of Kiev. Of the district's seven remaining candidates in parliamentary elections next Sunday one is on the revived Communist party ticket and the other six are ex-party farm bosses or long-time local officials. Last September when Ukraine's first post-independence elections were called, western diplomats and Ukraine's opposition press thought they would be the mechanism that would at last remove the entrenched Soviet legacy that has steered Ukraine to hyperinflation, a severe energy crisis, plummeting output and monthly wages of less than Dollars 10. Now they are pessimistic. Yaroslavka is a typical Ukrainian village of 1,300 people, 70 per cent of them pensioners, whose lives are centered around the collective farm, formerly named Pro-Communism. People there do not easily trust new approaches even though their lives have lurched back to a primitive barter economy as the state is increasingly unable to provide. 'The old mentality lives on here,' says Mr Mykhailo Yarmolenko, a Soviet master welder who built atomic power stations abroad and has retired to his family's birthplace. 'People still expect the collective farm director to provide everything from roofing to their kids' lunches. They don't see another way.' Horse-drawn ploughs are used more and more as tractors break down. There are no replacement parts to be found. Public transport to the city was cut off a year ago. Candles are used more to cope with frequent blackouts which last for days. The single general goods store has been closed for weeks because there are no goods. Personal backyard plots of beets and berries are the main source of security for their families' meals. Instead of using Ukraine's worthless currency (Dollars 1 gets you 39,000 karbovanets), home produce is bartered through informal networks of city friends and family who can bring matches or a warm sweater on a visit. Mr Yarmolenko uses his welding skills for his contribution to the collective farm. The chairman wanted to pay him. ''What money?' I said,' recounts Mr Yarmolenko. 'Give me a sack of flour instead for my wife to make blini (pancakes).' Centuries of serfdom and starvation, whose apex was the artificial famine of the 1930s which wiped out 7m Ukrainian peasants, have made them a stoic lot, who expect little of their government and are good at devising private strategies for survival. They distrust radical change, preferring the devil they know. 'I just don't believe that private farmers can feed the country,' says head of the village council, Hryhori Boretz, a life-time communist official, 'Only the state can provide the kind of massive investment our farm needs. A lone farmer couldn't do it by himself with just a horse and a plough.' In this village, only two farmers have taken advantage of Ukraine's private land law to get their own farms. 'There are not enough young people to take risks and responsibility,' says Andrii Bezlyudny, who is in charge of the collective farm's animal breeding and mechanisation. (The collective farm's head was off on one of his regular trips to Kiev to beg for fuel needed for spring planting.) 'Right now all the bureaucrats are in charge of the processing factories where we send our grain and milk. They don't have any money to pay us, but they won't let go either because they'd be out of a job. They live off these factories.' On the front line of his farm's problems Mr Bezlyudny believes everything needs to be privatised, from the processing plants down. He is hoping for a new parliament. Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

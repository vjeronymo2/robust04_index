			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hsu Yun-teng (1776 0061 7506) from </F> Shenzhen: "Customs Inpsection Line Moved Back to the Second Line  to Make Way for Building of a Large Bonded Area"]    [Text] Authorities concerned confirmed that Shenzhen will  become the mainland's largest bonded area pursuing a Hong  Kong-style free-trade policy after 1997, when Luohu Customs  (first line) will be moved back to the site of the current  second line, effectively extending the special economic zone  from the present 327 to 2,020 sq m, to boost the reserve  strength for the development of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.    Sources say the Shenzhen City CPC Committee has drawn up an  outline of the idea, to which Deng Xiaoping responded: "Must Do  (go ahead)!"    Jiang Zemin, mainland state president and CPC general  secretary, and State Council Premier Li Peng also agreed to the  concept.    By this concept, after 1997, people with Shenzhen permanent  residency and a permit issued by a local policing unit can  travel freely into and out of Luohu Customs. Foreign goods  shipped in through Luohu Customs will not count as imports and  will be exempted from import duties (except a few commodities  such as tobacco and wine). In Shenzhen, mainland people can  catch a glimpse of trade commodities from all over the world.  Similarly, mainland domestic products shipped from the Shenzhen  Special Economic Zone will not be seen as exports. Foreign  businessmen will have a chance to observe trade in all good  domestically made products in Shenzhen.    Shenzhen hopes to become a "365-day, forever open Guangzhou  trade fair."    The outline, described as a "choice that spans the  centuries," forecasts that by 2010 ,Shenzhen's per-capita GDP  will reach $70,000, more than Shanghai's $30,000, Taiwan's  $40,000, and Singapore's $60,000. The 1.2 billion mainland  population will throw their weight behind the program to push  Shenzhen ahead of the four Asian little dragons in 2010.    The $70,000 is the result of calculations on the World  Bank's  price parity theory (PPP) on four types of purchasing powers,  not a lone estimate by the mainland.    The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone currently occupies 327 sq  m. There is 160 sq m of land worth development, 100 of which are  under actual development. Land use rights over the remaining 60  sq m has been transferred with compensation.    The trend shows weak reserve strength for the Shenzhen  Special Economic Zone to sustain future development and the  necessity of incorporating Baoan and Longgang Districts into the  special zone, adding another 1,700 sq m of land.    However, there must be effective measures for operations  against smuggling and personnel movement management in the  future, or there will be a series of problems.    To abide by the general principle of "Hong Kong ruled by  Hong  Kong people," after 1997, the 3 million Shenzhen population will  remain excluded from elections in Hong Kong. There is still a  difference between "Hong Kong people" and "Shenzhen people."  Only thus can Beijing keep its word to the whole world.    The idea of building a large bonded area was floated when  Shenzhen discovered that there were no longer any preferential  policies to speak of in the first special economic zone with the  opening up of the entire mainland; also there had been talk of  converging with Hong Kong with the approach of 1997.    Shenzhen was the second local government to raise such an  idea. Hainan Province once suggested the concept of a "special  customs area," which was shelved and finally rejected by Beijing  last year.    Shenzhen officials stated that improvement of zone border  management must start right away. It will take into account the  experience of Hong Kong and bonded areas around the world, study  it, draft relevant ordinances and policies, while picking the  Shatoujiao and Futian bonded areas to undergo pilot projects in  preparation for modern, international cities, experiences gained  there will be popularized.    In fact, Shenzhen has started arranging for this year's  investment "basket," which is leaning toward water, electricity,  land transport, and communication and expanding resource  allocations for ports, airports, highways, and high-speed  railroads.</p>

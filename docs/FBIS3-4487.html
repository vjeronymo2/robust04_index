			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 30 March (AFP)--North Korea is playing a  dangerous game of brinksmanship in its nuclear stand-off with  the West, and China's role is crucial in defusing the crisis,  Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Wednesday.    "The worry is whether or not they are capable of carrying  out  feats of brinksmanship without stumbling over," Evans said here  ahead of a week-long visit to China.    "It may be that they just want diplomatic gains and economic  gains," he said. "If that is so, they ought to be achievable  without raising the stakes to the level to which they have been  raised so far."    Evans told reporters that he would discuss North Korea with  Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen -- "my friend and colleague" --  when they meet in Beijing.    He declined to say what specific ideas he might discuss with  Qian, but he stressed that China had an "extremely important"  role to play in convincing North Korea to accept international  inspection of its nuclear facilities.    "They do probably know more about what's going on in North  Korea than anybody else -- and they have a greater capacity than  anybody else in the world to influence North Korea," he said.    "I am sure that the last thing on earth that the Chinese  want  is to see the North Koreans acquiring a nuclear capability ...  and an erosion of the credibility and integrity of the nuclear  non- proliferation process," he added.    North Korea, the world's last hardline Stalinist state, is  alleged to be developing nuclear weapons as it continues  blocking inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) of what it insists are non-military nuclear installations.    Many analysts suspect it is using the nuclear issue as a  lever to win diplomatic recognition and economic support from  Western nations, particuarly the United States, which remains  South Korea's main ally.    Australia has a special interest as it chairs the IAEA, the  nuclear watchdog responsible for inspecting the North Korean  facilities.    The issue is liable to overtake human rights concerns in  China during Evans' trip, although he stressed that he will be  taking up such topics as jailed dissidents and repression in  Tibet.    "We'd like to see some significant gains made... Human  rights these days are everybody's business," he said.    But earlier, Evans was taken aback when he was asked at an  Asia Society luncheon what he might do in Beijing for the  release of Sydney businessman James Peng, jailed without charge  in China for the past 5-1/2 months.    "I will seek a brief on that particular matter," he said,  without elaborating.    Peng is being held in Shenzhen city, adjacent to Hong Kong,  in connection with a business dispute. Australian diplomats are  able to see him only three minutes per month.    In his speech to the luncheon, Evans argued for a  "pragmatic"  approach over human rights.    "Very often, particularly in Asian contexts, quiet dialogue  and persuasion -- systematically pursued -- will give better  results than drum-beating," the senator said.    He also reaffirmed support for Governor Chris Patten's  democratic reforms for Hong Kong -- despite the lukewarm  endorsement given earlier this year by Prime Minister Paul  Keating when Patten visited Australia.    China has bitterly opposed Patten's reforms, pledging to  scrap them immediately after taking back the British colony in  1997.    But Evans told reporters that in his view, the Sino-British  row over Hong Kong is "rather a lot to do about little. China  should be prepared to take a deep breath and accept these  relatively modest changes."</p>

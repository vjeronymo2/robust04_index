			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 8 (ATA) -- The leaders of Albanian  parliamentary parties were pronounced today on Radio Tirana on  the Greek veto for blocking the assistance worth 35 million ECU,  which European Union has granted to Albania.    The chairman of Democratic Party, Eduard Selami, considered  the veto "as an irresponsible attitude of Greek Government,"  which is part of "others non-friendly ones and not in favour of  Albania." Mr. Selami expressed his hope "in the Greek moderate  part" and considered the veto mechanism by Greece as "an abusive  act." The leader of the democrats, who have the majority in the  parliament, expressed his readiness for dialogue, but pointed  out that "they (Greeks) should react seriously, if they are for  dialogue and for the positive solution of these problems."    The chairman of Social Democratic Party, Mr. Skender  Gjinushi, considered as "unacceptable" the attitude of Greek  Government, "above all, now that Albania is experiencing the  transitional period." Mr. Gjinushi pointed out that the idea of  non-respecting the rights of Greek minority in Albania "is  groundless" and said that the Greek Government should reflect on  this issue. The social democratic leader also requested the  continuation of the dialogue with the Greek side.    Mr. Sabri Godo, the leader of the republicans, said that the  blocking of the funds by Greece "is a resentment of Balkanic  style, which was not expected by Papandreou government, who is a  statesman with broad culture." Mr. Godo pointed out "that  Greece is not paying, but Europe is."    While deputy chairman of Socialist Party, Mr. Servet  Pellumbi, considered the blocking of 35 million ECU as an act of  the European Union and not Greece and demanded that "all of us  should reflect" upon this issue because "it looks like Europe  has serious remarks on the respect of its European standards in  Albania."    Deputy chairman of the Human Rights Party, Mr. Kosta  Makariadhi, said that "there are some requirements, which should  be respected by the countries, that require aid from European  Union," among which he mentioned the honouring of the human  rights. According to him "there are flagrant violations of  human rights in Albania."</p>

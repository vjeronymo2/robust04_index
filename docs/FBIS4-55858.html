			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 21 May (TANJUG) -- The Skopje air base  Petrovec will soon become a mostly civilian airport. At a  meeting with the president 20 May, representatives of the  Macedonian Transport and Defense Ministries agreed that two out  of three airstrips will be used for civilian purposes -- one for  passenger and the other for cargo air traffic. After the  departure of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], the Petrovec air  base was mostly taken over by the army of the recently formed  state. This impeded development of civilian air traffic, while  the military section of the airport was insufficiently  exploited. Modernization plans have been announced for next  year, primarily the reconstruction of the runway and signaling  system.</p>

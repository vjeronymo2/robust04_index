			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Stolen computers head east PERSONAL computers, fax machines and photocopiers are being stolen on an organised basis in northern England to feed shortages in eastern Europe, police believe. Secondhand markets have collapsed in Britain because of price cutting by manufacturers. Greater Manchester police say eastern Europe appears to be the only place where the returns justify the risks of large-scale crime. Organised theft of office equipment was identified last year when Bradford police used a computer to search for patterns of crime. They found that Pounds 1.57m of office equipment had been stolen in the city in the previous 12 months. Typical insurance claims after a raid are more than Pounds 10,000. Thieves go to elaborate lengths, often posing as service or removal specialists to raid offices. Greater Manchester police have approached Customs and Excise to see if manifests and bills of lading can be checked for stolen computers and other electronic office equipment being shipped to eastern Europe. Detective Chief Inspector Ian Martin said he was applying for Pounds 1,000 from the Home Office's Safer Cities crime prevention campaign to buy a branding iron with an interchangeable head. Police will then be able to visit offices and brand a company's postcode into the plastic fascia of expensive equipment. 'This will make it easier to check goods being offered at car boot sales, auctions or exported,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Vietnam War veterans on Wednesday criticized director Brian DePalma's new  anti-war movie "Casualties of War," saying it falsely depicts American soldiers  as rapists and incompetents. In a news conference at the Army-Navy Club in  Washington, John Wheeler, president of the Center for the Vietnam Generation,  said the Columbia film "causes a lot of pain to vets and to those who love them  . . . by using false stereotypes." "Casualties of War," co-starring Michael J.  Fox and Sean Penn, opened Aug. 18 to some rave reviews. The film is based on a  1969 book and New Yorker magazine article about a patrol of American GIs who  kidnap, rape and murder a South Vietnamese girl in 1966. Peggy Siegal,  DePalma's press representative, said the director had no comment, but added he  "made an anti-war film and they were all casualties of that war."

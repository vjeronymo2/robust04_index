			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark continues to gain The D-Mark once again commanded attention on foreign exchange markets yesterday, where Thursday's money supply figures from Germany continued to hold sway over traders. The German M3 statistics, which revealed that money supply had risen by 9.7 per cent in March, have convinced traders that no interest rate cut is likely in Germany in the near future. According to Mr Neil Mac-Kinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, market sentiment was dominated by those figures throughout the day. 'It is likely that the Bundesbank will resist pressure for an interest rate cut at this weekend's G7 meeting,' he said. 'And many are worried that they will actually increase rates.' As a result, the D-Mark ended up against both the dollar and sterling. In London, it closed at DM1.6505 against the dollar, a cent up compared to its previous close of DM1.6605. Against sterling, the D-Mark ended at DM2.9250 after a previous close of DM2.9300. D-Mark strength apart, the dollar had its own reasons for a weak performance on markets yesterday. Some traders said that dollar support had been partly undermined by a growing frustration with the pace of US recovery, with many traders hedging their bets until an important series of US economic indicators are published next week. In London, the pound ended at Dollars 1.7720, compared to a previous close of Dollars 1.7650. In yen-dollar trading, dealers seemed unwilling to take any bets on the possible outcome of this weekend's G7 summit in Washington. In London, the dollar ended almost unchanged against at Y134.55. 'The market is taking the G7 with a pinch of salt,' said Mr MacKinnon of Yamaichi. He recalled that, before the Garden City G7 summit in January, there had been speculation on a deal to prop up the yen. Nothing came of it, however, and dealers did not want to be caught out a second time. In early New York trading, the dollar moved up slightly from a lower opening. It was at DM1.617 up from 1.6485 at the opening. Sterling's weakness against the D-Mark came despite some encouraging indicators on the UK economy. Sluggish high street sales before the UK election were disappointing, though Britain's current account deficit at Pounds 575m in March was in line with expectations. The market chose to ignore these figures, feeling that German economic issues were all-important. Sterling could not withstand a surge in the franc, which resumed its place third from bottom in the EMS grid after France announced a FFr1.4bn trade surplus for March, far higher than forecast. Sterling ended at FFr9.8825 compared to a previous close of FFr9.8925.</p>

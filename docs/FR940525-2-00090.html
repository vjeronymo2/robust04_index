The Optimization Program is a computer program developed by an independent third party and utilized by BFM pursuant to a license agreement. Various such programs are commercially available. BFM represents that the ability to exercise discretion for the operation of the Optimization Program is limited. BFM selects the Optimization Program, selects and weighs the strategic themes used at any point in time in the Stock Evaluation Process, and develops certain mathematical models used as data for the Optimization Program. Once installed, the Optimization Program typically remains in place without material change for a lengthy period of time (2 to 10 years). While the strategic themes and mathematical models are changed more frequently, they usually remain unchanged for approximately 12 months. BFM states that the Optimization Program operates in an automatic fashion and that actions within BFM's discretionary control (e.g. changing its strategic themes or changing the mathematical models used in its stock rankings for the Stock Evaluation Process) will not generate direct cross-trade transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. BFM uses the Optimization Program on a daily basis to examine all equity securities in the applicable universe and to determine the specific equity securities, if any, to be purchased for each Account in order to achieve the optimal portfolio for that Account. Each universe is developed by BFM as part of the Stock Evaluation Process and is uniform for all Accounts for which that particular universe is relevant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in the context of domestic equity securities, BFM determines the universe of securities to be considered for potential investment as part of the Stock Evaluation Process. The universe for domestic equity clients currently consists of all U.S. publicly-traded common stocks, excluding any such stock which has a market capitalization of less than $50 million. BFM states that this domestic equity securities universe, which includes several thousand stocks, is identical for all of BFM's domestic equity Accounts unless certain restrictions are imposed by the Independent Account Representative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to domestic equity Accounts, BFM uses the Optimization Program to examine data on foreign equity securities for Accounts that have designated investment objectives which permit such securities for their portfolios. At the present time, the potential universe of securities for such Accounts would include equity securities listed on exchanges in the following countries: Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada; Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Hong Kong; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Malaysia; Mexico; Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Singapore; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; and the United Kingdom. BFM states that these are the countries which today have sufficiently developed securities markets (including adequate data on the exchange-traded securities) to permit use of the Optimization Program for the Accounts. BFM represents that the two-part investment process (i.e. the Stock Evaluation Process and the Portfolio Construction Process) operates in substantially the same manner for foreign equity securities as it does for domestic equity securities. In all cases involving either domestic or foreign equity securities, the Independent Account Representative for each Account will determine which universe is relevant for the Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent there are any equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account by reason of one of the triggering events, the Optimization Program will include the equity securities in its analysis of all available equity securities in a particular universe, taking into account the lower transaction costs available for cross-trade transactions involving such securities. However, BFM states that the opportunity for a cross-trade will not influence the Optimization Program's analysis and determination as to whether such securities should be bought or sold for an Account except to the extent transaction costs are lower. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

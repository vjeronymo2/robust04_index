			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / BA says Pounds 9m offer was off agenda BRITISH AIRWAYS' original offer of Pounds 9m to end the 'dirty tricks' dispute with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group was off the table in the latest round of attempted mediation, Mr Robert Ayling, group managing director of British Airways, said last night. He said after the collapse of the mediation attempt by Sir Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, that he believed the dispute with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic could be resolved amicably. BA was was still prepared to resolve its dispute with Virgin, 'but not at any price'. 'I don't fear the issue being resolved through the courts but it is in the interest of both parties to try to resolve it amicably,' he said. He confirmed that Mr Chataway had visited Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, three weeks ago and had offered to act as honest broker to try to resolve the dispute. Sir Colin had made clear from the outset that BA's original Pounds 9m compensation offer made last March was off the table, Mr Ayling said. 'Christopher managed to bring us together on some points that have separated us,' Mr Ayling said, adding that all the discussions were conducted through Mr Chataway with Sir Colin and Mr Branson having no direct meeting. The original Pounds 9m compensation offer made by BA last March collapsed because Virgin rejected what it regarded was an unacceptable 'gagging clause' demanded by BA to settle the 'dirty tricks' dispute. In the latest negotiations the gagging clause was changed in what Mr Ayling described as 'an intelligent way'. It was dropped for a 'gentleman's agreement' on the part of Mr Branson not to rake up the events of the past. The reason why BA decided to withdraw its original Pounds 9m offer was that Pounds 5m of that amount involved a long-standing aircraft maintenance dispute between the two airlines which was already under arbitration. Since then, the arbitration process had made some headway and BA felt the engineering dispute should now be left to arbitration. But Mr Ayling claimed Virgin made clear at the end of last week that it was Pounds 9m or nothing.</p>

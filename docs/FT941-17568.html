			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Letter to Bank of Spain governor The following is the text of a letter, dated December 27 1993, from Mr Roberto G. Mendoza, vice-chairman of JP Morgan, to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain. Dear Mr Governor, In connection with discussions I understand that you have had with D Mario Conde, chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito, I am writing to confirm that: 1. J P Morgan has assisted Banesto in developing a plan to deal with certain accounting and asset quality issues; fully supports both the spirit and particulars of the plan; and believes that it can be implemented successfully; 2. Subject to market conditions, J P Morgan intends to lead manage the underwriting of a Dollars 400m convertible subordinated debt issue for Banesto during the second quarter of 1994 and believes that, following the announcement of Banesto's plan and related charges, the issue should be successful; 3. J P Morgan believes that, if necessary, Banesto could sell half of its stake (or approximately 25 per cent of the outstanding shares) in Banco Totta y Acores during the first or second quarter of 1994 and J P Morgan would be pleased, subject to market conditions, to lead manage the underwriting of the sale of such stake; and 4. J P Morgan supports Banesto's current management and believes that Banesto's prospects for future profitability are strong. J P Morgan has assisted Banesto in developing a written presentation of its plan, and this. . . has been reviewed by the senior management of J P Morgan in our role as financial adviser to Banesto. I would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a copy of that presentation and to discuss with you in person why J P Morgan believes Banesto's proposed plan is feasible and in the best interests of Banesto, its shareholders and the Spanish banking system.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Raise your glasses to clean water Anglian Water is hoping to benefit from tough European Community rules on water purity by meeting the demand for cost-effective technology to remove pesticides from drinking water supplies. The UK water group, which operates in a largely agricultural area and has developed particular expertise in removing contaminants, has set up a joint venture with Humphreys &amp; Glasgow International, a subsidiary of US-based Enserch. The 50:50 joint venture company, Anglian H&amp;G, will market its technology in the use and regeneration of granular activated carbon (GAC), which until now has been used mainly to improve the taste and colour of drinking water. But researchers have discovered that GAC is effective in absorbing pesticides, herbicides and other contaminants in the water supply. It works by attracting and capturing the molecules of contaminants in millions of tiny holes. One of the biggest challenges which Anglian and H&amp;G have addressed is how to ensure that the GAC is replenished before it becomes saturated and stops working. A separate research and development programme undertaken by Anglian with Severn Trent Water has produced a reliable method for removing the spent carbon from a filtration plant and regenerating it in a furnace for recycling. H&amp;G has built a pilot plant for Anglian and Severn Trent Water at Grafham near Huntingdon which is capable of handling 10 tonnes of GAC a day. Jim Peddie, managing director of Anglian Water Commercial Developments, estimates that in the UK alone there is a need for 10 plants of this size. Over the next few years drinking water throughout Europe must meet standards laid down by the EC which set a maximum admissible concentrations (Mac) for a range of contaminants. The new pesticide Mac requires less than 0.1 micrograms per litre compared with the old rules before 1989 which allowed up to 30 micrograms per litre.</p>

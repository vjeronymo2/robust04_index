			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibolya Veres: "Bekesi: If the Prime Minister Is </F> an Economic Expert, There Is No Need for a Deputy"]    [Text] With the approach of the government change, the  question whether there will be an main economic ministry is  becoming increasingly more important. What kind of  reorganizations are the party that was victorious at the  elections planning for the economic ministries? It makes a  difference whether the government begins its operation by  establishing a new state administration structure -- which takes  quite some time -- or if it keeps the existing structure. We  interviewed Laszlo Bekesi, the number one economic expert for  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], on this issue.    It is very important to have an economic policy center. It  has to be achieved that the spheres of authority for  decision-making and preparation do not clash, which requires a  suitable institutional structure, Bekesi said. He considers the  current system untenable because the spheres of authority are  fragmented between the Office of the Prime Minister, the Finance  Ministry, and sometimes the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations, or the Industry and Agriculture Ministries.  According to Bekesi, all this is not satisfactory and, instead,  integration is the main goal.    In his view, a threefold structure is needed. Based on the  Finance Ministry, an main economic ministry has to be  established to governs the macro-processes, the balancing  processes, medium and long-term strategies, economic  integration, and state finances. The finance minister who heads  this ministry also has to be the leader of the economic cabinet.  Bekesi believes that the view that the Finance Ministry should  be turned into an office solely for tax and budget affairs does  not correspond to the current Hungarian situation. This might  be the future way, but it cannot be implemented at the moment,  Bekesi claims. Should the finance minister responsible for  economic control also fulfill the function of deputy prime  minister? In Bekesi's view, this depends on whether the prime  minister is an economic expert. If he is, then there is no need  for the finance minister to be a deputy prime minister at the  same time. However, if the prime minister is not an economic  expert then the finance minister responsible for the economy  must also be a deputy prime minister.    Another ministry will have to deal with the tasks of the  economic branches, governing the real economic processes, market  protection, concrete foreign economic relations, and technical  development. This ministry has to be established on the basis of  the current Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, by merging  the Industry and Trade Ministry and some sections of the  National Technical Development Committee [OMFB], Bekesi claims.    The third economic ministry will have to fulfill diverse  tasks in the areas of infrastructure and regional-development,  Bekesi believes.</p>

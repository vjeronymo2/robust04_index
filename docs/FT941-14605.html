			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Second line stocks surge as rate hopes revive - Market report Renewed confidence in prospects for an early cut in UK base rates, buttressed by strength in British government bonds and in the short sterling futures contract, brought further gains in equities in London yesterday. The focus for demand again lay among the market's second line and smaller capitalised stocks, where investors sought to identify the earnings prospects which have largely been assimilated in market ratings on the Footsie's 100 listed issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index bounded ahead by 64.5 points to yet another new high of 4,013.3. Technical factors remained very important in equities, with the shortage of stock which has plagued the blue chips shifting to the smaller capitalised stocks. Having been obliged to sell stock to eager investors in the morning, marketmakers then had the almost impossible task of finding stock for future delivery. Comfortable assumptions that base rate cuts would be held back until spring were suddenly challenged as sterling moved higher against the German D-Mark. Confidence in the UK bond market built considerably towards the close on the announcement that the planned bond auction would be smaller than expected. The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed just under its best with a gain of 29.2 at 3,437, within nine points of the level reached earlier this month but still 25 points under the all-time high of late December. But the pace of advance in the Footsie 100 Index has been outstripped by that of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index this week as investors, both institutional and private, have sought out companies likely to benefit from further economic recovery, and for share prices in which these prospects are not yet fully reflected. High valuations of prospective earnings in the UK market have unsettled some investors. Traders pointed out that the Footsie may now be at the top of its latest trading range. A survey of the distributive sector published yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry indicated successful retail sales over Christmas and the new year, underlining the progress of economic recovery. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull commented that that the strength of sterling now provides the chief justification for a base rate cut. Interest rate hopes will be challenged this morning by publication of the retail price index (RPI) and also the official retail sales data for last month. The stock market is expecting a year on year RPI gain of 3 per cent, and a similar retail sales gain of perhaps 2.4 per cent. Gains in excess of either of these predictions will raise the spectre of inflation. The stress on second line stocks was indicated by market volume details showing that non-Footsie stocks made up around 68 per cent of yesterday's total of 964.9m shares through the Seaq network. Monday's Seaq volume of 808.1m shares was worth Pounds 1.59bn at retail level. Equities closed in confident mood, with sterling's strength failing to upset the blue chip export stocks, and Wall Street helping London with a gain of 5.07 Dow points in early trading. Media stocks stood out, with the Pounds 292m agreed bid for Anglia keeping the domestic TV sector on the alert. Our report on Monday morning that BZW, the UK investment bank, had raised its year-end Footsie forecast to 3,900 was incorrect; BZW's forecast remains at 3,600.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Religious Party [NRP] has submitted a  motion of no confidence in the government over the decision to  evict yeshiva students from the ancient Jericho synagogue. The  case involves a building the Civil Administration plans to  renovate and open to the public as an archaeological site.    Knesset Member Hanan Porat, one of the initiators behind the  motion, says the prime minister has told his aides that he does  not want the yeshiva to remain on that site under autonomy.  Members of the improvised Jericho yeshiva have decided to guard  the place in shifts in a bid to prevent eviction by the Army.  This was reported by our correspondent Ron Nesi'el.</p>

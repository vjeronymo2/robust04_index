			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Romanian President  Ion Iliescu, back from a visit to East Asia today, said Romania  is paying close attention to changes in China which is heading  toward a market economy.    He told reporters at the airport that during his last two  days of visit in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, he  saw great potential in the already remarkable economic growth  there.    Iliescu said the province's two cities of Shenzhen and  Zhuhai  are among the strongest of China's economy, and that they have  transformed themselves from poor country villages to modern  cities in 15 years.    He said the inflow of foreign capital into the area has  greatly contributed to the development there.    The president, who had visited South Korea before making a  stop in Guangdong, pointed out that the Asia-Pacific region is  leading the world's economic growth.    His visit to the region will help Romania make its own  opening policy, he added.</p>

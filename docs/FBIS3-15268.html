			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian  Government, delivered an analytical report on the state of the  country's economy and the prospects for its development at an  expanded meeting of the government in the Kremlin today. He  said that the government totally shares the provisions of the  message from President Boris Yeltsin to the Federal Assembly:    [Begin Chernomyrdin recording] The crisis has affected not  only those sectors which were forecast to suffer the greatest  reduction in production but also those which produce products  which are, in principle, competitive and consumer goods which  are in demand. In these conditions it is evident that the  question can no longer be put simply in terms of more money or  less money. It is clear that without a sufficiently tough  financial and monetary policy it will not be possible to achieve  anything, just as it has not been possible in other countries.  But it seems that it will hardly be possible to radically  improve the state of affairs in the country using only this  means.    The government today has great responsibility for the course  of the reforms, for what they will cost millions of people, for  the political temperature of the young Russian democracy which  is undergoing a complicated time of its self-determination both  in the country and in the world as a whole.    I cannot today avoid mentioning a problem which is extremely  important for me, personally and for the government which I  head. What is at issue is that of late in some of the mass media  a noisy campaign has been unleashed with the aim of proving that  the chairman of the government is allegedly concentrating power,  that he is taking too much onto himself in order to get himself  onto the presidential chair. Even some polls have begun to be  held on this theme. Let me say honestly and frankly that I am  not one of those clever people who can do everything who are  prepared to ascend in one leap from being head of a laboratory  to being a minister, deputy minister or premier or even at times  president.    I must say in the first place that Russia is not a racing  car, which you can get into, go for a spin and get out of again;  and after this the whole country trembles like in a fever.  Second, I consider that it is impermissible and simply idiotic  to have any discussion about the presidency while we have an  existing president. We have one nationwide leader, elected by  the whole people and I do not intend to intrigue against him. I  am not like that.    Third, some people, including some of you, are making vain  attempts to drive a wedge between the president and the chairman  of the government, trying to cause trouble between us, and this  will not succeed. It is futile to try.    Today, accord is needed by all of us, by all branches of  power, by all leaders, no matter what posts they occupy. Accord  is needed by the whole people. [end recording]</p>

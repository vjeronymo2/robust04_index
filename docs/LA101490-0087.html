			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DEVELOPMENT PERILS WILDLIFE, STUDY SAYS'  </P> <P> The wanton desecration that Tony Moiso has planned for Arroyo Trabuco will  steal from every Orange County resident our greatest inheritances and  treasures.  </P> <P> With thousands of acres of undeveloped land, we would hope that he could muster  enough restraint to set back a few hundred feet to preserve this pristine  natural habitat.  </P> <P> And now if the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors cannot be  trusted to stop the pillaging of these beautiful wild lands, then it is clear  that they have no intentions of protecting any of Orange County.  </P> <P> Indeed, Santa Margarita brags to be "Where the West Begins Again." I submit  that it may have to be labeled "Where the West Ends Forever."  </P> <P> BRUCE CONN  </P> <P> Trabuco Canyon  </P></p>

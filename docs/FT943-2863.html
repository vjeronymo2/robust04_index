			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Radler faces a Chicago challenge  -The Hollinger chief's task at a top US newspaper Mr David Radler, who is Conrad Black's right hand man in his international newspaper empire, sits in the publisher's suite at the Chicago Sun-Times ticking off his cost-cutting plans for the city's second-largest newspaper. 'Aside from already announced lay-offs and buy-outs there's another Dollars 7m to Dollars 10m of non-salaried expenses which we'll be able to carve out,' he says. Mr Radler, chief operating officer of Canadian-based Hollinger Group, hopes to double the Chicago paper's profit margins to 14 per cent, or about Dollars 30m, within the next two years. Last year the Sun-Times earned Dollars 19m, a margin of 7.5 per cent. He will be helped by a general recovery in the US economy and a cyclical rise in newspaper advertising lineage. Squeezing profits out of the Sun-Times, the US's ninth-largest newspaper, is a key component in Hollinger's expansion strategy. The Chicago newspaper became Hollinger's long sought-after US flagship in March, when American Publishing, Hollinger's US subsidiary, bought it and 61 affiliated suburban Chicago publications from a syndicate of private investors for Dollars 180m. The Sun-Times acquisition more than doubled American Publishing's revenues, and puts the group in a key urban US market for the first time. APC owns more than 340 newspapers, but most of them are small-town dailies or weeklies scattered across the US. It also controls the Jerusalem Post. The Chicago paper is perceived as a cash-generating machine that will finance other US acquisitions. APC used the purchase to raise Dollars 100m in a public share offering two months after buying the Sun-Times, being careful to reserve all voting rights for Hollinger. But there was nothing specific about the Chicago market that attracted Hollinger to the Sun-Times. 'We've tried to buy other papers,' Mr Radler said, referring to Hollinger's widely publicised bid for the New York Daily News in 1992, 'but we were unsuccessful'. The dogged search for dispensable expenses has shaken the Sun-Times from the pressroom to the boardroom. The paper's general manager, chief financial officer and controller departed shortly after American Publishing took hold, and the long-time Sun-Times publisher Mr Sam McKeel retired on July 31. A new publisher (the equivalent of a chief executive) has not been named, but Mr Radler, who is based in Vancouver and is looking for an apartment in Chicago, says he will move into Mr McKeel's old office when he finds the time. Among the rank-and-file, more than 50 employees have left or been laid off since March. Insiders say at least 100 Sun-Times employees will have left by December. American Publishing aims to trim the Sun-Times' 1,500-person staff by 200 during its first two years of ownership. However, cutting costs at the Sun-Times has not been easy. The syndicate that sold the Sun-Times to the Hollinger group bought it from Rupert Murdoch in a leveraged buy-out in 1983. That deal left the paper laden with debt and with little cash for technology improvements, promotion, or wage increases. Unlike the London Daily Telegraph, which Hollinger turned around smartly after buying it in 1987, the Sun-Times is produced by a slim staff (labour accounts for only 35 per cent of costs) and its 35-cent daily cover price is already 15 cents below its rival, the Chicago Tribune, limiting opportunities for a price-based circulation war. 'This is not Fleet Street, not in terms of management or technology,' says Mr Radler. 'The Telegraph was a 1940s newspaper. The Sun-Times is a 1970s paper,' he says. One of Mr Radler's concerns is replacing the Sun-Time's elderly presses with technology that will print colour advertising supplements and employ fewer pressmen. The upgrade is expected to cost Dollars 75m to Dollars 80m. He is also faced with difficult labour talks with the guild representing the paper's 265 newsroom employees over pay. The current three-year contract expires on September 31 and negotiations are at a standstill. Mr Radler shrugs off the possibility of a strike, saying neither side wants one, while noting that Hollinger readily weathered a 62-day strike at its Quebec City newspaper last year. Hollinger's purchase, however, should engender confidence that Chicago will remain a two-newspaper town. 'Chicago is a good city,' says Mr Radler. 'Its competitive, but we're confident about doing business here.'</p>

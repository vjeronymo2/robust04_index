			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> After pressure by civil rights groups, the head of the all-white club that  plays host to the Masters golf tournament said he hopes the club will invite  its first black member this year.  </P> <P> "That is our hope, yes," said Hord Hardin, chairman of Augusta National Golf  Club.  </P> <P> "We haven't completed the procedures we normally follow yet, but it certainly  is our desire that we will do it. I have every reason to believe that we will."  </P> <P> Augusta National has not had a black member since it was founded by Bobby Jones  in 1932. But the club recently came under pressure to integrate after similar  protests against the all-white Shoal Creek Country Club in Alabama that is  scheduled to play host to next month's PGA championship.  </P> <P> Last week, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference threatened to lead an  advertising boycott against the Masters next year if Augusta National continues  to exclude blacks.  </P></p>

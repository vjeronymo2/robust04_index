			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Rival bids emerge in coal sell-off THE PROSPECT of a split among British Coal employees over how to mount a buy-out of the company emerged yesterday as the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and East Midlands Electricity confirmed plans to form a bidding consortium. The British Association of Colliery Management had earlier announced its plans to purchase the company. Mr John Meads, general secretary, said last night that rivalry would be 'unfortunate'. But he stressed that the ultimate aim must be to preserve as much of British Coal as possible. The UDM and East Midlands consortium is preparing plans for a buy-out that would include a 20 per cent stake for employees. The consortium would be willing to bid for the whole company, but would consider other structures if the government preferred to break it up. One preference would be to split British Coal into two equal sizes with a mix of deep and open-cast mining. BACM believes British Coal should be sold as one piece to give it a viable structure. East Midlands and the UDM, who have been working on their plans for a year, have established a steering group which includes Sir David White, deputy chairman of the National Freight Corporation, itself the subject of a successful buy-out in the early 1980s. Others members are Mr Dickson Mabon, energy minister in the last Labour government, and Mr George Guise, former director of Consolidated Gold Fields and adviser to Lady Thatcher. The consortium hopes to attract two or three other members and is engaged in talks with companies in mining production and equipment supply industries. The government has said it wants privatisation to lead to an employee stake in the business. Public money will be available to help employees put together buy-out proposals. Lex, Page 22</p>

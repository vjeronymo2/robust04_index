			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHING EVOLUTION  </P> <P> (State Supt. of Public Instruction) Bill Honig is to be commended for his  change of position regarding the teaching of evolution. I also agree that we  should not withhold scientific facts from our children, but let's be sure we  teach all sides of the issue -- those things that are proven facts along with  those that remain theories. To say that evolution in total is a fact is just  not a true statement.  </P> <P> HERBERT H. LEWIS  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

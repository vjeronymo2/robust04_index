			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: API planning third leg as profits advance by 46% API, the packaging group, yesterday announced a 46 per cent jump in pre - tax profits from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 1.96m for the half year to April 3, on turnover 11 per cent higher at Pounds 32.8m. Mr Michael Smith, group chief executive, also announced that the company would soon be adding - by acquisition - a third packaging leg to stand alongside the foils/laminates and converted film/paper products divisions. Mr Smith said the advances were largely due to productivity increases and rises in market share, rather than to any upturn within the packaging industry in particular or the UK economy in general. He added that sales by volume had climbed 14 per cent but that there had been some price erosion after winning several large accounts. Mr Smith said the prospective new leg would be higher-tech yet - since the year - end the group has strengthened its balance sheet by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2m net cash. Of API's sales some 48 per cent are abroad - 15 per cent to the US, 27 per cent to Europe and 6 per cent to the Far East. Foils and laminates lifted operating profits to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 759,000) on turnover of Pounds 20m (Pounds 17.6m), while converted film and paper products made Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 900,000) on turnover of Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.62m). Mr Smith said that both divisions were still pursuing margins of 15 per cent; this time they were 6.8 (4.3) per cent and 10.4 (9.4) per cent respectively. Again the blot was the heating and ventilating systems side which broke even (Pounds 200,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 2.28m). The interim dividend is lifted to 3.35p (3.05p), covered 1.9 times by earnings of 6.4p (4.5p).</p>

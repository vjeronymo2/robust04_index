			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The state of the Slovene economy,  especially its strong position among the East European and  Central European economies in transition, has been the subject  of analyses in Ljubljana and Belgrade economic journals and mass  media.    According to the 13 January issue of the Ljubljana economic  weekly GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK, Slovenia enjoys a comparative  advantage because it started its transition to a market economy  as the "most developed" of the former socialist countries,  although it is the smallest in population (2 million in 1992)  and size (20,000 square km). In 1993 Slovenia led in per capita  GDP ($6,186) and purchasing power ($8,500). While the transition  to a market economy caused recession in all the former socialist  economies, such trends were "less intense" in Slovenia. The  journal also noted that Slovenia has better prospects than the  Visegrad Group countries because the Slovene economy has been  "traditionally export-oriented" and, as such, influenced by  trends in the global economy. According to some economic  experts, who have dubbed Slovenia "the Switzerland of the  countries in transition," the country has already reached the  level of the "less-developed members of the European Union."    The 19 May issue of GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK analyzed positive  and  negative trends in the Slovene economy. On the positive side,  the journal pointed out that:    --After a period of stagnation and decline, the economy grew  in the third quarter of 1993, indicating a gradual economic  revival;    --The national currency, the tolar, has been stabilized --  the monthly inflation rate is averaging 2 percent, with  inflation estimated to total 18.5 percent in 1994;    --Foreign debt is relatively low;    --Exports make up two-thirds of the GDP, the highest in this  country group;    --Structural economic reforms and the rehabilitation of  banks  are "progressing successfully."    On the negative side, GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK noted a 15-percent  unemployment rate caused mainly by recession in the industrial  sector. Data show that unemployment continues to present "one of  the most difficult problems," particularly among the "less  educated work force." Although the private sector is rapidly  expanding, it is unable to generate sufficient new jobs. The  journal sees increased production as the only long-term solution  to unemployment.    Another problem mentioned in the article is low productivity  reflected in low wages. Slovenia's average monthly net wage of  $415 nevertheless represents the highest reported monthly income  among the former socialist countries. GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK  concluded that Slovenia is on the right path to recovery, while  conceding that the pace of privatization is lagging.    The 16 May issue of the Belgrade economic weekly EKONOMSKA  POLITIKA observed that the Slovene economy "navigates well"  between recession and postsocialist economic difficulties.  Citing the financial journal EUROMONEY and the Vienna Institute  for Comparative Economic Studies, the Belgrade weekly predicted  "possible" economic growth for Slovenia in 1994 and stronger  commercial activities, thanks to "new export markets" in the  Czech Republic and Hungary. According to EKONOMSKA POLITIKA, the  Vienna Institute anticipated 1-percent economic growth for 1994  resulting from exports, 20-percent annual inflation, and  18-percent unemployment.    Further confirmation that Slovene industrial production is  increasing in response to growing local demand, ECONOMSKA  POLITIKA reported, came from the Ljubljana Economic Institute in  March. Institute economists attributed the increase in retail  trade to the boost received from "invisible" exports to Croatia  -- many Croatian citizens shopping in Slovenia.    Citing data from the Slovene Statistics Institute, EKONOMSKA  POLITIKA noted that retail prices rose 3.9 percent in the first  quarter of 1994, while the overall cost of living increased 4.7  percent. The value of exports in January and February was $915.6  million, with imports worth $856.1 million. Trade with the  Yugoslav successor states continued to decline.    Signs of economic growth and general improvement in  employment opportunities for 1994 have also been confirmed by  the Ljubljana Economic Institute in its April survey of economic  trends, as reported by Ljubljana Radio on 16 May and the  Ljubljana daily DELO on 18 May. The Institute reported that  rising production spurred by an increase in demand led to high  levels of retail trade and a reduction in the stock of unsold  goods. The following Institute data for the first quarter of  1994 was published in DELO:    --Industrial production grew 3 percent compared to a year  ago.    --Unemployment, while still "one of the key problems," has  started to abate.    --Trade is balancing out. Foreign debt increased by $29  million and foreign currency reserves by $148 million, nearing a  total of $1.8 billion -- sufficient to cover 90 percent of  Slovenia's total foreign debt.    --The large supply of foreign currency is supporting the  exchange rate of the Slovene tolar, which was devalued by almost  2 percent during the first four months of 1994.    --Inflationary pressures are diminishing despite a  6.1-percent increase in retail prices and a 4.5-percent increase  in manufacturers' prices.</p>

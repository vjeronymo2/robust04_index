			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (1): Shaking the kaleidoscope - A country in the throes of change has suddenly been deprived of its leader. Many of Turgut Ozal's achievements are irreversible, but Turkey still faces daunting problems with the added danger of political instability. The process of choosing a new president begins tomorrow. TURKEY TODAY is a country in the throes of dramatic change, both internal and external. With the highest growth rate in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it also has inflation running at over 50 per cent. Its economy has opened decisively to the outside world in the last ten years, and a full customs union with the EC is scheduled for 1995. Meanwhile, the strategic environment has been turned upside down by the end of the cold war, and the country finds itself surrounded by zones of conflict and instability. Its own south-eastern region has for 8 1/2 years been the scene of a bitter civil war, which just may now be close to a peaceful conclusion. At this decisive moment in its history, the country has been deprived of the leader who in the last decade did most to shape its destiny. President Turgut Ozal died on April 17, and parliament votes tomorrow in the first of four possible ballots to choose his successor. Although for the last year and a half he has been in office rather than in power, his influence remained considerable, and his death has shaken the political kaleidoscope. Ozal was the architect of Turkey's economic recovery and an unflinching supporter of its traditional pro-western foreign policy. The emergence of a consumer society, the revival of the search for a European identity, Turkey's robust support of the US-led coalition against Iraq: on all these issues Ozal forced Turks to look at themselves and their country anew. He also played an important part in the creation of the Black Sea economic co-operation forum last year, and in encouraging closer links with the Turkic-speaking central Asian states. His power to influence policy, uncontested during the Gulf war and its Kurdish aftermath, had not been the same since the defeat of his Motherland Party in the November 1991 general election. Yet no Turkish party or politician can afford to ignore his impact. The economic reforms he put in place in the early 1980s laid the ground for Turkey's buoyant return to health after the stop-go performance of the previous decade. After ten years of growth averaging more than 5 per cent, Turkish society today is much more open, and Turks themselves more self assured. The country's membership of the European Community may still be a distant dream, but the westernising trend continues apace. President Ozal was criticised for challenging the secular legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the republic's founder. Yet even the social democrats - political guardians of secularism - are starting to rethink the doctrine of Kemalism, which was used to justify the military's intervention three times between 1960 and 1980. Another charge against Ozal was that he gave free rein to radical Moslem elements. Politicised Islam is certainly a persistent, if small, force, but there are few politicians who believe it cannot be contained within Turkey's secular democracy. On foreign policy, while powerless to prevent the rash of regional conflicts, Turkey is learning to use its growing diplomatic weight to urge moderation on both Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, and to galvanise the west to firmer action in Bosnia where Turkish F-16 jets under Nato command are now helping enforce the UN no-fly zone. Yet Turkey can ill afford a long period of party bickering. The country has an urgent agenda ranging from the Kurdish insurgency through relations with the EC to the economic problems highlighted in a recent OECD report. A breakthrough in the conflict with Kurdish separatists, seems now to be in sight, but success is by no means assured. Ankara has yet to frame its response to the ceasefire declared in March by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The cessation in hostilities provides an opportunity for the administration to apply its judicial and human rights reforms in the Kurdish-speaking region, which until now has been largely denied them, owing to draconian special measures used in the fight against terrorism. A big economic development package has also been announced, but it remains to be seen how far the Turkish state will go in allowing the expression of a distinct Kurdish identity through political parties, or through the use of the language in schools, broadcasts and administration. On Europe, too, negotiations are at a turning point as Turkey and the EC enter the last lap in their progress to acustoms union. By the end of 1995, if all goes to plan, Turkey should have lifted all import restrictions on EC goods and adopted the Community's common external tariff. There will almost certainly be an attempt to link Turkey's reforms with EC concessions on textile imports, currently limited by a quota arrangement which is technically in breach of the 1964 Association Agreement. As the deadline approaches, Turkey's powerful industrial lobbies will no doubt try to cling on to their privileges. But no government can long continue to let Turkish industrialists produce high-cost inferior standard products behind a wall of protective tariffs. Turkish consumers and foreign investors alike will want a clear signal from Ankara of its commitment to open the Turkish market. Any slip-up at this first hurdle would deal a severe blow to Turkey's long term ambitions for full EC membership. In 1992, the gross domestic product grew by 5.9 per cent - faster than any other economy in the OECD. But with the population also increasing by 2.1 per cent each year, there is little room for error. Some progress has been made to close the budget gap, but the underlying trend of inflation is increasing, and the administration still has to prove it is serious about tackling the mounting problems of the state enterprises. As a result, investment has all but stopped. Challenging enough even to a government with a strong hand on the helm, Turkey's troubles could suddenly seem insurmountable if a period of political drift sets in. By itself, President Ozal's death would have been sufficient to stimulate a bout of national introspection. But when it emerged that his great rival, prime minister Suleyman Demirel, was likely to stand as a presidential candidate, the way ahead was suddenly clouded with uncertainty. For while Demirel could be reasonably confident of success, the succession to him as leader of the True Path Party (DYP - the largest in the present parliament) is much less obvious. The leader of that party would certainly be asked to form the next government, but it is by no means certain that the present coalition of DYP and social democrats will continue. And should parliament by any chance fail to elect a new head of state, after four ballots it would be automatically dissolved and the country plunged immediately into a general election. The politicians may yet see themselves through the morass. A smooth handover would provide the best guarantee of the durability of the political and economic reforms set in motion by the late president. But elections for the presidency are always fraught in Turkey, even though it is a largely ceremonial post. This time will provide a thorough test of the maturity of the political system, and any further political and economic reforms must remain in doubt as long as the threat of early election hangs over the parliament. The promised land is still some way off. Whatever administration emerges, the challenges confronting Turkey remain awesome. But there can now be no turning back from the road on which Turgut Ozal struck out.</p>

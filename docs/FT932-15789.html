			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / GM truck recall urged A US safety agency yesterday asked General Motors to recall millions of pick-up trucks to correct an allegedly dangerous positioning of petrol tanks, Reuter reports from Washington. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a letter to the company that an agency study showed there was a 2.4 times greater risk of fire occurring in fatal side-impact crashes involving the GM vehicle than in similar sized Ford pick-up trucks. Consumer groups that have advocated a recall have said the safety problem affects 4.7m 1973-1987 model trucks. GM said it disagreed with the agency's request and would try to demonstrate to it that a recall of trucks was unwarranted.</p>

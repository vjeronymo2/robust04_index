			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Press commentaries today address the U.S. secretary  of state's upcoming tour of the region, which is aimed at  activating the peace process and creating an appropriate climate  for the resumption of the bilateral negotiations.    Under the headline "Israeli Deception," the newspaper  AL-BA'TH says: On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's tour of the region, Israeli officials have  launched an intensive media campaign aimed at misleading the  world public in general, and the U.S. public in particular.    AL-BA'TH adds: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said  that he is willing to consider the dismantling of settlements in  the occupied Arab territories, although facts on the ground  belie these claims. For, the Israeli Government has continued  to Judaize the occupied Arab territories, particularly occupied  Jerusalem.    The paper believes that it is high time the world community,  which has long been deceived by Zionism, realized that the  statements and pronouncements made by Israeli officials from  time to time on a peaceful settlement are totally different than  their real schemes and practices on the ground. For, had Israel  been seeking peace as it claims, it would not have pursued a  policy of procrastination and prevarication over the past two  and a half years; that is, since the inception of the peace  talks. This shows that Israel is evading the requirements of  peace acknowledged by the international community.    AL-BA'TH notes that the failure to make any progress in the  peace talks, which were suspended in the aftermath of the Hebron  massacre, was not caused by the Arabs, who, as is well known,  have done a great deal to render the peace process a success.  Rather, the failure to make progress in the peace talks is  caused by the Israeli position, which is opposed to the  implementation of the relevant resolutions of international  legitimacy, which constitute the terms of reference of the peace  process.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying that the U.S. side must take  into account the need to rehabilitate the peace process, and to  reestablish it on the terms of reference agreed upon -- the  terms which formed the bases for the convening of the Madrid  conference. The entire world community, the paper adds, welcomed  the convocation of the Madrid conference, and regarded it as a  unique opportunity for the achievement of just and comprehensive  peace in accordance with the relevant resolutions of  international legitimacy and the principle of trading land for  peace.    For its part, the newspaper TISHRIN addresses the  statements Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has made to  express his willingness to dismantle settlements on the Golan,  and reiterate that he would avoid complete withdrawal from the  Golan. The paper says: These statements show that Rabin is  sidestepping the crux of the peace process; indeed, crux of the  Arab-Israeli conflict. For, settlements have never been the  bone of contention between the Arabs and Israelis. Rather, it  was the occupation of Arab territories that has always been the  bone of contention between the two communities.    The paper adds: When he expressed a willingness to dismantle  settlements, which were a product of the occupation, Rabin  attempted to throw dust in our eyes. This is because, at the  same time, he also underscored his determination to avoid  complete withdrawal from the Golan, although Rabin, along with  all Israeli officials, are well aware of Syria's position in  this regard. Syria's peace stand is rooted in the need for  complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; namely,  the Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and  southern Lebanon.    TISHRIN goes on to say: Rabin, who is engaged in a fresh  maneuver with regard to the Golan, deliberately seeks to make  the peace talks, if they are resumed, revolve in a vicious  circle, or to render them void of any meaningful content.  Moreover, Rabin's statements regarding the avoidance of  complete withdrawal from the Golan are part of a new maneuver  that Israel is attempting to cover up by declaring a willingness  to dismantle settlements. These statements also betray a  flagrant Israeli circumvention of the components of durable and  viable peace.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: These Israeli proposals are  only aimed at perpetuating the occupation. For, had it been  serious about the efforts to achieve peace, Israel would not  have hesitated to subscribe to the requirements of the peace  process, chief among which are complete withdrawal from the  occupied territories and the implementation of the relevant  international legitimacy resolutions, which provide for the  inadmissibility of the acquisition of others' territories by  force and call for Israeli troop withdrawals from all occupied  Arab territories to achieve just and comprehensive peace.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the same issue, saying:  On the eve of his upcoming tour of the region, Christopher  announced that he is not carrying any new ideas or proposals.  Nonetheless, he has made public his optimism over the possible  achievement of positive results to help resume and reactivate  the bilateral negotiations.    The paper adds: It is hoped that this optimism is  well-grounded, and that it will produce tangible developments to  allow for the resumption of the negotiations, for progress in  the peace talks, and for the promotion of the peace process.  The attainment of all this would allow this process to achieve  its final objective; that is, a just and comprehensive peace  that upholds the principles of right and justice and nullifies  all forms of injustice, occupation, and aggression.    The paper goes on to say: Eleven rounds of negotiations have  been held since the convening of the Madrid conference. During  all these rounds, the Arabs ran into Israeli intransigence and  determination to conclude partial solutions and separate deals,  which cannot achieve peace or bring about stability. As a  matter of fact, such solutions and deals can only consecrate  injustice, domination, and occupation.    The paper says: For now, we cannot see any indication of a  change in the Israeli position. Likewise, we have not seen any  positive attitude on the part of the Rabin government indicative  of an abandonment of its old approaches and concepts, or of an  acceptance of the principle of complete and full withdrawal; and  this cannot help achieve peace.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: The Arabs,  headed  by Syria, have not given up hope over the possible emergence of  a fair and honest U.S. position that would vindicate the values  of right and justice and show impartiality toward the regional  conflict. All that we want is to see the United States  demonstrate fairness and honesty, and play the role of a full  partner with all honesty and impartiality.</p>

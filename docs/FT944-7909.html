			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures snoozed through much of the session on dull trading volume, unable to extract inspiration from lifeless cash markets in both London and New York, writes Jeffrey Brown. Activity was very thin. Just 6,887 contracts were dealt during pit trading - down from 10,236 on Friday - and more than 1,000 of these stemmed from spread trading as investors rolled over into the March contract. At the 4.10pm official close, the FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,130, down 10 points. The premium to cash equities was around 10 points, three points more than fair value. Traders said the market looked to have gone on hold ahead of the long Thanksgiving weekend in the US and with the UK Budget - due on November 29 - rapidly approaching. The local, or independent, traders had the session largely to themselves and deal sizes shrank dramatically. The premium on the December contract narrowed to a couple of points on occasions, but there were few real attempts to lead the cash market lower. Stock option volume was also slack, slipping to 21,653 lots, against 35,055 on Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for less than 10,000 contracts dealt. Hanson was the busiest stock option, with 1,492 lots, followed by BT and Lonrho.</p>

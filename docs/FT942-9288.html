			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Pension schemes criticise industry A third of pension schemes believe the industry does not communicate effectively with its members, says a survey released yesterday. A third also believe that pension-scheme members understand little of the financial information presented to them, the survey commissioned by accountants Clark Whitehill indicates. The analysis was based on a sample of 196 schemes with a total of 1.6m members. Nearly two-thirds of schemes rely on the small amount of information contained in summary financial statements sent to members. Clark Whitehill called for regulation of the contents and distribution of summary reports for members and said that reports should require a separate auditor's and actuary's report. It said its findings underlined concerns raised by the Goode committee on pension fund reform about the level of 'gobbledegook' in pension scheme literature. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council  (HKMAOSC) of China made a statement to XINHUA here today after  the Legislative Council (Legco) of Hong Kong passed this morning  the partial electoral bill submitted by Chris Patten, governor  of Hong Kong.    Following is the full text of the statement:    After the 17th round of the Sino-British talks on the  arrangements for the 1994/95 election in Hong Kong was held, the  British side walked away first from the negotiating table and  submitted the electoral bill to the Legco despite the earlier  statement made by the Chinese side, thus, terminating the talks.    Even so, we made it clear repeatedly that for the Chinese  side the door for negotiations was open under the prerequisite  that the British side must withdraw the submitted partial bill  from the Legco. However, the British side has ignored this and  clung obstinately on its own course. It has not only had the  partial bill passed at the Legco, but also decided unilaterally  to make public the contents of the 17 rounds of the Sino-British  talks and to submit the rest of the electoral bill to the Legco,  thus closing completely the door for resuming the talks.  Therefore, the British side should be held fully responsible  for ruining the talks.    The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law  stipulate that the British administration of Hong Kong will  terminate on June 30, 1997 and the Chinese Government will  resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1,  1997. In accordance with these provisions, the Chinese side  reiterates that as component parts of the British political body  administrating Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district  boards, the two municipal polls and the Legislative Council will  definitely be terminated together with the end of the British  administration of Hong Kong. Before the Chinese and British  sides reach an agreement on the arrangements for the 1994/95  elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the  partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or  any other electoral bill possibly to be passed by the Legco  cannot stand over the year of 1997. By that time, the political  body of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be  formed according to the decisions of the Chinese National  People's Congress and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law.</p>

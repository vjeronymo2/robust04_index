			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Arts: Palm goes to pulp - Cannes' winning film seems a shameful crawl to Hollywood The science of Palmistry suffered a major setback when the top prize at Cannes went to America's Pulp Fiction. There we all were, clutching our Pernods and tipping Zhang Yimou's To Live or Kieslowski's Red, when, lo] - nothing doing. The golden frond was bestowed on the new film from Quentin 'Reservoir Dogs' Tarantino. With Eastwood as jury president we should have been prepared. Pulp Fiction is a 2 1/2 -hour gangster romp in which various members of a starry cast (Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel) have their days made by various stabbings, shootings and summary executions. S-and-M, torture and drugs are also on the menu. Indeed if you want to anthologise one scene for the book of 'Great Throw-Up Moments In Hollywood Cinema', it must be that in which gangster's moll Miss Thurman, having OD'd on heroin, has a needleful of adrenalin thrust in her chest by a desperate escort-bodyguard (Travolta), anxious that she should not die while he is on the job. How the Palais roared. Likewise when the kidnapped young black has his brains scattered over the car. Or when Mr Big (also black) is captured and raped by a pair of Los Angelenos running neo-Nazism's answer to Sainsbury's Homebase. The virtue of Reservoir Dogs was that it kept wiping the smile off our faces. One moment you were giggling, the next you were all but passing out. But Pulp Fiction is a string of ill-connected stories about the underworld held together, if at all, by the sick wit of its gifted writer-director. The prize seems another shameful crawl to Hollywood from a festival that not long ago golden-palmed America three years in a row for unworthy films and is now, post-Gatt, anxious for another bout of kissing and making up; although I decline to name the part of Hollywood's anatomy that it might be kissing. Other hand-outs were more just. Kieslowski's prizelessness was greeted with indignation by many critics, though not this one: I thought Red the weakest of his trilogy films. Instead Zhang Yimou's hunk of history about China To Live, reported on last week, shared the runner-up Special Jury Prize with Nikita Mikhalkov's Burned By The Sun, jostling with Tarantino in the last busy weekend. The Russian film-maker is becoming the festival world's duty dark horse. Three years ago he came from nowhere to seize the Venice Golden Lion with Urga. Now he blends Chekhovian chamber drama with Stalin-era historical tragicomedy - this is another 2 1/2 -hour piece in a festival where we could all have filed overtime claims - in a film that is a small triumph of art over obstacle. Main obstacle is audience resistance to what seems initially yet another Cherry Orchard-ish elegy about the idle rich socked by a changing zeitgeist. Mikhalkov himself plays the central Colonel, at play with his family in a summer dacha while Uncle Joe Stalin gears up for his 1936 purges. But there is an oddness and energising sinisterness even in these scenes of sunlight, Chopin and cotton dresses. Who is the young family friend who arrives disguised as a blind man? Why are there so many mock-suicide games? Finally the film tears the idyll with a vengeance. Just like the chauffered car jolting our hero down the country lane towards his eventual gulag, this plush movie vehicle ends up showing it has lively springs and a feel for the road. And Mikhalkov, if he had not won a prize for the movie, could have won it for a performance that grows from the subtle to the bravura. The Best Actor prize went instead to Ge You, gauntly memorable in To Live. And the Best Actress was Virna Lisi - good lord, surely we remember her as a vacuous Italian starlet of the 1960s? - playing Catherine de Medici in France's La Reine Margot. Lisi's was not the only identity change at Cannes. A number of directors kept turning into actors and vice versa. Tarantino and Mikhalkov both jumped in front of the camera when not shouting 'Action]' behind it. Roman Polanski burgled several scenes from co-star Depardieu in Tornatore's A Simple Formality. And the Best Director prize went to a man better known, at least in the Eternal City, as a performer: Roman comedian Nanni Moretti who, as per my last report, enchanted le tout Cannes with Dear Diary. And talking of toucans, there should have been a prize for the large-beaked tropical bird on an adjoining hotel rooftop who kept waking me each morning in time for the dreaded 8.30. press show. 'Bonjour]', it cried, sharp on 7.45. And then something, I insisted to friends, that sounded like 'Serie noire] Serie noir] . . .' Only later did I realise that the bird was giving me a tip. Serie Noir is the French title for Pulp Fiction.</p>

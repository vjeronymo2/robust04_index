			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Karl Morgenstern] </F>   [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (DPA) -- The Cuban Airline (Empresa  Consolidada Cubana de Aviacion) that took over the Compania  Cubana de Aviacion on 27 June 1961 has been badly affected by  its Soviet inheritance.    While its predecessor operated exclusively with British and  U.S. airplanes, under Fidel Castro's regime the Cuban airline  became the Soviet airline industry's best client in the Western  Hemisphere. But with its once impressive fleet, today the  airline cannot win any laurels. Because of this, Cubana has  purchased from Aviaco, a subsidiary of Spain's Iberia Airlines,  eight used Fokker F-27's for $6 million, and it has allocated  $1.5 million to train the crews to continue servicing national  and Caribbean flights.    The twin-motor Dutch airplanes are certainly not the most  recent models, but they are still reliable, and despite their  age they are easier to maintain than the rest of the old Cubana  fleet which includes three An-24's, nine An-26's, 12 Il-62's,  nine Tu-154's, five YAK-40's, and two YAK-42's.    Seven Il-62's -- four-turboprop long-range airliners that  are  extremely expensive to operate but are able to carry 200  passengers -- will be refurbished and updated to comply with  U.S. safety standards, since they will also fly over U.S.  territory. Of the nine three-turboprop Russian Tu-154's, short-  and medium-range airliners once preferred by the former GDR  airline Iterflug, only two are in any condition to fly.    The Cuban airline industry is in a deep crisis. The old jet  airliners are expensive, and there is a shortage of foreign  exchange and consequently fuel, not to mention the scarcity of  spare parts for the obsolete Russian airliners. Notwithstanding,  Cubana continues flying to Europe, Latin America, and Canada to  bring tourists to Cuba.    The country raising the most objections is the United  States.  In 1991, when Cubana agreed to a joint venture with the  Brazilian airline company VARIG to modernize its fleet and  receive a strong injection of capital, the U.S. veto was more  powerful. VARIG, in pursuit of its own interests in the United  States, had to capitulate.    Another example: International law allows Cuban long-range  airplanes that fly to Europe the use of a corridor passing over  the United States which must be strictly observed. But, as soon  as the airliners reach New York they have to turn right and head  toward the Atlantic. Even on all flights to Canada, a country  with which, much to U.S. annoyance, Cuba has had good relations  for many years, Cuban airliners have to take a huge detour.    Heriberto Prieto, general manager of Cubana Airlines,  laments: "This is equivalent to one additional hour in flight  time between Havana and Canada, with its corresponding fuel  expense."    Cuba is looking for a way out of this crisis through  practical emergency solutions. Its stated aim is to survive.  The best way is through tourist flights which the company does  not want to leave entirely in the hands of airlines from Europe  and Canada, regions that provide the majority of tourists  visiting Cuba.    Therefore, they need airplanes. The first step was taken by  leasing a DC-10. Recently, Aero-Varadero, a subsidiary of  Cubana Airlines, is flying an Airbus A-310, also leased, from  Havana to Frankfurt and Milan on a regular basis, and in the  future will fly to Madrid and Paris.</p>

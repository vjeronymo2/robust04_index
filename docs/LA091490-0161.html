			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> CHICANAS STRUGGLE AGAINST ART WORLD EXCLUSION ;  </P> <P> EXHIBIT: 'IMAGE AND IDENTITY' ASKS WHY CHICANAS ARE VIRTUALLY ABSENT FROM MAJOR  LATINO ART SHOWS.  </P> <P> As in most fields, women artists have a more difficult time "making it" than  men artists, and the problem is compounded for those of Latino descent. But a  show opening Saturday at Loyola Marymount's Laband Art Gallery is chipping away  at that problem.  </P> <P> Titled "Image and Identity: Recent Chicana Art from 'La Reina del Pueblo de Los  Angeles de la Porcincula,' " the exhibit features works by five women of  Mexican heritage. The group complains that Chicana artists have been virtually  passed over by major Latino art shows, including "Hispanic Art in the United  States" at the L.A. County Museum of Art in early 1989; the recent European  traveling show "Le Demon des Anges"; and to a lesser extent, "Chicano Art:  Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-85," which opened last weekend at UCLA's Wight  Art Gallery.  </P> <P> "There have definitely been omissions, and this show will help (to make up for)  a lot of those glaring ones that have happened recently," said Sybil Venegas,  curator of the exhibit, which includes five or six works each by photographer  Laura Aguilar and painters Barbara Carrasco, Diane Gamboa, Margaret Garcia and  Dolores Guerrero-Cruz.  </P> <P> In addition to racism and sexism, said the women of "Image and Identity," there  are several possible reasons for their difficulties.  </P> <P> Garcia noted that women artists often deal with more personal, introspective  themes, and therefore may create work seen as "less universal." Carrasco said  Chicana artists addressed more political themes than men, which goes against  the current trend of what she called "stereotypical" Chicano art. Gamboa  believes women artists lack the camaraderie prevalent among men, and  Guerrero-Cruz said that many women can't produce a large enough body of work  because of such additional concerns as raising families.  </P> <P> "A lot of times there is an underlying sexism that assumes that somehow men are  more competent, and then (Chicanas) are put down on a cultural level as well,"  said curator Venegas, who teaches Chicana and Mexican art history at East L.A.  College and Cal State Long Beach. "Mexican females are really outside of the  mainstream. Any one of these women could have been included in 'Hispanic Art in  the United States.' "  </P> <P> In that show, Venegas said, only 3 of 29 artists were women. In three other  recent Latino shows, women account for 20% to 29% of the artists: "Le Demon des  Anges" had four women in a pool of 20, "CARA," has 41 women out of 169 artists,  and four women are among the 14 in "Aqui y Alla," running at L.A. Municipal Art  Gallery.  </P> <P> "We have been excluded from a lot of the other shows, and the odds are against  us in many ways as women," Gamboa said. "It's real obvious and hard to  overcome, but it's important for the few of us that are doing it to stick with  it. This show will help us do that."  </P> <P> Guerrero-Cruz agreed. "I am a woman and a Chicana -- which gives me two  strikes. But I think our time has come. It's only recently that we've been  complaining about it and have been able to start showing our works. This is the  first Chicana show in which we have a large body of work that gives an accurate  description of what we can actually do."  </P> <P> There have been other Chicana shows, Venegas pointed out, but they have mostly  been held at smaller, less respected community galleries. The last Chicana show  in Los Angeles, she said, was in 1983 at SPARC Gallery.  </P> <P> "Something is happening here. We are finally going somewhere," Venegas said,  noting that the idea for the exhibit actually originated with Loyola  Marymount's Chicano student group. "This show will make a difference because  with the Laband Gallery, this stuff is coming into the institutional level. And  because it's being institutionalized, people are going to see it as  legitimate."  </P> <P> Garcia also said the tide is turning. "Our work is going to be making the  statements. There's so much strength there that it can't be bottled any more.  It's got to happen, because the work is meaningful and people will see that,"  she said.  </P> <P> Echoed Guerrero-Cruz: "I think we're going to surprise people. We really have  some strong work, and we just haven't been able to show it.  </P></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Tunnel to be built under Medway A Pounds 70M road tunnel is to be built by a UK-Dutch joint venture under the river Medway to relieve traffic congestion and to encourage the redevelopment of the historic former naval dockyard at Chatham. The contract to build a largely publicly financed tunnel has been awarded by Kent County Council to a joint venture between Tarmac, the British construction and building materials group, and HBM Civil Engineering, part of Hollandsche Beton Groep of the Netherlands. The tunnel, a twin-bore immersed tube, will stretch between Frindsbury on the west bank to the Chatham Maritime development being carried out by English Estates, the government-sponsored development agency, on the east bank. More than 300 acres of the the dockyard, where some of Britain's most famous warships were built, including Nelson's flagship HMS Victory, were set aside for redevelopment when the dockyard closed in 1984. At that stage it was hoped to build a privately financed tunnel or bridge across the Medway. English Estates and Rochester Bridge Trust, a 600-year-old charity which owns and operates the twin bridges carrying the A2 across the Medway at Rochester, are making a Pounds 20m contribution to the cost.</p>

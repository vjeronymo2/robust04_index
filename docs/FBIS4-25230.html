			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen on Tuesday [7 June] reiterated Beijing's opposition  to the imposition of sanctions against North Korea to enforce  the International Atomic Energy Agency's calls for unhampered  access to North Korean nuclear facilities.    "It is not a good way to solve the problem by imposing  sanctions," China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY quoted Qian as  telling visiting Maltese Foreign Minister Guido de Marco.    Qian said China adheres to the stand of maintaining  stability  on the Korean Peninsula and making it nuclear free, hoping that  the nuclear issue will be settled through negotiations,  according to XINHUA.    Discussions about possible punitive steps against North  Korea  have intensified at the United Nations since the IAEA said last  week it can no longer verify whether Pyongyang has diverted  plutonium after its inspectors were blocked from examining fuel  rods unloaded at a nuclear reactor.    The United States has said it will ask the U.N. Security  council to impose sanctions on North Korea for its defiance of  international nuclear safeguards.    China, as a permanent member of the key U.N. body, could  wield its veto to block any measures against its traditional  ally North Korea.</p>

Watkins, who made a presentation at the meeting of Bush's  Economic Policy Council, is recommending that the strategy include both  increased fuel efficiency standards and a requirement for greater use of  non-gasoline fuels. But other advisers, including White House Chief of Staff  John H. Sununu, are fighting the proposals on grounds that they would be costly  and involve excessive government regulation.  </P></p>

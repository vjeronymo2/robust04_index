			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Hungarians seize uranium Hungarian police have arrested two nationals trying to sell 2kg of radioactive material, believed to be uranium fuel rods from the former Soviet Union. Agents of Hungary's intelligence services had trailed the two suspects outside the country before detaining them in a Budapest hotel carpark on Monday as they sought to sell the material for Dollars 40,000 per kg. The incident comes amid international concern that nuclear material may be finding its way out of Russia to help other countries or terrorist groups make atomic weapons. The Germans have made four seizures of illegal weapons-grade plutonium and uranium since May that Bonn believes may have come from former Soviet stocks in Russia.</p>

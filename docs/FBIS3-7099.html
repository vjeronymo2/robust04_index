			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Kim Yong-sam prior to departing for </F> official visits to Japan and China at Seoul Airport -- live]    [Text] Dear fellow countrymen: It is raining now to bless  our future. I am making official visits to Japan and China for  a week beginning today in my capacity as a state guest for the  first time since I took office as president. At a news  conference with reporters earlier this year, I said that I would  not hesitate in going anywhere in the world to be a salesperson  for our national interests. My visits to Japan and China this  time are to put such will into practice. For the past year  since I took on the presidency, I have met over 20 heads of  state, and found them all to share one common factor--that they  all were pursuing their respective national interests.    Our closest neighbors historically and geographically, Japan  and China, are our partners in leading the Asia-Pacific era. I  will reconfirm this on this visit. At the same time, I will  relay the impressive efforts during the past year of our fellow  countrymen for reforms and for building a new state, to the  people of these two countries.    The globalization trend is increasing in the international  community daily. Distances between countries are shrinking, and  relations of mutual reliance are deepening. In particular, a  new world trade order of indefinite competition has emerged in  the wake of the Uruguay Round. In order for the ROK, China, and  Japan to mutually enjoy political stability and economic  prosperity in such an era of rapid change, it is very important  for close cooperation to take place.    Japan and China are our second and third largest trade  partners. Most of our foreign investment has been in China.  Amid such a trend in the world economy, cooperation is ever  increasing among the three countries, all with different  industrial structures and developing rates. Mutually  complementary cooperation and partnership will enable all three  countries to strengthen each's competitiveness.    Fellow countrymen:    During my visit, I will hold deep consultations with Japan  and China on how the three countries can cooperate for Asia's  security and peace. In particular, the North Korean nuclear  issue is not only a grave issue for us, but is also closely  related to the security of Northeast Asia and world peace.  North Korea has refused to sincerely receive the inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency and has even unilaterally  broken off the North-South dialogue, thus creating a crisis on  the Korean peninsula. It even threatens our people with severe  words that state that it is ready for war.    We will resolutely defeat any kind of provocation by North  Korea with the firm security cooperative system of the ROK and  the United States. During the security-related ministers'  meeting on 21 March which I chaired, I reconfirmed our flawless  security posture and consolidated a firm will to deal with  whatever situation we may come to face. U.S. President Clinton  sent me a personal letter promising that the United States will  sincerely abide by its security pledge toward the ROK, whatever  the situation. We will by no means yield to North Korea's  threats. We will keep the doors open so that dialogue can begin  as soon as they change their attitude.    I will ask for Japan and China's cooperation during my visit  to the two countries to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue  and call for North Korea's reform and openness, as it is now  isolated internationally. The three countries of the ROK,  China, and Japan each has its share of work in resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue.    I intend to explain to the leaders of the two countries that  true reconciliation and peace are not only crucial to the  prosperity of East Asia but also to the Asian-Pacific region,  and ask for their cooperation.    Fellow countrymen: During my visit to Japan, I am scheduled  to meet Emperor Akihito and hold two summits with Prime Minister  Hosokawa. I will also make a speech before the Diet and reveal  how I envision ROK-Japanese relations in the 21st century. In  addition, I will meet the leaders of Japan's political and  economic circles to exchange views on worthwhile mutual  exchanges. At Waseda University, I will talk about the future  role of youth in the ROK and Japan.    As for the summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, since  I  held exclusive talks with him in Seattle last year, this will be  our second summit meeting. In the upcoming summit, we will  contemplate our relations which have been maintained for a long  time. I am also scheduled to meet Premier Li Peng.    I will observe economic developments in Shanghai and Tianjin  and will visit the site of our former provisional government in  Shanghai.    I also intend to convey the warm greetings of our people to  fellow countrymen living in Japan and China.    Fellow countrymen:    The ROK is no longer on the periphery of the earth. Having  opened an era of civilian government and being third in economic  rank in the world [segye chesamwiui kyongjeryog], the ROK is  emerging as a core country in the 21st century. The ROK is  actively participating in and contributing to setting up a new  order in the Pacific era. This is not just our opinion but how  the world sees us.    Let us all have pride and a sense of mission! Let us all  realize our ambition with reforms and internationalization! Let  us all turn this country into a country that contributes to  creating a new civilization.    Even though I briefly depart, fellow countrymen, I will  remain with you always.    Fellow countrymen, I will return soon.</p>

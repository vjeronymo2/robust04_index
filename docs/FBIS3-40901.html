The documents on Ukraine's elimination  of nuclear weapons and adherence to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the three Presidents signed, are  another step in the nuclear disarmament of the world," Boris  Yeltsin said, replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS  correspondent. [passage omitted]    Leonid Kravchuk told journalists that starting today,  "Ukraine's security has been substantially enhanced, because by  signing these documents along with the Presidents of Russia and  the United States it has obtained from each confirmation of its  security."</p>

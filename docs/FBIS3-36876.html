It passed its first  reading over a year ago. But in its second reading it did not  garner the required number of votes. Recently another attempt  was made to legalize alternative service.    But the deputies heeded the opinion of republic Defense  Minister Colonel General Pavel Kozlovskiy, who stated that the  time for this law has "still not come." The Armed Forces, he  said, are experiencing a severe shortage of draftees and, if  alternative service is now allowed, the situation as regards  bringing the Army up to strength with soldiers and sergeants  will become extremely complicated.</p>

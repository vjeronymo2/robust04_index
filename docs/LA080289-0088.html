			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW TACTIC AGAINST SLUMS: TAKING THE RENT MONEY AWAY  </P> <P> Attacking what Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called "the mother's milk of  slumlordism, the rent check," a new Los Angeles ordinance allows the city to  take rent money away from landlords who refuse to make repairs.  </P> <P> Passed last November at the urging of Yaroslavsky and Councilwoman Gloria  Molina, the ordinance gives the City Council the right to place either certain  apartments or whole buildings into a "rent escrow account program." It is  similar to laws already enacted in New York and Detroit.  </P> <P> Tenants then pay their monthly rents into a special bank account maintained by  the city, rather than to their landlords. Landlords get the money only after  they make repairs, minus a $50-per-apartment fee to the city.  </P> <P> So far, the city's Community Development Department, which administers the  program, is considering three buildings as candidates for the rent escrow  program -- at 521 S. Union Drive, 5426 Virginia Ave. and 1040 Westlake Ave.  </P></p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / EC backs Red Hot TV ban THE European Commission yesterday backed the British government's plan to outlaw Red Hot Television, a pornographic television channel transmitted into the UK, Andrew Hill writes. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC commissioner for audiovisual policy, said the measures outlined by the UK were compatible with EC law and Brussels would not be raising any objections. Red Hot Television, originally called Red Hot Dutch, is thought to be transmitted via satellite from Denmark, and is received by subscribers using decoders sold under licence from a Dutch-registered channel. The commission said it was unable to confirm where the broadcaster was established, or which member state had jurisdiction over the channel. But Mr Pinheiro said member states were obliged to take action against broadcasts which 'might impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular those that involve pornography or gratuitous violence'.</p>

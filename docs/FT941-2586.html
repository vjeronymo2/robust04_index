			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Stags find it tough Financial adviser Johnson Fry has put lots of noses out of joint with its French privatisation service, writes Gillian O'Connor. The original scheme was to operate a rolling stagging fund: clients would put in Pounds 1,000, which would be used to apply for shares in one privatisation. These shares would then be sold as soon as dealings started and the money would go into the next privatisation offer - and so on. The first problem was that the French Treasury took umbrage at the idea of a stagging fund, particularly one where the beneficiaries were perfidious Englishmen. A few eyebrows were raised before the offer of shares in Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, the first privatisation in which Johnson Fry tried to participate. Johnson Fry ignored the eyebrows and bought its clients some Elf shares. But rival Killik &amp; Co., a stockbroker which had been running both a French privatisation share-dealing service and a stagging service for some time, got caught up in the slipstream and was not able to get its clients into Elf. Johnson Fry then decided it might be prudent to play down the emphasis on stagging. So, it offered clients the choice of holding on to their Elf shares and topping up the rolling stagging fund, or sticking with the formula for which they had signed up. Result: some thoroughly confused clients.</p>

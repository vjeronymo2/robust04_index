			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / German utilities announce takeover bid Germany's three largest energy utilities have announced agreement to take over the lion's share of east Germany's power generating and coalmining industries, in two deals valued at more than DM10bn (Pounds 3.8bn), writes Quentin Peel. Essen-based RWE, PreussenElektra, owned by Veba, and Munich-based Bayernwerk will jointly own 75 per cent of Veag, the main east German electricity company, with the remaining 25 per cent going to five smaller western utilities. The price is around DM8bn. The takeover of the giant Lausitz brown coal fields (Laubag), for DM2.1bn, will involve a further DM6bn investment over 20 years, according to Mr Friedhelm Gieske, RWE's chief executive. The Rheinbraun subsidiary of RWE will be the 51 per cent majority shareholder in Laubag, with PreussenElektra taking 30 per cent, and Bayernwerk 15 per cent. RWE Energie will hold the balance. Veag supplies some 70 per cent of east German electricity, primarily from power stations fired by brown coal.</p>

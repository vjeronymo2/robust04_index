			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Fiscal squeeze 'will cut growth' The two Budgets of 1993 will reduce UK economic growth by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent a year for the next three years, say accountants and management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. It says the combined effect will be a fiscal squeeze of about 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1994-95, rising to about 3 per cent in 1996-97. This is a greater impact than that of Lord Howe's 1981 Budget and represents 'the most severe fiscal squeeze in the UK since 1945'. Coopers &amp; Lybrand does not expect economic growth to average more than 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent over the next three years. Tax debate, Page 8</p>

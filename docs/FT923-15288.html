			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (1): Living down the past - Ten years of turmoil have left Merseyside struggling for consensus. Good leaders have emerged and stability is firmer. The conurbation has been slimming down to fit its new, smaller economy SIR DESMOND Pitcher, newly knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours, and chairman of Merseyside Development Corporation, looked over the city of Liverpool from his office, high in the headquarters of Littlewoods, where he is chief executive. 'Merseyside has had to bear the consequences of its image,' he said. 'No one wants to know the school delinquent. The problems were deeper and worse than in most places, but they were made even worse by a political poison pill. Fortunately, we don't have to live with that so much now.' Sir Desmond is one of the people picking up the pieces after 10 years of turmoil. They began with Liverpool's Toxteth riots in 1981 and - everyone hopes - ended last year, when Liverpool city council withstood seven months of bitter strikes by left-wing town hall trade unions to prove the council runs the city. The years between saw what Mr Neil Kinnock called 'the grotesque chaos' of Militant's domination of Liverpool in the mid-1980s; the abolition by the government of Merseyside county council, the only body ever to have held the place together; the disqualification from office of 47 Liverpool Labour councillors for financial mismanagement; and the break-up of Merseyside's main party of local government - Labour - into almost sectarian left-wing factions. The means of getting over this trauma are now to hand. Politically, the ultra-left has been marginalised. Moderation and consensus are apparent. Substantial economic reconstruction has seen Merseyside shrink through migration. It had nearly 1.6m people when it was formed nearly 20 years ago but has closer to 1.4m now. At 17 per cent, unemployment is bad, but depopulation means it is not getting as bad as it has been. Although 200,000 jobs have been lost since 1977, the bulk of the 420,000 that now exist are well-paid and largely filled by qualified, skilled or at least trained people. Professor Patrick Minford, the Liverpool University economist, says this means the tax base and total local spending power have not eroded. At the same time, there is plenty to boast about. Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, forgiven its debts by the government and freed from trade union power by the abolition of the National Dock Labour Scheme, has revived the port of Liverpool. Liverpool Freeport is the most successful in Britain and an important selling point to potential inward investors. They like the cash flow benefits of its VAT-free internal regime. Merseyside Development Corporation (MDC) has rescued the Mersey's two waterfronts from dereliction, laying the basis for a tourist industry with 14,000 jobs that brought in 29m visitors last year. Under the energetic Prof Peter Toyne, the elevation of Liverpool Polytechnic into John Moores University - named after the founder of Littlewoods - has created a more competitive academic environment for Liverpool University. Merseyside is a good place to live; some of the talented staff and students attracted will, as they always have, stick and stay. Merseyside won two of the 11 national prizes in the government's City Challenge competition, one on each side of the river, with millions of pounds of urban funding now wiping out dereliction in Liverpool and Wirral. The July issue of North West Business Insider, a magazine which chronicles corporate milestones in the region, lists 35 significant projects and developments currently under way in the Mersey docklands. A promotional concert tour by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra to the eastern seaboard of the US in February - paid for by the MDC and with a government minister in attendance - produced 1,000 leads. When the 111 tall ships of the Columbus Grand Regatta finish their race across Atlantic in the Mersey next month, scores of potential US investors will be there to see them, as well as to attend an operatic gala, compered by Sir Peter Ustinov, which the MDC is staging near the Albert Dock. In spite of all this, Sir Desmond, who took the chair at MDC 14 months ago, and has focused its growth on 10 main project areas, points to a problem stemming from past conflicts. 'Merseyside is full of people with skill and talent,' he says. 'But it has been like a company whose directors are always arguing with each other.' Urban regeneration elsewhere has demonstrated three main requirements. First, there have to be leaders; second, all involved have to sink their differences and work towards common goals; and, third, each leader has to have a wider vision of the community than their own role in it. Merseyside has always had good leaders. The problem has been getting them to work together. It is as acute today as ever. Thus, it is proving very difficult to form a Merseyside partnership of local authorities, government agencies and the private sector to set common goals and develop the sort of vision with which Glasgow revitalised itself in the 1980s. The process is in its third year. Other communities have formed their partnerships in weeks. Merseyside's started after Baroness Chalker, then MP for Wallasey, was the moving force behind a large meeting of all potential partners. Government support was through the Merseyside Task Force, which co-ordinates the work of various Whitehall departments in the area and controls the purse-strings for most projects in need of public funding. Prof Graeme Davies became chairman of the putative partnership. His was the politically neutral constituency of Liverpool University, which he had shaken out of years of inertia, as far as its role in the Merseyside community was concerned. But last year his talents saw him plucked out by the government to run the Universities Funding Council. Mr John Billington, fourth-generation head of Edward Billington &amp; Sons, one of Britain's last three sugar merchants, took over. He has hands-on local government support from Mr David Henshaw, chief executive of Knowsley council. If this dislocation of chairmanship did not bode well, neither did 10 months of uncertainty about the date of the general election. Labour would have abolished the MDC and created a Merseyside Development Agency with plenipotentiary powers. Local politicians dragged their feet to see what might happen. Meanwhile, diplomatic gaffes resulted in a failure to invite Liverpool Chamber of Commerce - which has 1,300 members - to take part, as well as Wirral feeling it was being left in the cold. Both mistakes have been rectified, but many people seem incapable of forgetting them. Mr Harry Rimmer, the moderate Labour leader of Liverpool city council, says he finds it all 'depressing'. Wirral - which has 23 per cent of Merseyside's population against Liverpool's 30 per cent - already has a successful partnership, with powerful private sector participation from Candy, Unilever, Shell and Vauxhall. It is reluctant to risk public money on Merseyside and would rather go it alone, though it will probably support Mr Billington for form's sake. The most active private sector input has to come from Boom - Business Opportunities on Merseyside - an enthusiastic promotional pressure group founded by Mr Geoffrey Piper, formerly Deloitte's regional senior partner - who also runs the north-west business leadership team. It has 120 influential corporate members paying Pounds 2,400 each. 'Boom will not wind itself up if there is no proper vehicle we can hand over to,' Mr Piper says emphatically. Mr Billington says: 'I know what's wanted but I am very frustrated at the speed we can do anything. Because of everyone's diary commitments, it takes four weeks to arrange a meeting that all five council chief executives can attend. I'm used to getting on with it.' He hopes to have a business plan to put to a public meeting of potential partners this month, to recruit a chief executive in November and start up officially next April. If he succeeds, most will see it as a triumph. As Prof Minford puts it: 'John Billington is a very nice man who has managed to keep a lot of people in the same room for a long time. That's a major achievement in this area. It's as difficult as doing it in Northern Ireland.' In the meantime, Merseyside will have to go on speaking for itself. Unfortunately, its history has a very loud voice.</p>

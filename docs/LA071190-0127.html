			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER TURNS SELF IN AFTER FATAL ACCIDENT;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: A WOMAN WHO ALLEGEDLY HIT AND KILLED A MOTORCYCLIST, THEN LEFT  THE SCENE, WENT TO AUTHORITIES LATER THE SAME NIGHT, THEY SAID.  </P> <P> A 19-year-old Long Beach woman who allegedly struck and killed a motorcyclist  on a dimly lit residential street turned herself in to police after initially  leaving the scene, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Police said Suzanne Montague was apparently making a left turn on Foster Road  at Copa de Oro Drive about 9 p.m. Monday when her car hit a man riding a Honda  trail bike. California Highway Patrol spokesman Lyle Whitten said the man was  traveling south on Foster at the time of the accident.  </P> <P> The name of the victim, a 37-year-old Rossmoor man, was withheld until his  family could be notified. Whitten said he was knocked about 80 feet off his  motorcycle and onto the pavement, suffering massive head and internal injures.  Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at Long  Beach Memorial Hospital at 10:10 p.m.  </P> <P> Whitten said that investigators suspect the small motorcycle's headlights were  not on at the time of the crash. In addition, he said, the intersection wasn't  brightly lit.  </P> <P> "It was not real bright at the scene, so it may have been very difficult for  this motorcyclist to be seen," Whitten said.  </P> <P> After hitting the man, Montague pulled over and stopped, Whitten said. She  later told investigators she looked around, didn't see anything and took off,  Whitten said.  </P> <P> "She went home and told her mother . . . she was involved in some type of  accident," Whitten said. Her mother then called the CHP and brought her  daughter to the Westminster CHP station at about 11:30 p.m., he said.  </P> <P> During an interview with an investigator, Montague said she was not sure if she  had hit the motorcyclist but knew she had hit something, Whitten said.  </P> <P> There was no indication at the scene or at the station that she had been  drinking, Whitten said.  </P> <P> Officers arrested her on suspicion of felony hit and run but "due to the fact  that she did voluntarily come into the office and since we are looking for  witnesses, we released her pending further investigation," Whitten said.  </P> <P> Efforts to reach Montague were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The car she was driving, a 1984 Toyota Tercel, was parked in front of her Long  Beach home and was later impounded by the CHP and placed in a secured area,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "The car had extensive left front damage and blood splatterings on the left  fender," Whitten said. "There was glass and debris found at the scene that  matches the car." He added that the CHP will attempt to match the blood to the  victim's blood. There were no skid marks at the scene, he said.  </P> <P> "It is entirely possible for the average motorist not to have seen this guy,"  Whitten said.  </P> <P> The headlight and taillight were taken off the motorcycle and sent to the crime  lab to determine whether they were lit at the time of the accident "but it  appears they were off," Whitten said.  </P> <P> "We also had a witness who saw the motorcyclist before the accident traveling  down one of the surface streets without headlights on," Whitten said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that tests will be  conducted on the victim's blood alcohol level as required by state law.  </P> <P> After an investigation, the case will be brought to the Orange County district  attorney, who will determine if charges will be filed.  </P></p>

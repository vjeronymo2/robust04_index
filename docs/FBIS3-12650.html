A responsible Palestinian source has said he has received a  written approval of this stand by these four PLO Executive  Committee members from both al-Hut and al-Hasan.    In a separate development, nine Palestinian popular unions,  namely, the Palestinian Workers Union, the Palestinian Teachers  Union, the Palestinian Students Union, the Palestinian Women's  Union, the Palestinian Writers and Journalists Union, the  Palestinian Plastic Arts Union, the Palestinian Peasants Union,  the Palestinian Artists Union, and the Palestinian Physicians  and Pharmacists Union, concluded their joint meeting in Tunis on  1 March.    These unions issued a statement, a copy of which was  obtained  by AL-RA'Y. The unions held Israel responsible for the massacre  at holy Ibrahimi Mosque.    The statement urged the Arab nation to shoulder its pan-Arab  and historical responsibility toward the Palestinian people to  enable them to maintain their steadfastness until the  achievement of their inalienable rights to self-determination,  repatriation, and the establishment of an independent  Palestinian state.    The statement urged the United States, in its capacity as a  cosponsor of the peace conference, and U.S. President Clinton to  end their unlimited support of the Israeli Government.    The statement also called on the UN Security Council to take  immediate and practical measures to dispatch a protection force  to the occupied territories to protect our people from the  crimes of Israeli aggressors.</p>

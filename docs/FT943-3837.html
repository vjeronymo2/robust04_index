			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Philippines The Philippine Stock Exchange said that it was keeping a close watch on dormant stocks to ensure they were not being used by companies wanting to list assets without meeting listing requirements. Early last week the PSE suspended trading in 10 of at least 20 inactive firms being closely watched, and ordered them to explain rises of up to 50 per cent in their share prices in case they had failed to disclose 'material facts' that could have fuelled speculation. The suspension of three of the stocks was lifted last Tuesday. Exchange officials said that they were concerned that small stocks might become takeover targets for new groups wanting to get round listing requirements. Most small board issues are mining and oil stocks. Hong Kong Luoyang Glass said on Wednesday that comments made by Mr Guo Xiaohuan, its chairman and managing director, on the projected performance and profits for the second half of 1994 should not be relied upon. China's largest sheet glass maker said that the information had not been reviewed by its financial advisers or auditors. The Hong Kong stock exchange discourages company officials from making results forecasts which have not been reviewed by independent financial specialists. Nevertheless Luoyang's shares, which closed 4 cents lower at HKDollars 3.89 on Tuesday, surged 17 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to HKDollars 4.06 on Wednesday.

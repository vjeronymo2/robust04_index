			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Travel: Bitter truth behind a Bolivian beauty - Nicholas Woodsworth visits Sucre, a charming town in the Andes. But four hours up the road is one of the most hellish places on earth There is nothing, during a stretch of hard travel, like unexpected delight. I had grown weary. My brain was joggled, my bottom numb. Who expects charm and civilisation hidden in a fold of the Bolivian Andes hundreds of miles from anywhere? The town of Sucre took me entirely by surprise. What, I wondered, as I strolled into a sunny central plaza from the bus station, could have provoked such elegant building so long ago in such a distant place? For Sucre, even to the untrained eye, is a city of great age. I spent an hour parked on a bench, relaxing in the balmy atmosphere of the Plaza Veinte-cinco de Mayo. It is named, like so many squares and boulevards in Latin America, after the outbreak of a revolution. Sucre's revolution was no ordinary banana-republic bunfight, though. It was, in fact, the mother of all Latin American revolutions. On May 25, 185 years ago, a call to revolt rose from here that was to echo across Spanish America. Taken up by the 'Great Liberator', the military genius Simon Bolivar, it was to lead in a few turbulent years to the independence of half the continent. But it was not a dream of revolution that kept me sitting so long in reverie. What absorbed my imagination, rather, were the remnants of pre-independence Bolivia. From my bench I gazed out above the white walls and wrought-iron balconies overlooking the plaza. Here, amid statues and fountains, spires and towers, was a wonderfully mixed collection of colonial architecture - everything from renaissance palazzi to baroque cathedrals to neo-classical administrative buildings. In fact, as far as Sucre is concerned, independence was just yesterday: less then 50 years after Columbus sailed to the new world, the Spanish colonists of Sucre were building San Lorenzo, the first of the city's 24 imposing churches. Sucre today is little more than a provincial town hidden away in a fertile Andean valley. It was not always so. In the mid-1500s Phillip II of Spain named La Plata, as it was then called, as his Audiencia - the administrative capital of what today includes large parts of Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia. By the early 1600s La Plata was accorded the theological autonomy of an archbishopric; by the 1620s Spanish Jesuits had built the University of San Xavier, one of the earliest in the Americas. Sucre has been a sophisticated place of culture and learning for a long time. It still is. I enjoyed strolling through monasteries, convents, churches and palaces from the distant past. Equally, I enjoyed the youthfulness to which Sucre's antiquity now forms a backdrop. Today the biggest business in town is education. Behind Sucre's white-washed walls, in delightful flowered cloisters and courtyards, student life goes on apace. There are dozens of faculties, institutes, seminaries, colleges and schools scattered about the town. What could be more agreeable, I thought, as I strolled about the Plaza in the cool of early evening? On the benches among palms and citrus trees pretty, dark-haired schoolgirls in white uniforms sat chatting and laughing, their books forgotten. In the cafes around the square groups of young men and women ate, drank and whiled away the hours. Young couples, oblivious to the world, strolled hand in hand past the cathedral. I tried to imagine it all 300 years ago. It would not have been that different. Learning was one thing, but Sucre was also a place made for pleasure and relaxation. One question still bothered me. What had kept it all going? What purpose did colonial La Plata serve the Spaniards? You do not build a sophisticated centre of civilisation on a distant continent hundreds of miles inland along difficult mountain trails for no reason. The next day I asked Ivan Escobar, a Bolivian Indian graduate student who was showing me the marvellous green-tiled monastery of San Felipe Neri, to explain. Like most Indians, Ivan - his militantly Marxist father gave him a Russian name - is bitter about Spanish colonial history. 'Behind these tiles,' he said as we stood in the bell tower and looked out over the sun-splashed roofs of the city, 'are stone blocks from the mountain-side. They were brought by Indians who were told by Spanish priests that each time they brought a stone to build the church God would absolve them of a sin. 'But the Spanish did not come to relieve us of our sins. They came to relieve us of our wealth. You have to look no further than the name of this city to know how and why it was made. In Spanish, La Plata means silver.' He turned to the south side of the tower and pointed to the high Andes. 'Four hours up the road is what is left of the largest silver mine in the world. If you want to see the other side of Spanish colonial culture, go to Potosi.' In The Time Machine, HG Wells portrayed a world inhabited by two races of humans. One spent its whole time in pleasant surroundings in the pursuit of leisure; the other laboured unceasingly in horrifying workshops deep under ground. Visiting Potosi after my stay in Sucre, I could not help thinking I had entered Wells' world. I arrived in Potosi late at night, filthy with the dust of untarred mountain roads. At 13,000ft, Potosi is the highest city in the world, as bleak and distant and uncomforting a place as you will encounter. Drizzle began to fall and the thin Andean air was raw as I set off down long, empty streets to find a hotel. Great roughly-cut stone cobbles glinted in the light of occasional street lamps. The houses on either side, their plaster facades stained and peeling, were tightly barred and shuttered. There was still a shop or two open; under weak light-bulbs dark-skinned Indian women sat huddled in blankets beside mean little stocks of merchandise. Once I tripped over a small child defecating in the gutter. Two drunks stumbled by, dragging a third. By the time I found a room I was feeling too desolate to inquire about dinner, but pulled the blankets over my head and went to sleep. From my window the next morning I could see the Cerro Rico - the Rich Mountain - a great naked red cone of rock looming over the city. By 9am Marco Mamani had assembled a small group of tourists like myself opposite the thick-walled and fortress-like Moneda, the old royal mint, and off we set for the Cerro Rico. Marco now makes his living showing visitors over the mountain, but in the past he worked there as a miner and knows the life only too well. Small presents for the miners we would meet in the Cero Rico, he told us, would be greatly appreciated. We stopped at one of the shops that line the steep streets leading to the base of the mountain. Leaning against the walls and piled in crates were shovels, pick-axes, helmets, rubber boots, hammers, chisels and dozens of other implements of the miner's trade. 'What would you advise as a gift?' we asked Marco. 'Oh, dynamite and coca leaves are what they like best,' he replied. It sounded quite a mixture. I bought six sticks of one and  1/2 lb of the other. If the 12,000 Indian co-operative miners who still work the Cerro Rico sit outside and chew huge wads of coca leaves for an hour or so every day before going to work, it is because the shafts and galleries and rock faces of the Rich Mountain are too awful to face entirely sober. A great seething ant-hill, this must be one of the most hellish places in the world. Down we plunged into the bowels of the earth, Marco leading, we following by the light of the lamps mounted on our borrowed helmets. The galleries of the Cerro Rico are low and narrow, and lead up and downwards through 10 levels at impossibly steep angles. Some of our progress required feats of alpinism, the kind that requires diligent searches for toe and fingerholds. Yet we passed men, bare-chested in the heat of the mine, hefting 100lb loads of ore up these slopes. They use nothing but dynamite and the type of primitive tools used in the Middle Ages; there is no mechanical equipment. The biggest risks are invisible: silica dust, asbestos fibres, arsenic and other toxic gases, acetylene vapours, the trapped by-products of mining detonations. Silicosis is almost universal; the average lifespan of a Potosi miner is 40 years. And what is it all for? Today, the rich seams gone and the mine virtually worked out, miners earn about Dollars 2 a day. For nearly three centuries, though, beginning in the mid-1500s, the mine's production was legendary. 'I am Potosi, treasure of the world and the envy of kings,' read the city's imperial coat of arms. By the end of the 1600s Potosi was the largest city in the Americas, its population comprised mostly of mine slaves. Many who made their fortunes in bleak Potosi lived in lush Sucre. The silver mined here and minted at the Moneda was carried by llama-train down the long, tortuous Camino de Plata, the Silver Road, to the Pacific port of Arica. The silver not pirated by English buccaneers on its way home made the wealth of the Spanish empire. The cost in human terms was appalling. Indian and African slaves remained in the mine for months at a time, eating, sleeping and dying underground. At the bottom of the mine, Marco showed us a frightening man-sized bust of Tio, the powerful underground devil whom miners propitiate with gifts of coca, cigarettes and alcohol. It is no accident that his face and beard are those of a Spaniard. It is estimated that under Spanish rule 8m men died in the mines of Potosi. Today, in recognition of its tragic history, the city has been recognised by Unesco as a world heritage site. A few days later, I was back in the warmth and comfort of Sucre. The 12 carved stone apostles on the tower of the cathedral appeared just as splendid as they had before. The courtyards of the university looked equally as pleasant. But I was not entirely at ease. I was seeing them in a different light.</p>

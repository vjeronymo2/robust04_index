			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: TRUMPETER SPREADS THE JOY OF MUSIC  </P> <P> Douglas Thompson has spent most his life playing music for the love of it.  </P> <P> Financially, "I'm not doing too bad, but then again I'm not doing too great,"  said Thompson, who favors the trumpet.  </P> <P> Many times, "When I'm at a low ebb, I've had to find jobs outside music to  survive."  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach resident decided at age 21 to become a professional  entertainer. Later he wanted to be a professional trumpet player. He finally  settled on being a band leader and director.  </P> <P> While he currently works in customer relations at a car agency, Thompson is the  director of the Businessman's Band, although not all the players are  businessmen. In fact, the band has had several names including Music Man's  Band, Fountain Valley Community Band and Band X.  </P> <P> In 1983, Thompson went to Washington as a member of what he said was the  world's largest non-marching marching band.  </P> <P> "We didn't march, we just played march music," he explained.  </P> <P> "I get a lot of joy working with my music and with people in music," said  trumpeter Thompson, who sometimes switches to piano, trombone or drums. "I've  always said if you do music for the money in it, then you're not doing music."  </P> <P> Added Thompson: "In fact, serious musicians are strictly in it for the  creativity, love and sharing of music and that's the 100% feeling most of us  have."  </P> <P> But while there is love for music, "a musician has to keep his financial life  on an even keel and that's why I have to take a number of different jobs," he  continued. "It goes with being a musician."  </P> <P> And he knows of what he speaks.  </P> <P> "When I was in college (Cal State Los Angeles) I titled my term paper "Earning  a Living as a Musician," which he said addressed the problem of keeping body  and soul together while being an artist.  </P> <P> He also attended Orange Coast College and Huntington Beach High School.  </P> <P> These days, Thompson is attempting to develop a 200-member community band that  he hopes will consist mainly of businessmen, but that is open to "anyone who  can read music and play," as he put it.  </P> <P> The current 32-member band rehearses Thursday nights at Costa Mesa High School  and plays at Orange Coast College football and basketball games as well as  other community functions.  </P> <P> Thompson, who once was assistant director of a U.S. Army band in West Germany,  complains about the small number of community bands in Orange County as well as  the limited number of places for adults to learn and perform music.  </P> <P> "I don't want to see a complete dry-up in community performing arts training,"  moaned the one-time church choir singer who said he was part of 13 performing  arts groups when he was 17.  </P> <P> After his Army discharge, Thompson went to Sacramento in hopes of persuading  lobbyists and legislators to push for more funding for the performing arts.  </P> <P> "There wasn't a whole lot of performing arts training going on and the future  of musicians was at stake," he said. "It was difficult getting the attention of  the right people."  </P> <P> But later, besides his work with community bands and orchestras, he also got  the attention of Boy Scouts.  </P> <P> "In 1974 we formed Band Explorer Post 808," said Thompson, who was the post  leader. "The Boy Scout Council said it was the first (such band) ever formed in  the western half of the United States."  </P> <P> Some scoundrel stole the American flag from the Garden Grove home of Lu and  Paul Bole, who have flown the flag atop a 25-foot pole 24 hours a day for the  past 10 years.  </P> <P> Word about the theft reached Mac McCullock, Americanism co-chairman for the  Garden Grove Elks Lodge.  </P> <P> Within a day he presented the couple with a flag that had been flown over the  Capitol in Washington.  </P> <P> "Flying the American Flag is an important part of the Elks Americanism  program," he said.  </P></p>

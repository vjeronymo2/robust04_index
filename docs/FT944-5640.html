			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Hanson shops around after rise Hanson shares continued their recent recovery yesterday as the Anglo-US conglomerate reported a 26 per cent increase in annual operating profits to Pounds 1.23bn and said it was ready to take on another big acquisition. The shares have lagged the market this year on worries that the group was running out of steam. But Lord Hanson, chairman, declared yesterday that its future 'remains exciting'. 'The economic resurgence has provided a stimulus to improve trading profits still further, while seeking strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value,' he said. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said the group had excellent opportunities for organic growth but was also ready to take on another big deal. 'The balance sheet is in a position to make another major step forward if we find the opportunity. That is certainly what we are looking for.' Last year's operating profits, of which 54 per cent (against 43 per cent) were generated in the US, were boosted by the acquisition of Quantum Chemical in a Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.95bn) deal in September 1993, which contributed Pounds 100m after interest. Gearing, which rose to 86 per cent on completion, has now been reduced to 58 per cent, after Pounds 945m of disposals. Including disposal gains, group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.35bn, from Pounds 1.02bn, on sales of Pounds 11.2bn (Pounds 9.76bn). Excluding exceptional items, profits were little changed at Pounds 1.01bn (Pounds 992m) and earnings per share, on the same basis, were 14.7p (14.4p). As previously signalled, the quarterly dividend is 3p (2.85p) for a total of 11.7p (11.4p). Mr Bonham said that Hanson wanted to combine dividend growth with a gradual reduction in cover from 1.25 times to about 1.5. The figures were accompanied by an upbeat assessment of prospects for the next two years. Mr David Clarke, chief executive of the US arm, Hanson Industries, said: 'We are very much on a roll, particularly with Quantum. We are even more enthusiastic about prospects for 1995 despite recent interest rate hikes.' Most of Hanson's cyclical chemicals and constructionrelated businesses are recovering strongly on both sides of the Atlantic, while profits at Peabody, the largest US coal producer, bounced to Pounds 144m (Pounds 70m) following the end of the long and expensive strike. The improvement in operating profit was largely offset by an interest bill of Pounds 223m (compared with income of Pounds 14m the previous year). This reflected higher borrowings but also the reduced spread between US and UK interest rates which Hanson has arbitraged very successfully. Mr William Landuyt, finance director, warned that the interest bill was likely to rise again this year. The shares added 2p to 237p. Lex, Page 16 Details and Background, Page 19</p>

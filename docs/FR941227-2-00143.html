PaineWebber, a Delaware corporation, is a registered broker-dealer and registered investment adviser. PaineWebber is a wholly owned subsidiary of Paine Webber Group Inc. (``PWG''). PaineWebber serves as the investment adviser and principal underwriter of registered investment companies and proposes to act as investment adviser and principal underwriter to additional investment companies in the future. A wholly owned subsidiary of PaineWebber, Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management Inc. (``Mitchell Hutchins'') serves as sub-advisor and sub-administrator to the registered investment companies underwritten and advised by PaineWebber. In addition, Mitchell Hutchins is the investment adviser and principal underwriter for a number of open-end and closed-end registered investment companies, and anticipates serving in similar capacities with regard to additional registered investment companies in the future. PaineWebber is also the sole depositor, or a co-depositor, and/or underwriter of numerous unit investment trusts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. General Electric Company (``GE''), the parent company of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Incorporated (``Kidder''), and Kidder have entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated October 17, 1994, with PWG. The asset purchase agreement provides for the purchase by PWG and certain of its subsidiaries of certain assets of Kidder and its subsidiaries, and contemplates the employment by PaineWebber of Kidder employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. PaineWebber currently is not disqualified from acting in any of the capacities specified in section 9(a) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Subject to receiving the requested exemption, however, PaineWebber proposes to employ Stanley S. Trotman, Jr. (``Mr. Trotman'') in the health sciences group within its investment banking department. Mr. Trotman is subject to a securities related injunction. Absent relief, Mr. Trotman's employment would cause PaineWebber to become disqualified under section 9(a) of the Act from acting in any of the capacities specified in that section. Accordingly, PaineWebber seeks the requested relief so that applicant, and any affiliated person of applicant, will not be disqualified from acting in any of the capacities specified in section 9(a) by reason of employing Mr. Trotman. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1990, the Commission exempted PaineWebber from the disqualification provisions of section 9(a) with respect to issues unrelated to this application.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> PaineWebber Incorporated, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Investment Company Act Release Nos. 17588 (July 16, 1990) (Notice) and 17789 (Oct. 10, 1990) (order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Mr. Trotman currently co-heads the health care group within the investment banking department of Kidder. Prior to holding this position, Mr. Trotman was a director of Charter Medical Corporation, T2 Medical, Inc., and Salick, Healthcare, Inc. Until February 16, 1990, when Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, the parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Incorporated (``Drexel''), filed for bankruptcy protection, Mr. Trotman was a managing director of Drexel in charge of the health care group in its corporate finance department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

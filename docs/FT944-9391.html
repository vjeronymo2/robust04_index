			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Saudi businessmen reach for the media stars: Roula Khalaf tracks a crowded race for dominance of the Mideast satellite television market Rival Saudi Arabian businessmen are spending close to Dollars 1bn in a race to become the Middle East's media moguls. Seduced by the glamour of the media age, and driven by an urge to influence the content of information and entertainment in one of the world's most conservative societies, they are already beaming more than 20 satellite television channels across the region. Satellite dishes have proliferated on rooftops in the area since the Gulf war with more than 400,000 in Saudi Arabia alone, in spite of a long-standing ban on dishes. CNN and Star TV, among others, opened a window to the world for people who had to contend for years with heavy - handed censorship of state-owned channels. Programming is so poor in some places that viewers look forward to the commercial breaks, and rent tapes of commercials from video shops. Saudi businessmen have rushed to capitalise on the new wave. They knew that the satellite intrusion was unnerving conservative governments. It was no longer acceptable for the image of an embracing couple on American shows such as Dallas or Dynasty, for example, to be frozen and substituted with a channel's logo, a common practice on some state-owned television stations. The would-be media magnates reckoned they could please both governments and viewers by launching a series of agreeable but sanitised channels. Three rival Saudis have led the quest for the Middle East's satellite viewers (there are an estimated 1m to 2.5m dishes in the Middle East): Sheikh Walid Al Ibrahim, a businessman whose sister is the wife of King Fahd; Sheikh Saleh Kamel, the billionaire owner of Islamic banking group Dallah Al-Baraka; and Emir Khalid Ibn Abdallah Ibn Abdel Rahman, who is married to the King's sister, and is head of the Mawarid Group, one of the kingdom's largest conglomerates. Mr Al Ibrahim started the trend in 1991 when he enlisted Mr Kamel's financial support to launch the Middle East Broadcasting Centre (MBC), the first pan - Arab satellite television station, which quickly gathered an audience of 27m as some Arab countries picked up the MBC signal and rebroadcast it. MBC, broadcast from London, is self-censored but its seeming independence from government control and its news programmes' international flavour - it has an office in Jerusalem, for instance - have made it popular in the region. Last year Mr Kamel sold his stake in MBC to launch a rival media company, Cairo-based Arabian Radio and Television (ART), which beams four dedicated channels of children's programmes, sports, movies and music. 'We will do anything we can do to protect our Arab children from the coming invasion from western countries,' Mr Saria Al Khatib, a manager at ART, says. MBC is preparing to launch four additional channels. Media consultants say ART and MBC are spending at least Dollars 200m each on their projects. Mr Ibn Abdallah has loftier ambitions, a more liberal mindset and a fatter wallet. In May, his Rome - based Orbit Communications Company is spending about Dollars 500m launching 16 television and four radio channels targeted at Mideast viewers. More Arab businessmen are joining the race. Mr Mohammad Al Sager, editor of Al Qabas, Kuwait's largest daily, is the biggest shareholder in a new company which has raised Dollars 50m to set up yet another pan-Arab channel, expected to be on the air next year. Various Arab countries, meanwhile, are broadcasting their state-owned channels via satellite. The Middle East market, however, is not big enough to support all the new channels. ART and MBC are aiming to attract mass audiences by beaming services for free until they get on cable systems, still to be set up in most of the region. Advertising revenue is still too low to support that many channels. In Saudi Arabia, the largest advertising market in the region, total advertising expenditure stood at Dollars 247m in 1993 with television's share a mere Dollars 57m, according to the Dubai-based Pan-Arab Research Centre. Orbit, meanwhile, is a pay television service catering to a small group of western-minded and more liberal viewers. It has signed lavish deals with American networks to rebroadcast news and entertainment programmes and commissioned the BBC to create a World Service Television in Arabic, which is already on the air. Orbit says it buys programmes that would not offend the sensitivities of the region and leaves them unedited. Just a few months into launch, however, some Orbit dealers who had been selling decoders for Dollars 10,000 have lowered their price to Dollars 6,000 - still a lot considering customers have to pay Dollars 90 to Dollars 200 a year in subscription fees after the first year. Meanwhile, the Saudi government earlier this year said it would begin to enforce its ban on satellite dishes. Although few have been taken down as a result and a black market in dishes is flourishing, the ban has dampened hopes of growth. At the same time the government is investing up to Dollars 500m in a cable system, which is easier to censor. That will put further pressure on the market but may give MBC an edge over its rivals because the system will be operated by an MBC affiliate, also majority owned by Mr Al Ibrahim. The system will start with 20 channels and eventually reach 30. Five channels are likely to go to MBC, and Arab government channels, which will receive priority, will take at least a half dozen more. And as the Saudi government seeks to make a return on its investment in cable, it may at last close the doors of the most lucrative Mideast market to satellite dishes.</p>

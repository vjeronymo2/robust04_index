			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES: THE ART OF THE DEAL;  </P> <P> NO ONE WANTS TO BE A SUCKER WHEN IT COMES TO BARGAINING  </P> <P> HOW MANY WORDS do you want to read today -- 200, 300? This column is supposed  to be 850 words. But let's make a deal.  </P> <P> Don't want to bargain? Neither do I. Yet, lately it seems as if the world has  become a big bazaar. Maybe it's the recession, but price tags everywhere have  come unglued. On Main Street in Santa Monica, where I sometimes shop, it used  to be that I'd pick up an item for a closer look and a supercilious clerk would  say, "$500," and I'd put it down. Now as soon as something catches my eye, the  supercilious clerk chirps, "I can give it to you a little cheaper."  </P> <P> Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against lower prices. I just don't like to  haggle. Once a price starts fluctuating, I know I can't win. Someone -- anyone!  -- is bound to get a better deal. And what fun is buying something for $300  that used to be $500 when tomorrow it's going to be $160?  </P> <P> Lots of fun for some people. "I like to bargain better than I like sex," says  my sister-in-law, Robbie. "When I get a good deal, it makes my whole week."  What's a good deal? "A 75%-off sale -- that's a bargain. Ten cents on the  dollar -- that's a bargain. Of course, then I say, 'I love it, but can you do a  little better on the price?' "  </P> <P> I wouldn't have the nerve. I'm never sure when dickering is appropriate. It  used to be something you did only on vacation. If I go to a picturesque stall  in a foreign land and an older woman sitting behind a pile of straw hats  demands 2,000 pesos or won or some other oversized currency that has a guy with  a mustache on it, then I know I'm supposed to say, "1,500." But now people  dicker everywhere.  </P> <P> "I was behind this woman in the checkout line at the supermarket," my  grandmother says, "and the cashier tells her, 'That will be $168.42.' And this  woman says, 'I'll give you $100.' " She was up to $125 when Grandma left the  store.  </P> <P> Of course, sometimes you have to bargain just to stay even, like when you're  trying to get any five rooms of carpet cleaned for the coupon price of $24.95  while an abusive representative keeps warning you that the steam cleaning is  absolutely useless without the color brighteners, Teflon coating and  preconditioning (none of which are included).  </P> <P> "There's always an angle," my brother, Bobby, says. "That's the root of all  bargains -- the unknown. Like I bought a $400 suit for $225. I thought I got a  great price, and then they clobbered me on alterations. Such a deal. Nobody  could have walked out with that suit unless he was 6-11 and didn't want  finished bottoms."  </P> <P> And to think I called my brother for some bargaining tips. I wanted a wall  built in my yard and had been taking bids. My lowest bidder, a contractor from  Tonga, the Friendly Islands, measured and said his price was $1,000, "but for  you, $950." I didn't know what to say.  </P> <P> "Tell him you'll give him $500," Bobby advised. "If you want a good price,  you've got to be ridiculous." I couldn't be that ridiculous.  </P> <P> My husband agreed that I had to negotiate. "I don't think they have a word for  fixed prices in the Friendly Islands," Duke said. "Tell him $800, and he'll  settle for $850." And he did. But why couldn't he just ask for that? "Because  then he thinks people will feel cheated if they don't get it for $700," Duke  explained.  </P> <P> Nobody wants to feel like a sucker. And I suppose that a lot of folks would  look at my nice new wall and fret that they could have gotten it for less. Not  me. I have this principle about bargaining called the Mexican Blouse Theory. It  goes like this: You're at a booth in Tijuana. You see an embroidered peasant  blouse that costs $25. You rant and rave for 45 minutes until the senora agrees  to part with it for $3. But ask yourself: Do you really want a $3 blouse?  </P> <P> "Do I really want another brass Aztec calendar?" says my friend Doug. "No, but  if I can get it for $5, what the heck?" He sees bargaining as a competitive  sport at which he excels. "It has all the advantages of exercise. Your heart  gets pumping. You raise your voice. You pace, you pound, you wag fingers."  </P> <P> That is not my idea of a pleasant shopping experience. And neither is this:  "You must be willing to walk away," Doug says. "It's the basic rule of  bargaining. If you can walk away, you can't lose."  </P> <P> Last year, my husband and I were in Hong Kong, home of the adjustable price  tag. I fell in love with an adorable pair of shoes. I was ready to buy them,  but then Duke, who likes bargaining in a foreign country because it's one of  the few social interactions possible when you know only 20 words of the  language, decided to get me a better price. I watched in horror as he and the  salesman bickered over $30 HK.  </P> <P> "Let's go," Duke said, leading me away from my beautiful shoes. "It's an act,"  he whispered. Luckily for him, the salesman ran after us and met our price.  </P> <P> Then the most incredible thing happened. I'd be happy to tell you about it.  </P> <P> Just make me an offer.  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Currencies influence European trade Continued turbulence in European currency markets was again the main trading influence on bourses last week, while good economic news from the US and a strong performance from Japan lifted sentiment elsewhere. The FT-A World index rose 1.2 per cent in local currency terms. Finland stood out with a positive improvement in very high turnover: by midweek some FM100m (Dollars 19.8m) of business was transacted, approaching five times the average daily level. Mr Peter Lawrence of Kleinwort Benson says that the Finnish market reacted negatively to the devaluation of the Swedish krona, which fanned fears that it would harm Finnish industry. However, the fact that the local currency fell in line with that of its neighbour effectively erased worries about a loss in competitiveness. The lifting of a threatened nationwide strike also had a positive effect on the market, Mr Lawrence adds. Gains were seen across the board, and international conglomerates were also heavily bought. Ireland attracted interest on expectations that it will be forced to devalue. Mr Robby Kelleher of the brokers Davy's notes that the market was mimicking the situation in the UK when the FTSE showed solid gains in the days leading up to sterling's withdrawal from the ERM. However, Ireland has consistently underperformed other European markets this year and in spite of the rally of the last 10 days the index remains 13 per cent down year-on-year. Elsewhere, New Zealand showed a near 9 per cent gain on the week in local currency terms. Ms Pauline McAtamney of Ord Minnett in London says that progress in the Gatt trade talks the previous weekend provided a positive background. Strong interim results from NZ Telecom and Carter Holt Harvey, a management reshuffle at Brierley and a major asset sale by Fletcher Challenge provided the main corporate news.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change    % change                      % change in local currency*  sterling* in US Dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------             1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of   Start of    Start of                                             1992       1992        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.09     -3.22   -18.96     -12.62      +2.32      -17.34 Belgium      -1.17     -0.11    +0.17      -1.76     +14.98       -7.11 Denmark      -1.26     +4.98   -26.90     -26.01     -12.38      -29.22 Finland      +6.88    +10.27    +6.78     +11.95     +11.48       -9.93 France       +1.49     +0.52    -0.06      -0.79     +17.42       -5.14 Germany      -1.32     +1.49    -7.93      -6.42      +9.96      -11.17 Ireland      +4.59     +3.37   -15.95     -16.58      -3.14      -21.76 Italy        -3.50     +0.05   -10.93      -9.29      -7.52      -25.28 Netherlands  +0.29     +1.14    +2.86      +3.17     +21.45       -1.89 Norway       -0.52     +1.66   -17.41     -16.04      -5.13      -23.36 Spain        +2.04    +10.79   -10.20     -10.94      -7.66      -25.40 Sweden       +4.62    +24.07   +13.27     +12.38     +13.26       -8.50 Switzerland  +0.89     -0.52   +11.67     +11.23     +29.52       +4.62 UK           +0.98     +3.92   +11.83     +10.68     +10.68      -10.59 EUROPE       +0.50     +2.99    +2.83      +2.60     +11.11      -10.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +3.22     +1.76   -12.75     -14.72      -4.23      -22.63 Hong Kong    +2.39     -4.25   +40.75     +37.17     +70.72      +37.92 Japan        +2.37     +2.71   -24.20     -22.73      -3.88      -22.35 Malaysia     -0.38     +2.76   +23.57     +19.48     +58.94      +28.40 New Zealand  +8.84    +17.18    -3.82      -3.96     +13.38       -8.39 Singapore    +4.78     +6.53    -4.06      -6.86     +14.10       -7.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       +0.45     -1.81    -6.64      -8.03      +2.58      -17.13 USA          +0.81     +2.87   +14.77      +3.53     +28.15       +3.53 Mexico       +3.94     +8.94   +22.88     +16.38     +40.69      +13.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa +3.58     +3.93   -15.11     -12.45     -28.65      -42.36  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  +1.24     +2.72    -1.79      -5.05     +13.02       -8.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on November 27th 1992.

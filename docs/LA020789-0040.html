			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS BIG GUYS GOBBLE THE S&amp;LS, LET THEM PAY THEIR DUES  </P> <P> The Bush team leaped before it looked when it suggested nicking  savings-and-loan depositors for the sins of S&amp;L management, and got burned  as a result. But in its fallback plan it didn't have far to look to spot the  takeover operators as the targets for the Treasury to hit first.  </P> <P> All S&amp;Ls, like Caesar's Gaul, are divided into three parts: those already  put out of their misery and handed over to new owners, those slowly twisting in  the wind before being blown away, and survivors.  </P> <P> If President Bush directs the Treasury's zeal against the savings-and-loans, he  can invite the electorate, Congress and the media to spend the next four years  reading his lips without a peep of protest against hidden taxes levied on  S&amp;L depositors. The S&amp;Ls already taken over have no stockholders who  might complain, only proprietors keeping the goodies to themselves. They would  not retaliate by threatening a mortgage lenders' strike. Their purpose in  buying S&amp;Ls is not to make mortgage loans.  </P> <P> The new proprietors evaluated the defunct S&amp;Ls auctioned off to them as tax  havens, not as investment opportunities. All of them put up peanuts to pick up  push-carts full of assets. None of them need to worry a hoot about local  real-estate conditions, values or credit risks around the country. All of them  have been buying -- more precisely, accepting -- rich shelter from taxes  already paid on their own past earnings, as well as from taxes to be owed on  future earnings.  </P> <P> The President's advisers believe in the "efficient market theory." It has  dictated a parallel White House decision to designate the banks as the  country's future community mortgage lenders. Before the fuss started over  charging S&amp;L depositors and sparing the owners, operators with market  smarts spotted the connection that the sponsors of the two-bit deposit  assessment overlooked. Anyone buying S&amp;Ls was getting an option to sell to  eager bank bidders.  </P> <P> So, on top of the tax benefits that they could count before they put their  purchase money up, the new S&amp;L owners can also bank -- no pun intended --  on takeover bids from banks at prices that they can set themselves. Obviously  only the bigger and better banks can or will bid, and they will bid against one  another. Their targets will be local franchises to take deposits,not the  challenge to revitalize real-estate markets in remote neighborhoods; S&amp;L  passbooks draw the lowest interest rates in sight, and bank credit cards  marketed to depositors earn the highest. Efficient market theory assumes that,  given today's high risk in mortgage lending, banks will seek deposits but hold  back on mortgage loans. "Name" banks have been feeling their way toward going  national for years. Thanks to the disastrous consequences of diversification of  the S&amp;Ls into commercial banking, the opportunity is coming to them faster  than they dared hope, and as benefactors, not predators. The name banks will  happily pay top dollar for all the S&amp;Ls that they can gobble up. By the  time they do, the FDIC, which insures their deposits, will long since have  taken over from the FSLIC, which no longer has the wherewithal to insure  S&amp;L deposits. The efficient market theory has already dictated this  decision.  </P> <P> What about the second group of S&amp;Ls, the endangered ones? They're barely  making it, subject to the danger that any new burden would whip up another  storm and leave them its orphans. True, the calendar cut-off stopped further  giveaways of tax benefits at the turn of the year, and Congress is not likely  to renew the hunting season. Nevertheless, two considerations argue for  extending insurance assessments to this second group of shaky S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> One is that the banks are now "in play," as they say in the takeover game, as  bride-grooms ready to rescue any S&amp;Ls cast as damsels in distress. The  incidental one is that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has already put  endangered S&amp;Ls on notice of their serious exposure to a jump in interest  rates, which would hurt them more than a charge for deposit insurance. The  Treasury admits that each full-point increase in rates will raise the S&amp;L  bailout tab, and therefore the government spending that Greenspan deplores, by  another $12 billion to $15 billion.  </P> <P> Finally, the profitable S&amp;Ls are in a class by themselves. The bidding  contest that the banks are positioned to start for S&amp;Ls that are under  water or merely treading it will jump market valuations of S&amp;Ls still going  full steam ahead. The genuinely profitable S&amp;Ls are enjoying the best of  both worlds: worst case, can't lose; best case, big win. They will attract the  first and the highest bank bids.  </P> <P> The sooner the S&amp;Ls cut off the argument about who is to foot the bill for  insuring S&amp;L deposits, and volunteer to do so, the more depositors they  will have to turn over to the banks. The banks will judge the cost a bargain. A  little birdie has belatedly tipped off the White House staff to this fact of  financial politics. Efficient market theory invites a try at passing along  hidden costs.  </P></p>

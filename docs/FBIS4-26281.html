			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- An exhibition of more  than 60 arts and crafts works from Western Mindanao in the  Philippines opened here today.    The exhibits on display include colorful costumes, wood  carvings, embroidery and musical instruments made by the local  tribespeople.    Buhe, vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress  [NPC] Standing Committee, and visiting Philippines  Vice-President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, participated in the  opening ceremony.    Buhe's wife Zhu Lan and Mrs. Estrada cut the ribbon for the  exhibition.    Then the visiting couple visited the Palace Museum, built  over 500 years ago in the Ming Dynasty, and mounted the rostrum  of Tiananmen, where the late Chairman Mao Zedong announced the  founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.    Yesterday Estrada watched a military display performed by  the  people's armed police near the capital airport.</p>

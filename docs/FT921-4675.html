			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Ulster talks to start on Monday THE British and Irish governments agreed in Dublin yesterday to suspend any further meetings of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference until after the British general election. This creates a brief space for 'round-table' talks by the four main political parties in Ulster to begin on Monday. These will cease as soon as the election is called, which is widely expected to be early next week.</p>

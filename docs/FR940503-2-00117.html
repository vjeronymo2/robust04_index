San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;13, a possession-only license held by the Southern California Edison Company (SCE or the licensee). The exemption would apply to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1 (SONGS 1), a permanently shutdown plant located at the SCE site in San Diego County, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that SONGS 1 would be exempted from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection). The licensee requested the elimination of its required participation in a letter dated February 2, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SONGS 1 was permanently shut down in November 1992, and defueling of the reactor completed in March 1993. Upon licensee certification of the defueling on March 9, 1993, Amendment No. 150 to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;13 became effective, changing the license to a possession-only license. The exemption addresses withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since SONGS 1 no longer contributes as great a risk to the retrospective rating plan participants as does an operating plant, this reduction in risk should be reflected in the indemnification requirements to which the licensee is subject. Approval of this request would allow a more equitable allocation of financial risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action does not involve any environmental impacts. The proposed exemption is in a subject area, changes in surety, insurance and/or indemnity requirements, for which the Commission in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(10) has determined that a license amendment would meet the criteria for categorical exclusion from the need for either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, there is reasonable assurance that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident or reduce the margin of safety, no changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluents that may be released offsite, and there would be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal alternative would be to deny the action. This would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would not enhance the protection of the environment nor public health and safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Environmental Assessment related to the conversion of the Provisional Operating License to a Full Term Operating License issued to Southern California Edison Company for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1, on September 16, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff consulted with a representative of the State of California regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee application to amend Indemnity Agreement No. B&hyph;31, dated February 2, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room at the Main Library, University of California, Post Office Box 19557, Irvine, California 92713. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 22nd day of April 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Seymour H.

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MEGA-MEMENTOS;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS ARCHIVISTS SORT THROUGH CROONER RUDY VALLEE'S 4-TON COLLECTION  </P> <P> Rudy Vallee, the megaphone-carrying crooner and popular radio personality, was  a pack rat, say archivists at the Thousand Oaks Library who recently began  cataloguing the four-ton collection of papers and mementos that he gathered  over more than 60 years.  </P> <P> Vallee saved X-rays of an impacted wisdom tooth that was extracted in the  1970s, brief notes that his fourth wife left on the refrigerator and a copy of  the formula for his golden hair dye.  </P> <P> Fortunately for students of entertainment history, Vallee also kept thousands  of fan letters, radio scripts, musical scores and other items that provide an  unusually complete record of the popular culture of his day, said Henry Matoon,  an archivist hired to catalogue the collection.  </P> <P> The material fills about 560 crates and spans Vallee's long career, which began  in the 1920s, reached its peak during the next two decades when he became one  of the nation's most successful vaudeville and radio personalities, and  continued until he was well into his 70s.  </P> <P> The collection will be available to the public by January, Matoon said.  </P> <P> "Thank God Vallee saved all that stuff," said Larry Gassman, president of the  Los Angeles-based Society to Preserve and Encourage Radio Drama, Variety and  Comedy, or SPERDVAC. "For anyone writing his biography or interested in  history, its value is incalculable."  </P> <P> Soon after Vallee died in 1986 at age 84, the Thousand Oaks Library Foundation  bought the collection for $275,000 as part of an ambitious program to establish  an archive on the history of radio and early television.  </P> <P> The foundation, which raised the money through private donations and a $125,000  </P> <P> grant from the city of Thousand Oaks, outbid the University of Wyoming and  several other institutions for the highly coveted collection, said Antoinette  Hagopian, the group's president. By owning the prized Vallee collection, the  foundation "is on its way to building a first-class archive" on the performing  arts akin to those at UCLA and other area universities, she said.  </P> <P> Although it is rare for a small city library to embark on such an ambitious  endeavor, the foundation believes that the role of a library "is to preserve  history, not just to provide typical library materials to a community," she  said.  </P> <P> The foundation could have chosen early California history or other topics, but  decided to devote its archive to radio and early television because many local  residents are employed in the entertainment industry and have offered to  bequeath their papers to the foundation, Hagopian said.  </P> <P> The library has more than 2,000 books on the subject and about 6,000 scripts.  In addition, it has the papers of Clete Roberts, a famous World War II news  correspondent and veteran Los Angeles broadcaster who lived in the area until  his death in 1984, she said.  </P> <P> In 1987, the foundation came under fire from some city residents, who  criticized it for acquiring the Vallee collection in the face of cutbacks in  library services that year. But officials defended the acquisition by saying  that the collection is an investment whose value will continually increase, and  the outcry was short-lived.  </P> <P> "We bought it for a sweet price," Hagopian said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Grant  </P> <P> In January, the foundation received a $50,000 grant from the state library to  begin cataloguing Vallee's huge collection, which he kept in a three-story  building on his Hollywood Hills estate.  </P> <P> Surrounded by pictures of the clean-cut singer and by old newspapers with  headlines devoted to his appearances, archivists Matoon and Martin Getzler have  applied themselves to the massive task of sifting through the thousands of  newspaper clippings, photographs, and financial and other records. While they  are working, they sometimes play tapes of Vallee favorites, such as "My Time Is  Your Time" and "I'm Just a Vagabond Lover," Getzler said.  </P> <P> Vallee's widow, Eleanor Vallee Hustedt, owns the copyright to many of Vallee's  personal papers, and researchers who want to publish the materials will have to  approach her for permission, library officials said.  </P> <P> The collection contains none of the original megaphones that became Vallee's  trademark, said Ruth Leonard, special collections librarian. Some mementos are  now in the Smithsonian Institution and at the University of Maine. However, the  library has hundreds of recordings of Vallee's radio shows, which will be  copied onto audiocassettes and loaned to library patrons, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Sex Symbol  </P> <P> The two archivists say they have already made some interesting discoveries  about Vallee. For instance, they have come across records that indicate that  Vallee hired a detective to follow a woman with whom he was romantically  involved before he met his fourth wife. Vallee, who graduated from Yale  University with a degree in Spanish and philosophy, had a clear, cultured voice  that made him one of the first male sex symbols, Getzler said.  </P> <P> "In the early days of radio, the fan letters he got from women were on a high  romantic plane," Getzler said. "Later, in the '40s, the women were a lot more  forward and tried to instigate meetings with Vallee."  </P> <P> From the age of 8, Vallee saved memorabilia from his life because, even as a  Maine schoolboy who played the saxophone, he believed that he would become  famous, said Hustedt, whom he married in 1949. Vallee knew his collection  "would be valuable for posterity, just like Nixon's," she said.  </P> <P> "Let's face it, the guy was marvelously charming, but he saved this stuff  because he had a monumental ego," said Gene Gressley, former director of the  University of Wyoming's American Heritage Center, which tried to buy the  collection. "The stairway in his house was lined with pictures of him and  famous people, and I remember it took us two hours to get downstairs because he  stopped to tell me about each one."  </P> <P> Getzler and Matoon acknowledge that there are materials in the collection that  indicate that Vallee thought highly of himself, including records of his  unsuccessful efforts to get the Los Angeles City Council to change the name of  his street to Rue de Vallee. But Vallee was also generous, they say, paying  medical bills for friends and employees in need.  </P> <P> "The Rudy Vallee collection is one of the best windows onto a star of his high  caliber," Gressley said. "You can understand a lot about 20th-Century radio and  film by studying that collection."  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Hosing us for all we've got Water privatisation is a rip-off, a steal, a plunder, legalised mugging, piracy, licensed theft, a diabolical liberty, a huge scam, a cheat, a snatch, a grab, a swindle. You already knew that, of course, as did I. We may even have found a few of the ducats falling in our own direction, taking one thing with another. What is fresh, and the cause of a sense of annoyance I find hard to suppress, is the evidence in yesterday's report from the National Consumer Council. We are talking, the council reminds us, not of 10 large and 21 small private companies struggling to scratch a living in a competitive market, but of an industry that is a 'monopoly supplier of an essential service to a captive market'. What else would it be but a huge machine for taking money out of customers' pockets? The late Nicholas Ridley, the minister principally responsible for this outrage, told me his game plan in advance of its announcement. The pipes and sewers had been allowed to rot, he explained. Worse, the environmental movement wanted purer water. 'It would be cheaper to deliver free Perrier to every house in the land,' he said. No Treasury, under any government, had found or would ever find the necessary capital. Besides, water charges were linked to the rates, which he was abolishing in favour of the poll tax. Private companies could raise capital in the markets. They would be more efficient. That would release further funds. There would be a modernisation charge, but it would be manageable. If you believe the consumer council, these forecasts were wrong. As to raising money in the markets, the overall gearing of the water businesses rose from virtually zero in 1989-90 to 24 per cent in 1992-93, the last year for which full accounts were available. To be fair, the companies are about to borrow a great deal more. Against that, no significant capital has been raised through equity issues. That could be expensive, but only while the industry insists on paying out many times its honest worth. Apart from the near-tripling of its share valuation, gross dividends rose by 63 per cent a year on average between 1989-90 and 1992-93. Yet these should be low-risk investments, comparable to index-linked gilts. As to efficiency, operating costs per unit of water delivered rose by 9.7 per cent between 1990-91 and 1992-93. The equivalent figure for sewage was 16.5 per cent. That leaves the modernisation fees, the ones you and I pay. Far from being manageable, the consumer council finds them incomprehensible. The companies are masters of financial disguise. The opacity of their accounting practices varies, but little daylight gets through. The consumers' council has to make best guesses. It questions transfers between budgets for continuing maintenance and the costs of construction of genuine new assets, not to mention cross-subsidisation of non-core businesses. In language we can all understand, the water gang has exaggerated its forecast bill for modernisation, spent less rapidly than it said it would, gambled and lost on out-of-industry ventures, and (although the consumer council does not say this) paid its directors handsomely for their non-service. These caporegimes, some of them unemployable in competitive industry, have awarded themselves large slices of the protection money they extract from us. And do we pay] 'Of all the privatised utilities, domestic water and sewerage bills have shot up the most since privatisation - by 67 per cent on average between 1989-90 and 1994-95,' the council observes. Using a variety of assumptions, it intimates that the bulk of the money has been distributed in dividends. It notes that '. . . the 69 per cent contribution by consumers to-wards additional capital expenditure looks extreme-ly generous', which is a kind way of putting it, since the renovation and environmental expenditure story, while clearly true, has plainly been exaggerated in a bogus effort to excuse the monopolists' voracity. Genuine hardship is inflicted on the poor. Income support does not account directly for water bills. A notional, demonstrably inadequate, amount is included in the overall payment. It may be unreasonable to ask the water companies to bear this burden, but the pre-1988 practice, of taxpayers reimbursing all or part of the actual water bill along with the rates and the rent, is the only civilised alternative to a cap on charges. Tory policies have made the poor worse off, in some cases absolutely as well as relatively. Making water high-cost for low-income households is indecent. The industry regulator, Ofwat, must not allow itself to be deceived. Its director general, Mr Ian Byatt, has to show he can be tougher than the initial Ridley formula. It will be difficult, given his terms of reference. He has to allow for a reasonable rate of return. Few private companies enjoy such a guarantee. I would adore a portfolio of stocks backed by the Ridley-inspired promise. It permits all sorts of jiggery-pokery to be inflicted upon the accounting process. The regulator should be called Ofrip. We shall see how well Mr Byatt has learnt this lesson when he publishes his price decisions on July 28. Meanwhile, the voters are being roused to take their revenge, as they did over the poll tax. There has been a large swing to the Liberal Democrats in the south-west, where water charges have risen most rapidly. Northern electorates are already aware of the political significance of water imposts. Labour's spokesman, Mr Chris Smith, is a moderate who would not dream of advocating renationalisation. He speaks, rather, of toughening the regulatory regime, encouraging the companies to borrow long term, challenging charges to consumers, and reducing the growth in dividends. Labour even favours 'efficiency', which means fewer jobs, preferably through natural wastage. A sensible Conservative government would pre-empt such a campaign, and admit that it fumble-fingered water privatisation. The Tories must get it right, or Labour will. This does not constitute an argument for renationalisation. State monopolies are thoroughly discredited. We know their faults. But when you turn to private monopolists to do a job, you regulate them with chains, and where necessary beat them with rods, lash them, kick them and confine them. Do all of that, or they will take you for everything you've got.</p>

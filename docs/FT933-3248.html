			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Senate passes defence bill The US Senate approved a Dollars 261bn (Pounds 169.4bn) defence bill yesterday calling for a congressional decision on keeping US troops in Somalia and supporting President Bill Clinton's plan to allow homosexuals in the military, Reuter reports from Washington. The Senate passed the bill by 92-7. The House of Representatives expects to complete its version of the bill next week. The Senate voted last week to ask the president to get Congress's approval by November 15 for keeping troops in Somalia. It made the request in a non-binding resolution, added to the defence bill, that also urged Mr Clinton to tell Congress by October 15 his objectives in Somalia.</p>

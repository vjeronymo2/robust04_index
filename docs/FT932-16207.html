			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Ford cuts Mondeo prices by average 6% FORD UK yesterday bowed to market pressures and cut by an average of 6 per cent the prices of its new Mondeo car range, widely criticised by fleet buyers since its launch only a fortnight ago as being too expensive. The reductions formed a part of price and dealer margin-cutting measures announced by Ford yesterday. These were seen by motor industry analysts, led by Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School, as marking the end of Ford's long-standing ability as UK market leader to set the framework for competition in the market for new cars. Ford, whose move came on the eve of the launch of Rover's 600 model, also announced cuts of up to 10 per cent on its Granada/Scorpio range of executive cars and about 5 per cent on Escort and Fiesta models. However, with the exception of the Mondeo, prices customers will actually pay are unlikely to change much, because Ford also cut dealer margins on all cars to 10 per cent from the customary 16 per cent to 17 per cent. Most dealers have been giving discounts of at least 10 per cent anyway, all the price realignments have done is reduce their room for manoeuvre. The Mondeo price cuts will be passed on to customers because dealers have had only a 10 per cent margin on them from the start of sales. Ford said last night that the lower prices would apply to all existing orders. Customers who had taken delivery of cars at the higher 'introductory' prices would be reimbursed. Although the Mondeo price reductions average 6 per cent, there are wide variations. The 1.6LX five-door Mondeo, expected to be one of the biggest-selling fleet cars, costs Pounds 11,835 from today instead of Pounds 13,080 - a reduction of nearly 10 per cent. The 2-litre Ghia five-door drops by only 3 1/2 per cent, to Pounds 17,450 from Pounds 18,080. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford UK's chairman, attributed the move to the changes in company car taxation in last month's Budget. From April 6 1994 tax assessed on company cars will be based on a simple percentage of manufacturers' retail list prices. The price cuts and Mondeo reimbursement programme is expected to prove costly to Ford, which has been losing heavily on its UK operations. Critics pointed out at its launch that some Mondeo models were Pounds 1,500 dearer than their closest Vauxhall Cavalier rivals, but that did not stop the Mondeo reaching sixth place in the sales league last month, despite being on sale for only a part of it. Ford's announcement also coincided with the publication of statistics showing that registrations of new cars rose for the sixth consecutive month in March, pushing the market 11.58 per cent higher in the first quarter than the same period a year ago. But doubts continued to be expressed about whether the recovery is as strong as it appears, and the extent to which the statistics are inflated by manufacturer-inspired market-boosting tactics such as large-scale registering of dealer 'demonstrators' for which there are no final buyers. These doubts were reinforced by the contrast between the car market rise and a further drop in registrations of commercial vehicles, announced by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday. Van, truck and bus registrations fell 11.75 per cent from the severely depressed levels of a year ago and the market was 5.36 per cent lower in the first quarter than in the same 1992 period.

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Driver licence centre accused in Nissan row THE GOVERNMENT'S Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency was yesterday accused of passing confidential customer information worth millions of pounds to Nissan Motor (GB), the Japanese carmaker's recently formed distribution company. Nissan UK, Mr Octav Botnar's company that used to hold the Nissan distribution franchise for the UK, claimed that the Swansea-based DVLA had sold a list of 700,000 names of its customers to Nissan Motor (GB). Mr Botnar was said to be 'furious' about the sale of the list, which he said covered customers who had bought vehicles from Nissan UK in the past six years. Nissan UK said: 'Now they (Nissan Motor (GB)) are using confidential information for a huge marketing programme.' However the DVLA, while it acknowledged that a list of about 400,000 names had been supplied to Nissan Motor (GB), said last night that it had acted within its guidelines. An official of Nissan Motor (GB) insisted that the list had been sought solely to reassure Nissan owners about their entitlement to warranty after the confrontation between Nissan and Nissan UK that led to the termination of Nissan UK's distribution contract at the end of last year. The company said the database had already been returned to the DVLA 'and we have made no copies'. It acknowledged that letters had already gone out to most of the owners, but insisted that they were a 'one-off' to clarify the warranty situation. There would be no marketing follow-up. The database is one of the few substantial assets left to a distribution group in the event of a vehicle supplier terminating its franchise. An official for Nissan UK said last night that the rival Nissan group's acquisition of the database was likely to prejudice the success of efforts to sell alternative makes of cars when new franchise arrangements were put in place. In a statement the DVLA said that although its records were not a public register the law specifically provided for information to be disclosed to parties regarded as having reasonable cause to seek it. The purpose of Nissan Motor GB 'was solely to advise the keepers of Nissan vehicles of the position with regard to warranty following the withdrawal of the manufacturer's franchise from the previous distributor.'</p>

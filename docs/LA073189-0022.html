			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> In the second attack on his home in two months, a man found his house defaced  in the latest in a series of attacks on gays by assailants espousing hatred of  homosexuals, San Francisco police said. Glen Eichelberger awoke on his 44th  birthday to find anti-gay epithets painted on the stucco wall of his Sunset  District house. The vandals also splashed Eichelberger's car with red paint.  "This is terrorism," Eichelberger said. Also scrawled on the wall were the  letters "SDI," which police say stands for Sunset District Inc., a gang of  white youths espousing a white-power philosophy that includes hatred of Jews  and homosexuals, among others. Eichelberger's home was attacked about two  months ago by vandals who stole a gay pride flag and returned it half burned  with black swastikas and anti-gay slogans written on it, police said.  Eichelberger speculated that his work volunteering for AIDS victims may have  motivated the vandals' action. Police said they have stepped up patrols in the  area.  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Regional reports) (14): US analysts are cautious on third-quarter earnings growth Although the second quarter of 1994 had few of the nasty shocks that so paralysed the US stock market in the first three months of the year, it still proved a difficult period for traders and investors. After staging a halting rally from April through to mid-May, share prices turned tail in the closing weeks of the quarter. Between June 14 and June 30, the market lost all of the 6 per cent gain it had earned in the previous nine weeks. Those losses meant that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen for two consecutive quarters for the first time since 1984. By the close of trading on the quarter's final day, the Dow stood at 3,624.96, down 11 points points, or 0.3 per cent since March 31. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was at 444.27, having fallen less than two points during the quarter; while the Nasdaq composite index, under pressure from heavily-sold technology stocks, finished at 705.96, down 38 points, or 5 per cent. As in the first three months of the year, trading during the quarter was dominated by rising interest rates. From the start, the market struggled to make much headway amid concern that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy further in an attempt to cool down the overheating economy and stifle inflation. When the Fed did raise rates, pushing the federal funds rate from 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent on April 18, share prices dropped sharply. Yet, within a week, the market psychology began to change. From fearing another rate increase, Wall Street started to look forward to one, with analysts judging that one more tightening of monetary policy would be enough to appease the inflation-sensitive bond market without inflicting serious damage on equity market sentiment. Consequently, when the Fed raised rates again in mid-May, the stock market rallied. At the time, investors assumed that the Fed had finished raising interest rates, at least for the rest of the summer. Thus, over the next month the Dow advanced 140 points, or 4 per cent, to peak at 3,814.83 on June 14. The gains were fuelled by the belief that long-term interest rates had stabilised - the yield on the long bond was hovering around 7.35 per cent for most of that time - and that the settled outlook for monetary policy, combined with still-growing corporate earnings, would revive investor demand for stocks. Those quietly optimistic expectations, however, were overshadowed in the final weeks by several external factors which conspired to drag prices lower across the board. They were: rising commodity prices, which revived the bond market's inflation jitters, the political crisis in the Korean peninsula, and a weak dollar. The last of these inflicted the most damage, as the US currency's plunge below Y100 against the yen sent stock and bond prices tumbling, amid predictions that the Fed would have to raise interest rates to protect the ailing dollar. By the end of June, the growing feeling that the markets had overreacted to the dollar's decline, and that another rate increase was not on the cards, suggested the third quarter might get off to a positive start. Yet analysts cautioned that the expected downturn in the economy during the second half of the year would probably slow the rate of corporate earnings growth over the summer. In Mexico, the stock market plunged 19 per cent in the opening two weeks of the quarter after US interest rates were raised, but then rallied strongly in late April after US, Canada and Mexico signed an arrangement for fighting exchange rate turbulence among their currencies. For the remainder of the quarter, fears of higher US interest rates and continuing political problems with the rebels in Chiapas held prices back, and the IPC index ended the quarter at 2,262.6, down 150 points, or 6 per cent. As on Wall Street, Canadian stocks were troubled throughout the second quarter by rising domestic interest rates. Over the three months, the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index fell more than 300 points, or 7 per cent, to end at 4,025.25.</p>

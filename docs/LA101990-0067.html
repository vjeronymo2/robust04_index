			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SUIT FOCUSES ON TOY SELLER'S PROFITS;  </P> <P> VENDOR: THE TRINKET HAWKER, WHO WORKS OUTSIDE L.A. ZOO, SAYS THE MONEY GOES TO  CARE FOR UNWANTED PETS. OFFICIALS SAY HE POCKETS MOST OF IT.  </P> <P> Garbed in a clown suit, Bernard Kessler until recently spent his weekends  hawking balloons and toys in front of the Los Angeles Zoo -- raising money, he  says, to care for thousands of unwanted cats and dogs.  </P> <P> But the state attorney general's office alleges in a lawsuit that most of the  money that Kessler and his workers have made in the last four years selling  trinkets at various Griffith Park sites has gone not to animal welfare but into  Kessler's pockets.  </P> <P> "We estimated they were selling merchandise at the rate of $350,000 a year in  front of the Los Angeles Zoo, the Griffith Observatory and Travel Town (Museum)  . . . telling people the proceeds were going to help dogs and cats," Deputy  Atty. Gen. James Cordi said. "Our investigation showed that most of the  proceeds were going into Bernard Kessler's bank accounts."  </P> <P> Kessler's attorney insists that his client is guilty of no more than poor  record-keeping, while Kessler argues that he is being persecuted because his  trinket sales compete with souvenir sales inside the zoo.  </P> <P> "Anybody who knows Bernie knows that Bernie is devoted to animals," said  Kessler's attorney, David Liberman. "He never took a salary, never took a  vacation. All of this was used so that he can rescue animals. . . . He's a very  eccentric guy, we're not denying that. But he's certainly not a dishonorable or  dishonest person."  </P> <P> The attorney general's office has obtained a temporary court order barring  Kessler and his wife, Sheri Mizrachi, from making any more sales until a Nov.  20 Superior Court hearing on the matter, prompting Kessler to complain that he  is being prevented from helping "the little orphan kitties and puppies who need  to be bottle-fed to survive."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Kessler read from a letter that he had been planning  to send to "almost every important person, including the Pope of Rome" about  his plight -- but then decided not to on the advice of his attorney. In the  letter, Kessler muses, "Why can't I stand proudly like the Statue of Liberty at  the L.A. Zoo as my balloons wave high in the air like the American flag?"  </P> <P> In the Superior Court lawsuit filed Oct. 4, the state argues that Kessler has  violated a number of state and federal laws governing the nonprofit  organization he founded in 1985, Help Elevate Life for Pets. According to state  auditors who reviewed Kessler's bank records, sale proceeds were deposited into  six accounts, five of them personal accounts and the sixth earmarked for HELP.  Checks written on the personal accounts were used to pay such things as  Kessler's mortgage and car and utility bills.  </P> <P> Saying that he uses his Sylmar home to house 1,000 abandoned pets a year,  Kessler defended his use of the HELP income to pay the mortgage. "Ninety  percent of the house is used by the animals," Kessler said. "Ten percent is  used by me. We have phone bills; 95% of the phone bills are for the animals."  </P> <P> At the East Valley Animal Care and Control Center, District Supervisor Tom  Walsh said his office has received a couple of complaints in the last year from  Kessler's neighbors about an illegal kennel. Walsh said that on some visits his  inspectors found too many animals and issued warnings. On several other  inspections, the animal control officers found only a few pets.  </P> <P> "Where is he hiding them?" asked Walsh of the 25 to 50 pets Kessler said he  cares for every day at his home.  </P></p>

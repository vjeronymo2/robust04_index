			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT EMBARGO'S END MEANS FOR MANAGUA;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS IS EXPECTED TO GIVE NICARAGUA'S ECONOMY A  BOOST. BUT ANALYSTS SAY THE BENEFITS COULD TAKE AWHILE.  </P> <P> Sandinista officials and private businessmen welcomed the lifting of the U.S.  trade embargo Tuesday as a major step toward reviving Nicaragua's war-battered  economy but warned that few benefits will come immediately.  </P> <P> In the United States, companies are already eyeing Nicaragua's primarily  agricultural economy as a business opportunity.  </P> <P> The end of nearly five years of U.S. economic sanctions, announced by President  Bush in Washington, is likely to multiply commercial flights between Managua  and U.S. cities, to double the price Nicaragua receives for its sugar, to make  such vital imports as medicine and farm machinery cheaper for Nicaraguans and  to bring U.S. investment in a post-revolutionary economy.  </P> <P> But businessmen cautioned that few, if any, of these changes will come before  President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro takes power from the Sandinista  government April 25 and starts using a promised U.S. aid package to reopen  commercial credit lines shut down by the embargo.  </P> <P> "This announcement tells the world that Nicaragua has changed and can do  business with the United States again," said Gilberto Cuadra, president of the  Superior Council of Private Enterprise and a leading adviser to Chamorro. "But  for now, it is more symbolic than real. It won't mean anything until we can  produce and trade on a larger scale."  </P> <P> U.S. Commerce Department official Timothy Ashby said that "it's still very  early in the game" to tell how quickly trade with Nicaragua will rebound.  </P> <P> But rumors about the Bush Administration's plans have created "quite a bit of  interest already," said Ashby, director of the International Trade  Administration's Office of Mexico and the Caribbean Basin, which is part of the  Commerce Department.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of inquiries from potential business people," he said. "So I  think we'll see a lot of return from exile (of Nicaraguan business people) and  the return of a lot of flight capital" that left the country under Sandinista  rule.  </P> <P> However, even a reinvigorated Nicaragua of the future is liable to be just a  small piece of the U.S. trade picture.  </P> <P> "It was peanuts before, and it will be peanuts after," said a spokesman for the  U.S. Trade Representative's Office.  </P> <P> The embargo was imposed May 1, 1985, in the midst of the U.S.-backed Contra  war, as part of the Reagan Administration's campaign to dislodge the  Sandinistas from power. It barred commerce between the two countries, except  for donated medicine and other items considered humanitarian, and blocked loans  to Nicaragua from U.S.-based lending agencies.  </P> <P> Because Nicaraguans found ways to get around the embargo, its impact has been  debatable. But it contributed in part to the economic decline that prompted  voters last month to turn the Sandinista revolutionaries out of office and  elect a pro-American coalition that favors private enterprise.  </P> <P> In lifting the embargo and asking Congress for $300 million in emergency cash  for Nicaragua, Bush met requests by Chamorro's economic advisers for a key  element of their recovery program, while allowing the Sandinistas to leave  office with the country on better terms with Washington.  </P> <P> Calling the sanctions an affront to all his countrymen, Nicaraguan Vice  President Sergio Ramirez welcomed Bush's decision as "an act of justice that  has taken too long."  </P> <P> He said it "responds to the initiatives this (Sandinista) government has taken"  in holding free elections and pledging to turn over power.  </P> <P> "We are interested in the new government's having resources to help it overcome  the profound economic crisis that this war has created," Ramirez said.  </P> <P> In Santiago, Chile, where he attended the inauguration of President Patricio  Aylwin over the weekend, President Daniel Ortega said:  </P> <P> "I celebrate this as a victory of the Nicaraguan people, who have suffered so  much. They deserve this and more. Although it's little, considering Nicaragua's  economic circumstances, it shows a willingness to help."  </P> <P> Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry invited the Bush Administration to send an  economic delegation here to find ways to make its promised aid available "as  soon as possible."  </P> <P> The embargo made Nicaragua's agriculture-based economy more dependent on Cuba,  the Soviet Union and their East Bloc allies, while diverting business once  conducted by U.S. companies to Canada, Brazil, Japan and other countries. In  1984, the United States was Nicaragua's largest trading partner, accounting for  17% of its foreign commerce.  </P> <P> That year, Nicaragua exported $58 million in goods to the United States, most  of it such agricultural products as bananas, beef, shrimp, coffee and sugar.  That total was down from nearly $214 million in 1980.  </P> <P> In 1984, Nicaragua bought nearly $110 million worth of chemicals, paper  products, food and other products from the United States, down from about $247  million in 1980, according to the Commerce Department.  </P> <P> In 1988, Sandinista officials calculated the cost of the embargo up to that  point at $325 million.  </P> <P> Other economists say the impact has been more modest. Many American spare parts  can be bought from other Western countries, and those available only in the  United States are imported through companies in Panama and elsewhere. At  hard-currency stores in most Nicaraguan cities, shelves are stocked with  Campbell's soup, Kleenex, Oreo cookies and other U.S. products that the embargo  was meant to stop.  </P> <P> But such "triangulation" schemes have inflated the prices of U.S. products  here.  </P> <P> The end of the embargo will make U.S. consumer goods and medicines cheaper. And  it will rescue businesses unable to replace worn-out heavy equipment made in  the United States, such as industrial coffee dryers and milk boilers. Today,  Nicaragua exports much of its coffee unprocessed, and the milk industry is  collapsing.  </P> <P> Nicaragua will become eligible again for a quota of the U.S. sugar market,  which now pays double the price of the country's current European buyers.  </P> <P> "Sugar is one export that can make an immediate leap," an official at the  Central Bank said.  </P> <P> Nicaragua can be expected to buy all sorts of U.S. merchandise, Massachusetts  Institute of Technology economist Lance Taylor said.  </P> <P> "But it's not going to be any big trade bonanza for the United States," said  Taylor, who did a survey of the Nicaraguan economy last year.  </P> <P> Maj. Alejandro Arguello, Nicaragua's director of civil aviation, said Tuesday  that Aeronica, the state airline, will soon apply for landing rights in Miami,  where it flew four days a week until the embargo. At present, only Lacsa, a  Costa Rican carrier, makes direct flights from Managua to the United States.  </P> <P> U.S. carriers will be welcome to land again at Managua's Augusto Cesar Sandino  airport, Arguello added.  </P> <P> Anticipating an end to the embargo, a team from the Federal Aviation  Administration inspected the airport's runways and pronounced them fit, he  said.  </P> <P> Continental and Pan Am, two big carriers that serve other Central American  countries from which passengers can take connecting flights to Managua, are  watching the situation.  </P> <P> "It's just a little soon for us to focus on it," a Continental spokesman said  Tuesday. "As of Thursday, Continental will have more flights to Central  American destinations than any U.S. carrier, but Managua doesn't happen to be  one of them."  </P> <P> More flights could mean tourists for Nicaragua.  </P> <P> "It is a wonderful travel destination" that was once very popular, said Pat  Petit-Clerc, who develops new tours for Travcoa, a wholesale operator of luxury  tours, based in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "I think we'll probably skip it for 1991 and take a good look at it in 1992,"  said Petit-Clerc, noting that the company already offers several other Central  American tours. "It's like the Middle East: If you wait for it to settle down  completely, you'll never go."  </P> <P> By reopening Nicaraguan seaports to U.S. carriers, the end of sanctions could  open California markets to Nicaraguan bananas, beef, rum and coffee now sold in  Europe. Corinto, Nicaragua's main Pacific port, is the banana port closest to  the U.S. West Coast.  </P> <P> Ramiro Gurdian, a former banana grower in that region, said several  multinational companies have expressed interest in buying out state-owned  plantations and shipping bananas to the United States.  </P> <P> The promise of new business opportunities has drawn many Nicaraguan businessmen  home from exile since Chamorro's Feb. 25 election. One of those arriving  Tuesday was Eduardo del Carmen, a clothing manufacturer and retailer who left  for Miami 10 years ago after the Sandinistas limited his supply of dollars to  buy cloth from the United States.  </P> <P> "That's good news," he said of the end of trade sanctions. "As long as there's  going to be peace and reconciliation in Nicaragua, we can start rebuilding.  Nicaraguans are good workers. I'm very optimistic."  </P> <P> Businessmen who struggled to survive the embargo inside Nicaragua were also  relieved.  </P> <P> "Now we can produce enough to supply all of Central America," said Edgar  Acosta, whose company will resume chemical imports from the United States to  make brake fluid and engine coolants. His business shrank from 22 to 14 workers  after turning to more expensive chemicals from Europe in 1985 and losing its  export markets.  </P> <P> Until Nicaragua comes to terms with American creditors, however, commerce is  expected to be limited to what can be bought with its dwindling supply of  dollars. The promised U.S. aid package will help Nicaragua pay its bank debts  and will make the country eligible for new lending by the World Bank and  Inter-American Development Bank for roads and other public works.  </P> <P> "There are no financial relations to make transactions with the United States  now," Nicaraguan economist Mario Arana said. "The benefits (of Bush's action)  will be felt once the new government takes over and these relations are  normalized. The recovery will begin slowly and not be felt until the middle of  the year."  </P> <P> Richard Boudreaux reported from Managua and Nancy Rivera Brooks from Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> MAIN STORY: A1  </P></p>

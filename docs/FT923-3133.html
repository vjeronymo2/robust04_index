			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Extracts from the EC Monetary Committee communique and statement by Mr Norman Lamont Extracts from the EC Monetary Committee communique: 'On the joint request of the German and Italian authorities, the ministers and central bank governors of the member states of (the) European Community have by mutual agreement and after consultation of the Monetary Committee decided to fix new central rates in the EMS ..... 'This decision will contribute substantially to the proper functioning of the EMS. 'The Italian government, recognising that the fundamental condition for stable exchange rates, low interest rates and stable prices is sound public finance, is aware of the importance of a full and quick implementation of the convergence programme. The Italian government, with the 1993 budget, and with other structural measures, especially in the areas of pensions, public health, and public sector wages, will substantially curb the public deficit and reduce inflation.' Statement by Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer: 'I particularly welcome the intention of the Bundesbank Council to cut its official interest rates in order to reduce strains within the ERM. This demonstrates the benefits of continuing close co-operation amongst Community countries. The UK government has repeatedly made clear that there is no question of any change in the central parity of the pound against the deutschmark, and that we will take whatever action is necessary to secure that. Sterling's central rate therefore remains at DM2.95.'</p>

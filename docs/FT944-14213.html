			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Final quarter promises more gains - London The UK stock market is beginning to resemble last week's ill-fated press trip by the Eurotunnel express; all set up for a triumphant run, yet the train refuses to leave the station. Bond prices have picked up, opening the way for the FT-SE 100 Index to race for those year-end 3,500 to 3,600 forecasts; but the Footsie 3,100 hurdle is hurtling away in the wrong direction. The new problem, for the other European markets as well as London, is the US dollar. Opinions differ as to how significant dollar weakness is regarded by the Federal Reserve in its policy decisions. But the impact on the UK blue chips of concern over the US currency is clear enough. About one-fifth of corporate earnings in the Footsie list can be designated 'dollar-influenced', according to Edmond Warner at Kleinwort Benson Securities. The companies concerned range across the multinational pharmaceuticals, through the drink, consumer and engineering sectors. Next month brings trading results from BP, BAT Industries, BA, Unilever and GEC, to name but a few. All big-name, index-moving stocks impacting across the full range of the London market. The currency alarm was sounded on Friday morning when the sterling/dollar rate moved above Dollars 1.65. Indeed, the move in the cable rate from Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.62, its highest level since sterling left the ERM, had already sent many London analysts back to the computers for a fresh look at earnings forecasts. The outcome of their review is not entirely negative. Much depends on how permanent the dollar trend proves to be. Strauss Turnbull points out that a weaker dollar restrains imported inflationary pressure in the UK and that there is some statistical evidence that total returns on dollar-earners relative to the market are in fact inversely related to dollar trends. Strauss identifies Grand Metropolitan as a company which can out-perform against dollar weakness because it buys its currency forward and, more importantly, sees servicing costs fall on its Pounds 4bn plus of dollar-denominated debt. Hanson, as might be expected, arbitrages between sterling deposits and dollar-denominated debt. Guinness, on the other hand, shares with HSBC and Standard Chartered additional sensitivity to the Hong Kong dollar which is linked to the US currency; and Guinness does not hedge translation of profits. The same mix occurs even in the pharmaceutical sector, clearly a target for currency worry. Glaxo does not hedge its forex position, but SmithKline Beecham buys forward. For as long as the dollar remains weak and European investors doubt the Fed's intentions of coming to its aid, the FT-SE 100 Index will be under threat. But London market strategists will be quick to seize any opportunities among shares able to buck the trend.</p>

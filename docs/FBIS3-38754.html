"The potential for  danger is rising," admitted State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer  (Christian Democratic Union), who is responsible for the  intelligence services, but he added that, despite intensive  observation of the market, there have been no signs of a threat  by nuclear terrorists. "So far, there is no indication at all.  Weapons-grade material has not turned up in our country at  all.... Terrorists do not have access to weapons-grade  material, because it is not available on the market," he said in  an interview with RTL.    "It can still be ruled out that nuclear warheads are  available in an uncontrolled manner," the news magazine quotes a  report by the Federal Intelligence Office (BND). Referring to  the same source, however, DER SPIEGEL warns that nuclear bombs  and biological weapons from East Europe could soon be in the  hands "of Western gangs."    The 18-page BND report speaks of a "trend toward escalating  the situation." Smuggling centers include Vilnius and Kamas in  Lithuania. According to the magazine, the FRG has become the  hub for nuclear smuggling. Schmidbauer explained this by  referring to the FRG's geographical location. The minister  reported that 300 to 350 cases of illegal nuclear trade or  smuggling have been registered over the past two years.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna also  does not assume that blackmailers will soon have access to  nuclear weapons. "So far, we have not noticed anything like  that in our worldwide monitoring," a spokesman said in an  interview with the private radio station RADIO 7 in Ulm. The  IAEA has helped the CIS states to establish inspection bodies so  as to prevent trade of weapons-grade material.</p>

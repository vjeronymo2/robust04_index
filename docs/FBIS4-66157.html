			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gao Ping (7559 1627): "Where Is NATO Headed in </F> the Wake of the Cold War? -- Analysis of the Results of the  Brussels NATO Heads of State Conference"]    [Text] The direction NATO is taking in the wake of the Cold  War is an important issue affecting the international situation.  However, for Europe and the United States, which have  experienced various difficulties such as the indifference and  mutual distrust brought about by the disappearance of the Cold  War threat, the several deadlocks that have occurred in the  Uruguay round of negotiations, and the divergence of views over  intervention in the Bosnia-Hercegovina civil war, the importance  of this issue is even more important. Between 9 - 16 January,  U.S. President Clinton made his first visit to Europe since  taking office. Since one of the main goals of this visit was to  refashion the relationship between the United States and its  European allies, and between NATO and East Europe and the  countries of the former Soviet Union, President Clinton chose  Brussels as his first stop, and took part in the NATO heads of  state conference there. Foreign public opinion gave fairly high  marks to this visit, feeling that President Clinton's first trip  to Europe was truly something that had a new and far-reaching  effect.  <H5>  Establishing a "Peaceful Partnership" Between East and West </H5> Europe    The first change in NATO brought about by the two-day  Brussels heads of state conference was passage of an  U.S.-sponsored plan for a "peaceful partnership," which formally  answered the question of whether and how NATO would be extended  to the east, which had been outstanding since the end of the  cold war.    East Europe's difficulties in freeing itself from restraints  to establish its own independence and security following the end  of the cold war made it very anxious to enter NATO. The recent  clamor from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland,  in particular, had been loudest. Two years earlier, the NATO  heads of state conference in Rome had decided to set up a North  Atlantic Cooperation Committee that would accept East European  and former Soviet Union countries as members to improve  relations and cooperation between NATO member states and their  erstwhile adversaries, and to move these countries in the  direction of a western-style democracy. However, some of the  East European nations were no longer entirely satisfied with  that kind of extremely loose and entirely symbolic cooperation.  Faced with the "power vacuum" in East Europe following the end  of the cold war, the potential threat of a revival of Russian  great nation chauvinism, and the instability caused by extreme  nationalism and ethnic clashes in East Europe, some East  European nations urgently demanded genuine security guaranties  from NATO. The clamor to joint NATO increased with each passing  day.    In their heart of hearts, both the United States and its  West  European allies naturally very much wished to extend NATO  eastward. At the beginning of the cold war more than 40 years  earlier, the United States singlehandedly planned establishment  of NATO with the goal of doing all possible to stem the  increasing expansion of Soviet influence, and doing all possible  to expand eastward western military power and even the west's  free and democratic system. Now that the cold war was over,  naturally the United States could not abandon this opportunity  that it had yearned for. It was for this reason that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher hastily said, "During this  crucial transition period, building of such a (east and west  Europe) relationship will make it possible for democracy and  reform to succeed, and the possibility of this success will be  far greater than the opportunities that a war would bring."  However, the United States had some apprehensions about what  specific actions to take. In the view of the Clinton  administration, the extension of membership status to all the  East European nations was really premature. First of all, in  addition to the lack of any real basis at the present time for  these East European countries to carry out within NATO the  assurances of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty (namely, that an  attack on one member nation would be regarded as an attack on  all members), the tangled and complex ethnic conflicts and the  latent territorial conflicts prevailing in East Europe might  cause conflicts that would make the heads of NATO member states  hesitate to act. NATO feared that too early acceptance of these  East European nations might result in NATO becoming bogged down  later on in regional conflicts like the war in  Bosnia-Hercegovina. Furthermore, even though NATO has for many  years successfully maintained a relationship between two  antagonistic member nations, Greece and Turkey, there was no  reason for NATO leaders to believe that the East European  nations would do the same thing. Second, and more important,  was the Clinton administration's unwillingness to countenance  "drawing a line at the western border of Russia to replace the  former iron curtain." The United States worried that too early  and too speedy NATO acceptance of these East European countries  that were formerly allies of the Soviet Union might intensify  Russia's feelings of isolation and stimulate an anti-American  and anti-western tendencies in the Russian public. It might even  increase ultra-nationalist forces within Russia, thereby  weakening the forces of democratic reform factions such as  Yeltsin's that the United States supported. These apprehensions  found greater expression when the Radical Nationalist Party  headed by Zhirnovsky gained the second largest number of seats  in Russia's Duma in December 1993. In fact, on the eve of  Clinton's visit to Europe, a strong reaction occurred within  Russia to the formal application for entry into NATO of Latvia,  one of the three Baltic nations. Russian President Yeltsin  warned the west not to do "anything to isolate Russia." Because  of the above worries, President Clinton adopted a fairly  cautious attitude about expanding NATO, showing that the issue  is not whether to expand NATO but "how and when to expand it."    The peaceful partnership plan that the NATO heads of state  passed was a deft compromise to avoid stirring up Russia  following careful consideration by the United States. In  accordance with this plan, non-NATO member East European  countries and former republics of the USSR will gradually  develop their military relationship with NATO member countries,  conducting joint training and exercises. These "peaceful  partners" will become a planning team that cooperates closely  with NATO in the organization of joint training and exercises in  preparation for possible future joint military action. It is on  the basis of this conception that NATO will nurture the ability  to deal with "challenges to Europe's common security."  Henceforth, should the territorial integrity, political  independence, and security of any partner country be threatened  at any time, NATO will conduct deliberations at once. According  to Warren Christopher, founding of such a mechanism will  "eliminate feelings of insecurity among East European and former  Soviet Union partners, strengthening the political relationship  between NATO and them."    In order not to dash the hopes and to support the requests  of  some East European and former Soviet Union republics who desire  immediate NATO entry, during his visit to Europe President  Clinton constantly reiterated that the "peaceful partnership,"  plan does not replace arrangements for entering NATO, but is  "the first step toward entering NATO." The United States  explained to Europe that partner nations could demonstrate their  desire and their ability to assume NATO obligations and enjoy  NATO benefits by approving this plan's provisions for  strengthening political and military cooperation. In future  years, the situation will show which countries possess the  conditions for formal entry. Then NATO can consider the question  of whether to grant them formal membership status. To use  Clinton's words, this is a "gradual and case-by-case expansion  procedure."    The Clinton administration believes that the "peaceful  partner relationship" plan that it devised can kill many birds  with a single stone. First, it satisfies, to a certain extent,  the desires of those East European and former Soviet republics  that eagerly sought entry into NATO, and it increases their  confidence. It enables them to continue and accelerate progress  toward western democracy while at the same time it avoids  arousing ultra-nationalist sentiment in some Russians so that  they do not regard NATO expansion as a military threat. Second,  the plan's provisions for an expansion of military cooperation  with East European countries will help NATO improve its ability  to act in important new fields of crisis management,  humanitarian rescue, and peace keeping, thereby effecting a  smooth change in NATO's functions. Third, since the Clinton  administration says that in the future NATO will unilaterally  have the right to decide when to increase membership, this  "single track system" of examining credentials will force those  East European nations that wish to enter NATO to listen to what  the United States says. They must not only take an active part  in NATO activities, but more importantly -- as Clinton said --  they must demonstrate "their decision to respect the values on  which NATO depends for its survival." This includes respect for  individual freedom, human rights, and a system of law, and  peaceful resolution of disputes without the use of armed force  to change existing national borders. Thus, the United States  has transformed NATO expansion, which was formerly a matter of  examining member nations credentials, into a powerful lever for  ensuring the peace, stability, and freedom of East Europe.    Therefore, the United states has a deep sense of  satisfaction  about NATO heads of state approval of the "peaceful partnership"  plan, as well as the acceptance of this plan by East European  countries like the Czech Republic and Poland. it believes this  to be an important result of President Clinton's trip to Europe.  However, whether this carefully conceived plan will truly be  workable, and whether it can attain the goals that the United  States envisages will depend on the the test of time.  <H5>  Recognition of West European Allies Autonomy in Defense </H5> Matters    The second important change in NATO that President Clinton  brought during this visit was the United States' decision to  recognize the autonomy of its West European allies on defense  matters. This gives them the right to independent military  action that they, particularly France, have long desired.  Contrary to the United States Government's past position, during  this heads of state conference, President Clinton explicitly  recognized that Europe has authority over defense matters  affecting its own independence; thus, West Europe has the right  to make its own decisions and take independent actions to deal  with defense matters purely within Europe. For this purpose, the  United States said it would permit its West European allies to  use NATO matriel and equipment for their own military actions.  This means that the West European allies may take military  action using NATO's command, reconnaissance and logistics  systems in the name of the West European alliance or in the name  of joint French and German forces rather than in the name of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In addition, this NATO heads  of state meeting decided to set up a new military entity termed  a multinational task force. Acting under the leadership of the  West European Alliance or NATO, this force could undertake peace  keeping, human rights rescue, and other military tasks. The  United States could decide whether to take part in these  military actions as circumstances warrant. United State  Secretary of Defense Les Aspen said that according to this plan,  "military forces and equipment that are an organic part of the  NATO military organization could be used to deal with unexpected  incidents of purely European concern without U.S. direction."    When the cold war first ended, the United States felt at a  loss about what to do for a time. On the one hand, the United  States realized that the disappearance of the tremendous Soviet  threat meant that it would no longer have to concern itself with  every matter regarding Europe's security as it had done in the  past. The United States no longer saw it worthwhile to go to war  and shed blood over conflicts in regional conflicts such as the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the United  States, which had been accustomed for more than 40 years to  issuing orders to Europe and attending to everything itself, was  unwilling to be cast aside now, allowing West European nations  to make their own decisions and carry out their own actions, and  it was apprehensive about it. It was with these conflicting  feelings that the former Bush administration, and the Clinton  administration at its outset always vacillated and contradicted  itself on European affairs. This characteristic was demonstrated  most markedly on the Bosnia-Hercegovina civil war issue. The  West European allies were extremely unhappy about this, and  U.S.-European relations consequently blew hot and cold. All  these events showed that the United States Government had formed  no clear-cut consensus on U.S.-European relations. It lacked a  consistent policy.    The change in the United States Government's position now  shows that the Clinton administration has a new understanding of  United States-European relations after having gone through a  period of consideration.    No matter how one looks at it, the security of Europe is of  crucial importance to the United States; therefore, the United  States must remain in Europe and continue to play a leading  role. However, the United States cannot both want to play the  part of leader and also side with West Europe in making empty  promises when a crisis occurs in the European situation. The  only workable approach is for the U.S. Government to change its  former equivocal and ambiguous attitude, clearly recognize and  respect Europe's autonomy in certain defense matters, and let  the European allies handle matters themselves in return for  their cooperation and support in matters of importance to U.S.  defense. Clinton embraced just such a clear-cut understanding in  making a trip to Europe. While affirming that Europe remains at  the heart of U.S. security, he said that "the common enemy on  both sides of the Atlantic Ocean has disappeared, but common  dangers have not disappeared." By this he meant that although  not as mortal as the former Soviet threat, the "quiet  instability that has appeared" in Europe is fraught with danger.  Both the United States and West Europe must react to this.  However, this reaction should be selective. According to the  current thinking of the United States Government, when a major  threat occurs that endangers the western value system, the  survival of the western system, and reverberates on the  situation on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States will  work in concert and bend efforts to cooperate with Europe. When  a partial or regional crisis occurs in Europe that does not  threaten the overall situation within a short period of time,  acting in the spirit of "Europeans handling European affairs,"  the United States will not intervene. Actually, the  Multinational Task Force was born out of the U.S. desire not to  shed blood in European regional disputes, and in Europe's desire  to make a rapid response to them.    This change in the U.S. Government's position was welcomed  by  West Europe, especially France. For a long time, France has  wanted the right to take independent military action and  maintain an independent West European military force. The United  States always refused, however, because it feared that this  might lead to a disintegration of the western alliance. The  United States' unexpected declaration at the NATO heads of state  meeting and the results it obtained evoked a joyous response  from France. The French Minister of Defense termed the new  Atlantic alliance following this heads of state conference the  "second NATO." The United States termed the proposal it made at  this conference and the existing North Atlantic Treaty "each  attending to his own affairs," but not each going his separate  way. This means that NATO and the West European Alliance will be  complementary rather than mutually exclusive in the future.  Nevertheless, the U.S. attitude shows that its effect on  European affairs has declined. It is a choice that the United  States had to make after the situation changed in order to avoid  even grater damage to Europe-U.S. relations. No wonder that  after President Clinton said that the United States was resolved  to remain in Europe that some European public opinion still  suspected that this change in the U.S. position might be the  first step in its gradual withdrawal from Europe.    Results of the Brussels heads of state conference showed  that  a change in the control and even the purpose of NATO was  unavoidable. The direction that this conference set for  east-west and Europe-U.S. relations, in particular, means that  the Brussels heads of state conference has become yet another  important milestone in the more than 40 year history of NATO. As  a WASHINGTON POST editorial said, the conclusion of this  conference marks "a quiet revolution" that is going on within  NATO.</p>

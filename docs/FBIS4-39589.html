			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriya Ochinyan report: "Changes in Sverdlovsk Oblast </F> Administration. Sverdlovsk Governor Gets Rid of `Old Guard'"]    [Text] It has taken Sverdlovsk Oblast Governor Aleksey  Strakhov five months to finally decide on a reshuffle in the  administration. He announced the move in yesterday's sitting of  the oblast government. Despite the many expectations, however,  the fired officials were not the men of former governor Eduard  Rossel, but rather members of the "old guard" who used to work  in Sverdlovsk with Boris Yeltsin and Oleg Lobov.    The shakeout, the possibility of which Aleksey Strakhov  warned about back in his first days as governor, has affected  the positions of importance for the oblast: Having been  relieved of their positions are Aleksandr Nebesnov, deputy  administration head for transport and communications; Sergey  Turunovskiy, administrator of affairs; Anatoliy Tarasov, head of  the foreign economic relations administration; and Galina  Ivanina, head of the organizational department. Incidentally,  Mrs. Ivanina is the only "casualty" whose dismissal was  explained by the administration's head himself; he accused her  of "working for the Duma." The cause of Mr. Tarasov's dismissal  is also clear, however, for he is being identified with the  abuses by the oblast's special exporters of strategic raw  materials who were recently exposed by a commission of the  Control Administration under the president.    According to informed sources, so protracted a hiatus  between  Mr. Strakhov's appointment as governor and the start of the  personnel "purges" is attributed to the difficulties of  selecting personnel to fill key positions in the oblast. One  can still suppose that the governor will not draw the line at  parting with the mentioned officials, and the administration is  in for new waves of dismissals. At the same time, observers  think, the fired officials cannot be identified at all as  "Rossel's people" because most of them had been working in the  oblast [Communist Party] executive committee ever since Boris  Yeltsin was secretary of the oblast committee, and Oleg Lobov  chairman of the oblast executive committee. Experts who predict  Mr. Rossel's comeback as governor think Strakhov's reshuffle  would stand any of his successors in good stead because  discernible behind the current change is the desire to replace  the old-style administrators with younger ones, capable of  flexible methods of work.</p>

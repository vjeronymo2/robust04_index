			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: COLD-WEATHER EXERCISERS NEED TO EASE INTO THEIR ROUTINES  </P> <P> Cold-weather exercisers should increase their warm-up time to decrease injury  risk, being careful to warm the entire body before stretching major muscle  groups, exercise specialists say.  </P> <P> Colder weather makes muscles more prone to injury, according to Dr. Ronald  Mackenzie, medical director of Centinela National Athletic Health Institute in  Culver City. The traditional "tree lean" -- in which exercisers lean against a  tree or wall to stretch leg muscles -- isn't sufficient pre-exercise warm-up  and should never be done first, he added.  </P> <P> Spend time warming up the entire body, advised Cindy Baily, a Santa Monica  physical therapist. "Shift your weight from side to side, for instance, and  pump your arms." She recommends the overall body warm-up in any weather and  suggests lengthening it from one minute to two in cold weather "to get blood  flowing to major muscle groups before you stretch them." Mackenzie's alternate  suggestion for an overall body warm-up: "Step into hip-deep Jacuzzi water for  five minutes and walk around."  </P> <P> Next, concentrate on slowly stretching specific muscles, said Bailey, paying  particular attention to those on the front and back of the thighs and the  buttocks. In all, spend seven to 10 minutes warming up, he advised.  </P> <P> Latchkey Kids, Health  </P> <P> Latchkey kids aren't ill any more often than their counterparts in  adult-supervised care, nor is their self-esteem usually lower, researchers in  two separate studies have concluded.  </P> <P> Dr. Rickey Williams of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center in  Tucson and Dr. W. Thomas Boyce of the UC San Francisco Medical Center studied  503 Tucson fifth-graders over a two-year period and found latchkey kids no more  likely to be obese than other children, nor more likely to miss school or visit  the school health office.  </P> <P> The study, reported in the American Journal of Diseases of Children, was  prompted by medical reports indicating that latchkey kids may be more stressed  and that stress, in turn, might affect their physical health.  </P> <P> In a separate study, Dr. Brad D. Berman of Children's Hospital in Oakland and  an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at UC San Francisco studied  fourth- and sixth-graders in three Bay Area schools, separating them into four  groups: self-care, home-care by parents or other adults, older-sibling care, or  out-of-home day care. "Kids in self-care didn't have any lower self-esteem than  kids in adult care. But unexpectedly, kids in older-sibling care did have lower  self-esteem compared with the other three groups," said Berman, who presented  his findings Monday at the western regional meeting of the Ambulatory  Pediatrics Assn.  </P> <P> The researchers acknowledged that the optimal arrangement of adult-supervised  care is not always available or affordable. If children must stay alone, Boyce  said, "it's important for kids to know how they can get in touch with a parent  and to know safety procedures such as how to answer the door and the  telephone."  </P> <P> Said Dr. Keitha Scott, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical  Center: "Kids in self-care (at age 11) probably aren't sicker. But I worry more  about their emotional health and physical security than about obesity or visits  to the nurse."  </P> <P> Travel and Pregnancy  </P> <P> Healthy pregnant women can usually travel safely if they follow some  common-sense precautions, conclude two physicians writing in the current  Journal of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> "Try to get immunizations up to date before pregnancy," said Dr. Frank Bia, an  associate professor of medicine at Yale University School of Medicine who  co-authored the report with Dr. Michelle Barry, also a Yale associate professor  of medicine. "And stay out of areas where there is chloroquine-resistant  malaria," Bia advised, citing Thailand and the Amazon region as locations to  avoid.  </P> <P> Among their other advice:  </P> <P>  -- Don't plan air travel late in pregnancy. "Domestic airline regulations  stipulate that air travel for pregnant women after 36 weeks' gestation is not  allowed and most foreign airlines have a cutoff of 35 weeks' gestation,"  according to Bia and Barry.  </P> <P>  -- To reduce the risk of phlebitis (vein inflammation), walk around as  frequently as possible during air travel, Bia suggested.  </P> <P>  -- Forget high-altitude trekking. "Prolonged exposure of pregnant women to the  high altitudes beyond (15,000 feet) achieved on many commercial treks has not  been studied, and caution should be exercised," the doctors write.  </P></p>

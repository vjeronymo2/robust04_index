After his meeting with Christopher at the Chinese Embassy in  Paris, Qian told reporters that the meeting was "positive" and  "constructive".    The two foreign ministers said that although the global  situation has changed dramatically, they believed China and the  United States are important and influential countries in the  world. They still have many common interests and bear  significant responsibilities in a broad field, including  safeguarding international peace and security.    The two sides agreed that the economies of the two countries  have their own merits and advantages and that there is great  potential in bilateral economic and trade cooperation.    They said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's meeting with  U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle last November marked a  good beginning for Sino-U.S. relations.    Since then, exchanges of visits by important officials of  the  two countries had increased and bilateral economic and trade  cooperation reinforced.    These visits are conducive to the promotion of mutual  understanding and meet the interests of both sides, they added.    Qian arrived here on Saturday [22 January] at the invitation  of the French Government for an official and goodwill visit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The Chinese Communist Party is in danger of losing  its identity as the moral force of the country and being turned  into just another administrative arm of government, a party  newspaper has warned.    Party organizations are becoming increasing secularized and  are disregarding their traditional role of providing "spiritual  and ideological" guidance to the Government and the country as a  whole, the current issue of PARTY STYLE MONTHLY said.    The paper complained that party members no longer referred  to  each other as "comrade" and treated party meetings simply as an  administrative chore to be got over and done with as quickly as  possible.    "Cadres attend meetings not to discuss important party  issues  but to simply issue instructions. Leading cadres don't even pay  their party dues themselves but send someone else to do it for  them," it said.    This lax attitude "posed a threat to the party's  development,  ideology and work ethic".    PARTY STYLE pointed out that while such questions as the  form  of address used in party meetings may seem to be mere details,  they were symptomatic of a much wider problem.    The use of government rank titles such as "bureau chief" or  "director" rather than the more egalitarian "comrade" was  preventing a free flow of discussion and leading to the  ossification of the party's work. "How can there be any  criticism of leaders when the term 'comrade' is not used?" the  paper asked.    By being referred to by their administrative titles, leaders  tended to lose sight of the party's traditional humble and  honest work ethic, it said. Analysts said the PARTY STYLE  article reflected a deep seated crisis of identity within the  party.    "Very few rank and file party members really understand what  the party actually stands for nowadays, nor do they really  care," a Chinese political observer said.    Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's theory of "building  socialism with Chinese characteristics", which is supposed to be  the guiding light of the party, was so vague as to be virtually  meaningless, he said.    "So, without any real ideological direction, cadres are just  getting on with business the best they can and ignoring  ideological questions they can't answer.    "At least under Chairman Mao Zedong everyone knew where they  stood but now there just seems to be mass confusion."    Other analysts pointed out that because of the party's  failure to separate itself from the work of government, it was  perhaps inevitable that the party structure would become  subsumed into the structure of government.    And while PARTY STYLE has sounded the alarm bell, most  analysts agree it will be difficult for the party to recover its  old identity in a rapidly changing and modernising China.</p>

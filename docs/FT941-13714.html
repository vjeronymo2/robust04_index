			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: A warning signal from Venezuela - The Emerging Investor The collapse of Venezuela's second-largest commercial bank should raise warning signals about the quality of Latin America's banks. Many are raising funds in the international markets and still more are paying high interest rates to secure foreign currency deposits; but there are signs that investors are not adequately differentiating among different institutions. 'There are a lot of second or third-tier Latin American banks having their paper placed all over the world. The extent to which this risk is any good, one doesn't know,' says Mr Paul Luke of Morgan Grenfell Debt Arbitrage and Trading in London. 'It's unclear whether the market is adequately differentiating between the different forms of risk.' Mr Charles Prescott of the London-based bank credit analysis concern IBCA says 55 banks from Brazil alone have issued debt in the inter-national market without a credit rating. Much of this debt has been placed directly into the hands of flight-capital accounts held by individual Latin Americans, who are comfortable with the risk they are taking. However, foreign investors without specialised local knowledge are likely to demand more information than they are getting at present. Latin America's banking systems are a varied lot. Most are in a state of flux, stemming in large part from the economic reforms which have changed the nature of banking in much of the region. Institutions which once survived by channeling money to the government and living off the wages of inflation, have had to find private sector customers and have sometimes proved inexpert at finding good risks. As these upheavals take place, the practices which were common in Latin banks in the past have not entirely died out. As in Venezuela, accounts are sometimes not consolidated, allowing banks to shuffle assets from one subsidiary to another to provide an optical illusion of a healthy bank. The practice of making loans to executives or leading shareholders still goes on. Unhappily for the authorities, Venezuela's problems came in the very month that new banking legislation, which would have dealt with some of these practices as well as bolstering the capital of the banks, took effect. In a bid to calm disquiet over the rest of the banking system, Venezuela's government moved on Friday to relax monetary conditions in the banking system in a bid to ease disquiet about other institutions. Mr Prescott points out that the likelihood that a country's authorities will stand behind a bank, while it may not provide much comfort to shareholders, is an important element in analysing its credit risk. The problems being faced by Venezuela now parallel in some respects the difficulties faced by the Chilean and the Colombian banking systems during the 1980s, when the government was forced to intervene to save some banks. These banks are now emerging from these problems: legislation now before the Chilean congress should resolve the remaining issue of subordinated debt still owed to the government by banks in Chile. In Colombia, the Banco de Colombia is also emerging from under the state umbrella: it is undertaking an international placement of Dollars 220m (Pounds 149m) in notes to be exchangeable into the bank's shares. Morgan Grenfell and its Deutsche Bank parent are handling the issue - which will account for around a third of the bank's capital. In Mexico, the rapid privatisation of 18 banks and the expansion in the economy led to a breakneck pace of loan growth. Now the economy has slowed down, the loan quality of the banks deteriorated through much of 1993. Trying to compensate for this, banks have kept high the interest rates they have charged to customers, intensifying and possibly lengthening the recession. Elsewhere, worse may be yet to come. A report by two World Bank economists in November suggested that many Brazilian banks were making hay out of inflation (now touching 40 per cent a month) and that subduing inflation 'would threaten the solvency of some banks'. Most bank analysts agree that a difficult period can be expected for Brazilian banks once inflation is under control, before the banking system eventually emerges healthier. This parallels the Argentine experience in reducing inflation radically over the past three years. The New York-based Thomson BankWatch says Argentina's 'regulatory environment will continue to improve, with stricter capital requirements and closer monitoring of the banks by the central bank.' Profitability, it adds, 'will remain above international norms'. Nonetheless, in Argentina and elsewhere, it is hard for bank regulators to keep up with the pace of change in the banking market. If it's hard for the regulators, investors should tread warily.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Friday         Week on  Week change Stock                    Country   Dollars Close  Dollars  per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Telesp (Pfd)             Brazil      0.4593       0.0955    26.2 Comp Vale Do  Rio Doce (Pfd)          Brazil      0.0293       0.0293    24.8 Telebras (Pfd)           Brazil      0.0476       0.0092    23.9 First Philippines  Holdings (Pfd)          Philippines 3.7050       0.6184    20.0 Electrobras (Pfd)        Brazil      0.2241       0.0403    19.8 Aracruz Celulose (Pfd)   Brazil      3.0216       0.4723    18.5 Grupo Ind.

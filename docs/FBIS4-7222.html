			<p>BFN     [Text] Here are excerpts of the telegrams from His  Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk  in connection with his proposal for a roundtable meeting for  national reconciliation and peace.    1. On 22 April 1994, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk  issued a statement proposing that a roundtable meeting for peace  and national reconciliation be held under his chairmanship.    2. On the same day, after receiving the king's statement,  H.E. Khieu Samphan, chairman of the PDK, immediately sent a  telegram to the king. The contents of this telegram is as  follows:    I am pleased to receive your 22 April 1994 statement. In  keeping with the deepest desire of our entire nation and people,  I, on behalf of the PDK, would like to express total support for  the proposal, which is the product of your profound insight, to  organize a roundtable meeting for peace and national  reconciliation under your majesty's august chairmanship.    3. On 23 April, with a spirit to enable this roundtable  meeting to be held successfully with good results in line with  the king's wish and the deepest aspiration of our entire  Cambodian nation and people, H.E. Khieu Samphan sent a telegram  dated 23 April 1994 to the king. The content of this telegram  is as follows:    The PDK's support for the king's proposal on a roundtable  meeting for peace and national reconciliation comes from the  persistent stand of Democratic Kampuchea, which zealously wants  the Cambodian problem to be resolved quickly to achieve genuine  national reconciliation and unification and enable our Cambodia  to enjoy peace.    All along, Democratic Kampuchea has always supported the  ideas put forth by the king with great insight to enable  Cambodia to achieve national reconciliation, unification, and  peace.    The PDK has fully and unconditionally supported His Majesty  the King's five-point political guideline. At the same time, I  have tried to propose meetings of various levels with a spirit  to accomplish your majesty's five-point idea. But they have all  along opposed our proposals and sought every means to destroy  the peaceful solution.    At the same time, I sought to have an audience with Your  Majesty with an aim to seek a solution to end quickly the bloody  war caused by the foreigners and them.    Recently, Your Majesty and the respected queen kindly  permitted me to have an audience with you on 13 April. But Your  Majesty knew about the security situation, which cannot be  guaranteed even 60 percent, for me and the entire PDK  delegation. Thus, with lofty spirit of responsibility in your  capacity as the father of the nation, Your Majesty kindly  canceled the audience on 13 April and instead grant me an  audience in Beijing in June instead.    The PDK has voiced happily and promptly its support for the  king's proposal on a roundtable meeting made in your 22 April  1994 statement.    I would like to cite some developments for Your Majesty's  information with the aim of arranging favorable conditions for a  secured and neutral negotiation. This is in line with the  profound and sacred desire of the father of peace and national  reconciliation and in line with the aspiration of our entire  nation and people.    The PDK office has come under constant monitoring and  threats  since 18 April 1994. The employees working there could not  carry out their normal activities. The police even prohibited  them from going to the market to buy daily food. They were  allowed to go sometimes, but with policemen tagging along in the  same car or policemen on motorcycles following behind. There  are between 10 and 15 policemen and troops standing in front of  the office gate to show constantly their force. Telephone lines  have all been disconnected. The masses who are relatives of the  PDK members have also been prohibited from entering the office.    This causes a problem, which affects the chances for the  roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation that  the entire Cambodian nation and people, including Democratic  Kampuchea, want so much. I would like to beg Your Majesty to  help arrange for the PDK's office to resume its normal activity.    In addition to this, there is the issue of the National  Assembly members, whose true nature is known to all, proposing a  draft to outlaw the PDK, to make it the rebel. This is direct  and arrogant opposition to the king's proposal for the  roundtable meeting. This law, either with a two-thirds or a  three-thirds majority, is in opposition to the roundtable  meeting and to national reconciliation, national unification,  and peace in Cambodia.    The situation has deteriorated since the time the Vietnamese  invaded Cambodia. They kept opposing and trampling upon the  Paris agreement even after signing it. They resolutely rejected  the four-party policy. In reality, that was outright opposition  to national reconciliation and unification. They refused to  give any role to the four-party Supreme National Council [SNC]  as well as to the king, the SNC chairman. Immediately after the  elections organized by the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia], they began their joint offensive to kill the PDK and  kindle the flame of war which has continued to rage Cambodia  until today.    I and the PDK, like our entire nation and people in the  countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad, want so much to achieve  national reconciliation and unification and to rally all forces  under the shade of the throne and the king. All of this is in  order to bring peace to Cambodia and enable our Cambodian people  to live and make their living in peace and happiness.    In this spirit, despite their trampling upon the Paris  agreement and opposition to the PDK, even by jointly attacking,  opposing, and trying to kill Democratic Kampuchea, I am willing  to let bygones be bygones without any desire for vengeance. I  only think about how to achieve national reconciliation, rally  all national forces, and reunify the nation in line with His  Majesty's national reconciliation policy. This will respond to  the profound aspiration of the entire nation and people, who  want genuine national reconciliation and reunification in a  peaceful, unified, and neutral Cambodia.    For all of the above reasons and through experiences gained  in our Cambodia and from the world, I am of the opinion that the  roundtable meeting should be held in a neutral place -- inside  or outside the country -- where security is guaranteed for all  parties to the negotiation and talks. Only by so doing can the  negotiation and talks proceed normally and the meeting achieve  good results.    The above information that I have reported to Your Majesty  comes out of our thoughts, with a sense of responsibility for  the fate of our nation and people, on what to do in order to  enable the roundtable negotiation be held successfully in line  with Your Majesty's desire and our people's profound aspiration.</p>

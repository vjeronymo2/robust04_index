			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Observer: Princely task When is the Prince of Wales going to recruit somebody who really knows about business to advise him? Matthew Butler, the new assistant private secretary responsible for the Prince's interests in industry and commerce, doesn't sound much different from his predecessors. He is the latest in a line of bright young things who have been seconded to the Prince's private office because they supposedly knew something about business. Lord Hanson lent the Prince a youthful Rupert Fairfax for a couple of years, and Fairfax was followed by Guy Salter, a former personal assistant to Sir Ralph Halpern in the days when he was running Burton. Both were well connected public school boys in their twenties. Butler, like Hugh Merrill who is returning to British Telecom, is little more than a high-powered pr man, having done stints looking after the public outpourings of the Industrial Society, Vickers and most recently Allied Dunbar, the financial services firm. But at least he went to a northern grammar school and has been found by a professional firm of head hunters.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex to co-operate with Budapest exchange THE THREE-year-old Budapest Commodity Exchange is shaping up as eastern Europe's best connected market. This week it signed a memorandum of understanding for co-operation with the New York Mercantile Exchange, the third largest US futures exchange and the world's largest energy market. Budapest already has co-operation agreements with the world's largest two futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. As part of the latest agreement, Budapest must offer Nymex first refusal on any energy product venture in Hungary where it is seeking another participant. The Budapest exchange is planning to launch an oil futures contract in the last quarter of this year. It already trades grain and livestock contracts, the traditional products of the CBoT and CME, respectively. The Nymex-Budapest agreement also encourages the exchange of information and the strengthening of economic and trade relations. Mr Lou Guttman, the Nymex chairman, who was in Budapest for the signing ceremony, said that the New York exchange was 'very excited about the limitless opportunities which can develop as free market forces take hold in this area'. He said Hungary's political stability and relatively advanced economic reforms made it possible for the BCE to become the leading bourse of its kind in central Europe. The Moscow Commodity Exchange has signed similar agreements with Nymex, the CBoT and the CME, but many believe that economic chaos in the former Soviet Union will slow the development of budding exchanges in Russia and other republics.</p>

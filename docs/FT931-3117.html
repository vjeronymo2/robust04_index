			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Mackay delays ruling on barristers' rights LORD Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has again postponed a final decision on whether barristers employed by the Crown Prosecution Service and in the Government Legal Service should be given the right to appear as advocates in the higher courts. Last October the Lord Chancellor (pictured right) and the four senior judges who decide such issues indicated they were not opposed in principle to barristers in the two services having rights of audience in the higher courts, but concluded that the CPS in particular needed more time to overcome initial operating difficulties before taking on the extra responsibility. As a result the judges decided not to approve permanently a Bar Council rule that bans all employed barristers, including those in the CPS and GLS, from appearing in the higher courts. They asked the Bar to consider applying this rule only until the end of 1994 so that the issue could be kept under review. The Bar called on Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, and Mr Gerald Hosker QC, the Treasury solicitor, to withdraw their applications for rights of audience for CPS and GLS barristers. The DPP and the Treasury solicitor urged the Lord Chancellor and the four judges to disapprove the Bar's rule on the basis of an undertaking that they would not seek to exercise wider rights of audience for a period of six months. The Lord Chancellor and the judges have now decided to postpone a final decision until they are in a position to consider barristers' rights together with the Law Society's application for wider rights of audience for solicitors. The Law Society applied to the advisory committee last November on behalf of all solicitors including those employed by the CPS and GLS. The Committee is not expected to advise Lord Mackay on the application until later this year. The Bar welcomed yesterday's announcement. 'The Bar remains opposed on principle to the employment of state prosecutors,' said Mr John Rowe QC, chairman.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Management: Pushing pens and pumping iron - Perks / In-house corporate gyms If the definition of a company perk is a benefit mutually useful to both company and employee then the provision of corporate sporting facilities has long fallen within this category. What originally started as a social idea designed to weld team spirit between employee and employer is now coming to be seen by employees as a right rather than a privilege. Established UK companies such as ICI and Midland Bank have sports grounds and social clubs with histories almost as old as those of the companies. The US craze for squeezing workouts into every waking hour, however, has spawned a new type of facility - the in-house fitness centre. The centres, which usually comprise a multi-gym, aerobics centre and cardio-vascular unit, are becoming increasingly popular among City institutions and large company headquarters as an alternative to corporate membership of health clubs. Most in-house corporate fitness clubs are run on a membership basis requiring an annual subscription. These are often subsidised - which is where the perk comes in - though the Inland Revenue has not yet decided to tax the subsidy. 'I don't think the taxman would try to tax something which is improving a company's bottom line when he's also getting corporation tax,' said Don Genders, managing director of Corporate Gymnasia, which designs and builds gymnasiums. Some companies are moving away from the provision of old-style recreational centres and sports fields located miles from the workplace at an out-of-town site. General Accident recently sold its sports ground in Surrey to a local football club and Standard Chartered Bank has put its own sports ground on the market. Thomas Cook has bucked this trend by building a Pounds 4m leisure centre at its 22-acre headquarters site employing 1,900 people at Peterborough. The centre is designed to complement the outdoor cricket, bowls, football, tennis and croquet pitches. It includes three conference rooms and a day-nursery for up to 50 pre-school children. More typical of recent corporate trends is the installation of on-site fitness centres managed by outside contractors. The two main operators of managed centres in the UK are Fitness For Industry (FFI), a subsidiary of the Forte Group, and Orion, part of the Coverwood Group. Both companies have been around for about 13 years and they are still operating in a small though expanding market. Ann White, operations manager at Orion, said that providing a perk for employees was often the motivation for establishing a company fitness centre. But, she argued, companies were seeing benefits for themselves across the workforce. 'The companies with in-house centres are finding that a wider group of people is using the facility including people who wouldn't normally excercise,' she said. Some 800 of the 1,000 staff at Freshfields, the London legal practice, have had fitness assessments at the firm's in-house gym run by FFI. Of those, 400 now use the gym twice or more every week. Companies such as Ford Motor Company, Wellcome, Rank Xerox and Mercury Communications have gyms operated by Orion which now has 20 in-house gym-management contracts. FFI has 21 clients, including the House of Commons, Robert Fleming, American Express and Air Products. FFI runs two centres for Air Products, the US industrial gases and chemicals manufacturer. The company installed the centres when it moved some of its operations to Basingstoke from its Hersham European headquarters. Air Products has had a large sports centre at its parent headquarters in Allentown, Pennsylvania, for some years so management took little persuading about the merits of in-house gymnasiums in the UK. The centres are run like a club and staff who pay a Pounds 48 subsidised annual membership fee undergo fitness assessments before they start work on cardio-vascular equipment. All are given V02 ratings  - the standard fitness rating based upon a calculation of oxygen intake during excercise. Paul Waldoch, a 31-year-old engineer manager, is one of the Hersham fitness success stories. He joined in January, weighing in at 16 1/2 stones with a V02 of 33 and a blood pressure rate of 166 over 66. Now he is down to 14 stone, his V02 rating is 57, his blood pressure is 127 over 66 and his resting pulse-rate is down from about 75-80 to 60. He has taken up rowing, eats lots of fruit and feels sharper for the experience. 'If you ask most people here I think they would say their work has benefited by being involved in this. You don't get to lunchtime and say I wish the day would finish,' he said. Alan Carver, director of human resources who introduced the fitness centres, said that the 355 members of the club at Hersham, out of a workforce of 800, had acheived a 20 per cent increase in fitness in its first six months. He said: 'People at all levels use the facility and it does break down barriers.' The centre is open three times a day - 7am to 9pm, 12 noon to 2pm and 5pm to 8pm. All sessions are supervised. Fitting out the centre in a 1,600ft pre-fabricated building in the grounds of the headquarters cost Pounds 38,000. A further Pounds 50,000 was spent adding showers and flooring. Annual running costs to the company are about Pounds 50,000. 'When you consider the benefits for staff from that sort of outlay I think it is a very attractive proposition,' said Carver. The fitness centre is only part of a wider promotion of health and fitness at Air Products which includes an almost evangelical approach to safety. The company believes its policies have paid measurable dividends. In 1975 it had 110 incidents across Europe that resulted in staff needing time off; 4,000 working-days were lost as a result. Last year Air Products had just eight such incidents resulting in a loss of 50 man-days. An internal survey of FFI's clients showed that, on average, from a total sample of 800 scores the fitness ratings of those taking part had risen by more than 16 per cent between six-month assessments. Little UK data is available to assess the benefits of corporate fitness programmes. Reports in the US, where the high cost of health care has generated enthusiasm for such programmes, indicate lower absenteeism, reduced health-care costs, increased morale and improved efficiency among workers. Coverwood looked at 97 of the US reports and found that, while all the surveys showed positive results, the findings varied widely and benefits tended to be overstated. On one of its own managed sites, however, Coverwood said that its fitness programme had saved more than Pounds 300,000 in working days lost because of back pain. Coverwood is now introducing programmes to take corporate fitness into the management training field. 'We are trying to develop a new way of looking at things. We want corporate financial management to use fitness centres as a training base,' said Barry Morgan, chief executive of the group. This is the third article in a series on company perks.

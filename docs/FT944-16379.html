			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft defends actions in curbing US losses Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German industrial and trading company, said last night losses on its rolling forward controversial US oil contracts would have reached Dollars 50m a month last December if it had not acted to unwind them. Defending the way it dealt with the loss-making contracts - in which derivatives (mostly futures) were used to hedge long-term fixed price contracts - it said the authors of critical articles in the US had misunderstood the nature of the crisis facing the company. This nearly led to the collapse of the company, forcing German banks to head a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.19bn) rescue effort in January this year. 'We're happy with what we've done and will remain happy with what we've done,' said Mr Michael Hutchinson, managing director of Metallgesellschaft Ltd in London and a member of the team which dealt with the liquidity problems stemming from the contracts. Metallgesellschaft argued there had been no alternative to its strategy. It said the authors of the US articles, including Mr Merton Miller, a Nobel prize-winner for economics, had subsequently corrected some of their opinions in a new article to be published soon. Mr Hutchinson said the US oil trading subsidiary suffered 'very substantial cash losses' every month as it closed out and then reinstated its entire trading position - 'a position so large that it was the equivalent of 85 days worth of the entire oil output of Kuwait'. The losses stemmed from falling oil prices and a sustained contango (futures prices at a premium over spot prices). The contango losses rose to between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m a month and would have reached Dollars 50m in December if the company had not begun unwinding its position. It declined to comment on how the company had got into this situation, citing this Friday's court hearing over the Dollars 1bn compensation claim by Mr Arthur Benson, a former senior executive at MG Marketing &amp; Refining in New York. MG Corp, a US unit of Metallgesellschaft, said it had paid Dollars 900m in margin calls on oil hedges in 1993 and lost at least Dollars 40m in October and November that year in the oil futures market, Reuter adds from New York.</p>

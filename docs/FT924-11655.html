			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Bank of Italy drops discount rate to 14% THE Bank of Italy yesterday announced it was lowering the discount rate one percentage point to 14 per cent from Monday. This is the first signal that the Italian monetary authorities believe the recent turbulence in the international foreign exchange markets has calmed and that the lira has achieved a relatively stable floating rate. The move came a day after the Italian parliament approved a special law delegating the Amato government to carry out structural reforms in pensions, the health service, local government and the civil service. These four areas have been one of the main causes of the country's huge public sector deficit, equivalent to more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The reforms will provide one third of the savings in the 1993 budget. A Bank of Italy statement said the drop in the discount rate was also prompted by the calmer state of the international markets and by the continued decline in Italian inflation. Preliminary figures for this month suggest the annual average for inflation will be 5 per cent. Although this continued fall has yet to reflect the effects of the lira's devaluation and float since it left the Exchange Rate Mechanism along with sterling on September 17, the authorities appear confident the impact can be limited in Italy's depressed economy. The central bank has been under pressure for several days to follow the general easing of rates in Europe, and in the past two weeks has been gradually lowering its short term and overnight rates. However, this time it has been especially cautious. Officials were well aware of the experience of August. On August 8 the discount rate was dropped from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent in response to parliament approving the 1992 emergency budget. But by the end of the month the Bank of Italy was forced to begin defending the lira again, leading to the last rise on September 4. Each one percentage point drop in interest rates is estimated to lower the cost of servicing Italy's debt by some L15,000bn a year. Over the past week, the lira has stabilised against the D-Mark around the L870 to L880 level. This compares with floating rates of nearly L1,000 at the height of market turbulence. The current parity is close to where Bank officials believe the lira could hold. This is a 16 per cent devaluation against the German currency. Officials yesterday declined to specify when the lira was likely to seek re-entry to the ERM. But Italy is expected to wait until more items in the budget are approved and completion of negotiations for an Ecu8bn standby facility from the EC. This means re-entry is unlikely before December. Mr Florio Fiorini, the Geneva-based Italian financier, has been arrested by Swiss police on charges of alleged fraud in connection with the collapse of his stock market quoted Sasea holding company, writes Haig Simonian from Milan. Mr Fiorini is best known as the one-time partner of Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian businessman with whom he took over the MGM film studios in the US. The two financiers parted company last year, and Mr Parretti has since been involved in a legal battle with his bankers. The administrators of Sasea have until the end of February to put forward plans to restructure the group. In spite of numerous disposals, Sasea is still weighed down by heavy borrowings.</p>

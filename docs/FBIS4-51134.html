			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Private Businesses Are Said To Need Private </F> Banks"]    [Text] China should set up privately owned banks to assist  the development of the country's private businesses, said the  All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (FIC).    Gu Qixuan, deputy director of the economic department of the  FIC, said that China should consider setting up private banks to  use the country's great amount of savings to supply individual  businesses with much-needed cash for capital construction.    This has become clearly important, as the country's  individual savings now exceed 1,200 billion yuan ($138 billion)  and at least an other 400 billion yuan ($46 billion) is lying  idle in the pockets of the public.    At the same time, many private firms are plagued by a severe  shortage of capital for expanding production and updating  manufacturing technology, he added.    Gu noted that some 10 per cent of the country's private  businesses have suspended operations due to financial problems,  while another 30 per cent are losing money in their operations.    The introduction of privately run banking firms would not  only increase market competition to stimulate the State-run  banks to strive for better operations, but would also create a  new financial channel for the country's fledgling private  industries.    The country's privately run industries, whose output last  year surpassed 397 billion yuan ($45.6 billion), were often  denied loans by the State banks, which give priority to the  government's key projects.    In order to receive government financial support, some  provinces and regions have given at least 83 per cent of the  privately run rural enterprises the title of "collective firms,"  he added.    Gu predicted that by the end of this year, private  businesses  will number 370,000, up 55 per cent from the same period last  year.    Their workforce will hit 5.35 million, up 54 per cent, and  their registered assets will amount to 200 billion yuan ($23  billion), a rise of 193 per cent from the end of 1993.    While strengthening the financial and tax management of the  private businesses, government officials should also change  their prejudice against individual businessmen, which have  already become a major financial contributor to State coffers,  he suggested.    China's private businesses are now awaiting government  treatment equal to that given to State firms, even as the  country wants to diversify its service industry as part of the  efforts to develop a market-oriented economy. Along with the  central government's decision in 1992 to encourage  non-governmental businesses, most local authorities have also  formulated their relevant policies on facilitating the  development of local private businesses.    However, there remain imbalances in the development of  private businesses among different regions of the country.    Official figures show that at least 69.85 per cent of the  country's private businesses are now in East China, where  economic development is faster than other areas.    Another 19 per cent are in Central China and only 1.18 per  cent are in the western part of the country.</p>

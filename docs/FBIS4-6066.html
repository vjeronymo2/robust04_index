			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] REPUBLIKA and KOMPAS believe that violent actions,  like the recent protest demonstrations in Medan, require serious  attention from the authorities. REPUBLIKA says the incident in  Medan has destroyed the image of the labor movement and  expressed hope that the incident will serve as an important  lesson for both the government and businessmen.    Meanwhile, KOMPAS describes as correct and praiseworthy the  remarks made by the chairman of the North Sumatra regional  chapter of the Coordinating Agency for the Strengthening of  National Stability to the effect that the agency will help solve  the issues of the minimum wage and workers' rights because this  will lead to a fair and harmonious relationship between workers  and employers.</p>

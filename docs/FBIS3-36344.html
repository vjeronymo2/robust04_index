			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Feb 02, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas said he is very concerned that trained  specialists are moving to private structures and thus weaken the  scientific potential of research institutes and institutions of  higher education.    Speaking at the annual Lithuanian Science and Industry  conference in Kaunas Tuesday [1 February], the president  emphasized the need to preserve the remaining scientific nucleus  and to train new specialists for the country.    Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius admitted in his report  that the state is unable to maintain all scientific personnel.    The number of scientific personnel decreased by nearly 30  percent over the past three years, but, in the premier's view,  the country's higher education institutions do not experience a  shortage of specialists yet.    The four-day conference in Kaunas will try to find solutions  to problems of developing Lithuanian science and will search for  a way out a crisis that was caused by the worsening economic  situation. The conference is attended by members of the  government, university rectors and scholars.</p>

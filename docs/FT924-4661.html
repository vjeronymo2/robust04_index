			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Aluminium producer sees its future in cars - The new chairman of Reynolds Metals explains his strategy to Kenneth Gooding STEERING his company towards more business from the carmakers is a top priority for Mr Richard Holder, new chairman of Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium company. It is conceivable, he says, that by the end of the decade Reynolds' transportation business, which generates a turnover of about Dollars 500m a year, will be as big as the group's packaging operations are today - and they bring in about Dollars 2.5bn. 'Sure, there is a big question mark about how much aluminium is going to be used in cars. 'But even a conservative forecast says to us that in five years the average will be 350lb of aluminium per car (in the US), up from 170lb last year,' Mr Holder points out. If the motor industry decides to make substantial numbers of cars from extruded aluminium space frames - skeleton-like structures - or starts to use aluminium for body panels, the 350lb a vehicle estimate will be left far behind. Reynolds recently gave the go-ahead for a Dollars 26m plant at Auburn, Indiana, where it will produce aluminium extruded components for the motor industry - components such as bumper systems, door intrusion beams and sunroof tracks. Mr Holder points out that Reynolds will make a better return on its aluminium by producing such components. The company has 28 automotive-related plants around the world, and technology to be used at the Auburn plant was developed in the Netherlands. As part of the scramble by aluminium companies world-wide to prepare for the motor industry boom, Reynolds in April signed an agreement on joint automotive research with Mitsubishi Aluminium and Sumitomo Light Metal Industries of Japan. Mr Holder has been with Reynolds for 39 years. He was chief operating officer from 1986, so his appointment as chairman and chief executive in succession to Mr Bill Bourke, who retired in April, was expected. He and his board have acted swiftly to sharpen the focus on Reynolds' core operations. Before he had settled in the chairman's seat, the Eskimo Pie ice cream business (acquired from a bankrupt customer in the distant past) had been sold. Alrelco, which supplies secondary (scrap) aluminium to automotive die casters, was put up for sale and the aluminium cable operations sold to BICC, the international cables and construction group. The latter deal included a provision for Reynolds to supply BICC with competitively-priced aluminium rod for 15 years. Mr Holder says that, 'at the right price,' Reynolds' gold business and its property development division would also be sold. Reynolds now has the capacity to generate about two-thirds of the aluminium it needs from its own plants and that is enough for now, according to Mr Holder. 'We would rather put our investment dollars strategically into end-use markets where margins (of profit) are higher,' he says. Reynolds and Mitsubishi of Japan have quietly shelved an aluminium smelter project in Venezuela, but the US group is still committed to providing technical assistance for a smelter which is being built in Nigeria. That project is making slow progress because the Nigerian government, which is financing the scheme, is short of cash. Mr Holder suggests there is still plenty of growth left in the packaging business. In the US, aluminium has virtually replaced steel for canned fizzy drinks, but growth will come from increasing use of aluminium in other areas of the packaging market. Outside the US, the aluminium beverage can revolution has only just begun. Reynolds also expects to win more international business for its other packaging products. The group's Reynolds Wrap aluminium foil has nearly 100 per cent retail distribution in the US, and at the end of the 1980s the group capitalised on this by acquiring more packaging companies. Mr Holder says that, now these have been successfully digested, more packaging purchases are on the cards. Mr Holder has taken over at a time when Reynolds is battling through a severe recession in the industry. But, he points out, Reynolds is in far better shape than in the last recession at the begining of the 1980s. His predecessor, Mr Bourke, was recruited from Ford Motor to overhaul Reynolds. The company shut down three high-cost US aluminium smelters, bauxite mines in Jamaica and Arkansas, and the workforce was cut by one-third to 27,000 (subsequent acquisitions took it back to 31,000). That rationalisation cost Dollars 600m. Reynolds recently completed a Dollars 3bn, five-year capital spending programme, which, among other things, gave it a great deal of low-cost aluminium smelting capacity in Canada. Mr Holder says the group will spend an average of Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m annually over the next three years, 'depending on the way the economy is going.' Reynolds aims to be 'cash neutral', if possible - to cover expenditure by internally-generated funds - and to keep its debt-to-equity ratio in the 'low 30s.' Mr Bourke set Reynolds a target of a 20 per cent return on equity, averaged over the economic cycle. Mr Holder, an aluminium rather than a motor industry man, says the new board has yet to set a target, but '15 per cent is probably more realistic.'</p>

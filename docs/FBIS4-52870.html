			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Just Overture for Durable Peace on Korean Peninsula" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  describes the DPRK's proposal for replacing the Armistice  Agreement with a peace agreement and establishing a new peace  arrangement as a timely and realistic measure to settle the  nuclear and other acute issues on the Korean peninsula and open  a new phase in the improvement of DPRK-USA relations and  inter-Korean relations.    The paper says in a by-lined article:    To remove military confrontation and the danger of war and  preserve peace on the Korean peninsula is a vital question  related to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the future  destiny of the Korean people and a main key to the preservation  of peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world.    Due to the reckless illegalities of the United States, a  signatory to the Armistice Agreement, military confrontation  remains and the danger of a new war is increasing on the Korean  peninsula.    The United States is trying its hardest to stifle the DPRK  with strength over its "nuclear issue" while wantonly violating  the Armistice Agreement.    The DPRK and the United States are signatories to the  Armistice Agreement. Therefore, hostile relations between them  cannot be removed nor can rapprochement be achieved without  replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and  establishing a new peace arrangement.    A glance at the existing truce arrangement justifies an  early  realization of the DPRK's peace overture. The present truce  arrangement is a legal and institutional mechanism to check arms  buildup and military confrontation, stabilise the situation and  preserve peace on the Korean peninsula. But it fails to play  its role as such today.    After the collapse of the East-West cold war structure and  the equilibrium of strength, the United States, acting the "only  superpower," is shipping large quantities of military equipment  to South Korea in broad daylight and becoming more undisguised  in its military threat to the DPRK, a signatory to the  Armistice Agreement, in an effort to stifle it. This means that  the United States has unilaterally and totally abrogated the  Korean Armistice Agreement it signed in the name of the United  Nations, and nullified the provisions of the agreement.    The United States must discard the anachronistic  confrontation concept and war psychology and accede to the  DPRK-proposed negotiations for peace.</p>

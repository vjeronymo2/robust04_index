			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions provide impetus for 33% advance at Graseby GRASEBY, the medical products and controls group formerly known as Cambridge Electronic Industries, yesterday reported annual profits up a third, reflecting contributions from Tace and Goring Kerr, both acquired during the year. Pre-tax profits for 1991 rose from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 10.3m on sales 10 per cent lower at Pounds 107.3m. Some Pounds 3m of the Pounds 13.2m trading profits came from the five months contributions of Tace, the environmental monitoring company, and Goring Kerr, the instruments business. Earnings per share, after exceptional costs for the rationalisation of defence businesses, were up 0.1p at 16.1p. The final dividend is maintained at 7.6p for a same-again total of 10.9p. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said the acquisitions had lived up to expectations and enabled earnings per share to be marginally increased. The group also made an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.56m to write off trade investments and cover the cost of closing and selling two businesses. Shareholders' funds fell by Pounds 13.3m as a result of a Pounds 2.3m deficit for the year after dividend payments and an Pounds 11m write-off of goodwill on the acquisition of Tace and Goring Kerr. As a result gearing rose to 67 per cent. On the trading side, the medical businesses were hit by lower NHS spending. Sales rose only 4 per cent and profits were held at about Pounds 2.8m. Environmental and defence businesses were boosted by Gulf war related sales of chemical agent monitors which helped profits more than double from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 6.85m on sales up 80 per cent at Pounds 40.5m. Research and development spending rose from just over 3 per cent to 5.2 per cent of sales, or Pounds 5.6m, in addition to which the group received Pounds 2.4m of external R&amp;D funding from the US Defense Department and the UK Ministry of Defence. COMMENT Rather than being dilutive as some had feared during the takeover last year, the integration of Tace and Goring Kerr has been greatly earnings enhancing. It was a good thing too. The medical division, the old group's star performer, suffered in the second half from lower NHS spending. Further growth here in the absence of new products will be more difficult as Graseby already has such a large share of its NHS markets. The company can similarly not rely on benefiting from large one-off orders of detection instruments made during the Gulf war, although the US army could soon place another sizeable order. This year is therefore likely to be at best flat, possibly bleaker. The company will benefit from a lower tax charge this year, but it is still unlikely to make profits above Pounds 12m which would give earnings of 13.9p and a prospective multiple of 15.</p>

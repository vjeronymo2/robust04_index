			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / South Korean President in Beijing South Korean President Kim Young-sam will mix business with diplomacy during his visit to China, hoping to win new orders for Korean companies, John Burton reports from Seoul. Economic issues that will be discussed include the Chinese purchase of Korean telephone exchanges, a proposed Sino-Korea project to develop and market mid-sized commercial airliners and the participation of Korean industry in China's infrastructure programme. The two countries also plan to form an industrial co-operation committee to promote business ties and technology exchanges. North Korea has accused Washington and Seoul of risking a 'catastrophic crisis' by putting their armed forces personnel on alert on the Korean peninsula, Reuter adds from Tokyo. 'These provocative moves are very dangerous developments which may cause a catastrophic crisis on the Korean peninsula,' said the official Korean Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo.</p>

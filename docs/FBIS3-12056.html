			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 26 and 29 March.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 26 March reports that  Guantanamo  Province has been one of the most outstanding provinces in  harvest emulation during the period between 11 and 20 March.  Guantanamo has been cited in 7 of the 14 aspects rated in the  harvest emulation, and it also intends to increase sugar  production and fulfill its plan.    In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that  approximately 13,000 low-cost houses will be built in Sancti  Spiritus Province by 1996 using local resources. This will help  triple the number of houses built per year in this province,  which is experiencing a tremendous shortage of energy, cement,  and steel. Approximately 2,000 houses are under construction,  most in 40 high-priority zones.    Rebelde adds in the same newscast that the U.S. Conference  of  Catholic Bishops has donated 7 tons of medicines worth $2.5  million to Cuba.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 28 March report  that Camaguey canecutters are engaged in a campaign to increase  production and efficiency. In 80 days they cut 2 million arrobas  of cane and are talking about cutting another million, if  necessary.    In the same newscast, Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision report  that as the water shortage continues, farmers are resorting to  old techniques to provide water to their cattle. One said he is  using a mule to draw water from a deep well for his milk cows  because bringing in water tanks costs an arm and a leg.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 28 March reports that a new  system for selling medicines has been implemented with positive  results in Holguin Province pharmacies. The pharmacies "have  been linked" to polyclinics and assistance centers, and  "pharmaceutical products that used to disappear off the shelves  in a single day now last up to a month....Doctors at polyclinics  and assistance centers now know daily what products are  available."    In the same newscast, the radio reports that only 326 of the  6,751 pieces of medical equipment at Matanzas Province  assistance centers are currently out of service because they are  broken. This constitutes a praiseworthy achievement by the  workers of the provincial electromedical technical services  center.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 March reports that  specialists and technicians from the Rayonitro enterprise in  Matanzas are satisfactorily carrying out tests to obtain  ammonium dicyanate,"a reagent that is of interest in producing  meningitis vaccine." Rayonitro engineer Damaso Lopez said there  is currently a plant that "facilitates production of carbon  bisulphide, which is raw material for processing the reagent in  question." Rayonitro can currently make, industrially, some 60  tons per year of carbon bisulphide, considerably reducing the  amount Cuba has to import. "Carbon bisulphide is a dense,  transparent, very volatile liquid. Its cost on the world market  is between $2,000 and 2,500 per ton, while by employing the  Matanzas technology, its use is facilitated at a cost of just  500 pesos the ton."    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 28 March reports that the  oilworkers of Ciego de Avila Province met 105 percent of their  plan for the extraction of crude oil for the first quarter of  1994 by extracting 17,373 tons before the deadline. They also  drilled 5,005 meters instead of the 2,520 established in their  drilling program.    In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that over the  past two years, 60 caballerias of cacao have been planted with  hybrid seeds that have a high genetic potential and are  resistant to environmental adversity. The seeds were produced by  the cacao research station located in Baracoa Municipality,  Guantanamo Province, the municipality that produces the greatest  number of seeds from plants resistant to pests, disease, and bad  weather. Guantanamo Province produces close to 80 percent of the  national cacao crop of between 35,000 and 45,000 quintals yearly.    Cuba Vision at 2320 GMT on 28 March reports that tobacco  enterprises in Pinar del Rio are picking the capa dura leaves  which are normally discarded during the harvest. They plan to  use these leaves in domestic cigarettes and cigars.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 29 March reports that up to 26  March, the sugar agroindustry had planted 2,740 caballerias of  sugarcane, 80 percent of the amount scheduled for planting by  the end of this month. The provinces of Camaguey, Havana,  Matanzas, Cienfuegos, and Guantanamo are outstanding in this  activity.    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 29 March reports that the (Juan  Jose Berdesi) and Jose Maria Perez brigades have cut 2 million  arrobas of sugarcane, becoming the first to reach this amount  during the current harvest in Santiago de Cuba Province.    Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 29 March reports that 1 million  quintals of potatoes have been harvested in Havana Province.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 March reports that a fish  farm in Los Palacios Municipality has successfully bred a  Chinese variety known as the (fenca china). In the first tests  in 10 ponds, 6 million eggs were obtained, of which 4.2 million  hatched. Radio Rebelde also reports that 46 quintals of  sunflower seeds have been harvested in Cienfuegos to produce  cooking oil.</p>

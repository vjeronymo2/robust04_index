			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Names allowed to borrow on profits Lloyd's Names are to be allowed to borrow against this year's expected profits to help them meet losses of an expected Pounds 2.5bn for the 1991 year. Lloyd's will announce its fourth consecutive year of loss next week, in line with its three-year accounting system. 'This is part of a package of measures to assist Names to trade through,' explained Mr David Rowland, chairman. He said Names could take credit for up to 3 per cent of their 1994 premium income limits - the amount of income they are permitted to underwrite. With Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, supplying Pounds 9.3bn in capacity this year, the measure should allow them to borrow up to Pounds 279m. But the facility will only be made available where managing agents, who administer Lloyd's syndicates, consider it 'appropriate'. Last year Lloyd's allowed Names to borrow up to 5 per cent of premium limit, an amount equivalent to about Pounds 440m. About Pounds 375m of the facility was used. Lloyd's is expected to post profits for the 1993 and 1994 years, after steep increases in premium rates. The special credit can be used by Names to help them through the solvency test, an exercise conducted every year to assesses their ability to meet liabilities. It should ease pressure on the Lloyd's central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet their obligations. Mr Rowland stressed that these measures were designed to deal with 'exceptional circumstances' and should not be seen as a 'precedent for the future'. Chatset, the publisher which monitors Lloyd's results, estimated before yesterday's announcement that Names would need to pay Pounds 1,788m of the 1991 loss by the end of July. Chatset has also revised downwards its estimate of the 1991 result to Pounds 2,546m, after earlier suggesting that it could exceed Pounds 3bn.</p>

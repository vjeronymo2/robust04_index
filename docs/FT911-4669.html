			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ore tests delay nickel project for second time OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish state-owned base metals group, and Australian Consolidated Minerals (ACM) have delayed for a second time giving the go-ahead to the Mt Keith nickel project in Western Australia. The scheme would produce 28,000 tonnes annually of nickel in concentrate, adding about 5 per cent to western world supplies. Tests have shown that some of the ore has a higher level of magnesia than showed up previously and this might affect operating costs at the proposed mine and/or treatment charges at the smelter. Outokumpu said yesterday that tests to determine the precise levels of magnesia will take at least two months to complete. Pending the outcome, the commercial agreements between the partners may have to be reviewed. Agreements between Outokumpu and ACM expire in September if a decision to develop Mt Keith has not been made by then. Mr Graham Mascall, business development director of Outokumpu Metals and Resources International, said it was still too early to determine if the magnesia found in the orebody was due to a procedural error. 'There may be big or small amounts of magnesia (in the orebody). Tests may prove that it may not be a problem after all,' he said. In 1989 large-scale pilot plant samples taken from Mt Keith indicated that nickel concentrate assaying 20 per cent nickel could be produced at 75 per cent metal recovery rates. Outokumpu is also considering mining nickel at its joint venture with Forrestania, the Australian group in which it has 50 per cent shareholding. Forrestania's mine, about 200 miles south-east of Perth, is expected to begin production at the end of next year and would produce annually between 7,000 and 8,000 tonnes of nickel.</p>

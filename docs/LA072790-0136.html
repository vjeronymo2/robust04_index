			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURF COUNTY, USA;  </P> <P> SURF'S UP;  </P> <P> A LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S BEST BREAKS  </P> <P> If riding waves is your idea of the ultimate in recreation, then the beaches of  Orange County are the Playgrounds of your dreams. From Seal Beach to San Onofre  lies a stretch of sand and surf that features fast, hollow tubes, slow, rolling  peaks, and everything in between.  </P> <P> There are high-powered point breaks, such as Trestles, where some of the  world's best surfers hone their skills. And there are low-key beach breaks,  such as Bolsa Chica, where beginners get their first mouthful of saltwater  while floundering in the white water. Indeed, there's something for everyone  with a surfboard and a love for the waves.  </P> <P> BEACH BREAK WAVE  </P> <P> At Huntington Beach and other beach breaks, ocean storms and variations in  swell direction can change the character and size of a beach break wave in a  matter of days or even hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The presence of a continental shelf miles out slows the beach break and  diminishes its energy.  </P> <P> Shifting sand bars create an alternating pattern of breaking waves and open  channels allowing surging water to flow laterally in the primary surf zone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offshore winds can smooth and shape the wave into perfect plunging cylinders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Water surging toward the shore escapes back to the sea through deep-water  channels.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT BREAK WAVE  </P> <P> waves peel around the point at Trestles and dump onto shore giving the surfer  one of the best rides in Southern California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Swell advances toward shore and wraps around the point at Trestles and crashes  onto the cobblestone beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Current sweeps around the point into a channel that runs around the  shoulders of the waves.  </P> <P> </P></p>

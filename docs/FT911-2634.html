			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Recession hits steelmakers DOFASCO, Canada's largest steelmaker, made a small profit in the first quarter, but its competitor, Stelco, continues in a precarious cash position with mounting losses, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Both companies have been badly hit by the recession and high steel imports from the US, and see little chance of a turnround in 1991. In addition, Stelco is struggling to recover from the impact of a long strike last year. Dofasco, with a large sheet business, recorded first-quarter earnings of CDollars 11.2m (USDollars 9.6m), or 7 cents a share, up 12 per cent from a year earlier on sales down 12.5 per cent at almost CDollars 500m. Stelco lost CDollars 52m, or CDollars 1.56 a share, against a loss of CDollars 13m, or 48 cents, while sales dropped 42 per cent to CDollars 370m. The company is trying to negotiate higher bank credit lines. Stelco has stopped paying common and preferred dividends and Dofasco has cut its quarterly rate from 32 cents to 20 cents a share. It wrote off its CDollars 713m investment in Algoma Steel at the end of 1990.</p>

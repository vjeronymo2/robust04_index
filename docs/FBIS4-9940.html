			<p>BFN     [Text] Once again, the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the  eastern coasts of the United States will be the stage for  military manuevers by U.S. naval, air, and land forces. These  manuevers are called the (Fleet-tex-2-94) Joint Exercise.  Today's edition of the newspaper GRANMA points out that for the  purpose of setting the inhabitants of all regions of the world  at ease vis-a-vis the mobilization of its military forces, the  U.S. Government usually announces that the maneuvers are routine  or that they are merely innocent exercises.    In this case, GRANMA adds, the U.S. Department of Defense  says its goal is to put its stamp of approval on a large portion  of those forces to be mobilized to Europe. It is difficult to  understand the essence of that idea when the allegedly innocent  exercises include approximately 13,000 troops; 23 ships,  including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier; and more than 100  airplanes.    GRANMA, which is the official newspaper of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, also emphasizes the  participation of an Argentine destroyer and submarine, which  join a very dangerous military buildup in regions very far from  their home base. Last, GRANMA underscores the moral, derived  from another Creole saying: The road to hell is paved with good  intentions.</p>

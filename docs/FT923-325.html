			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Arts: Op Art thirty years on - William Packer hails Bridget Riley's latest work Bridget Riley woke up one morning, nearly 30 years ago, to find herself famous. There she was, the leading exponent of what we still call 'hard-edge' painting or 'post-painterly abstraction', which, by its insistent linear and rhythmical repetition teased the retina into an active, even neurotic response. But we are all too easily made the prisoners of our labels, and Op Art, travestied to banality in the 1960s, has dogged Miss Riley's reputation ever since. The point, however, is not that she is not an op artist, in the sense that she is still centrally concerned in her work with the retinal frisson that may be stimulated by close and particular combinations of tone and colour, but only that Op Art itself still stands in its 1960s character, the trivial, dated, ephemeral concern of an art-historical moment. That moment passed, but she went on working, slowly and consistently over the years, developing and extending her formal ideas and the scope of their expression. She exhibited regularly through the 1970s and '80s with the Rowan Gallery, which is now sadly closed and which gave notable support to current British abstraction through difficult times. But the last gallery show was five years ago, and since the 1980s she has had little group shows or major tours other than a handful of retrospective and study exercises. As she moved into her own 60s, Miss Riley found herself in the position, unusual for her but common enough, of having a substantial body of recent work that few had seen. This exhibition, which comes to the Hayward from Germany, where it was shown at Nurnberg and Bottrop, is therefore both timely and useful. In all we have heard, these 10 years past - of conceptualism, post-modernism and the revival of figuration - the tacit assumption has been that abstraction, if not yet dead exactly, has become academic and irrelevant. It was not so, and will never be true so long as serious artists stick seriously to what they believe they should do. This survey of the work of the past 10 years marks the transition from the simple abutment of narrow vertical stripes across the canvas, to an imagery more obviously active and complex. The vertical stripes remain, but are broader, and are no longer of a single colour but disrupted by a system of diagonal multi-coloured stripes. It is in the nature of the diagonal to inform the composition with speed and movement, counter and complement to the essential stability of the vertical. The device that here fuses the two elements together is the simple modular parallelogram, in an infinite number of combinations, actual or implied. To put it so baldly is perhaps to make it sound little more than an arid technical exercise or trick, but the reality is so much more than that. The viewer is drawn in to a complexity of visual choice, contradiction and reconsideration - now see it this way, now that. For, flat as these paintings are, their essential subjects are space and light, and the play of the one in informing the other. Should we choose to see them so, the vertical columns move forward optically a little, or back as the case may be, in relation to each other and the shafts of light stream through the shallow space between them, as through the trees of a forest or the pillars of a church. Or again we might choose the diagonal emphasis, and the space opens out as in a schematic, isometric perspective, seen from above, tilting towards us. It is no landscape in any direct sense at all, and yet the forms begin to move before and behind each other, and the eye is drawn in to an ever shifting yet coherent space. And over all there is the colour, moving across the canvas in its several elements like clouds or shadows, the emphasis given now to the more airy colours, the blues and greens, now to the weightier, denser pinks, browns, blacks. From such differences each composition gains its character, yet a character not of obvious and direct disposition, one mass of colour here, another there, but rather of mutual infiltration, balance and adjustment. As in music, tone, pitch, chromatic variation, the weight and presence of the piece overall, are a matter of single notes. Admirable and beautiful as this exhibition is, especially so in the more natural light of the Hayward's upper floor, I have one practical criticism to make, and one suggestion to offer the visitor. For all the apparent and disarming simplicity of imagery, these are dense and complex works which work slowly on the eye and mind, and reveal their true qualities and mysteries only after particular and close attention. As it is presented here, it requires of the visitor more time perhaps than it is reasonable to expect. Culled by about a quarter, or a third perhaps, it would be no less comprehensive and impressive a demonstration, and certainly less daunting a commitment. The pairing of this exhibition with The Art of Mexico downstairs is not at all so arbitrary and unsympathetic as one might think, but each requires so different an order of concentration and attention that a considerable mental adjustment is needed between the two, to do either exhibition justice. The shift is from the figurative, symbolic and anecdotal to the purely visual and abstract. It is usually a good idea to move from the general to the particular, and so, should both shows be the object of a single visit, my advice would be to see the Bridget Riley first.

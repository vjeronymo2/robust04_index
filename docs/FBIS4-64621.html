			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has declared that  an investigation has been launched in connection with the  incidents that erupted following the May Day demonstrations in  Ankara. He added that necessary action will be taken against  those who were responsible, in line with the outcome of the  investigation.    Mentese replied to an off-the-agenda speech by Celal  Kurkoglu, Social Democratic Populist Party deputy from Adiyaman,  at the Turkish Grand National Assembly, which convened under the  chairmanship of Vefa Tanir today. In his statement, Mentese  remarked that the Ankara security director has been removed from  office pending the conclusion of the investigation and the other  persons involved in the incident have also been identified.    Mentese pointed out that although Turk-Is [Turkish  Confederation of Labor], DISK [Confederation of Revolutionary  Worker Unions], and Hak-Is [Turkish Moral Rights Workers Union]  acquired a permit for the demonstration, many illegal  organizations also participated in the demonstrations in Ankara.  Members of these organizations, Mentese noted, shouted  separatist slogans and carried placards with similar contents.    [Begin Mentese recording] As far as we could determine,  legal unions belonging to Turk-Is, DISK, and Hak-Is, as well as  illegal unions, and the civil servants platform attended the  demonstrations. Also attending were members of the Turkish  Communist Party [TCP] Marxist-Leninist [ML] organization under  the placard of the "Banner of labor"; members of the TCP Spark  [Kivilcim] Dev-Genc [Revolutionary Youth] Resistance [Direnis]  under the placard of the DIRENIS magazine; members of the  Turkish Northern Kurdistan Liberation Organization [Turkiye  Kuzey Kurdistan Kurtulus Orgutu] under the placard of the  "United socialist alternative, young hope, young liberation";  and members of the Dev-Yol [Revolutionary Path] organization  under the placards of "Revolutionary youth, the right to speak,  authority, power to the people," and "Struggle until the  liberation of Huseyin Mahil Ulas." These are illegal  organizations.    I continue: Members of the Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left]  organization marched under the banners of "Dev-Genc  [Revolutionary Youth] free [word indistinct] struggle"; members  of the Turkish Revolutionary Communist Party under the banner of  "Work, bread, freedom"; members of the Turkish Revolutionary  Communists Union [Turkiye Ihtilalci Komunistler Birligi] under  the banner of "Sweat of the brow"; members of the TCP-ML-TMLGP  [expansion unknown] under the banner of "New democratic youth,  partisan youth"; members of Direnis Movement under the banner of  ODAK [FOCUS] magazine; members of the Militants for Anarchy and  Terrorism under the banner of "Anarchist"; members of the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] under the banner of "Long live the  brotherhood of peoples"; and members of the Rizgari organization  marched under the banner of "Rizgari." [end recording]    Mentese declared that despite this, the demonstration was  followed with patience to prevent any incidents. When the  crowds were about to disperse, however, a group of about 200  people belonging to illegal organizations refused to disperse  despite all warnings and insisted on marching towards Kizilay,  Mentese reported. He explained that the members of the group  stoned the security forces, who in turn, prevented them from  entering the prohibited zone. Mentese expressed regret and  condemned the action against Ankara Deputy Salman Kaya, who was  present at the scene of the incident. Mentese said that those  who stoned the security forces, who were fulfilling their duty,  should also be condemned in the same way.</p>

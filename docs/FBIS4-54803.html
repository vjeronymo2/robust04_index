			<p>BFN     [Text] It is now the third day since the companies engaged  in the division of farmland suspended work on restoring the land  to its owners. They will continue their action until the  Agriculture and Finance Ministries, the government, and  parliament examine their problems and make official decisions on  them. Today representatives from companies all over the country  held a protest march.    [Unidentified correspondent] The march began with a rally  held in front of the Agriculture Ministry. The protesters  believe that our country lacks the political will to resolve the  problems of the land reform. For almost one month, their  attempts to hold negotiations with the institutions responsible  have been postponed with the excuse that the prime minister was  ill and ministers were abroad.    [Unidentified protester] Our first demand is that the  contracts should be fulfilled and payments made on time, so that  the small companies can cover their costs. Second, we demand  that the contract prices should be indexed; they have not been  indexed in line with inflation since 1992 so, owing to rising  inflation, it is impossible to meet the costs of the land  reform. The firms involved in land division do not oppose  value-added tax, because they know that this is the best way to  provide revenue for the budget, but they want the Agriculture  Ministry to pay the money that is due to the taxation  authorities, as the law provides.    [Correspondent] After Agriculture Minister Georgi Tanev  refused to receive the protesters, they set off to the Council  of Ministers and National Assembly, where they handed over their  declarations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Jerusalem"] </F>   [Text] President Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem are  particularly noteworthy, although they would have sounded better  had they not been said in the context of the UN Security Council  resolution that is expected to mention East Jerusalem as  occupied territory. We have to wait and see if and how the  President's commitment to a united Jerusalem as the capital of  Israel is translated into the vote of his UN delegation.    And, lest we forget the forum in which the remarks were  made:  The leaders of the Jewish community in the United States -- the  same people whose lobbying and donations we so much like to  dismiss -- are the ones who heard from the President his renewed  commitment to the issue of Jerusalem.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina held a  session in Sarajevo today. The session focused on the grave  humanitarian situation. Mladen Bosnjak reports:    [Bosnjak] The first and key topic of the discussion at the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Government session today [words indistinct]  the availability of food for the population of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the government's extraordinary  session, when it was concluded that the humanitarian situation  was so bad that it was threatening with catastrophic  consequences, the delivery of food had somewhat improved, but  then it quickly fell to its previous level. In some regions,  such as in the Bihac region currently, the availability of food  has become critical. The main characteristics of the current  situation concerning the delivery of food were presented by Arif  Smajkic, minister for refugees, labor, and social protection.    [Begin Smajkic recording] Refugees, displaced persons, and  other socially deprived categories of the population today  receive food amounting to 158 grams on average. This is about  21 percent of their needs.    The picture is somewhat different in different regions. The  availability of food has drastically deteriorated in the Bihac  region, where meeting food demands fell from 41 to 18 percent.  In Gorazde, it fell from 31 percent to 13.6 percent. A  significant deterioration was registered in the Zenica region,  where it fell from 28 percent to 13.8 percent. A negligible  improvement in the situation was registered in Travnik. The  rise there was from 8 to 13.2 percent. In Tuzla, it rose from 7  to 11.6 percent. A somewhat more significant improvement was  registered in Sarajevo, where meeting food supplies rose from 25  to 38 percent per resident. [end recording]    [Bosnjak] Here is an excerpt from a report on the situation  in different regions.    Mostar region: No UNHCR relief convoy has arrived in  Jablanica in the last seven days. The amount of food that  arrived in Mostar is insufficient in terms of quality and  variety.    Zenica region: The situation remains critical. The greatest  problems with the delivery of food were experienced in  Zavidovici and Zepce owing to extremely poor roads. This  renders the situation in these towns very bad.    Travnik region: The situation in this region is extremely  difficult, particularly in Gornji Vakuf and the villages around  Gornji Vakuf.    Tuzla region: The wider area around Tuzla is approaching the  point where the delivery of food could be described as dramatic,  because the majority of convoys come to this region from  Belgrade and through the aggressor's territory. More and more  convoys are being canceled. Meeting food demands in this region  is the worst in the republic. [passage omitted]    The unfavorable situation in Bihac over the last 15 days has  culminated in the total suspension of convoys for this town.  Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic also stressed the following:    [Begin Ljubijankic recording] In the last seven days  hospitals have been fiercely shelled. Fourteen patients were  killed as a result of this shelling. This is all being somehow  overshadowed by events here in Sarajevo. Chetniks are  exploiting the attention the world public is giving to Sarajevo  and carrying out their activities there in the dark. I think  that the psychological effect of air drops would be compelling  there, perhaps more so than the actual physical effect. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

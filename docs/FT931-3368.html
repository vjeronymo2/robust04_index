			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): Lessons for Mr Lamont FOR GOOD AND EVIL: THE IMPACT OFTAXES ON THE COURSE OF CIVILISATION by Charles W. Adams Madison Books, Dollars 29.95, 517 pages IT IS too late now, given that today is UK Budget Day, but perhaps Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, could have usefully spent his days of pre-budget purdah in reading - and learning from - this fascinating work of real scholarship on taxation and the impact of taxes on the course of civilisation. Lamont could then post his copy to President Bill Clinton, whose campaign commitment to ease taxes on America's middle classes has become one of the first victims of his presidency. In turn, Clinton might do a favour for his predecessor, George Bush - but then it is too late to unscramble his 'Read my lips, no new taxes' promise which may have cost him the election. Perhaps there should even be a copy for Margaret Thatcher, who failed to learn from English history (including a similar fiscal debacle by King Henry VIII) and had another go at introducing a poll tax, only to have it withdrawn by her successor, John Major, albeit without the earlier parliamentary assertion that such a tax was 'unsuited for England'. Mrs Thatcher may have been weak on the history of taxation and its implications through the ages for empires and governments. For anyone in the same boat - just about all of us - this must be the seminal work. Just a few nuggets from history. Did you know that biblical Israel split after Solomon's death because his son refused to cut taxes? That Rome rose to greatness owing to a liberal tax regime, but declined under inefficient and corrupt ones? That in Switzerland William Tell was forced to shoot the apple off his son's head as punishment for tax resistance? That in Britain Lady Godiva made her celebrated ride naked on horseback through Coventry as a tax protest? Or that Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the American Civil war were fired, was a Customs House? Charles Adams has spent the best part of 20 years researching this exhaustive work, in part as a teacher of history, but mostly from his experiences as a tax professional - in the trenches, so to speak. This book builds on his earlier work Fight, Flight, Fraud: The Story of Taxation (1982), but For Good and Evil contains much additional material, including a new chapter on the miracle economies of Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, which introduced low-tax, supply side economics long before Ronald Reagan made it to the White House. Another new section shows how some US state constitutions seek to protect taxpayers by given them constitutional controls on taxing and spending, perhaps the most celebrated being Proposition 13 in California. Adams also includes a chapter called 'Taming the Monster'; he offers several reforms, all decidedly pro-taxpayers, to make taxes work for good, not evil. He wants taxpayers to be able to sue the tax authorities for misconduct and (in the US) to grant voters recall powers over district directors of the Internal Revenue Service. His lean is towards indirect taxes and away from a direct taxation regime, quoting in support from Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome,Spain, France, the Netherlands and England before William Pitt and the introduction of what, in effect, became income tax to finance the war against Napoleon. It was to be a temporary measure, to be suspended six months after the war ended. We know better now, and so does much of the world, since the British have been very successful at exporting the system. Adams' main conclusions should not be lost on today's governments. Good tax systems go bad unless citizens are able to restrain administrations which have a propensity to spend more than they tax; civilisations tend to self-destruct from excessive taxation; and moderation is an important principle in the design and implementation of any tax system. Such moderation includes the choice of tax rates and the penalties for evasion, the intrusiveness of tax collection, the need to treat taxpayers equally by avoiding extremes of progressive or regressive fiscal regimes. It is also important to leave the taxpayers with a sufficient margin to encourage endeavour and enterprise. Roll on today's Budget.</p>

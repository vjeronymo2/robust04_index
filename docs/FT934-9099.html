			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Protests in Lagos at 7-fold petrol price rise THOUSANDS of demonstrators took to the streets of Lagos and halted traffic on the city's main road in protest against a seven-fold rise in petrol prices, introduced on Monday by the country's military-backed interim government. The decision is likely to prove a critical test of the authority of Chief Ernest Shonekan, Nigeria's civilian head of state. Removing the petrol subsidy is an essential part of government efforts to revive a lapsed structural adjustment programme, and pave the way to an accord with the International Monetary Fund and rescheduling of external debt of over Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.3bn). But the highly unpopular move could well upset Nigeria's fragile stability and lead to an upsurge in opposition, particularly in Lagos and the south-west, stronghold of Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of last June's aborted presidential poll. The government on Monday increased the price of petrol from N0.7 (2p) a litre to N5 (15p), N4.75 for diesel and N4.5 for kerosene. Speaking in the capital Abuja yesterday, Mr Shonekan made clear his determination to press ahead with economic reforms, and stressed the need to cut government spending and reduce the budget deficit. 'Despite political and legal obstacles, we will still go along to carry out our mandate,' he said. 'The interim government may be a child of circumstance, but it is high time we came to terms with the reality of our circumstances.' However the fuel price increase looks likely to provoke a further damaging confrontation with the trade unions, which brought Lagos to a halt earlier this year in protest at the cancellation of the presidential poll and the extension of military rule until fresh elections promised for February next year. Demonstrators were also celebrating a ruling on Wednesday by the Lagos High Court that the former military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, had appointed Mr Shonekan as head of state hours after the general had himself resigned, making the appointment technically illegal.</p>

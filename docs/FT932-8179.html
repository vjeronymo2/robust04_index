			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Redundancies at Swan Hunter imminent REDUNDANCIES AT Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, are likely to be announced tomorrow, receiver Price Waterhouse has indicated. In a day of confusion about how soon some of the 2,200 employees may lose their jobs, Mr Gordon Horsfield, one of the Price Waterhouse team, said yesterday that there might be redundancies at the end of this week. He would not speculate on how many. Price Waterhouse, reacting to an angry union response, later confirmed that no one would leave the company tomorrow. However, redundancies might be announced. Union leaders will meet the receivers at Swan's Wallsend headquarters tomorrow morning to discuss job losses. The unions say jobs may go next Friday, the last date for which the Ministry of Defence has so far given consent for outfitting work to continue on three Type 23 frigates, the company's main current workload. Completing the frigates is Swans' best chance of retaining a core workforce, clinching new orders and finding a buyer to continue shipbuilding. At a meeting in Carlisle on Saturday shop stewards from all UK shipbuilders will vote on a motion from Mr Jim McFall, chairman of the shipyard negotiating committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, which urges any shipyard to which the frigates might be moved to refuse to work on them. The motion warns that any attempt to remove the frigates from Tyneside will be resisted by Swan Hunter workers. Swans went into receivership a week ago after failing to win a helicopter carrier order from the MoD. Mr Horsfield said that between 10 and 20 inquiries about buying the company had since been received 'from companies of substance', as well as some 'from people sitting at home with not a lot to do'. Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, told the Commons last night that the successful tender for the Royal Navy's new helicopter carrier was 'around' the fair and proper price estimated by the ministry of defence. He ridiculed suggestions by Labour MPs that a 'conspiracy' had resulted in the contract being awarded to the consortium of Cumbrian-based VSEL and the Kvaerner Govan merchant ship yard in Glasgow instead of to Swan Hunter. Mr Aitken said the ministry was surprised by the 'extraordinary gap' - more than Pounds 50m - between the two bids and insisted that it could not be accounted for by changes to the original specification. He promised that the full details of the two bids would be provided, on the basis of commercial confidentiality, for the inquiry to be conducted by the National Audit Office. Asked if Swan Hunter would be allowed to complete the three frigates still under construction, he said it was a matter for 'ongoing discussions' between with the receiver. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, acknowledged that the government had no alternative but to award the contract to VSEL, but said that mysteries surrounding the bidding process left several questions to be answered. A Labour motion citing the government's attitude to Swan Hunter as evidence of its 'callous and cavalier' treatment of workers in defence industries was defeated by 41 votes (304-263). Cuts in government spending on defence research and development are damaging Britain's international competitiveness in both civil and military aerospace, the Commons Trade and Industry Committee heard yesterday. Mr Alan Jones, chief executive of Somerset helicopter-maker Westland, warned that the Department of Trade and Industry's Pounds 25m programme for civil aircraft research and development was 25 per cent of what was needed to compensate for spending cuts.</p>

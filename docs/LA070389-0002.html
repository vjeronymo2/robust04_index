			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: A NEW BEGINNING FOR COUPLE -- AND FOR POLAND'S JEWS  </P> <P>  -- Happy memories of the day mingled with painful recollections of the past as  Warsaw saw its first wedding in a synagogue since the Holocaust. Families and a  few members of the city's once-thriving Jewish community watched as American  Jew Robert Blum and his Polish-born bride, Joanna Kan, exchanged vows. The good  wishes came multilingually: "Congratulations," "Mazel tov" and "Wszystkiego  najlepszego na nowej drodze zycia" -- the last Polish for "All the best on the  new road of life." Blum, who met his wife at work in New York, said he hopes  the wedding will help rejuvenate Poland's Jewish community. Fewer than 300,000  of the nation's Jews survived World War II, and emigration cut their number to  fewer than 10,000, most of them elderly. Warsaw, which itself once held 380,000  Jews and 400 synagogues, now has only one synagogue, rebuilt in 1983. The  rabbi, Menachen Joskowitz, a Polish concentration camp survivor, arrived from  Israel about six weeks ago for a two-year stay.  </P> <P>  -- Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and several thousand others gathered to  make a mountain out of a milestone, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the  addition of President Theodore Roosevelt's face to Mt. Rushmore. A  45-by-90-foot flag was unveiled over Roosevelt's likeness as Mary Ellis Vhay,  daughter of Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum, greeted the crowd. Mt. Rushmore,  in South Dakota's Black Hills, also includes the faces of Presidents George  Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. The anniversary was also used  to launch a $40-million fund-raising effort to expand and improve the monument,  and the state of South Dakota contributed $150,000. But one of the original  workers on the sculpture, Howard Peterson, said Borglum "didn't want any of  this stuff, the concession stands and all."  </P> <P>  -- In an emotional farewell speech to the National Education Assn. she leads,  Mary Hatwood Futrell called on teachers to "embrace change" and to remember her  as having "chalk dust on the sleeves of her soul." The six-year president of  the 2-million-member union was interrupted more than 60 times by cheers,  applause and standing ovations. About 8,400 delegates to the NEA Representative  Assembly in Washington are to vote on Futrell's successor today. DAVE JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Erwin Hofer report from Bolzano: "Swing to the Right in </F> Italy: South Tirol People's Party Fears for Autonomy"]    [Text] Bolzano/Vienna -- Before the end of April, a  delegation of the South Tirol People's Party (SVP) will travel  to Vienna and tell the Austrian leadership about South Tirol's  concerns about the political swing to the right in Italy. This  "definition of one's political position" toward the protecting  power, Austria, was resolved by the SVP Committee during an  extraordinary session on domestic policy development. The  meeting with Foreign Minister Alois Mock (Austrian People's  Party) is to take place within the next few days, SVP Chairman  Siegfried Brugger announced after the session.    Thus, the SVP has once again made it clear that it does not  make light of the political swing to the right after the  elections and the likely participation of neofascist ministers  in the new Italian Government and that it is seriously concerned  about the future of South Tirol's autonomy. The SVP committee  unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the future  government to "observe all national and international  obligations undertaken by Italy toward South Tirol." If this is  not the case, it will not only turn to the protecting power,  Austria, but also to all the relevant European bodies. "In this  respect, we are placing great hopes in democratic Europe,"  Brugger said.    In view of South Tirol's historical experiences with Italian  fascism, "the development in Italy are being noted with great  concern," the party committee stresses. There is above all  alarm at the "reawakening of fascism."    And not without reason: With a view to the government  formation, neofascists in Bolzano have called for changes of the  autonomy statute and said that fascist dictator Benito Mussolini  was the "greatest statesman of the century." The alleged  democratic transformation of the neofascists, which is  manifested by the change of their name to National Alliance, is  not believed in South Tirol. In the SVP's opinion, it is  nothing but "a feint" -- a wolf in sheep's clothing. Therefore,  only "a clear opposition and an unshakable no" to a government  with neofascist ministers can come from the SVP, Chairman  Brugger announced.    While the SVP is still displaying a wait-and-see attitude  toward Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia Movement -- it is still  too "vague and undefined" -- it does not want to deny that there  are "positive aspects" in the Northern League regarding the  discussion on federalism initiated by it. In Bolzano the  attitude toward this discussion is positive, provided that South  Tirol's special autonomy is not touched, but it is further  developed in accordance with real federalism. However, the SVP  rejects the idea of a greater region that would correspond to  the old "Tre Venezie" plan, which was rejected long ago.</p>

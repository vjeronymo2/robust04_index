			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latin America accomplished a `paper victory'  yesterday before the EU in winning a lawsuit against banana  restrictions, which have been described in Colombia as  diabolical and uncompromising.    The Colombian Government believes this victory has no  practical effects, given the GATT members must unanimously  approve the ruling. In this respect, no one expects the 12 EU  member countries or their former colonies in Asia, Africa and  the Pacific to vote in favor of a resolution that goes against  their own interests.    Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos has lamented the  fact a consensus favoring a withdrawal from the GATT lawsuit had  not been accomplished. This requirement had been established by  the EC as a precondition to improving access for banana imports.  The foreign trade minister has insisted Colombia was always  willing to withdraw the lawsuit and that four of the five  complainant countries had also agreed.    At 1055 (local time), five minutes before the results were  made public and the deadline to withdraw the lawsuit had  expired, Costa Rica and Nicaragua changed their minds, however,  and had decided to continue with the action. In this respect,  they both decided to join Guatemala, which from the beginning  refused to withdraw the lawsuit.    In other words, Colombia and Venezuela were left on their  own.    According to Santos, Costa Rica justified its shift in  position by saying the EC had not given any assurances that it  would maintain its proposal in light of Guatemala's refusal to  withdraw the legal action.    This division among the growers could result in the EC  withdrawing its proposal to improve conditions of the current  banana regulations.    In other words, Latin America's banana quota would continue  to remain at 2 million tons, and U.S. as well as European market  companies would retain marketing control.    There is still the possibility, however, of increasing the  2.1 million tons and the EC maintaining its offer until 15  February, according to information disclosed by a European  official.    The proposal consists of increasing the banana quota to 2.1  million tons and leaving 70 percent of the quota in the hands of  the governments; in other words, managing the market would once  again be in the hands of banana growers.    Santos has said the Latin American countries had to confront  all sorts of pressures, saying the multinationals have aided in  boycotting an agreement among growers. "I am aghast at the  pressures applied by the marketing companies over certain  countries," he said.    Moreover, Santos has disclosed the U.S. trade office had  summoned the Colombian ambassador in Washington to express its  concern, because steps taken by Colombia were harming the  interests of several U.S. marketing companies.    Considering accusations of the cowardice thrown against  Colombia by certain countries, Santos has said there is no  cowardice in fighting to defend the 500,000 jobs the banana  industry provides, or in challenging the multinationals.    The minister has reiterated that Colombia maintains its  willingness to dialogue with the EU and the Latin American  countries involved in the issue to search for a solution  satisfactory to all parties involved.</p>

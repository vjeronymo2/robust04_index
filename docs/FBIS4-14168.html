			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Commenting on the  Egyptian-U.S. talks, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said the talks  dealt with several issues, including all tracks of the Middle  East peace process, regional problems--such as Somalia and  Bosnia, and bilateral relations.    In his statement following his meeting today with Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Musa said the final measures to  implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement will be signed the first  week of May.    Regarding the situation in Bosnia, he stated that Egypt  supports NATO's recent measures to strike the Serbs if they  continue their aggression or if they violate the decision to  withdraw their forces 20 km from Gorazde.    Musa added that the formation of the United Nations  committee  on Bosnia-Herzegovina marks a step forward, because questions  had arisen concerning some of the proposals made by some of the  mediators.    He said President Mubarak has sent Ambassador Badr Hammam,  assistant foreign minister for Arab and Middle East affairs, to  Yemen to contact the Yemeni president and vice president.  Hammam is carrying a message from President Mubarak following  yesterday's contact made by the president with the Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid.</p>

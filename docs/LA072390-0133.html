			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BARR HUBBY TATTLED TO ENQUIRER  </P> <P> Where does the National Enquirer get all those wild stories about Roseanne  Barr? Some of them came from an unlikely paid informant -- Barr's husband, Tom  Arnold, according to one of the tabloid's reporters.  </P> <P> In an interview on "Geraldo" that will air Wednesday, reporter Brian Williams  said, "Tom was eager to, shall we say, earn a little extra money in his own  right so he helped us on a number of stories.  </P> <P> In particular, before they were getting married, he, in a macho way, wanted to  pay for his own honeymoon. Of course, Roseanne makes millions and millions of  dollars and Tom was barely surviving as a stand-up comedian. So he sold us a  series of stories in the hope of being able to pay for their honeymoon."  </P> <P> Enquirer General Editor Steve Coz described Barr as a tabloid journalist's  dream. "She's crazy and everyone around her is crazy and they love to talk to  tabloids," he said. "So you just get story after story about her."  </P></p>

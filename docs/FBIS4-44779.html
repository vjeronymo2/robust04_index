			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sylvestre Huet report: "A New State of Matter"] </F>   [Text] "Here is the machine," says Alain Perez, indicating  with a rapid gesture a fat cylinder of polished steel. Dotted  with metal studded inspection portholes, draped with power  cables, lit by a flashing green laser beam, and surrounded by  display monitors, it looks just like any another laboratory. In  the basement of the Claude Bernard University in Lyons, accessed  by a narrow corridor, there is nothing to indicate to the  visitor that what he has before him is a machine unique in  Europe. Nonetheless, it plays a key role in the study of  material in grains so small that you can almost count the exact  number of atoms -- what the experts call aggregate structures.  This intermediate state of matter, known scientifically as  mesoscopic, comes between the atom (or the molecule) and the  larger compact solid. Rich in new properties that probably lie  at the heart of macroscopic phenomena -- crystal growth,  conduction, magnetism -- until recently aggregates had been an  enigma for physicists. Hard to produce -- in small ovens --  they had been ephemeral, giving just enough time for a small  peek and a rapid analysis. Times have changed: physicists have  now managed to tame them.    Here they are produced by a combination of the two extremes  of very hot and very cold: burning laser shots and cooling jets  of helium. The heat of the laser is powerful enough to vaporize  even the most heat-resistant of substances, such as carbon which  requires a temperature of 4,000 C. Helium -- or argon --  injected at the same frequency as the laser pulses, expands and  leads to a sudden and violent refrigeration to around 0K  (-278 C). The aggregates are thus not given enough time to  recombine with their neighbors.    They are analyzed by their "flight" in the machine. This is  common practice, and is also used at Lyons to sort them by mass.  Then, after they have been sorted, the less common practice is  performed of spreading them out in layers on thin plates. Only  a few laboratories can do this, notably the AT&amp;T  laboratories in  Murray Hill in the United States, and the federal polytechnique  school in Lausanne, Switzerland.    Physicists rarely lack the adjectives to qualify matter:  "condensed," "soft," and now we have "divided," to use the word  employed by experts in aggregates and adopted by Michel Broyer.  Professor, laboratory director, and master in the art of  analyzing aggregates by the duration of their flight through the  vacuum, he sums up in one sentence the aim being pursued: "to  clarify the behavior of matter when it is prevented from forming  a compact solid." In short, a little pile of atoms -- from  three or four to a thousand -- of iron, nickel, silicon, cobalt,  or carbon. Things can also be complicated slightly by using  piles of assemblies of two types of atom. At a time when nuclei  are smashed into a thousand pieces to determine their  constituents, there is still much we do not know about the  properties that these aggregates could reveal. How are they  formed? What shapes do they take? What happens to their  electrons? In thin layers, are they hard or soft, conductive or  insulating? Will they prove useful for chemists, interesting  for electronic engineers, or revolutionary in optical  electronics? Used as projectiles, could these microscopic  shells destroy a target substance?    There are so many questions that the theorists remain rather  guarded. Verbose on the subject of nuclei, specific on single  atoms, they have little to say when it comes to this divided  matter. This is an ideal situation for the three promoters of  the Lyons pole and their experimental approach that has turned  up so many surprises. Michel Broyer stresses: "We explore."  The theorists can calculate the shape of an aggregate of up to  10 silicon atoms, but more than that, and they can only draw on  approximate notions or theories for as long as there are not  enough atoms to speak of a compact solid. Alain Perez is  director of research at the National Scientific Research Center  [CNRS], charged with designing and developing the source of  aggregates in association with the Lyons group. He says: "Few  predictions are possible in this domain." With his group and the  group headed by A. Hoareau, the materials expert started the  adventure with a gamble: No one could say for sure whether the  aggregates would keep their specific structures and properties  when they were deposited in layers on a substrate. Would they  not, rather, "lose the memory" of their violent and imbalanced  formation and reform as a conventional substance?    The last of the three men, Albert Renouprez, leads a team in  a chemistry lab close to the Claude Bernard University,  specializing in catalysis. Chemists and aggregates go back a  long way. The reactors in the oil industry have been using  aggregates for a long time to crack long hydrocarbon molecules.  They are commonly used in perfume manufacture and pharmacy. A  recent CNRS report estimated that at least 20 percent of the GDP  of the United States is generated from activities relating to  substances obtained by catalysis. However, their production by  chemical means -- as a platinum salt deposit on a plate and then  stripping the salt off -- is certainly efficient, but it remains  essentially an empirical process. It is difficult, in these  conditions, to identify the chemical processes at work, and  especially difficult to invent recipes based on new elements or  mixed aggregates. Albert Renouprez admits: "We know absolutely  nothing about the chemical properties of this type of  aggregate." He has just obtained, using the vaporization  source, the first samples of mixed platinum and palladium  aggregates on silicon and graphite substrates. He sees the  adventure leading to the possibility of working on "model"  aggregates that could, perhaps, be applied to the catalytic  exhausts of the future.    Michel Broyer leads the way in this exemplary project of  cooperation. It is his team at the ionic and molecular  spectrometry laboratory (CNRS/Claude Bernard University) that is  charged with identifying the aggregates formed in the vacuum  chamber. The efficiency of the equipment in Lyons has sped up  the research. When subjected to analysis, the aggregates reveal  their secrets.    In addition to their shapes and construction, physicists are  interested in the properties of these aggregates. How many  atoms does a metal need to conduct electricity? There is no  theoretical answer to this question.    Catherine Brechignac of the Aimo-Cotton laboratory in Orsay  (CNRS coordinator of French teams working on aggregates) and  Michel Broyer conducted experiments with mercury aggregates in  the Orsay Lure laboratory for the use of electromagnetic  radiation to study the transition from insulator to conductor in  relation to the number of atoms. They saw that as long as there  are less than 12 atoms, excitation remains limited to just one.  The "current" -- a shared behavior affecting an electron  population -- does not flow. From 12 atoms, the interaction  between them intensifies and their electronic fields  interconnect. Over 80 atoms, and electrons are knocked out of  place. However, we need at least 1,000 atoms before we can  really speak of electrical conduction. Even on this scale, the  electrical and chemical properties of the aggregates are not  always the same as those of the solid substance. Going one  stage further, Michel Broyer is now examining "mixed"  aggregates, cautiously combining the simplest of metals,  lithium, with the simplest of atoms, hydrogen. The aggregates  obtained consist of eight to 15 lithium atoms and one or two  hydrogen atoms. He has discovered that the latter tend to form  on the aggregate's surface.    While Michel Broyer's team is refining its methods for  precisely determining the aggregates produced, Alain Perez's  team has been preparing the plates. After a relatively  stringent sorting process, these plates capture aggregates at  the end of their trajectory forming, in one hour, plates of up  to a thousand angstroms thick over an area of one square  centimeter. He exclaimed: "What we had hoped for has happened!  The aggregates retain the memory of how they were formed and  land unaltered on the substrate. This is a world first that  opens up a whole new avenue of research." The initial guinea  pigs were widely reported in the media, including the famous  fullerenes (assemblies of carbon atoms, some of which -- between  20 and 60 atoms -- grouped together in little balls or even  footballs). "In fact we have managed to isolate a whole series  of families -- from the spherical and never-before seen C20, to  the C900 -- which we chose because of their specific  characteristics."    Alain Perez talks enthusiastically of "an ideal technique  for  producing thin, nanostructured layers." The prefix nano is  currently the vogue in laboratories, a sure sign of physicists'  ambition to be able to manipulate matter one atom or one  molecule at a time. The layers of carbon aggregates are  organized in piles of spherical particles some 15 to 25  nanometers in diameter, as seen in atomic microscopes. Alain  Perez manufactures strange "nano-sponges" on the surface of his  plates. They combine the perfect order of aggregates at a short  distance with the disorder of the layer where the aggregates are  deposited at random. This crystalline/amorphous mixture can  result in new and interesting electrical, magnetic, and optical  properties. Alain Perez actually speaks of "new substance." The  C20 nano-sponges, insulating and transparent, are almost as hard  as diamond but have less than half the density, making them  similar in mass to polymers. With aggregates of iron 20, iron  150, and nickel 200, the magnetic effects of the nanostructured  layers differ considerably from solid substances. Alain Perez  talks of a ferromagnetic state midway between amorphous and  crystalline substances. It is possible that his small packets  of aggregates, whose magnetism can be controlled, are the  precursors to future, hyperdense magnetic computer memory.    Other teams have shown that nanoporous layers of silicon are  luminescent in the visible spectrum, although nobody really  knows why. Will optronics engineers be able to use this  phenomenon? Alain Perez insists: "Not all these properties  could be deduced from the properties of aggregates. However,  the initial experiments on carbon will serve as a reference for  our future research on silicon." He is looking to build silicon  aggregates with less than 30 atoms. Some theorists predict that  they will be compact, with layers more dense than are found in  solid blocks of the substance, thus producing a new metal  phase... To summarize expert opinion, the last CNRS economic  report speaks of the "major stakes" that are represented by thin  layers of aggregates.    Four hundred km from Lyons, another French team has declared  war with aggregates. Figuratively (since it has just embarked  two major scientists) and literally, as it aims to accelerate  aggregates and use them as a shell to bombard matter with. A  change of scenery, with big machines and warlike vocabulary. On  the Orsay campus, the physicists working on the Tandem  electrostatic accelerator -- a blue-colored machine some 30  meters long, built at the start of the 1970s -- have seized on  these new projectiles. Accustomed to working with atomic ions,  their job is to observe the reaction of a bombarded substance  through the behavior of individual atoms. Using energy of  around 100 million electron volts, they force the bombarded  substance to emit ions, or even molecules in the case of organic  matter, which can then be analyzed for identification.    Standing by the blue Tandem machine, supervisor Serge Della  Negra is almost apologetic: "Of course, we cannot see anything,  but Orion is in there." Orion lives up to its name. In its  designer's view, it is a real "spatial manipulation." The  original and risky idea consisted of introducing an aggregate  source into the accelerator and leaving it there for several  months. It has to resist a hostile environment of  electromagnetic storms and an insulating gas at a pressure of 9  bars, while obeying the commands relayed by optical fiber.  Everything is done without the possibility of entering Tandem  to carry out repairs. Serge Della Negra admits that "the risk  was that no one could be sure that the aggregates would resist  the acceleration and not split up." However, it was worth it.  "At the end of the trajectory we bombard a point of material  with a huge amount of energy generated by the weight of the new  projectile." By switching from the ionic atom to the aggregate,  in effect the physicists swapped a ball for an explosive shell.    The first weapons used were C60 molecules, supplied in  powder  form by the CNRS's "Mr. Fullerenes," Patrick Bernier. In 1992,  Serge Della Negra's team surprised everyone using a beam of C60.  Introduced into the Tandem at 200,000 electron volts, this was  then accelerated. It passed through a box of nitrogen like a  kamikaze and ionized to come out the other side at 40 million  electron volts! Serge Della Negra says: "It is true that we  lose 999 out of 1,000 C60's in the process, but it is a world  first, and no theorist could have calculated the interaction  between C60 and nitrogen."    If he sounds jubilant it is because the bombardment obtained  opens up a whole new perspective. The largest known deposition  of energy per unit of time and space was performed in the GANIL  heavy ion accelerator in Caen, using uranium beams. With a beam  of one billion electron volts, it delivers 3,000 electron volts  per angstrom, but over hundreds of microns since atomic ions  penetrate substances easily. On the other hand, C60 aggregates  cannot slip between atoms and instead cause real explosions on  the surface of the material. With this experiment, the Orsay  physicists have nipped in the bud the theory that it is  impossible to accelerate C60 aggregates in a machine such as the  Tandem. However, the low yield obtained meant that the problem  had to be reworked. They then attempted to use gold aggregates,  so producing the first ever precious metal explosive shells.    On 19 November 1993, the Tandem team in Orsay was therefore  able to post another world first: the acceleration of  aggregates of three or four gold atoms. Aggregate beams with an  energy of 10 million electron volts bombarded silicon sheets,  creating shock waves that changed the crystalline structure of  the silicon.    What can be done with this new technology? Apart from its  interest from the point of view of basic research, Serge Della  Negra is convinced that there are other openings:  "Microelectronics, surface analysis and treatment,  nanostructures, multipoint bonding, biochemical detectors, etc.  A number of possibilities can be envisaged, as long as we are  not restricted to the specific conditions of the physics  experiment," and, a CNRS report stresses diplomatically, as long  as French industrial groups do not continue with their "wait and  see" policy.    In the longer term, Serge Della Negra is also thinking about  thermonuclear fusion. For some time, scientists have been  searching for a way to prevent the deuterium and tritium nuclei  from fusing by compressing them (by "inertial confinement")  using converging laser beams. In a kind of heavy arms race, we  are moving from photons to protons, and then to atomic ions, and  finally to aggregates. The heavier the projectile, the more  violent the impact. "We are still a long way off. However, we  are getting ready for the time when we will be able to  accelerate to 10 million electron volts molecules of 100,000  atoms ionized a hundred times, which would generate a billion  electron volts in 1,000 angstroms, the scale required to achieve  fusion."    With the successes achieved at Lyons and Orsay, a number of  teams are starting to perform this type of experiment.  Researchers have been able to successfully apply the concepts  of nuclear physics to aggregates. However, Serge Della Negra  laments: "Divided matter does not have its De Gennes, like soft  matter." Not yet.  <H5>  The Geometry of Aggregates </H5>   Cuboid octahedrons, tetrahedrons, octahedrons, icosahedrons,  etc. Freed from energy constraints and thus from the constraints  of the crystalline networks of solid matter, aggregates have  taken new shapes. The physicist invents assemblies of atoms in  shapes encountered nowhere else in nature except in interstellar  space. Michel Broyer has discovered that it is possible to alter  the shapes produced by altering the pressure of the helium and  the nozzles that supply it, generating effects that differ  according to the melting point of the elements. Aggregates of  more than 100 aluminum atoms prefer octohedrons. Gallium  aggregates collect in the shape of a drop of liquid, with  electronic layer effects such as would exist around an enormous  atom. The Lyons researchers also hold a record: gallium  aggregates with an outside layer of 7,200 electrons. Indium  aggregates of less than 200 atoms take up this droplet shape,  while they resemble aluminum when there are more atoms. Nickel,  iron, or cobalt aggregates have more rigid shapes. Nickel and  cobalt, in aggregates of 100 to 900 atoms, adopt an icosahedron  shape. The aggregates of iron take a number of different shapes.  <H5>  Breeding Aggregates </H5>   First take a thin bar, a few centimeters long by a few  millimeters across. It may be made of ultra-pure iron, cobalt,  carbon, silicon... in fact the whole of the periodic table is  available. Placed in a vacuum chamber, this little bar is then  spun round in the heat of a Yag laser pulsed at a frequency of  30 Hz. The power of the laser vaporizes some of the material.  At the same time, synchronized with the laser pulses, a jet of  helium is pulsed into the vacuum chamber. When it expands, the  helium immediately cools the vapor which then "freezes" the  aggregates formed, even if they are far from being in a state of  energy balance. Carried along at supersonic speed, the ionized  aggregates are sent to a "flight time" line, where they are  identified by mass spectrometry. This is the field of research  of Michel Broyer and his team. When production is known and  calibrated, the deposition stage commences. After passing  through a chamber sorting the number of atoms -- applying  Cornelian selection: the more severe the sorting the fewer  aggregates remain for deposition -- the aggregates enter a  deposition chamber. The first type of chamber is used by Alain  Perez's team in the materials physics department  (CNRS-university), since their plates often have to withstand  exposure to air. The second type of chamber, which includes a  small vacuum "suitcase" protecting the deposit from chemical  reactions, is used by Albert Renouprez at the Catalysis  Institute.    The only source of aggregates in Europe, this system is  characterized by a high flow and the ability to deposit on a  substrate aggregates that have been sorted by mass. It was  financed by the CNRS, the Claude-Bernard University (Lyons), the  French research ministry, and the Rhone-Alpes region for 10  million French francs (1989-1993). The second source, currently  being installed, will benefit from an acceleration cavity making  it possible to bombard a target with heavy aggregates with an  energy of 1,000,000 electron volts.</p>

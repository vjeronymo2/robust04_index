			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Indonesian equities make a return to favour Stockbrokers in Jakarta are worried about their security. Earlier this month, riot police were called to protect the offices of Wardley James Capel from an angry mob. Although violent, brokers can take comfort that the incident arose from the fact that Indonesian investors again want to own shares, and will sometimes resort to extreme means to get them. The market crash in 1990/91, which sent the composite index from a high of 682 points to 225, gave many Indonesians a jaundiced view of equities. Since the start of this year, however, the index has risen by 70 per cent and, among the IFC's emerging markets, Indonesia rates as the third best performer in the year to date in dollar terms. Warily at first, and now with excessive enthusiasm, local investors are returning. Their interest has been heightened by a spate of flotations which have gone to an instant premium to their listing price. On October 1, shares in Barito Pacific Timber, the largest single issue this year and raising Dollars 290m, rose 60 per cent on the first day of trading. A few days later, more than 4,000 people turned up at the offices of Wardley James Capel to apply for shares in Kedaung Indah Can, an enamel ware manufacturer. Brokers expect it to open at a 50 per cent premium to its flotation price. Given the adage that when the public buy, a market correction is imminent, brokers are now asking how long the good times will last. The market looks fully valued at 23 times forecast 1993 earnings and 17 times 1994 earnings. An unwritten rule that companies coming to the market should float at about 14 times earnings has allowed investors to make quick gains on new issues. There are signs, however, that the rule is about to be broken. Ciputra Development, a leading property company, is to list next month, raising Dollars 120m. Brokers report strong local interest, but note that its anticipated listing price would value the company at 19 times next year's earnings. If other companies follow Ciputra's example and decide against listing at a discount, the upside potential for equity investors will be limited. Lower interest rates may improve corporate earnings, but brokers are already assuming 20 per cent earnings growth next year. Speculation that the government will lift the shareholding limit of 49 per cent that foreigners may own in listed companies has also died away. The raising of the limit would dramatically improve liquidity for foreign investors and almost certainly drive the index higher. The flow of foreign funds into the market, particularly from the US, should help to sustain share prices, but Indonesia is only one of several emerging markets in the region. With Jakarta equities looking increasingly expensive, interest has turned to Thailand and Hong Kong. Nevertheless, brokers say the days are gone when the market, with a capitalisation of over Dollars 30bn, could be ignored by fund managers. Unless there is an upset, such as the failure of a large issue or a major corporate scandal, the market is unlikely to return to its 1992 trough. Trading volume has doubled to above Dollars 30m a day this year and, with a raft of new companies expected to float next year, volumes should continue to rise. Some investors still eye Indonesia suspiciously, recalling the scandals that rocked the market three years ago, but many believe this year's recovery will be sustainable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Dollar terms                       No. of                       stocks        Oct 22    % Change     % Change Market                                1993   over week   on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina              (11)         854.87       +5.0        +47.4 Brazil                 (44)         204.56      -16.3        +63.6 Chile                  (20)         469.86       +1.4        +12.3 Colombia1               (8)         526.38       +0.8        +23.8 Mexico                 (58)         783.35       +4.3        +15.9 Peru2                   (7)         113.62       -3.1        +13.6 Venezuela3              (8)         664.71       +6.3        +27.9 East Asia South Korea4          (130)          99.03       -0.4         +0.9 Philippines            (11)         227.17       +7.2        +70.1 Taiwan, China5         (76)          83.75       +0.3        +13.5 South Asia India6                 (61)          92.13       -0.1         -1.7 Indonesia7             (31)          98.25       +2.5        +67.4 Malaysia               (61)         268.59       +1.5        +64.2 Pakistan8               (8)         256.65       +8.6        +28.2 Sri Lanka9              (5)         134.56       +1.0        +34.6 Thailand               (52)         325.74       -1.8        +41.4 Euro/Mid East Greece                 (17)         226.68       -4.6        +16.1 Jordan                  (5)         171.62       -1.3        +46.9 Portugal               (16)         110.46       -0.5        +43.2 Turkey10               (31)         170.26       -6.6       +154.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Local currency terms                       No. of                       stocks        Oct 22    % Change     % Change Market                                1993   over week   on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina              (11)     524,570.34       +5.0        +47.7 Brazil                 (44)  44,918,644.65       -9.7     +2,053.9 Chile                  (20)         778.03       +1.6        +21.3 Colombia1               (8)         761.13       +1.4        +24.5 Mexico                 (58)       1,050.47       +4.2        +15.7 Peru2                   (7)         150.11       -1.5        +50.1 Venezuela3              (8)       1,500.57       +6.9        +60.7 East Asia South Korea4          (130)         105.33       -0.5         +3.5 Philippines            (11)         314.42       +5.7        +94.5 Taiwan, China5         (76)          83.73       +0.4        +20.1 South Asia India6                 (61)         101.88       -0.1         +6.7 Indonesia7             (31)         112.17       +2.4        +70.5 Malaysia               (61)         252.51       +1.7        +60.0 Pakistan8               (8)         348.49       +8.6        +50.3 Sri Lanka9              (5)         143.98       +1.2        +44.0 Thailand               (52)         326.45       -1.5        +40.0 Euro/Mid East Greece                 (17)         375.43       -1.2        +31.8 Jordan                  (5)         245.02       -0.7        +47.8 Portugal               (16)         131.29       +2.7        +68.4 Turkey10               (31)       1,024.20       -3.3       +281.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

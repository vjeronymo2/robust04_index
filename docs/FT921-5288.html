			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / IG Metall warned of heavy job losses THE START of pay talks for Germany's 4m engineering workers was marked yesterday by warnings of heavy job losses and a flurry of grim news from manufacturing companies. Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of the Gesamtmetall employers' association, said every percentage point above the inflation rate in this year's award would cost 200,000 jobs. At the first round of talks, held in Hamburg on behalf of 120,000 workers in northern Germany, the local IG Metall union branch claimed a 9 per cent increase. Most of the other nine regional branches, due to start negotiating in the coming weeks, have asked for 9.5 per cent. Inflation this year is expected to average 4.5 per cent at most. Mr Franz Fillbach, Gesamt-metall's negotiator in Hamburg, made no offer during the opening session and the talks were adjourned to March 24. But he said the engineering industry was on a downward slope. Domestic demand had fallen sharply and export orders were stagnating. Reports from leading companies confirmed that the downturn is now biting in all metal-working sectors. Gildemeister, one of western Germany's largest machine tool makers, said yesterday it would pay no dividend for 1991 and none should be expected this year. Group turnover fell 12 per cent last year and overseas sales dropped 23 per cent. Georg Muller, a Nuremberg bearings manufacturer, reported that it started the year with 46 per cent fewer orders than 12 months earlier. Ymos, a Bavarian company specialising in car components, said it had missed its 1991 financial targets by a wide margin because orders had not been renewed and motor manufacturers had delayed launching new models. In Dusseldorf the German Steel Federation added to the gloom with a report that orders for steel fell 9 per cent in the final quarter of 1991. In another pay case, the OTV union, negotiating for 2.3m western German public service workers, said it wanted employers to put forward a negotiable offer when the third round of talks starts today. The OTV is seeking a basic 9.5 per cent increase. White collar unions yesterday stepped up their rolling programme of strike action in pursuit of a 10.5 per cent pay claim for bank workers, and called out 15,000 staff in banks all over western Germany. Business was not seriously disrupted. Some banks reported operating comfortably even though half the workforce stayed away. The unions, meanwhile, threatened to increase the pressure steadily until a 'reasonable offer' was made.</p>

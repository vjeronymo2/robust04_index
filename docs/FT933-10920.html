			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: A Stone's view of success - Radio THE 50th birthday of Rolling Stone Mick Jagger might seem trivial to frivolous people but he is, rightly or wrongly, among the most famous of living men. Unexpectedly, the BBC celebrated the date on Radio 2, where song comes usually from different sources. It was a good feature they gave us, produced by Peter Aston, part biography, part sociology, not too much music. Clearly, Jagger's success has come from his own effort, not from outside coaching (unless you include his manager, Andrew Loog Oldham). His family he rates as bourgeois; he was bright enough at school to pass into the London School of Economics ('really boring'). He had no moral convictions as a young man: 'I've got my own morals.' In 1967, he got three months for a drug offence, a sentence that William Rees-Mogg, then editing The Times, condemned. He sang because that was what people were doing; his style is due to his love of 'the theatre of it.' With success, he is socially ambitious, with aims like MCC membership. His accent has gone up or down, probably with no personal design. Mary Whitehouse says she 'got on well with him.' Philip Stone, compiler of the programme, says he speaks good French, is cautious with money, friendly with children, weeps easily under stress. 'A knighthood, OK? Don't want a life peerage.' I wish him another 50 years but won't be buying his records. The World Service is doing a four-part series on The Slavs - sadly, not about the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia but about the historic and cultural elements of the Slav people. There are more of these than we generally think; they stretch from the Baltic to the Pacific, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. Last week's programme was history; presenter Wanda Petrusewicz went back to the 6th century when the Slavs were peaceful farmers, comprising one-third of the European population. In the West were Roman Catholics, in the East, Moslems, but most adhered to old polytheistic beliefs. Subsequent events increased the proportion of Christians, now generally divided between the Catholics and the Orthodox church. As we know, there are also Moslems in Bosnia - in Bulgaria, too - although religion, as such, is not involved in the Bosnian disasters. Yesterday's programme dealt with religion in more detail, with a specific cheer for the visit of the Slav Pope to Poland. Next Friday's programme is more relevant to our time, recalling the PanSlav movements of last century and Tito's aims in that direction, and considering the Slav nations' mutual relationships today after the decline in Europe of the Russian influence: proud of being Slavs, inclined toward nationalism. The programme can be heard on the World Service at 0730, repeated at 1215 and 1930. Radio 3 is giving more and more time to non-musical material, and this week has repeated some of last year's programmes about the US. On four days, we had Irish novelist Tim O'Grady's look at young Americans; alas, I could hear only one of them, a delightful half-hour about Nancy Lemann on Tuesday. She is a Southern writer living in New York, and she stimulated great conversation about 'the old verities' that include baseball. Also on Tuesday was a repeat of Piers Plowright's A Bus Named Desire, an unusual view of New Orleans of which I wrote enthusiastically when it was last broadcast, and which I enjoyed as much this time. Alexander, Radio 4's Classic Serial, is as exciting as ever. The boy Alexander (Simon Crane) makes an unauthorised trip to Olympus, tames the restive Bucephalos, then grows up enough (now played by Michael Maloney) to be appointed regent during Philip's absence, and to be advised by him to go after women and get himself a son. Splendid stuff.</p>

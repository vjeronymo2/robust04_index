			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: BZW move brings DTB and Matif closer The French and German futures and options exchanges came one step closer yesterday when a UK bank announced it was ready to trade interest rate futures across a link jointly developed by the two markets. BZW Futures, part of Barclays, will shortly begin trading a range of German futures and options from its Paris offices. Other traders are expected to follow over the next few months. France's Matif and Germany's DTB announced their collaboration 18 months ago. They hope that the link will allow them to compete more effectively with Liffe and other international exchanges. 'This is the most important single development in European financial futures markets for many years,' said Mr Graham Newall, chief executive of BZW Futures. 'It is the first trade in a new era in the way futures business will be conducted in Europe,' he added, arguing that the development would 'enhance liquidity on DTB'. The trades have been made possible by the installation of DTB terminals in Paris. In a second stage of co-operation, Matif, where trades are predominantly carried out through the traditional 'open outcry' method on the dealing floor, will allow DTB members to trade two of its products over the German exchange's screen-based trading system. Subsequently, the two exchanges plan to generate joint plans to develop trading software, clearing and settlement. The exchanges will be particularly keen to challenge Liffe's 70 per cent share of the market for German bund contracts. Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, played down the threat, arguing that the London exchange offers a wider range of products, greater liquidity and better distribution than its European rivals, which 'tend to be seen as domestic exchanges'. He said, however, that the tie-up could succeed in attracting new players into the marketplace. Liffe would not lose any 'significant percentage' of its bund business to the DTB, he predicted. Collaboration between Liffe and its European counterparts is likely to remain limited, Mr Hodson said.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (24): How not to fall into a trough? - The risk / Retire when the stock market or annuity rates are low, and your pension will suffer. The industry is seeking a solution to the problem Consider the position of someone who retired on a personal pension the day after the stock market crash of October 1987. Or, to take a more immediate example of how personal pension holders are hostage to market forces: the individual who retired earlier this year, when annuity rates, reflecting the very low yields available on 15-year gilts, fell to their lowest level in decades. For two people whose retirements were separated by Black Monday of October 1987, said Mr Ron Spill, director of pensions at Legal and General, 'the difference in the value of their pensions is 20 per cent.' In an employer-sponsored defined benefit scheme, it is the employer who bears the investment risk; and because benefits are paid out from a pool over a very long period, fluctuations in market values are not usually significant. But the challenge that personal pension providers now have before them is to devise investment strategies which help to minimise the volatility of investment returns, while maximising returns from the highest yielding securities. The same question of investment volatility applies to increasingly popular money-purchase, defined-contribution schemes. Moreover, the Labour party has indicated that it would like personal pension providers to build into contracts a minimum guaranteed level of benefit into contracts - a measure which would make a solution to the investment issue imperative. Mr Nigel Chambers, director at actuarial consultants Johnston Douglas, argues that the answer for the individual who wants to protect himself against a stock market crash just before retirement date is to 'make sure you are not invested in equities'. Indeed, most of the structures intended to reduce the investment risks of personal pensions involve the gradual shift of the portfolio into fixed-interest securities as the individual approaches retirement date. Gartmore, the UK fund management company, has a product which invests 90 per cent of an individual's pension fund in equities up until the 40th birthday. Then, over the next 25 years, investments are gradually moved out of equities and into fixed-interest investments - a process which accelerates between the 60th and 65th birthdays. Thus, if yields on bonds have fallen sharply, at least the individual will have the benefit of the sharp investment gains on bond prices which should have accrued in the preceding months. An alternative solution was launched last year by Mercury Asset Management's life insurance arm, Mercury Life. While it is initially available only to prospective clients with Pounds 500,000 or more to invest - making it suitable only for large group personal pensions or money-purchase accounts - the technique shows promise for personal pension holders as well. Using a complex formula that involves the use of equity derivatives, the 'guarantee fund' invests 99 per cent of all contributions in an investment pool, while the remaining 1 per cent goes into a reserve fund. The reserve fund uses derivatives to ensure that the individual will earn at least 90 per cent of the average daily market value of the units in the investment pool, and retain those profits even if the stock markets fall sharply in ensuing years. Alternatively, some argue, the liability stream of a personal pension requires the UK government to be much more imaginative and flexible in its design of investment securities used to fund the budget deficit. Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable, says: 'The basic problem is the structure of the cash flow.' What is needed, he suggests, is a very long-dated UK government gilt which pays no interest in its early years - while the pension plan holder is still employed and saving for retirement - but pays index-linked benefits in later years. Such a security could be purchased with a lump sum on, say, an individual's 40th birthday and accrue interest at, say, some margin above retail prices until the 65th birthday is reached. The index-linked payments would operate thereafter. Mr Ritchie argues that the new instrument would ensure that final returns to personal pension holders at least bear some relationship to the income earned during a lifetime at work. Presumably, salary will have increased broadly in line with inflation during the individual's working life, matching the accrued interest he will earn on retirement. Mr Ritchie is not alone in calling for new instruments to meet the investment objectives of personal and money-purchase pensions. The left-of-centre think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Studies, has also called for the creation of a new instrument that would have a capital value linked to an index of national average earnings. So a broad spectrum of the pensions industry has at least recognised the need to rethink the appropriate investment strategy. It remains to be seen which solution will prove the most effective for policyholders.</p>

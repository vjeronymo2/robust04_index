			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Observer: Spanish U-turn When Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, introduces Jose Maria Aznar, leader of Spain's centre right Partido Popular, at London's Queen Elizabeth II conference centre this morning, even hard-headed fund managers may spot the poignancy of the occasion. Portillo's father, Luis Gabriel, a mild-mannered law professor at Salamanca University, had to flee Spain when the Republican government he supported was crushed by General Franco's uprising. Aznar's grandfather, Manuel, who made his name as a first world war correspondent, wrote the official Francoist account of the 1936-39 fratricidal struggle. A refugee in London, Portillo senior, penned elegant and nostalgic sonnets about his lost homeland and worked as a translator for Reuters and the BBC. Manuel Aznar went on to be chairman of Spain's state-owned news agency EFE after serving as Spanish ambassador to the UN. Grandson Jose Maria is being wined and dined in London by James Capel, the securities house, which appears to have placed a firm bet on Spain's neck-and-neck elections. With Spain's centre-right promising a sweeping privatisation programme, such hospitality could be a sound investment.</p>

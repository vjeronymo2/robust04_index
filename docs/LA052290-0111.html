			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Yeutter Criticizes Japanese Minister: Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter blasted his  Japanese counterpart Tomio Yamamoto for reportedly saying the United States had  interfered in Japan's internal affairs by suggesting it liberalize its  protected rice market. "I am very troubled by these comments, " he said in a  letter to the Japanese agriculture minister that was made public.  </P> <P> Yeutter also sought a meeting with the Japanese official to discuss the issue  further and suggested that it be held during a ministerial meeting of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris next week. He  said Yamamoto was quoted last week in a newspaper as having said Japan would  not tolerate further meddling by U.S. officials in its rice policy. Japan  virtually bans imports of rice to protect its farmers from lower-priced  imports.  </P></p>

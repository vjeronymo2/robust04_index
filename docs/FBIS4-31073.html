			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a statement by the spokesman for the Foreign </F> Ministry; place and date not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] Commenting on the statement by Theodhoros Pangalos,  Greek minister for European affairs, who said that it was not  Greece's veto but that of the European Community [EC] that  blocked the assistance to Albania and that the EC has done this  as a punishment for the violation of Greek minority rights in  Albania, the Foreign Ministry spokesman has stated:    This is a completely insincere statement, and Mr. Pangalos  knows this better than anyone else. By making such a statement,  he is trying to hide the hand that has thrown the stone.    The truth is that the European Union [EU] assistance for  Albania's balance of payments has been approved on all EU  Commission and European Parliament levels and was blocked by the  Greek representative at the meeting of EU economy ministers in  Brussels on 16 May. The Greek representative put forth the veto  and did not call for a consensus on whether this assistance  should be granted to Albania as stipulated in earlier  projections.    Other Greek representatives maintained the same stance in  the  last meeting of technical groups that discussed this question.  The representatives of EU member countries have not only  expressed their surprise but also their nonapproval of this  Greek stance, as many of them have voiced this to the Albanian  representatives.    Regarding the claim on the alleged violation of the Greek  minority rights in Albania, we stress that the Albanian reality  and the repeated reports by the CSCE high commissioner, the  European Parliament, the Council of Europe, and the U.S.  Congress clearly testify that this minority enjoys all the  freedoms and rights set forth in the Copenhagen document.    With his last statement, Mr. Pangalos, seeking to share the  responsibility of his government regarding the blocking of aid  for Albania along with the other member countries, hopes to  freeze Albania's relations with the EU and its member countries.  However, this attempt has failed because Albanians know quite  well that embargoes and blockades for the purpose of  nationalistic ambitions are alien to civilized and democratic  Western countries.    We would like to tell Greece that, with the blocking of EU  assistance, it has gone too far and cannot boast of being  neither an old neighbor nor an EC president. On this occasion  Greece has used an economic punishment even for the Albanian  citizens of Greek origin who, determined to set up a democratic  society in Albania, are not only penalized but are also left  dissatisfied from this act and feel that others are abusing and  manipulating them.    The spokesman finally stressed that Albania is confident  that  the European Union will not agree to the blocking of reforms in  Albania and that it will not allow the money of noble European  taxpayers to be used for purposes of destabilized and  nationalistic policies or to serve geopolitical disequilibrium.</p>

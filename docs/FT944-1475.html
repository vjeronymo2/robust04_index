			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Bundesbank in command The German economy has confounded its critics in 1994; so has the Bundesbank. It is difficult to see why the council should revise its fundamental policies when setting the monetary target for 1995 this Thursday. Nor is there a compelling reason for it to alter interest rates. When the first change does come, it is more likely to be up than down. It is remarkable how far and how quickly both the economic situation and the problems confronting the Bundesbank have changed. A year ago, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast gross domestic product growth of only 0.8 per cent between 1993 and 1994. Meanwhile, as recently as April the annualised rate of growth of broad money (M3), over the average for the last quarter of 1993, was 15.4 per cent, far above the target range of 4-6 per cent. With the economy forecast to stagnate and monetary growth soaring, the Bundesbank was vulnerable to criticism whatever it did. If short-term interest rates were lowered, it would be accused of ignoring the monetary targets. If they were not, it would be accused of ignoring the needs of the economy. In the event, the Bundesbank did cut interest rates, lowering the discount rate from 5 3/4 per cent to 5 1/4 per cent in February, to 5 per cent in April and, finally, to 4 1/2 per cent in May. Similarly, the repurchase (or 'repo') rate was lowered from 6 per cent at the end of last year, to 4.85 per cent in late July, where it has since remained. The justification given for cutting interest rates was not that the money supply did not matter. Heaven forbid. It was rather that the money supply was swollen by technical factors, including tax considerations and high returns on liquid bank deposits relative to illiquid 'monetary capital'. Vindicated Considerable scepticism has been expressed about this rationale. In retrospect, however, the Bundesbank has been vindicated. Since money supply remained virtually unchanged between April and October, the growth of M3 is now likely to be close to the upper range of its target for the year. If M3 were to remain stagnant in November and December, its annualised growth would even fall within the range. Money supply has come right  - and so has the economy. The expectation is that GDP will grow by 2 1/2 per cent, or more, this year. Over the year to the third quarter it rose 2.5 per cent. Growth has been driven, in the traditional manner, by export volume, up 14 per cent in the year to June. As a result, industrial output has also risen quite sharply. In October, it was 5.1 per cent above the level reached a year before, although it was still 6.3 per cent below its peak in early 1992. The east German economy is also growing strongly, if from a low base: in the year to August 1994, output of manufactures rose 19 per cent. Inflation Even though the economy has been recovering far more strongly than expected, inflation has continued to fall. The annual rate of consumer price inflation has been running at below 3 per cent since September. Yesterday's monthly report from the Bundesbank said west German inflation could decline to below 2.5 per cent early next year. The report also welcomed the improvement in the public sector deficit. Germany is, in fact, well on the way to meeting the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union, by 1996. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank confronts the mirror image of the situation it faced a year ago. Then the economy was weak and monetary growth strong. Now things are the other way round. Nevertheless, the economy is not that strong and and monetary growth is not that weak. The Bundesbank's instinct may well be to change rather little. The monetary target for next year is likely to be similar to the one for 1993, although that would imply upward drift in the base, above the mid-point of this year's target range. Similarly, the Bundesbank should see little reason to change interest rates. At some point next year, interest rates are very likely to be raised. But the economy is not yet growing fast enough  - in particular, consumption does not appear dynamic enough  - to compel an early move. The Bundesbank deserves to feel proud of itself. It should rest a while on its laurels.</p>

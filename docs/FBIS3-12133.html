More than 1,000 students organized a peaceful demonstration  in which they shouted slogans denouncing the sinful aggression  against the unarmed citizens and raised anti-Israeli signs.    Meanwhile, Cairo University has decided to cancel two Arabic  musical concerts scheduled for today and to postpone until 3  March a folk dance show by Rida Group, in solidarity with the  families of the Palestinian martyrs and as an expression of  denunciation for this appalling crime.    At Al-Azhar University students demonstrated today for half  an hour while the opening session of an international  competition on the Koran was held on campus. The students  shouted slogans hostile to the Israeli practices and denounced  the attack on worshipers at the Hebron Mosque early Friday. The  students appealed to Arab and Islamic states to adopt a firm  stance against the Israeli violations.</p>

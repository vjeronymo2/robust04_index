			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHALLENGING ROUND FOR APPLAUSE;  </P> <P> OWNERS' FINANCIAL WOES, MARKET SHIFTS COULD UNDERMINE SUCCESSFUL WOODLAND HILLS  GIFT AND NOVELTY COMPANY.  </P> <P> Applause Inc.'s slogan this year is "Breakin' Away in '89," and Applause  President Robert G. Solomon calls it a "battle cry" to motivate the company's  1,300 employees to sprint ahead of their competition.  </P> <P> But Applause's race with its competitors this year may resemble a high hurdles  contest more than a sprint. After three years in which it doubled in size,  Applause is facing problems that could cause it to stumble if the company is  not careful.  </P> <P> In the past five years, the Woodland Hills company has emerged as one of the  nation's largest gift and novelty companies. Last year, it sold about $200  million worth of stuffed toys and dolls, plastic figurines, key chains and  decorative mugs, compared to sales of less than $100 million in 1986. The  company's products, which feature a logo showing a pair of clapping hands, are  sold in 75,000 gift, card, florist and stationery shops nationwide.  </P> <P> One question about Applause concerns its ownership. In May, control of the  company was bought by Avalon Marketing, a Los Angeles company that is itself  controlled by the wealthy Thompson family of Dallas, for $92.5 million cash and  stock worth $23.3 million.  </P> <P> The financial woes of the Thompsons, whose holdings include Southland Corp. and  its 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores, have been making news for the past  few months, with Fortune magazine recently calling their financial saga "The  Texas Chain Store Massacre."  </P> <P> The family borrowed about $5 billion to buy Southland in 1987 and has been  selling the company's assets furiously to pay down the debt. In addition, the  Thompsons developed a 42-story Dallas office building called Cityplace Center  that has been a financial disaster.  </P> <P> David Bowe, a vice president of Thompson Co. in Dallas, declined to comment  about Applause or other Thompson investments. But some observers are asking  whether Applause might be the next Thompson asset to be put on the block.  </P> <P> Not likely, said Dennis Telzrow, a retail analyst at Eppler, Guerin &amp;  Turner in Dallas, who has followed the Thompsons and developments at Southland.  He said the family fortune is somewhat insulated from the problems at  Southland, which was bought mostly with borrowed money.  </P> <P> "It's not like (Dallas businessman) Bum Bright, who put the Dallas Cowboys on  the block because had had a problem personally," Telzrow said. "The Thompsons  are not required to sell a lot of their (personal) assets because of what's  going on at Southland."  </P> <P> Two-thirds of Applause's business involves "plush toys" -- cuddly stuffed  animals and dolls. And that business softened dramatically last year.  </P> <P> According to figures compiled by the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade  group based in New York, sales of "traditional" plush toys, or low-tech stuffed  animals and dolls without electronic gadgetry inside, plunged 44% to 94 million  units last year, while the wholesale dollar value of such toys sold by  manufacturers tumbled 30% to $596 million.  </P> <P> Also, gift company executives complain that increased competition from new  manufacturers diluted the market as sales were slowing.  </P> <P> Robert E. McEntee, president of Applause's rival Russ Berrie &amp; Co in  Oakland, N.J., said: "1988 was not a a great year for plush toys. A lot of  people got into the business and saturated the market."  </P> <P> Such a steep drop is puzzling because 1986 and 1987 were big years for plush  toys. Toy and gift makers speculate that children and parents opted to spend  money on video games and traditional toys such as Barbie dolls in lieu of  stuffed animals and toys. They also blame department stores, which virtually  gave away stuffed bears in sales promotions.  </P> <P> "They really crippled the market," Applause's Solomon said. "There's no  question everyone in the gift and toy industry felt a softening in the plush  area."  </P> <P> Solomon recognizes that the gift and toy business is not child's play. So he  responded by making what he calls a "left turn" in Applause's business. Rather  than get slaughtered in the market by producing "generic" products such as  stuffed bears, he said, he aggressively went after the "licensed character"  market, where he said demand remains strong.  </P> <P> Licensed characters are often cartoon characters, many of them made famous in  movies, books or on television. Applause sells stuffed toys and figurines  featuring Roger Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, E. T., the Smurfs, the California Raisins  and Raggedy Ann. Coming later this year is a Batman doll, which Applause  expects to be a hit product after a feature film, starring actor Michael  Keaton, is released in June. (For more on Batman, please see the Marketing  column, Page 6.)  </P> <P> Dolls and figurines representing licensed characters make up about 50% of  Applause's sales, with only 10% involving the "generic" stuffed animals and  toys. Among its best-selling products lately have been California Raisins  characters, based on the popular television commercials for the California  Raisin Advisory Board in Fresno. The dancing raisins have brought Applause more  than $25 million in fees and sales of toys in less than two years, Solomon  said.  </P> <P> Some gift companies shy away from licensed characters. For one thing, the owner  of the license typically gets 5% to 10% of sales. In addition, the public is  fickle about such characters.  </P> <P> "Licensed products such as Roger Rabbit and Spuds MacKenzie come and go," said  McEntee, the Russ Berrie president, who nonetheless makes a stuffed toy based  on the television character ALF.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Produced Overseas  </P> <P> Solomon said the characters are selected carefully and that he prefers "classic  characters" that clearly have a long life span, such as Raggedy Ann and Walt  Disney's Mickey Mouse.  </P> <P> "We say no to licenses nine out of 10 times. We said no to the 'Willows' and  the 'Howard the Ducks' of the world," he added, referring to two recent films.  </P> <P> The stuffed toys and dolls that Applause sells are made in South Korea and  China and typically sell in stores for less than $20. To protect Applause from  big swings, Solomon said, the company makes sure that no more than 10% of  Applause's business will be based on any one product and that no more than 2%  of its sales are from any one retailer.  </P> <P> Solomon, 36, started working as a salesman in 1975 for the company, when it was  based in Van Nuys and known as Wallace Berrie &amp; Co. Berrie, the brother of  Russ Berrie, retired in 1982.  </P> <P> Applause later became a partnership owned by Solomon and two other men, Larry  Elins, who is retired, and Harris Toibb, who serves as Applause's chairman.  Last May, Solomon was named president after working as executive vice  president.  </P> <P> Solomon likes to use vivid metaphors when describing Applause. On a company  videotape, he tells his 500-person sales staff that the retail business is like  "Mt. Fuji." Applause, he says, does not want to aim for the top of the  mountain, where exclusive stores such as Tiffany &amp; Co. are, or for the  bottom, where he says one finds mass merchandise outfits such as K mart and  Toys R Us. Instead, he says, he wants to be in the middle, where he finds such  stores as Hallmark card stores and airport gift shops.  </P> <P> Applause is highly profitable, according to Securities and Exchange Commission  documents filed by Avalon. In the fiscal year that ended last June 30, Avalon's  gift ware division, which is mostly Applause, had operating income of $28.7  million on sales of $191.2 million.  </P></p>

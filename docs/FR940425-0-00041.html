			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA received nine comments about the proposed effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date. Blue Bird, Flxible, and Navistar agreed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed effective date of September 1, 1994. Flxible's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement with the agency's proposed effective date was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent upon the agency adopting its recommendations in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule. Navistar believed that the effective date should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be earlier if possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA, the United States Department of Energy, NGV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systems, Volvo GM, and CNG Pittsburgh did not agree with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date proposed by the agency. NGV Systems, Volvo GM,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and CNG Pittsburgh stated that the proposed effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be difficult to meet but did not recommend a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date. AAMA and the U.S. Department of Energy recommended an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of September 1, 1995. However, AAMA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation was contingent upon its recommendations being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in the final rule. AAMA further stated that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier effective date would not be reasonable or practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, the NGVC, the CGA, and CNG container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers have informed the agency that they want a CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel integrity standard to be effective as quickly as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. In addition, they favor having an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``voluntarily certify compliance'' to the standard once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule is published. The CNG industry groups believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is necessary for a Federal standard to be in place as soon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible given the expected increased demand for CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles in light of Federal and State fleet programs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean fuel vehicles. They also favor quick adoption of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal standard to preempt state regulations that otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be promulgated and to ensure that substandard CNG vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not marketed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set an effective date of September 1, 1995. NHTSA is fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware that the NGVC and CGA, which represent the natural gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, favor what amounts to an immediate effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the agency believes that a leadtime of at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one year is necessary given that vehicle manufacturers will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to certify compliance to an entirely new set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamic crash requirements. In the meantime, prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard's effective date, the industry is free to market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles as meeting the CNG vehicle standard that takes effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1995. Manufacturers have taken this approach with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the agency's side impact requirements and air bag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Therefore, to the extent feasible, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourages manufacturers to manufacture their CNG vehicles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet these new requirements before the date the standard takes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIMITZ IS PRESSED FOR ANSWERS;  </P> <P> QUAKE SAFETY: ENGINEERS SHAKE THE TOTTERING OAKLAND STRUCTURE. WHAT THEY LEARN  WILL HELP SHAPE THE RETROFITTING OF FREEWAYS AROUND THE STATE.  </P> <P> The double-decked Nimitz Freeway, or at least what is left of it, suffered a  magnitude 5 earthquake Thursday afternoon -- for two hours.  </P> <P> No, Mother Nature was not wreaking some strange vengeance on the remnants of  the freeway that collapsed and killed 42 people during the magnitude 7.1  earthquake that shook the Bay Area on Oct. 17.  </P> <P> Rather, it was a team of civil engineers from UC Berkeley and Caltrans who were  shaking an isolated block-long section of the freeway to determine why a  mile-long section of it collapsed during the October temblor. By doing so, they  hope to learn how to retrofit other freeways in the area -- and throughout the  state -- so that they are less likely to collapse in a future quake.  </P> <P> "There were many tragedies during the Oct. 17 quake," said UC Berkeley civil  engineer Jack Moehle. "But the greatest tragedy would be if we didn't take time  out to learn from them."  </P> <P> During the next two to three weeks, the research team will gradually increase  the amount of force applied to the Nimitz segment each day until they get up to  about magnitude 7.5. Eventually, after the supporting columns have been  reinforced using techniques that are expected to be applied to other damaged  freeways, Moehle and his colleagues will shake it even harder to see whether  they can make it collapse despite the reinforcements. If it does collapse, the  engineers will know they will have to explore other types of reinforcement.  </P> <P> But it won't collapse very far. Construction crews have erected a strong  supporting structure under the top deck and, if it falls, it will only fall  about six inches or so. "The most anyone will hear is a dull thud," Moehle  said.  </P> <P> Television crews and reporters who flocked to the test site here Thursday  hoping to see the structure swaying violently were disappointed. A motion  sensor on one end of the freeway, looking something like the antenna of a car  radio, swayed back and forth, but the movement of the structure itself was not  readily apparent.  </P> <P> During the shaking, workers casually walked around on the top deck, monitoring  instruments and videotaping the scene, seemingly oblivious to the simulated  quake. Others went on with preparations for the ultimate test, in which  powerful hydraulic jacks will force the top deck from side to side in an effort  to knock it loose from its foundation.  </P> <P> The force for Thursday's simulated quake, however, was provided by a  deceptively simple apparatus: two off-center weights connected to a two-part  vertical shaft axis firmly attached to the top deck of the freeway. As the  motor-driven shaft rotated the weights in opposite directions, it applied a  sideways force to the freeway similar to that produced by a wet blanket in an  out-of-balance washing machine, Moehle said.  </P> <P> The maximum effect occurred when the weights were rotated at what is called the  resonant frequency of the structure, about 2.2 cycles per second. At that  frequency, each rotation of the weights reinforced the shaking of the structure  in the same way that small pushes applied to a swing cause it to go higher and  higher.  </P> <P> To increase the size of the simulated quake in the coming weeks, the workers  will simply add more weights to the shaft.  </P> <P> Researchers have offered a number of explanations for why the upper deck of the  Nimitz collapsed unexpectedly during the earthquake. The growing consensus  seems to be that the columns supporting the upper deck were not anchored to the  lower roadway firmly enough.  </P> <P> As the earthquake shook the freeway structure, those columns apparently broke  free from the lower deck, straddling that deck and allowing the upper deck to  fall straight down.  </P> <P> Furthermore, by a quirk of fate, the shaking of the ground in the Oakland area  apparently matched the resonant frequency of the structure. That and loose soil  under some sections magnified the effects of the quake.  </P> <P> After the preliminary studies now under way are completed, the engineering team  will attempt to reinforce the points where the columns are anchored. Moehle  noted, however, that they have not yet decided what might be the most effective  way to do so.  </P> <P> Proposals include jacketing the column with an additional layer of cement,  attaching steel girders to it and tying together the columns on opposite sides  of the deck with steel cables.  </P> <P> After all the tests are concluded, Moehle said, engineers will be able to be  more confident that repairs being made on other freeways "will really do the  job."  </P></p>

Preservation of the freshness and fervor of  the presence of society in political affairs cannot be done by  force. Neither can government directives be instrumental in  politicizing a society, nor can one force the people to  participate in political affairs at a particular juncture or for  the sake of the personal inclinations of an individual.    That society has a constant presence on the political scene  which is endowed with political acumen and this cannot be  achieved without the spontaneous fervor of the people for such a  presence and is only possible when the society feels such a need.    The great leader of the revolution constantly stresses the  people's regular presence on the political scene and recently  too he exhorted the students to cultivate political  understanding and insight -- it is a source of amazement that  the students cannot participate in the most essential gathering  and march against the United States on the day that has been  declared a national day of combating the powers of world  arrogance.    Interior Minister Besharati's response to a question by the  Rasht deputy gives the impression that the commemoration of this  day and the marches by students on 4 November [anniversary of  the takeover of the U.S. Embassy by Iranian students] can only  be done through government channels.    If the students of this country, who are part of an  enlightened, dynamic, and aware society, have to surmount a  barricade called a government directive to express their hatred  and to condemn the United States, how can they be expected to  have a constant presence on the country's political scene?    In answer to the question by the Rasht deputy, the interior  minister stated: "Our criterion for granting permission to  stage marches on 4 November is the directive which is a legal  document, and we can grant permission to only one organization  and that is the Islamic Propagation Coordination Council."    Minister, Sir! Please note that on the day that it becomes  necessary for students to be present on the political scene to  condemn the powers of world arrogance, it will not be possible  to drag them to that scene with a directive.    Yes. The law is to be respected and its implementation is  necessary and it is binding on all. However, it is not possible  to groom a society to be a spontaneous political one endowed  with a high level of awareness and acumen merely by means of  government circulars.</p>

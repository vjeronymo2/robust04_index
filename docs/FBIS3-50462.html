In a communique, the rebels announced the creation of a  guerrilla group called the Zapata National Liberation Army  [Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional -- EZLN]. The  communique calls on EZLN forces "to advance toward the capital  of the country, defeat the Mexican Federal Army, protect the  civilian population during this liberating advance, and allow  the liberated people to elect their own administrative  authorities in a free and democratic manner."    Eyewitness Ernesto Riedwyl told AFP that in San Cristobal de  las Casas some 200-300 people took over the municipal palace.  According to Riedwyl, these people are now engaged in  destroying and looting the building. Riedwyl said: "They are  all wearing uniforms with green trousers, brown shirts, and red  hats and scarfs. They are also carrying weapons of various  calibers, and they have modern radio communications equipment."    He added, "Most of them are Indians, but there are also some  white people with light-colored eyes."    According to this witness, the rebellion began at 0230 (0830  GMT) when the rebels took over the Justice Palace, which they  burned. Later, they took over the San Cristobal de las Casas  Mayor's Office. According to Radio Red, the rebels are also  causing "disturbances" in other areas of Chiapas State, which  borders Guatemala.    According to reporters, security forces in Chiapas have  tried  to persuade the rebels to resolve their problems through legal  means, but this report has not been officially confirmed.</p>

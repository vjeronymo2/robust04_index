			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: Sunday trading: protect staff or follow Scotland? (1) Sir, I fully agree with the heading to your editorial that the government should 'Act swiftly on Sunday trading' (December 30). It is surprising that you seem to believe that effective legal protection of staff not wishing to work on Sundays is possible. Yet you frequently report cases of discrimination because of race or sex. Quite recently you reported that even women barristers feel they are discriminated against. Then, of course, there are those who suffer in silence knowing that the effectiveness of anti-discrimination laws is nothing but a mirage. Let's be realistic and find a new way to restrict Sunday trading. Sunday trading is significantly restricted in most of Europe. We would be foolish to step out of line.

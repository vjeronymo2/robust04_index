			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Federal Employment Service [FSZ] report: "The Rate of </F> Increase in the Number of Unemployed Has Fallen"]    [Text] As of 1 May 1994, the State Employment Service [sic]  had registered 1.4596 million citizens who were not engaged in  work activity, including 1.18 million who were unemployed.  During April the number of citizens who were unoccupied  increased by 95,900 and the number who were unemployed increased  by 96,500 over the preceding month.    Citizens who were dismissed from enterprises, organizations,  and institutions account for 25.2 percent of the total number of  persons who are unoccupied.    For the first 4 months of 1994 as a whole, the number of  unoccupied citizens rose by 375,100 (1.3 times as much).    The number of unemployed citizens registered by the State  Employment Service increrased by 344,400 (1.4 times as much)  over the first 4 months of 1994.    The unemployment level (the ratio between the number of  registered unemployed and the number of able-bodied persons in  the population of working age) was 1.4 percent for Russia as a  whole on 1 May 1994.    The number of vacancies reported to the State Employment  Service increased by 35,600 during April, reaching 325,000 on 1  May. Some 83 percent of the vacancies are for workers and 17  percent are for white-collar workers.    In Russia as a whole, an average of 4.5 persons are  unoccupied and 3.6 persons are unemployed for each vacancy  reported to the State Employment Service. In a number of  regions, the situation in the labor market is marked by more  tension. There are 255 unoccupied citizens laying claims for one  vacancy in the Ingush Republic, 51 citizens in Yaroslavl Oblast,  from 31 to 35 in the Nenetsk and Aginsk Buryat autonomous okrugs  and the Dagestan and Chuvash republics, and from 27 to 29 in  Pskov, Bryansk, and Sakhalin oblasts, the Komi-Permyak  Autonomous Okrug, and the Republic of Northern Osetia.

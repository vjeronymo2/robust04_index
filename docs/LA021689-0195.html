			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WALKER SCORES 37 AS BREA-OLINDA WINS EASILY  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda High School junior forward Keith Walker knows there's a long road  ahead to reach his goal of a Southern Section 3-A boys' basketball  championship.  </P> <P> So even though he scored a game-high 37 points to lead the Wildcats to a 73-44  victory over La Sierra in a first-round game Wednesday, he's not that thrilled.  </P> <P> "Our season's not over yet," he said. "So I won't be happy unless we've won it  all. I'll get a little happier each game (we win)."  </P> <P> The Wildcats, who play San Dimas on Friday, got off to a fast start Wednesday  on the strength of Aaron Charlton's three-point play and Walker's two  three-point baskets for 9-0 lead.  </P> <P> Charlton finished with 16 points and Craig McPhee contributed 11 rebounds for  the Wildcats.  </P> <P> The closest La Sierra got in the first half was at 22-16 when 6-8 center Keith  Greeley sank two free throws midway through the second quarter.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda (20-7) used a zone defense to shut down the inside game of Greeley,  who was limited to 14 points, 11 below his season average.  </P> <P> "Usually we don't do that," Walker said of the double, and sometimes  triple-teaming on Greeley, who will attend USC. "But I've played against him  before, so I knew he was big and strong."  </P> <P> Greeley missed his first four shots and made only five of 19 field-goal  attempts in the game.  </P> <P> Walker was 14 of 28 from the field four of nine from three-point range.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda opened up a 46-31 lead after three quarters after an 11-3 run to  close out the period. Walker, whose season high was 42 points against El  Dorado, had six points in the spurt.  </P> <P> The Wildcats maintained a comfortable lead through the final quarter. They  never allowed the Eagles (15-8) to get any closer than 12 points, and closed  out the game with a 14-0 streak.  </P></p>

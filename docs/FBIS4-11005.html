			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Sanchez] </F>   [Text] A risky step backward. It is barely discernible,  but the internal confrontation within the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] is devastating.    The changes following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination  have not been easy. Representatives of the political class,  including the dinosaurs and the technocrats, have been  conducting tough negotiations surrounding the presidential  candidacy of Ernesto Zedillo to ensure the survival of the  Colosio and the PRI political program.    Just hours after the Lomas Taurinas crime, confusion was the  recurring factor in the process to choose Zedillo.    Low blows and unorganized promotion campaigns.  Unintentionally, according to his helpers and political  companions, Amador Rodriguez Lozano [head of the PRI Secretariat  for Electoral Action] was brought face to face with President  Salinas and Zedillo: the intention was none other than to make  it appear as if Fernando Ortiz Arana was trying to slip  everybody a fast one.    But days before his death, Colosio had decided to make  changes in the PRI leadership. During Holy Week, Cesar Augusto  Santiago, a friend of Colosio and Ortiz Arana, was expected to  replace Jose Luis Lamadrid Sauza as PRI secretary general.    During those days Ortiz Arana had been the target of a  campaign to remove him from the PRI national leadership; the  campaign was ordered by the Xola government offices. This  campaign announced the nomination of Emilio Gamboa Patron or  Carlos Hank Gonzalez, or the natural transition to Francisco  Ruiz Massieu.    With Colosio's death, his followers became the weakest group  within the PRI and the non-Colosio groups started to settle  accounts, given their previous status as underdogs.  <H5>  The Groups </H5>   The Zedillo team was quick to open its way among the Colosio  followers.    The stamp of the new team is Hankism [referring to Carlos  Hank Gonzalez], the powerful group with roots in Atlacomulco.  Former Governors Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza and Alfredo Baranda  (who only had a brief dream of becoming Santiago Onate's  successor; instead, Jose Angel Gurria won by a nose) in addition  to former government secretary general Humberto Lira Mora, were  to take up key positions to give the campaign a different style  from that of Colosio.    Jose Luis Lamadrid Sauza -- a member of the compact group  created by Jose Cordoba Montoya -- to which Zedillo also  belongs, was removed from the maelstrom and placed out of the  reach of criticism: into the presidency of the Consultative  Committee of the Change 21 Foundation, now called the Luis  Donaldo Colosio Foundation, a job that was specially created for  the Jalisco State senator.    Amador Rodriguez Lozano, tasked with the PRI's electoral  program -- created by Cesar Augusto Santiago five years ago --  was appointed Zedillo's adviser. In turn, Rodriguez was replaced  by Humberto Lira Mora, from Mexico State.    Liebano Saenz -- a native of Chihuahua State who wants to  become a senator or governor -- was removed from Information and  Propaganda and became Zedillo's private secretary, which will  help him achieve his objectives.    Santiago Onate Laborde, a well-known jurist who worked in  the  Secretariat for International Affairs, was neutralized by  placing him in charge of the Office of the Presidency, a post  that he took over without the power of Cordoba Montoya. Onate  is a key member of the Colosio group.  <H5>  The Internal Crisis </H5>   Information provided to EL FINANCIERO by several key actors  allows one to ascertain that the recomposition of the Zedillo  team has generated a severe internal crisis within the PRI.    In the offices of the Secretariat for Electoral Action the  afternoon of Thursday 24 March, Hector Landeros -- a mechanical  engineer who admires Manuel Camacho, is loyal to Javier Garcia  Paniagua, and is tasked with legitimizing the topics and  coordinating the debates of the PRI electoral program -- issued  an order to the personnel who were working at the time in the  operations center of what is known nowadays as electoral  engineering.    The order was: Call everyone you know and tell them that we  must support Ortiz Arana.    Jesus Perez Pinon -- an electoral design specialist who  friends say has good intentions -- eagerly began the task of  promoting Ortiz Arana as the presidential candidate, even though  this had not been ordered by Amador Rodriguez. Hipolito Garnica  followed suit.    Faxes and photocopies of a document were also issued by  that office [Electoral Action Secretariat] giving six reasons  why Ortiz Arana should be nominated presidential candidate.    "Because he is our symbol    "Because Ortiz Arana is and represents change    "Because he, and only he, is our presidential candidate."    The document was prepared on a computer. It carried the PRI  logo crossed with the date 21 August [date of Mexican elections]  and the words "Colosio yes" on the upper right side. It was  sent via fax to some state leadership committees.    One of [Amador] Rodriguez Lozano's aides, who refused to  support the campaign "because there were no instructions from  our boss, Amador," said that from the CEN presidency, Ortiz  Arana stopped "the strange" campaign.    Sources that were consulted assure us that Amador Rodriguez  did not contrive this campaign; "it was handled clumsily," the  informants say. First of all because the Colosist team knew the  decision would fall on Ernesto Zedillo, who is from the same  region as Rodriguez Lozano. The PRI electoral program had been  drawn up throughout nearly five years, led by Colosio and  designed by the team at that time of Cesar Augusto Santiago  Ramirez, from Chiapas.    Rodriguez Lozano was left heading the PRI electoral program,  which had been tested in the 1991 federal elections and the  elections in Mexico, Yucatan, and Morelos States.    The Baja California deputy aspired to a Senate seat from his  state. With Zedillo's appointment, Rodriguez Lozano would not  only have implemented the designed and tested electoral program  but his aspirations would have been fulfilled without difficulty.    Nevertheless, the "inexplicable" promotion campaign not only  brought Rodriguez Lozano face to face with Zedillo and President  Salinas, but also exposed Ortiz Arana.    The truth is that the appeals to the state leadership  committees created a climate of confusion among the PRI members.  <H5>  Ortiz Arana, Securing Support </H5>   Hours after Colosio's assassination, reporters spoke with  Ortiz Arana. It was clear that the only possible formulas for  the presidential candidacy were Zedillo and Ortiz Arana. In  Dolores pantheon, Ortiz Arana commented:    Believe me, boys, the only thing I aspire to in my political  career is the Senate of the republic and to govern my state. I  do not want to be a presidential candidate. As PRI president, I  would not want to have an advantage over anyone. The country  and their stability are above anything else.    Ortiz ruled himself out on the morning of 29 March. Hours  earlier he had secured the support of 69 members of the National  Political Council to oppose a possible reform of constitutional  Article 82, which paradoxically was ready in Los Pinos.    A high-ranking PRI member said that if Article 82 had been  reformed, the array of possible candidates to replace Colosio  would have been so broad that the PRI would have crumpled until  it fell apart.    Other negotiations were held as events developed. Ortiz  Arana owes his political career to his ability, but also to the  loyalty and trust of the president of the republic. He was  leader of the Assembly for Salinas, chief of the PRI legislative  faction with the approval of the president, and PRI national  leader also because of the president.    The opinion of the governors was controlled by the president  of the Republic. The consensus of the old political class still  had to be secured.    The governors helped secure an agreement suggested by  Salinas  to obtain public support for Zedillo's candidacy from former  government secretaries, including Javier Garcia Paniagua,  Francisco Merino Rabago, Antonio Ortiz Mena, and Carlos Tello  Macias.    It was up to Ortiz Arana to obtain public support from some  80 former governors, who had already committed themselves to  publicly supporting Colosio. They now did so for Zedillo.    The campaigns against Ortiz Arana continue, and now the  rumors talk of Pichardo Pagaza's quick ascent to the PRI  national presidency and Esteban Moctezuma's ascent to the  secretary general's post. Such advances would show that the  Colosists had been displaced.</p>

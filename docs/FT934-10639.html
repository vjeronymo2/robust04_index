			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries The US cigarette price war is starting to take a perceptible toll on BAT which suffered a 26 per cent fall in overall tobacco profits in the third quarter. While the drop was broadly in line with expectations, considerable uncertainty still clouds the outlook. There is unlikely to be a new year price rise in the US, so retailers are unlikely to build up much by way of stocks in the current quarter. That could lead to a profits shortfall larger than the Pounds 75m already seen in the first half. With the prospect of a federal excise tax of up to 75 cents a pack from next October, the chances of price recovery in the US look slim in 1994. Meanwhile, the German market is under pressure, partly as a result of smuggled imports from Poland, and Latin America is no longer showing its customary growth. Since tobacco earnings are unlikely to revive quickly, the recent rally in the shares may have already discounted much of the recovery in financial services. The tax rate will be higher next year, too, as the effect of the enhanced scrip dividend falls away. At least BAT is now making good profits in the UK, which allows it to be generous on the dividend front without incurring fresh ACT problems.</p>

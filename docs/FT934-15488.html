			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Haitians hostile to US troops US troops on a multinational peace mission to Haiti met hostility yesterday, adding to fears among US politicians that the troops could come under attack like the US force now engaged in Somalia. The USS Harlan County, with about 200 US personnel on board, was blocked from docking and embassy personnel were turned away from the port by shouting protesters in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. 'We don't want foreigners coming here and trying to tell us what to do]' one man shouted. US officials played down the incident. The US troops are being sent as part of a plan sponsored by the United Nations and the Organisation of American States to restore to office President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted by a military coup two years ago. The US is playing a secondary role, supplying engineers to help build roads and clinics while leaving the task of training a new police force to French-speaking countries. The US troops, who will eventually number around 700, are to be only lightly armed, but US officials say they will be able to defend themselves in an environment much less dangerous than Mogadishu.</p>

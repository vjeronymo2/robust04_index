			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Baghdad, 26 Apr (INA) -- Vice President Taha  Yasin Ramadan today inaugurated an Arab fair for agricultural  and irrigation technology and agricultural and food industry.  The five-day fair is organized by the Iraqi Agricultural  Engineers Association at the Baghdad International Fair.    Taha Yasin Ramadan delivered a speech on the occasion. He  said the contribution of the Arab brothers to this fair  expresses their siding with their Iraqi brothers who are facing  a brutal aggression, led by the United States, represented in  the continuation of the unjust blockade, after the U.S. dreams  to undermine Iraq through its savage military aggression  vanished in thin air.    Taha Yasin Ramadan said the Arab fair for agricultural and  irrigation technology and food and medicine industry has  exceptional importance under the current circumstances. It is  also an important step to thwart colonialist policies that use  food as a weapon against nations. The participation of Arab and  foreign companies specialized in all fields of agricultural  production is a practical method to stand in the face of the  forces of evil and aggression.

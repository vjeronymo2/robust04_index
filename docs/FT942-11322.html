			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US pressed to open up to EU THE US must go further in opening home markets to European goods and investment if it is to live up to its self-claimed title of 'still the most open trading nation in the world,' the European Commission said yesterday. In an annual report on US trade barriers to European business, the Commission highlighted 'unreasonable' application of anti-dumping and other duty measures against exports from the European Union, and increasing application of domestic trade legislation to companies operating outside the US, as particular obstacles to European industry and investors. 'All these measures are anathema to an open world trading system which should be based on one set of negotiated multilateral rules and procedures fairly applied to all contracting parties in the Gatt,' the Commission said. The main barriers highlighted in the report include: Growing use of unilateral or bilateral trade measures, in particular renewal of Super 301 legislation, giving wide discretion to act over trade practices deemed unfair to US commerce. Extraterritorial application of national trade provisions which clash with trading partners' sovereignty and lead to insoluble legal conflicts. The report cites the Cuban Democracy Act as an example. Use of national security considerations to justify curbs on trade and investment such as a 20 per cent limit on foreign investment in radio communications. Discrimination against non-US controlled companies for certain public contracts tendered at Federal and state level, and 'buy America' laws. High tariffs on textiles, clothing, footwear, tableware and glassware. Tax legislation such as state unitary taxation and car taxes which are the subject of a Gatt panel request by the EU. Multiplicity of standards at federal, state and municipal level as well as protectionist labelling requirements.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / SPD support needed for coal compromise LEADERS of Germany's ruling coalition yesterday agreed a compromise which would provide guaranteed finance for German coal production up to the year 2000, but not beyond. The deal depends, however, on agreement with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) on continued electricity production from nuclear power stations - in order to cross-subsidise expensive coal-fired power production with cheaper nuclear electricity. The plan was immediately denounced by the SPD, which wants Germany to abandon nuclear energy, as 'attempted blackmail' at the expense of coalminers. Protesting miners blocked the main road to the parliament quarter in Bonn waving banners denouncing Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister responsible for the energy industry, as a 'job killer'.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Observer: Executive panic What is upper-most in the minds of the captains of industry who have made the long trip north to Labour's Blackpool conference? National Power gave the game away when it invited one of shadow chancellor Gordon Brown's staff to its conference party. In a corner of the card offering drinks and light refreshments at The Imperial, a National Power employee had noted the reason for the invitation. Scrawled in pencil was the phrase 'executive share options'. Meanwhile, Labour's success in sucking more money out of the corporate sector has not pleased all the comrades. Dennis Skinner, the leftwing 'beast of Bolsover' was incensed by the discovery that Marconi is sponsoring a reception for the party's national executive committee tonight. He has made it quite clear that he and Tony Benn, the other pillar of the left wing, are not going to be on parade at any booze-up sponsored by a company in the armaments business.</p>

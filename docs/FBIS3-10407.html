From Edelberto Garcia, at the command post, we have  a report:    [Garcia] Good morning, "First Thing in the Morning"  listeners.    In the wee hours this morning, Commander in Chief Fidel  Castro visited the command post of the Defense Council of Plaza  de la Revolucion Municipality, which was activated yesterday in  view of possible imminent storm surges along this part of the  Havana coastline. So far, however, there have been only slight  surges.    Fidel arrived at this coordinating point for the  municipality  -- which is located at the headquarters of the Communist Party  of Cuba [PCC] -- at 0220 and quickly asked how penetration by  the sea might affect the area. This is the second threat of  storm surges so far this year.    (Eduardo Tejera), PCC first secretary in Plaza de la  Revolucion Municipality, briefed the leader of the Revolution on  the measures that have been taken, which include the moving of  all foodstuffs from gastronomic and commercial centers, the  cleaning of storm drains, and the evacuation of 50 percent of  the tourists lodged at the Habana Riviera Hotel.    Fidel explained that he had visited the Riviera Hotel area  and had been able to see the measures that had been taken, as  well as the retaining wall built recently in front of the hotel  to reduce the effect of the waves. In this connection, he  explained the importance of providing protective mechanisms for  any new hotels that may be built in these areas because  everything seems to indicate that, as a result of several  phenomena, these surges will tend to increase.    Fidel pointed out: We have already had two threats this  year;  and this one is still not over, because there will be another  high tide at noon today and with it returns the threat of  possible flooding in low-lying areas of five municipalities in  this capital.    The commander in chief had a long and pleasant talk with  reporters until after 0330. Fidel insisted -- and I wish to  stress this to our listeners -- on his concern that the  population remain attentive to the reports issued by the weather  institute in the next few hours. By the way, there will be a  meeting at approximately 0700 today at the headquarters of this  city's provincial government to take specific measures in this  connection.    This has been Edelberto Garcia, reporting from the command  post of the Defense Council of Plaza de la Revolucion  Municipality for "First Thing in the Morning."</p>

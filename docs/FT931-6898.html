			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (1): Jargon and apathy are the enemies of planners and finance is no exception. There is so much jargon in the field that many people give up in despair. The result, too often, is that they make the either the wrong financial decisions or no decisions at all. But ignorance and apathy can prove disastrous. There are, of course, more important subjects in life than split-capital investment trusts. But just as the financial markets can overturn the plans of politicians, so lack of financial forethought can upset your plans for a happy retirement, or for paying for children's education. This A-Z, a sequel to the one we published a year ago, is designed to give readers a working guide to their personal finances - so that they can deal more confidently with the professionals in their sector. Articles cover both important products in the field - from bonds to zero-coupon shares - and some of the key issues, such as whether to pay fees or commissions, and the questions you should ask when you meet an adviser or salesman. The guide appears at a time when the rapid falls in interest rates have relieved some of the pressure on borrowers, but have made it more difficult for savers to earn acceptable returns without taking unacceptable risks. Meanwhile, the ties between banking and life insurance are growing ever stronger. Consumers can expect to be offered a lot of products during the 1990s, so they need to be able to tell the dross from the worthwhile. They may or may not be able to rely on the regulators to look after their interests; the sector is currently in turmoil as the authorities try to cobble together a new body, the Personal Investment Authority, to cover the retail field. These issues make it all the more important for consumers to be well-informed, and we believe that the A-Z of Personal Finance supplement will prove to be of value. We cannot cover absolutely every personal finance subject, but most are touched upon. Those readers who want income might look at the articles on bonds, dividends, money market funds and variable-rate investments. Those aiming for tax-efficiency might turn to our pieces on estate planning, National Savings, offshore investment, year-end tax planning and zeros. You don't have to earn Pounds 150,000, or wear stripy shirts and coloured braces, to understand finance; but you do have to take an active interest.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Sizing up the global pot Hardly a week has passed since February without the gilt market succumbing to yet another bout of inflationary angst. And hardly a week has passed since then without the emergence of some encouragingly benign piece of news about the trend of underlying inflation. With long gilts delivering an income of nearly nine per cent and the Treasury's latest forecast for inflation revised down to a mere 2 1/2 per cent, the angst takes some explaining. How can gilt yields remain so high in the absence of more obvious inflationary pressure? One of the more fashionable explanations is that high real bond yields stem from a global capital shortage. That is to say, a combination of growing demand for capital from emerging markets, from businesses in recovering economies and from governments with big budget deficits has had to be financed out of a static or dwindling supply of capital. This, it is argued, has caused the price of capital - real long term yields - to rise. Certainly the thesis derives some support from the movement of index-linked gilts, which have risen by around a full percentage point so far this year. Also from numerous economic studies, which have established that shifts in long-run real interest rates are substantially explained by changes in returns on investment and in debt ratios. Over the long run, moreover, the argument looks altogether plausible. Between 1979 and 1992 gross national saving as a percentage of GDP in the OECD area declined from 23.6 per cent to 19.4 per cent. The fall was driven by the US, where gross national saving slumped over the period from 21.3 per cent to 14.5 per cent. Budget deficits, meantime, have been rising uncomfortably, especially in Europe. In its latest Economic Outlook the OECD estimates that general government budgets weakened on average by the equivalent of 3 per cent of GDP in the recent downturn. Between a third and a half of the deterioration was structural, which implies that the related increase in public spending will not disappear with economic recovery. Creditors' ranks The developed countries have, in fact, been hogging much of the internationally available capital at a time when the ranks of the creditor countries have diminished. Not only are the oil producers no longer big capital exporters; Germany, which ran a current account surplus on its balance of payments for most of the 1980s, has gone into deficit as a result of German reunification. Since a surplus has to be matched by capital outflows and a deficit by capital imports, Germany's about-turn imposes a strain on the global pool of capital. And it leaves Japan as the world's last big creditor country. Yet the US, which has recently become the world's biggest debtor with outstanding obligations to the rest of the world of well over Dollars 500bn, has been busy trying to reduce the Japanese current account surplus both through an aggressive trade policy and neglect of the dollar. The OECD projects that the Japanese current account surplus will fall from Dollars 131bn in 1993 to Dollars 120bn in 1995, while the US current account deficit is expected to rise from Dollars 109bn to Dollars 153bn over the same period. Adverse impact Since the level of capital investment tends to be insensitive to interest rate movements, this decline in both the aggregate level of saving in the developed world and of internationally available capital at a time of global recovery could indeed be expected to have a big adverse impact on long-term real rates. And it takes place just when the developing countries have been raising their net imports of capital from Dollars 37bn in 1986-90 to nearly Dollars 160bn last year. Yet this increase in the demand on the global savings pool still looks an odd explanation for recent bond market behaviour because it pre-dates the shakeout. The supply of capital to emerging markets has been heavily curtailed since February. And the budget deficits of most developed countries, bar Japan, are expected to shrink over the next two years. Nor is the developing world's use of capital quite as predictable as might be expected. Domestic savings there have played a much bigger role in financing investment than external capital; and the Third World has actually increased its contribution to global savings from 15 per cent in the 1970s to a remarkable 25 per cent today. Many countries in the Asian Pacific region have run persistent trade surpluses over the years. Even the regional giant China is running a substantial current account surplus if taken in conjunction with its near neighbours Taiwan and Hong Kong. Other things being equal, the increasing demand for capital from the more dynamic economies in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe must have an impact on the cost of capital. But the capital shortage argument rests heavily on expectations of shortage rather than current financial reality. It is an important, but still only partial, explanation for the high real bond yields in the UK and elsewhere.</p>

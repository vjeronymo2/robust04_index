			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] plans to include  revenues from sales of government-held shares in Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) in a draft budget for  fiscal 1994. It is considering selling 500,000 shares. There is  criticism that "the MOF places priority on selling NTT shares  held by the government." However, the MOF appears to think this  criticism will weaken because a ban on selling NTT shares is to  be lifted at the end of fiscal 1993 and because it included the  resumption of public capital increase in measures to deregulate  the stock market, which the ministry recently announced. It  will decide whether or not to sell the shares while carefully  watching the trend of the stock market. If the MOF sells the  shares, it will be the first time it has done so in six years.    The ministry will put the revenues from the sales in the  debt  consolidation fund. Although the fund is for repaying national  debts, part of it will be used for public works projects. The  ministry plans to estimate the revenue amount by examining NTT  share prices in the market. If the share price keeps to the  level of the closing price at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 22  December (which was 751,000 yen), the profit will be about 300  billion yen after a selling charge is deducted.    The MOF hopes to spend part of the revenue on public works  projects to shore up the economy.    Nonetheless, it thinks that the stock market is in a severe  situation. That is why it dropped plans last weekend to list  Japan Tobacco Inc. shares on the stock market in the current  fiscal year. Thus, it is still uncertain if the MOF will  actually sell NTT shares.    After giving up selling NTT shares in fiscal 1989, the  government planned to sell 500,000 shares each year over a  five-year period starting in fiscal 1991. However, because the  stock market continued to be sluggish, it hesitated to sell the  shares. In August 1992, the government announced the freeze on  the sales of NTT shares in fiscal 1992 and 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Do Not Conjure Up Ghosts From the Past"] </F>   [Text] On 11 February 1994, PASASON published some  information from reporters covering the implementation of  Lao-U.S. cooperation on U.S. POW-MIA's. In fact, the information  was not really a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry. Our  newspaper would like to apologize to its readers. Nevertheless,  the information included a lot of details that are factual,  clearly showing the good intentions and sincere cooperation  rendered by the Lao side and the Lao authorities in implementing  Lao-U.S. cooperation on Americans killed during the war in Laos.  Because of the Lao side's wholehearted cooperation, the program  has been carried out effectively so far. The remains of many  MIA's have been recovered. While the search for more U.S. MIA  remains was continuing, however, the Voice of America accused  the Lao side of failing to cooperate. They even cooked up a  story claiming that some live U.S. POW's were still in Laos.  Why are they so suspicious and talkative?    As everyone well knows, since 1985 and 1986 Lao and U.S.  technical teams have cooperated in carrying out excavation  missions at crash sites of U.S. planes shot down by the Lao  People's Army and our people throughout Laos. By September  1993, the two sides had conducted 35 excavations in 11 provinces  throughout the country and had retrieved the remains of 51 U.S.  MIA's. According to the authorities concerned, Lao-U.S.  cooperation in searching for U.S. POW-MIA's in Laos can be  divided into four areas. The first is doing surveys and  excavations of crash sites. Second is carrying out  interrogations and searching for U.S. POW's that the U.S. side  believes are still alive. Third is conducting interviews with  prominent persons. Fourth is examining documents and movies  related to the war. The Lao side has given its full cooperation  to its U.S. counterparts in all these areas. We even comply  with any additional requests by the U.S. This is because we are  sincere. We think it is better to forget about past animosities  and move on with rebuilding and developing our friendship. This  is an act of goodwill on the part of the Lao side as well as a  highly-esteemed humanitarian gesture by the multiethnic Lao  people. We, the Lao people -- like the American people -- are  able to differentiate between history, current reality, and the  future. The Lao and American peoples should step up our  cooperation in all fields in order to build our respective  countries and make them prosperous. We should not talk and  quarrel with one another about the past; it is not good for  either of us. Of course our cooperation in the search for U.S.  MIA's in Laos will continue. But it is ridiculous to conjure up  the ghosts of the past in order to slander each other.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- New Home Affairs Minister  Hajime Ishii says he is eager to allow the several hundreds of  thousand Japanese citizens living overseas to vote in Japanese  elections in absentia.    "If we are given a year or so, I think we can prepare a  bill.  If we cannot resolve the issue, we should be called negligent,"  said Ishii, a senior member of the coalition's core party  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) led by Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata.    Some countries, including Australia, Britain, Sweden and the  United States, grant the right to vote to some of their eligible  citizens residing overseas and there have been demands from  Japanese abroad to guarantee such a right.    Ishii also said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that  he hopes the bills on the locations of 300 new single-seat  constituencies for the House of Representatives will be enacted  in the current ordinary Diet session ending June 29.    Ishii played a pivotal role in enacting a political reform  package as the head of the lower house special committee on  political reform. The bills became law in late January but will  not take effect until the locations of the constituencies are  fixed.    A government panel studying the locations will present its  advice in several months, at which time the bills will be drawn  up by the government.    The package centers on changing the 511-member lower house  electoral system from the current multiseat constituency system  into a combination of elections from 300 single-seat  constituencies and the remaining 200 through a proportional  representation system.    Ishii said the next lower house election must be held under  the new system. "We must not implement a worn-out system again."    The minister said he is positive about the introduction of a  local consumption tax.    "It would go against the current trend toward  decentralization if the central government hoarded financial  sources," he said.    Ishii also said the government is making efforts to draw up  concrete decentralization guidelines, based on which the  government would submit bills to the Diet by the end of this  year.    He said Japan's local governments may have to foster  administrative reform after the central government goes ahead  with such reform.</p>

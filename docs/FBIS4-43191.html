			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The initial results of yesterday's European  Parliament elections constitute a double message and a double  shock for the government of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] and New Democracy, with very serious consequences for  the official opposition party. Election results show a  significant increase for the Political Spring party, a greater  proportional increase for the Coalition of the Left and  Progress, and a sizable increase for KKE [Greek Communist Party]  and DIANA [Democratic Renewal].    The initial consequences may be a corrective shift toward  the  governing party, and a serious reaction to the leadership's  policy toward New Democracy.    The elections for the European Parliament show that it was  affected more by the domestic situation and the country's  internal problems than from the European aspect of the  elections. [passage omitted]    The two largest parties fared just under the level of the  previous elections for the European Parliament but the  significant increase of Political Spring confirms the split in  the conservative faction.    At the same time, the Coalition of the Left and Progress and  KKE showed that they tended toward their traditional overall  level.    Yesterday's elections also gives a message about the  upcoming  presidential election in May 1995. The message is that the lack  a presidential majority cannot be ruled out, something that will  lead to new general elections. [passage omitted]</p>

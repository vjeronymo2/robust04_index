			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OPPOSES AIR RESERVATION SYSTEM MERGER  </P> <P> The Department of Transportation said Wednesday that it objects to the proposed  merger of the computerized reservations systems owned by American Airlines and  Delta Air Lines unless it is changed to make sure that it does not diminish  competition.  </P> <P> "The proposed transaction now before you has the potential to adversely affect  competition in the CRS industry and the airline industry," Transportation  Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said. His comments were contained in a letter to  Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh.  </P> <P> When the merger plan was announced in February, intense scrutiny by the  Department of Justice was anticipated. Until the first of this year, the  Department of Transportation had the responsibility of approving or denying  mergers in the U.S. airline industry. That responsibility has since shifted to  Justice, so Skinner's opinion is advisory, not binding.  </P> <P> "While we do not believe that competition in the CRS market is threatened so  seriously that the transaction should be challenged on that basis, we do  believe the transaction as currently structured poses a substantial likelihood  of producing an adverse effect on airline competition," Skinner wrote.  </P> <P> The carriers had hoped to close the deal this month but now say that it cannot  be completed until sometime this summer.  </P> <P> Skinner said the transaction should be "challenged unless it is modified to  include at least one additional airline owner." He also said the merged  reservations system should be managed and marketed independently of the two  airlines. When the airlines announced the deal, they said the new company would  have its own management and marketing personnel.  </P> <P> If the merger is approved, it would create a huge system that would handle  about half of the nation's airline reservations. In the deregulated airline  industry, a strong computer reservations system is a major ingredient in a  carrier's success.  </P> <P> The only U.S. carriers that do not own all or part of a reservations system are  Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines, America West Airlines and Pan American  World Airways.  </P> <P> Dallas-based American's present Sabre system is already the nation's largest,  with computer locations at about 14,000, or 42%, of the nation's 33,000 travel  agents. Delta, which is headquartered in Atlanta, is a much smaller participant  with only about 9% of the market.  </P> <P> Initially, the two carriers propose that each will own half of the new company.  Each airline will contribute its reservation system to form the partnership.  Since the American system is so much larger than Delta's, which is known as  Datas II, Delta will pay American $650 million.  </P> <P> The two carriers said they would offer half of the new company for sale and  that Delta and American would ultimately each own 25%. The rest would be sold  to other domestic and foreign carriers as well as to non-airline companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential Partners Scarce  </P> <P> The airlines said originally that other carriers would be allowed to purchase  shares of 10% or less in the new system for $20 million per percentage point.  Perhaps because there have been no buyers, the price for the first 20% sold has  been cut to $15 million for each percentage point.  </P> <P> Hans Plickert, an airline analyst with the Transportation Group, an affiliate  of the New York investment firm of Paine Webber, said it looks as if other  potential partners are scarce. "I presume that the secretary is not suggesting  that American and Delta give away a piece of the system for nothing," he said.  </P> <P> A Delta spokesman, Jim Lundy, said late Wednesday that Skinner's concerns have  already been addressed. "We are in serious negotiations with several potential  buyers," Lundy said. "We feel that in a short time we will be able to announce  the new owners."  </P> <P> Despite Skinner's comments, American said it does not view them as opposition  to the merger. The carrier said it "is gratified that the Department of  Transportation has concluded that American's proposed computer reservation  system partnership with Delta Air Lines will not threaten competition in the  CRS market and that the joint venture should not be challenged on that basis."  </P> <P> However, it added: "American disagrees with DOT's analysis of the possible  effect on air transportation. . . . Secretary Skinner's proposed cure for this  perceived problem is the same one that American and Delta have proposed and are  actively pursuing."  </P></p>

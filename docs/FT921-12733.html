			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / The Property Market: Looking back and at the present Mr Edward Erdman, the eponymous founder of the surveying practice, has one of the longest memories in the property industry. His career stretched from 1923, when he began work as an office boy, to 1974, when he sat on the Treasury's panel which advised on the property crash. In the Mayfair offices of the firm he founded 58 years ago, Mr Erdman flicks through a yellowing scrap-book of his business contacts. Staring out of it are the black and white photographs of a past generation of movers and shakers. 'Maxwell Joseph, a great friend of mine . . . Lew Grade, a cockney boy. I had some fun with him . . . Sir Isaac Wolfson, my most difficult client . . . ' His collection of portraits and reminiscences amounts to a who's who of the property industry. His anecdotes, which he collected and published in 1982*, give a affectionate, but revealing account of the entrepreneurs, agents and builders who dominated the property industry for much of the century. Mr Erdman's scrap-book contains a letter to the uncle of Mr John Ritblat, the future boss of British Land, explaining why he had refused the young Ritblat a job on leaving school. 'I thought he would be far too ambitious to settle down patiently to the disciplines and rigours of a professional career,' he wrote. Mr Erdman was persuaded to change his mind after learning that the young John had a suitably professional background (his father was a Hampstead dentist). However, in a sense, his misgivings were well-founded. John Ritblat soon left to set up his own agency, Conrad Ritblat. Mr Erdman also recounts the gruelling initiation into the Hammerson Group of Mr Sydney Mason (now the grand old man of property, after many years at the head of the company). On the first day of his new job in 1949, the nervous youth was sent by his boss Mr Lew Hammerson to negotiate the acquisition of a site in Park Lane with Mr Freddie Oberlander, the heavyweight world amateur wrestling champion. Another figurehead of the property industry, Lord Samuel of Land Securities, suffered a nerve-wracking incident at the start of his career. One day, drumming up business in the west end, Mr Harold Samuel was smoking a cigarette to steady his nerves. When he went into the shop to talk to his owner, he stubbed out the cigarette, pocketed it and then found to his 'utter embarrassment and confusion', that he had set his coat pocket alight. Mr Erdman's best stories concern Sir Isaac, the fiery, abrasive Scot who built up Great Universal Stores (GUS) in more than 100 takeovers. Mr Erdman, who advised him throughout on property valuations, pays tribute to Sir Isaac's infectious enthusiasm. 'I often found myself almost rushing out of his office in eagerness to do the next deal,' he says. He also shows the darker side of the tycoon, who was 'tough on the payment of fees' in his early days and who domineered over his executives, even insisting that they breakfasted with him at 7.30am. Once when his Mr Erdman and another agent were discussing a sale with Sir Isaac a waiter appeared with coffee and biscuits. 'Who told you to bring biscuits?' snarled Sir Isaac. These people are not customers, they are only agents. Take the biscuits away.' When, in 1955, Mr Erdman, did his first valuation of GUS's properties, Sir Isaac went through each valuation, yelling when he saw what he thought was a conservative valuation: 'You (Erdman), are not a valuer, you are a butcher.' But to his surprise, IW (as Mr Erdman refers to him) slapped him on the shoulder when he finished and said: 'Ah, well, I think you have done a good job.' Mr Erdman, now a spry 85-year-old, did not bow out of the property industry when he retired. He is president of a housing association, a non-executive director of Chesterfield Properties and Warnford Investments and he continues to take an interest in his former surveying practice, which is now an international firm. There is a trace of regret in his voice when he talks about the surveying profession. He contrasts today's 'young university trained surveyors with their computers' with the old-style agents who built their experience from pounding the streets, assessing the value of each and every property and from many years of 'trust, confidence and personal contact with individual clients'. 'In those days, there was a special flair and intuition. That has almost disappeared,' he mourns. The change has been 'a bitter pill' for the old-style surveyors who think that modern commercial standards, competition and outside capital investment will lower professional ethics, he says. 'I look at this business from a different angle from today. The boss of our business was principle not principal.' For all that, Mr Erdman concludes that surveying practices like his own are on the right path. And he does not suggest that all agents behaved impeccably in the old days. Back in the early 1930s, one of his colleagues whose job was to canvass shopkeepers for business, got away with being on three separate payrolls simultaneously. Mr Erdman's long memory is particularly valuable in assessing the severity of this property downturn. The paucity of records in the industry makes it difficult to judge the severity of the current recession against those in the first half of the century. Mr Erdman reckons the present slump is the worst he has experienced. In the 1930s, the emerging retail multiples needed more shops, which partially offset the ravages of the depression. Even so, his description of Regent Street in 1937 bears an eerie similarity to the present crash. 'Many well built crown properties on the west side were empty and to let. Some occupiers during the slump even complained they could not pay the rates.' There was a hiatus in the London property market during the second world war, although there was no shortage of demand for buildings from the army and government. After the war, Mr Erdman returned and re-opened the practice in Mayfair, and tried to find offices for businesses which wanted to reestablish themselves. Since domestic servants were no longer easily obtainable, many occupants of large Mayfair houses decided to move away. Mr Erdman matched demand with supply by obtaining temporary licenses from the Greater London Council to use the houses as offices (some of which have recently reverted to residential use). The 1974 property crash was 'no comparison at all' with the current downturn, according to Mr Erdman. As one of the seven specialists who sat on the Treasury's property advisory panel in 1974, he thought that the problems were manageable. 'As rents were reasonable and there was not a huge oversupply of new buildings, all that was necessary was to ensure that people did not rush into forced sales'. By contrast, Mr Erdman is damning about the current state of the market. 'In the 1980s everything went mad. Rents and capital values rocketed. Without wearing glasses, anyone could see that the market was overheated. Younger and younger people were coming into the business and they got the idea that things keep going up and don't go down.' 'I have been through three recessions,' he concludes. This one is the worst because too much money was lent without caution.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Neubrandenburg -- A convoy of 60 armored personnel  carriers for UN troops in Bosnia has departed from  Neubrandenburg for Zagreb today. The vehicles from the stocks  of the former National People's Army were refitted in  Neubrandenburg (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). A second convoy  is to follow on Friday [15 April] so that over 169 armored  personnel carriers and two armored recovery vehicles will be at  UN disposal. According to those who reequipped the vehicles,  they will be used by the United Nations on a loan basis. The  United Nations is responsible for the maintenance and must  return the vehicles if they are not destroyed.</p>

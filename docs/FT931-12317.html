			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: IRI dismisses board of Iritecna subsidiary IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday dismissed the board of Iritecna, its lossmaking civil engineering subsidiary and Europe's second-largest general contracting group, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The new board is to be headed by Mr Franco Bonelli, a commercial law expert and former visiting professor at Stanford. The chief executive will be Mr Roberto Gianini, an MIT-educated engineer MIT with extensive experience in both the state and private sectors. Last week, IRI took similar action with Ilva, its troubled steel group. This latest move underlines the determination of Mr Michele Tedeschi, IRI's chief executive, to take radical steps to reduce mounting losses against the background of the government's privatisation plans. The board shake-up has also highlighted the problems faced by IRI when, a year ago, Iritecna become the vehicle for merging IRI's civil engineering, construction and industrial plant enterprises, held by Italstat and Italimpianti. Final 1992 figures have yet to be announced, but losses are understood to be around L1,500bn (Dollars 1.01bn) on turnover of L6,000bn.</p>

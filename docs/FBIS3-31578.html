The  declaration reads as follows:    Romania's Government with satisfaction took note of and  hails  the decision of the Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw heavy  weapons from the Sarajevo area, as well as the decision that the  Muslims will turn in certain pieces of heavy artillery. This  decision will prevent the risk of expansion of military actions  and will make a contribution to actions aimed at defusing the  situation in the Sarajevo area.    Reasserting complete support for a political settlement of  the conflict and noting that under the current circumstances a  possible military intervention might have unforeseeable  consequences and even consequences that are opposite to the  proposed goals, the Romanian Government expresses hope that the  favorable moment that has been created will mark the beginning  of actions aimed at finding durable solutions both in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the rest of the territory of the former  Yugoslavia.    In conclusion it is also mentioned that, as far as it is  concerned, the Romanian Government continues to express its  willingness to contribute to actions of finding political  solutions to the conflict together with the other countries  neighboring the former Yugoslavia and with other interested  countries.    The news conference continued with the spokesman summing up  the major issues discussed today during the meeting of the  executive.    The minister of agriculture, Ioan Oancea, read a report on  the stage of agricultural works and stressed that the soil  fertilization is taking place at a very slow pace because of the  lack of funds. However, the situation is about to improve,  through the implementation of a recent government decision.    In the same context, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu called  for the expansion of control over the implementation of the  government norms and over the application of reform in various  economic sectors.    Also during the government meeting, Minister of State Mircea  Cosea, president of the Coordination, Strategy, and Economic  Reform Council, briefed those present about the stage of the  discussions regarding the actions that have been taken in the  privatization acceleration process. Mr. Mircea Cosea insisted  on the need to ensure a uniform coordination of privatization  policies of various bodies in charge of various sectors in this  area. The norms currently valid in connection with reform and  certain norms that are in the middle of a finalization process  have been reviewed, namely, a draft decision regarding the  organization and functioning of the secondary market for  property certificates, another draft decision regarding methods  to sell bonds, and the draft law on accelerating the  privatization process.    Likewise, it was noted that there are plans to reorganize  the  National Agency for Privatization.    At the same time, proposals were made to modify certain  existing norms, respectively law No. 15 regarding the legal  status of commercial companies and their responsibility. State  Minister Mircea Cosea mentioned that a first action to speed up  privatization will be to make a public offer, that is to sell  bonds from six commercial companies, out of the 63 that will be  privatized in April-May 1994.    Further, Mr. Mircea Cosea presented the projects for the  future development of small and medium-sized enterprises,  informing the executive that the Romanian Fund for Guaranteeing  Credits for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise, in which the  Romanian state has a share of 98 percent, started operating. He  also informed the executive that the Balkan Center for Small and  Medium-Sized Enterprises has been set up in Bucharest.    Also during the meeting that the cabinet held today, the  draft decision to increase the salary fund, exempt from  additional tax, has been adopted, as a result of the increase of  economic efficiency of the activity carried out by commercial  companies whose majority shares belong to the state and  autonomous public corporations. He also noted that, as a result  of discussions with trade unions, the basis for calculating  salary increase according to other economic indicators, remains  open.</p>

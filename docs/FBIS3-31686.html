			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Zbigniew Maria Wlosowicz, Poland's </F> permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, by  Sylwester Walczak; place and date not given: "Poland Supports  Idea of Establishing a UN Army; Painful Burden of Bosnia and  Herzegovina Drama"]    [Excerpts] [Walczak] What is your assessment of the  results achieved by the first part of the 48th Session of the UN  Assembly? What were the most important decisions that were made?    [Wlosowicz] If it were not for the painful burden of the  drama of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the current session could be  regarded as peaceful. An atmosphere of cooperation prevailed,  even though a lot of emotions were stirred up by the  negotiations on establishing the post of a high commissioner for  human rights. There was even a point when reaching compromise  on this controversial issue seemed impossible. And yet  agreement was reached, which is another proof of ideological  differences being less and less of an obstacle in the UN's  functioning. Initiating a debate on reforms of the Security  Council was another significant part of the session--for the  first time, a general debate on the issue took place.    A unanimous lifting of economic sanctions against South  Africa, with the hope of a permanent breaking with the apartheid  phenomenon--that was a historical event.    From Poland's perspective, what is important is the fact  that  the concept of "countries of economies in a transitional period"  obtained recognition in the UN vocabulary. We have initiated  the idea. Until recently, Poland was classified as a developed  country. That was perhaps nice but it was also impractical  because it placed the country beyond the scope of assistance  programs from which developing countries benefit. The  recognition by the UN of the existence of a group of countries  with economies in a transitional period, creates a much more  advantageous situation for us. [passage omitted]    [Walczak] What is the fate of the initiative to establish a  UN Center for Human Rights in East and Central Europe, which  would be headquartered in Warsaw?    [Wlosowicz] The initiative was submitted by [former] Foreign  Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski during a general debate in  October of last year. The Foreign Ministry is working on coming  up with a specific formula for the planned center, which could  then be proposed to the international community. [passage  omitted]    [Walczak] Some proposals have emerged that aimed at  extending the list of the Security Council's permanent members,  to also include Germany and Japan. Is there anyone to oppose  that? Who are the other candidates?    [Wlosowicz] Indeed, even though the concerned countries  themselves are acting with restraint, there are ever more views  being raised to the effect that Germany and Japan, due to their  political and economic positions, should be included in the  Security Council as its permanent members. Practically  speaking, no one is putting that in question anymore, and a  consensus on that issue is emerging.    Yet the opening up of the Security Council to new members  gives rise to another problem: Who else should be included?  All regions would like to see their representatives as the  Security Council's permanent members. Separate from that,  proposals are being voiced to extend the Security Council to the  level of 20-25 members. Poland does not oppose changes,  generally speaking, but its view is that the interest of the  countries of East and Central Europe should also be taken into  account in the process of restructuring the Security Council.  Debate on this issue is just beginning, and no one actually has  a rigid position on it. [passage omitted]    [Walczak] What is your position on the proposal to  establish a 10,000-strong UN army? The initiative was submitted  by a commission set up by the U.S. Congress, whose goal is to  examine possible ways of reforming the UN. Is the proposal  realistic? Perhaps what would be more realistic is the  establishment by the individual countries of special units of  rapid deployment that would be ready for action immediately once  a signal from the UN came in. What is Poland's position on that  issue?    [Wlosowicz] Poland supports the idea of establishing forces  that would be at the disposal of the secretary general. The  shape these forces will take and the way they will function are  the subject of proceedings of a team that has been established  especially for that purpose and that also includes a Polish  staff military officer. Eighty countries, including Poland,  expressed their readiness to form units to participate in such  forces. Right now, the biggest problem is not so much a lack of  volunteers to participate in permanent UN forces as reservations  being made by many countries concerning the secretary general's  discretion applied in each case regarding whether the countries'  units should be deployed. That could place a serious limitation  on the efficiency of future permanent UN forces. On the other  hand, the countries' concern for their own troops is  understandable.    [Walczak] Is a change of the peacekeeping operations'  formula possible without close participation by the United  States? As is well known, the Americans do not participate in  operations by the "Blue Helmets" because they follow the rule  that U.S. soldiers cannot serve under a foreign commander (the  U.S. troops in Somalia act outside of the structure of UN  forces). During his speech at the General Assembly, President  Bill Clinton stated that future peacekeeping operations will  have to meet some strictly defined criteria in order for the  Americans to participate in them. Doesn't that mean that the  United States is unwilling to take part in peacekeeping  operations?    [Wlosowicz] We are witnessing increased involvement by the  United States not only in direct participation but also in an  active formulation of a new concept of "peacekeeping." This  process was initiated as early as during the last period of the  previous [U.S.] administration. Right now, we are witnessing  many U.S. initiatives, including informal ones, like the  "contact group for peacekeeping operations," which discussed  some practical aspects of those initiatives.    We should keep in mind that the United States will always be  interested in peacekeeping operations. That is because  practically one-third of the expenditures associated with each  of those operations comes from U.S. taxpayers. Therefore,  President Clinton's statement should be perceived mainly as an  expression of concern about the operations' goal and  effectiveness, and only secondarily as a need by the UN to  fulfill formal requirements enabling U.S. troops to participate  in peacekeeping operations.    [Walczak] The permanent representation you have been in  charge of for a year now is famous for its significant political  and cultural activity, also beyond the UN. How do you manage to  take care of all of the ingredients of this responsible job?    [Wlosowicz] I perceive my mission in very broad terms, and  that is also the way I perform it. We must keep in mind that we  continue to be at the stage of creating a new image of Poland  abroad. So I use every possible opportunity to contribute to  that goal. The UN is firmly placed in the realities of U.S.  political, economic, and cultural life, and that is why I  frequently take part in other forums. Apart form that, the  United States is also a country with a huge and influential  group of people of Polish origin. There is never too much  contact with them.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Supreme Soviet Press-Center report from the "Official </F> Chronicle" column]    [Text] A session of the Constitutional Commission headed by  chairman of the commission President of the Republic of Armenia  Levon Ter-Petrosyan was held on 20 April.    After a general review of additional proposals, the  commission completed work on changes and additions to the draft  of the Constitution based on proposals from the working group  which had reviewed and studied international experience in this  area.    As a result of the work accomplished, there has been  considerable improvement in the document with regard to  international law, the provisions on basic rights of citizens  and the definition of the principle of separation of  legislative, executive and judicial powers. The flexible  principle of state administration which has been developed will  allow the state to avoid possible internal political crises and  to eliminate anarchy in the republic as a whole as well as in  its individual rayons. The formulations and definitions of many  of the articles have also been revised.    The revised and amended draft Constitution will be published  in the press.</p>

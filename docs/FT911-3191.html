			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Strong demand pushes gilt auction to success THE Bank of England's first gilt auction in nearly three years was hailed as a resounding success yesterday. The full amount of Pounds 1.2bn of 10 per cent Conversion stock 1996 was gobbled up by the market amid signs of strong demand for the stock. The Bank of England received bids of Pounds 5.375bn for a total of Pounds 1.2bn in stock, so the issue was covered 4.45 times. The highest accepted bid was Pounds 98 21/32 , corresponding to a yield of 10.32 per cent, while the lowest accepted bid was for Pounds 98 17/32 , corresponding to a yield of 10.35 per cent. The rounded average accepted price was Pounds 98 9/16 , corresponding to a yield of 10.34 per cent. Traders said the short 'tail' and the high cover were signs that the auction was a roaring success. The tail - which is the difference between the average yield and the yield corresponding to the lowest price - was only one basis point. The Bank of England said bids at the lowest accepted price were allotted 46.5 per cent of the amount for which they applied. The when-issued stock opened at Pounds 48 5/8 , only a couple of ticks above the average bid price when bidding took place, and was trading at Pounds 48 3/4 by late morning, equivalent to a fully paid-up price of Pounds 98 3/4 . Demand came mainly from domestic buyers, traders said. The Bank of England is expected to hold a further two or three auctions this year. Otherwise, the gilts market drifted up during the day, but volumes were low. German bund prices edged up in the morning but slipped back again later. A statement from Bundesbank board member Mr Otmar Issing, quoted in a German magazine, did little to reassure the market. Mr Issing said the Bundesbank would do everything it could to keep the D-Mark stable, but recognised that the impact of foreign exchange intervention was limited. Yesterday's auction of Japanese Government Bonds was well received, dealers said. The auction was for Y800bn of the No 140 ten-year bond with a coupon of 6.6 per cent. The average price was 100.38, corresponding to a yield of 6.537 per cent while the lowest accepted bid was for 100.30, corresponding to a yield of 6.55 per cent. The short tail was seen as a sign of strong retail demand, traders said. Otherwise, prices in the market slipped during the day with the yield on the benchmark No 129 bond moving from 6.7 per cent in the morning to close at 6.74 per cent. US government bond prices firmed in late trading yesterday following a successful auction of two-year notes and some weak car sales figures from US manufacturers. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was up  19/32 at 96 3/16 , to yield 8.212 per cent, while the two year note was up  1/8 at 100 9/32 , carrying a yield of 6.946 per cent. Although there were some worries over the market's ability to absorb the additional supply in the two-year note auction, the sale passed off smoothly. The market was also buoyed by the mid-April car sales figures from the country's big makers. Analysts were looking for the figures to show annual sales running at 6m cars, up from 5.6m in early April, and based on initial reports from General Motors and Ford, sales in the period were below that.</p>

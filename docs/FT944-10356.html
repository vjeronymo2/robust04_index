			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Flag law angers Hungarians Ethnic Hungarians in Romania yesterday criticised a new law which provides for up to three years' jail for those flying foreign flags or singing foreign anthems in the ethnically mixed Balkan state. MPs from the ethnic Hungarian party said the provision, passed by parliament on Wednesday, was anti-democratic and violated European ethnic rights agreements. They said they would appeal to the country's constitutional court and to the Council of Europe. Parliament's decision is the latest sign of the growing influence of nationalist politicians who formally joined the left-wing minority government in August. It comes as the Senate, the upper house, is preparing a bill which would require foreigners to register with the police within 48 hours of arriving in Romania. It would also empower the interior ministry to restrict foreigners' movements on grounds such as national security and 'public morale'.</p>

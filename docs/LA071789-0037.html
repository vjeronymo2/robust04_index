			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. ACTS TO CURB MISSILES  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has decided to ban the sale to India of a sophisticated  missile-testing device and has expressed concern to France about reports of an  offer to sell advanced rocket technology to Brazil, U.S. officials said. The  two steps reflect a toughening U.S. stand on the sale of sophisticated  technology and know-how to Third World nations seeking to develop their own  ballistic missiles. A license for the sale to India of a $1.2-million system  used to put re-entry vehicles under simulated stress has been under debate for  some time. The French-led consortium Arianespace reportedly has offered missile  technology to Brazil if the Brazilians agree to use the Ariane rocket for two  new communications satellites.  </P></p>

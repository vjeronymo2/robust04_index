			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>   [Text] Ethiopia threatens to expel and detain thousands of  the Falash-Mura who are crowding the Israeli Embassy in Addis  Abeba. The official in charge of emigration in Ethiopia  anticipates that the continued transfer to Israel of those  claiming to be Falash-Mura will result in an incident between  the two countries and in a political crisis in Ethiopia. These  details are included in telegrams which were sent to Israel this  week from the embassy in Ethiopia and which reached our  political correspondent Gadi Sukenik, as follows:    A few days ago Uri Noy, Israel's ambassador in Ethiopia, was  sent to a closed meeting with the inspector general of  Ethiopia's police who is also responsible for prisons and  emigration from that country. At the meeting our ambassador  asked that the number of Falash-Mura who want to unite with  their Jewish brethren in Israel be increased from 80 to 200 per  month. The ambassador also asked that the mechanism for sorting  them out in the capital, Addis Ababa, and in Ethiopia's northern  districts be expanded, at a time when thousands of Falash-Mura  are already knocking on the Addis Ababa embassy's doors and  rumors lead many others to flow into the capital from the north.    Reports about the meeting which reached Jerusalem and us  indicate that (Hasan Shifa'), a senior Ethiopian official,  believes this is a very sensitive issue which may, and I quote,  harm Ethiopian integration and cause his country to  disintegrate. He claims that such organized emigration runs  counter to his government's policy and will turn northern  Ethiopia into another Israeli district. If this issue becomes  the focus of interest, it will explode due to its sensitivity.  In his opinion, the transfer of Jews from Ethiopia to Israel is  over, and the decision on family reunions is erroneous and will  culminate in a disaster. The official in charge of emigration  told Israel's ambassador that by Israel's criteria, all northern  Ethiopia residents, including even himself, are entitled to  immigrate to Israel. In short, the Ethiopians turned down all  the ambassador's requests. In another telegram to Jerusalem,  Uri Noy recommended that the smaller quota of immigration remain  and that very low-profile treatment be accorded those awaiting  immigration outside the capital.    [Later in the newsreel Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir  Tzaban reacts to the above report, saying that "the sensational  preoccupation with the Falash-Mura problem makes it very  difficult for the government to implement its decision to bring  them to Israel as part of its family reunion plan. Those who do  not respect the Ethiopian Government's sensitivity about this  complex affair may foil the humanitarian solution of this  problem."]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Jan (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has  stated that U.S. President Bill Clinton now knows and  understands better Syria's position and its unquestionable right  to regain its legitimate rights and the entire Golan Heights.  When this materializes, the road to a fair and permanent peace  will be open wide. In a commentary in Tuesday's edition, the  paper says the meeting between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad  and U.S. President Clinton clearly showed that the Syrian  president conceals nothing and candidly declares his country's  readiness to respond positively to everything Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin demands in return for ending the  occupation of the Golan Heights.    AL-AKHBAR stated that every sign affirms that the  Syrian-U.S.  summit was successful by any standard and achieved in one day  what 10 rounds of Syrian-Israeli talks failed to achieve. The  paper notes President Clinton's complete understanding of the  Syrian position and of President al-Asad's stance, despite  Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's attempt to portray the talks as a  lucrative deal for Syria [words indistinct].</p>

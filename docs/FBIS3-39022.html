			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Philippe Marcovici editorial] </F>   [Text] Perhaps.... Perhaps the 68 victims of the  indiscriminate shell that crashed into a Sarajevo market on  Saturday [5 February] did not die in vain. France, at least,  has done everything in its power to ensure that this bloody  absurdity does not happen again.    By threatening to withdraw its UN troops from Bosnia, Paris  has literally backed NATO up against the wall. NATO cannot  withdraw any further and the Americans, who are its spearhead  and its main strength, have had to stop hesitating and humming  and hawing in order to come into line with the "French fury"  suddenly revealed by Alain Juppe on TV Tuesday evening. The  foreign minister has taken up the harsh saying used by French  soldiers in Sarajevo: "Either we shoot or we get out." After  warning our allies on Monday and Tuesday, neither the United  States nor NATO could agree to let the French "get out," since  people are not exactly lining up to take over.    Alain Juppe, who was personally shocked by Saturday's  massacre, has certainly been sensitive to the indignation of  public opinion, which itself has been shocked by the unbearable  images shown on TV. This is a public opinion that clearly no  longer understands how the safety of the UN troops in Sarajevo  can serve as an excuse for a policy of non-intervention.    By bringing pressure to bear on the allies, the French  foreign minister, in total agreement with the French president  and prime minister, is aware of the risks being run -- both  those run by the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldiers in  Bosnia, and the risk that both the attempt or any action may  result in a failure. That is what is called a calculated risk,  and even if mentioning such a risk might seem uncalled-for in  the tragic context of Bosnia, the French Government should  benefit politically from it.    This is all the more true since, for the time being, French  firmness seems to be bearing its first fruits: both in  Brussels, where the NATO Council ambassadors met yesterday, and  on the ground, where Serbs and Muslims yesterday signed an  agreement on the withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons to keep them  out of reach of Sarajevo and the placing of Muslim heavy weapons  under supervision. Of course, this agreement -- which in itself  is merely the application of UN Security Council resolution 820  passed on 18 April 1993, must be considered with the utmost  caution. So many others that have preceded it have gone  unheeded! All we can do is hope that this time reason will win  the day and make it possible to curb the dangerous escalation  represented by the destruction of these weapons with air  strikes. This would be merely adding more war to the war.    Yet, the very mention of reason in Bosnia is already an  aberration, given the madness that was unleashed there almost  two years ago now.</p>

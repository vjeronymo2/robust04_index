			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Slow to catch on to their potential uses - Derivatives The recent expansion of derivatives trading has yet to feed fully into the fund management industry. International fund managers have been slower to catch on to the potential uses of derivative instruments than the treasurers of large international companies, most of whom actively use swaps and options to manage their exposure. Fund managers now account for a relatively small portion of the Dollars 140,000bn-worth of futures contracts traded annually on the world's exchanges, and an even smaller portion of the notional Dollars 4,500bn outstanding in the over-the-counter (OTC) swaps market. (The OTC market consists of specially tailored, bi-lateral agreements between two counterparties, rather than contracts traded on and cleared on exchanges). A gradual evolution is in progress, but most fund managers remain extremely cautious, even sceptical. However, many of them have woken up to the advantages of using derivative instruments for asset allocation. Because futures contracts traded on exchanges are more liquid than their underlying cash markets, fund managers often buy, particularly, stock index futures, when they have decided they like a particular market but are not yet sure which stocks they wish to buy. Many fund managers go no further. Some are concerned at the lack of liquidity of some OTC instruments. Most fund managers mark their positions to market on a daily basis, but it may be difficult to realise that profit by selling on the option, because of the market's illiquidity. The difficulties involved in performance measurement can prove a deterrent. And some trustees still do not allow institutions to use derivatives. 'It would be much easier if we could use derivatives across the board, but we can't,' says one manager. These difficulties are exacerbated by a lack of familiarity with these instruments. It is widely accepted that the US fund management industry is at least a few years ahead of Europe in this area. Often, the institutions most sophisticated in using derivatives have appointed a specialist head of derivatives, and/or employed staff with a background in derivative markets. One such is Mr Rob Gambi, head of fixed interest and currencies at AMP Asset Management, the UK-based fund management group owned by the Australian insurance company. The complexities of options pricing hold no mystery for Mr Gambi, a former derivatives specialist at a bank who used to price options for a living. For him, derivatives are 'multi-dimensional', allowing more complex views to be expressed. When an investor buys bonds or shares, he takes the view that they are going to go up. With derivatives, he can take the view that they are going to go down - and within a certain period of time. There are a number of ways, other than straightforward asset allocation, in which some fund managers are using derivatives. WRITING OPTIONS: If a fund manager has an overweight position in a particular market, and thinks he may already have caught most of the rally, he may decide to write call options against that position. This is called covered call writing. It is common among UK fund managers, who frequently write options against their UK equity portfolios. Writing, or selling, options earns additional revenue, thereby enhancing returns, but if the fund manager does not already hold the underlying securities it can be a dangerous game. HEDGING: If a fund manager expects a market to rally, without being certain when, derivatives can be used for protection. If a bond fund manager is underweight in US Treasuries and overweight in European bonds, because he is bullish on the European market but concerned that European bonds will under-perform in the next three months, he can hedge by buying options on the spread between the two markets. The more specific the hedge, the cheaper it is to buy - you are only paying for what you get. So knock-out options - which expire if the price of the underlying security falls below a certain level - have been popular. RISK ENHANCEMENT: Derivatives can be used to adjust risk in ways which are not possible in the cash market, and which may involve taking on new risk, but will pay off in several different scenarios. 'Nine times out of 10, forward contracts are the best instruments for currency hedging. Options are more complicated and less liquid,' says Mr Andrew Maclaren, assistant director at UBS Asset Management in London. Mr Gambi says he is more likely to use derivatives for bonds than for currencies: 'Let's say I'm fully invested in global bonds, but I want dollar not D-mark exposure: I can hedge forward my D-marks into dollars. That is what I would call hard exposure - you make money all the way up and lose money all the way down.'</p>

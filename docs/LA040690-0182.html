			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LAFOLLETTE AIDE WINS BALLOT TIFF  </P> <P> A Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled today that state Assembly candidate  Robert G. Wilcox can describe himself as an "assembly member's legislative  representative" on the June ballot.  </P> <P> Wilcox's ballot designation was disputed by an opponent, Paula Boland, who  filed suit Thursday to force state election officials to reject the phrase as  an overstatement of Wilcox's credentials.  </P> <P> But Judge Michael J. Virga denied Boland's request that he order the Secretary  of State's office to reject Wilcox's ballot identification. Virga ruled that  the description was not misleading.  </P> <P> Wilcox, a former field representative for retiring Assemblywoman Marian W. La  Follette (R-Northridge), is on leave from his post as executive director of a  La Follette task force on breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School District.  Wilcox and Boland are seeking the Republican nomination for La Follette's seat  in the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> Boland contended in court documents that Wilcox's ballot description "falsely  creates the impression that Mr. Wilcox has a higher, more responsible position  than his actual status" and implies that he "has some form of incumbency  status." The judge was not persuaded.  </P> <P> Wilcox has maintained that the description accurately characterizes his past  duties for La Follette. He chose the identification after abandoning an earlier  phrase, "Assembly executive director," which state officials last month  challenged him to substantiate.  </P></p>

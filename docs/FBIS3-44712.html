Chen Minzhang, the Minister of Public Health, stressed on  Wednesday in Beijing that provincial governments should further  increase their budgets for endemic disease control and people  from all walks of life must be persuaded to join the national  campaign against endemic illnesses.    Endemic diseases--including snail fever, iodine deficiency  diseases (IDD), the plague, and endemic fluoresces--have been  reported in 2,413 counties, or 85 percent of the counties in  China.    Chen made the remarks at the founding of the Endemic  Diseases  Society of China.    The society is a nongovernmental organization composed of  specialists in endemic illnesses and volunteers from different  State departments, institutes and industrial enterprises.    The society was founded to help spread State policies and  regulations on endemic diseases control and launch publicity  campaigns.    It will also organize academic exchanges to introduce new  techniques on prevention and cure of the illnesses to  grass-roots health workers.    The minister said he hoped a national endemic disease  control  network will be established as a result of the work of the  society.    Snail fever, or schistosomiasis, a parasitic illness  eliminated in the early 1950's, reappeared in the early 1980s.    Currently, endemic snail fever is rampant in 381 counties in  the country.    More than 3.6 billion square meters of land in China's lake  and mountain regions are still infested with snails putting 40  million people in danger.    The most serious epidemic cases are in rural areas and in  poor counties.    In 1991, the disease was found in 1,212 counties, accounting  for 43 percent of the country's total. About 300 million people  are threatened, 26 percent of the total population.    There are 43 million dental fluoresces patients and 1.6  million skeletal fluorosis victims.    IDD, like endemic flouride poisoning, is prevalent in all  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except  Shanghai.    IDD has become one of the major factors affecting the mental  development of Chinese children.    On the same day, a deputy provincial governor of Shanxi  Province said the provincial government has decided to allocate  an additional 1 million yuan (about $175,000) annually starting  this year for endemic disease control in the province.    The regular budget for the work in Shanxi, one of the  provinces in China that has a major problem with endemic  diseases, is 1.4 million yuan about ($245,000) each year.    The province has five kinds of endemic diseases in 107  counties and prefectures, 81 per cent of the province's total.    Some 3.4 million of the residents, or 12 percent of the  province's total population, suffer from the various illnesses.    Zhang Weiqing, the deputy provincial governor, said the  provincial government is to loan some 3 million yuan (about  $526,000) each year to help develop health-related industrial  enterprises.    The province is to subsidize scientific research institutes  by as much as 500,000 yuan (about $87,000) each year for  carrying out research in the field. Researchers who achieve  outstanding results will be rewarded.</p>

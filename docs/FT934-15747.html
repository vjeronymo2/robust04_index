			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Chased by the Revenue ON THE death of my parents in 1987, the small family company was put into liquidation. The Inland Revenue has requested the final accounts, as it knows there were substantial funds in the kitty which have not shown up on my tax returns. The liquidators have been contacted many times, with no positive results. With the Revenue breathing quite heavily down my neck, I was wondering if there is an organisation which would stir the chartered accountants out of their apparent apathy. If you believe the advisers are acting too slowly, you might wish to contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Chartered Accountants' Hall, Moorgate Place, London, EC2P 2BS, setting out the facts and asking for advice on how to proceed. We assume you have informed the Inland Revenue of the situation? This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

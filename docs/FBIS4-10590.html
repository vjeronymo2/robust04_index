			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado] </F>   [Text] Brazil has changed the course of its foreign policy:  It will begin expanding its actions in South America for the  purpose of increasing its economic base in the region and  overcoming the phase of excessive concentration of diplomatic  operations in Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Paraguay, and  Uruguay).    In 90 days, the Brazilian Government expects to begin  simultaneous negotiations over bilateral free trade agreements  with eight South American countries. The goal is to consolidate,  as of 1995 and over a 10-year period, a regional market in which  80 percent of trade will be made with zero tariffs.    Negotiations have a very broad scope and, for this reason,  the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has decided to set no rigid  limits on the talks with the other South American governments, a  Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    The decision already has been made. As has happened in  Brazilian foreign policy over the past few decades, the decision  seeks to extend beyond the terms of the Franco administration,  which designed it. Itamaraty already has included this decision  in the "permanent principles" that are always mentioned by  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim.    From a strategic viewpoint, it means that South America's  biggest nation now will engage in broad negotiations to  integrate the Amazonas (to the north) and the River Plate (to  the south) basins.    The objective is to create a regional free market that will  be, nonetheless, open to promoting relations with the emerging  political-economic blocs in North America, Europe, and Asia.    The representatives of the South American governments  involved in those negotiations regard this Brazilian diplomatic  initiative as a legitimate effort to recover the political  influence the country had in the region until the early 1980's.    Furthermore, it is also regarded as sort of a countermeasure  for the action the United States began undertaking in South  America after Mexico joined NAFTA.    The U.S. action seeks to reach, in the medium term, the  largest possible number of bilateral free trade agreements in  Latin America. This obviously interferes with the interests of  Brazil, the region's main exporter and largest market.    The two other major emerging Latin American markets are  confronting political and socioeconomic problems that cast  doubts on the future expansion of their economies: The Mexican  risk increased after the Chiapas revolt, while Argentina is  facing social upheavals in specific areas and increasing  commercial deficits.    This situation, which is dominated by the U.S. need to  expand  its business base in the Southern Hemisphere to assure its  future world leadership, might be leading Washington to adopt a  new political position toward Brazil.    The appearance of irritation in the economic competition  with  Europe and Japan already had led the United States to modify the  foundations of its foreign policy, Brazilian diplomats said.  Now, since Mexico joined NAFTA, Washington has decided to  emphasize its actions in South America.    The Clinton administration began to use diplomacy as a lever  to open markets for U.S. exporters. Until a short time ago, the  U.S. State Department would only preach free trade, allowing  exporters to operate naturally and independently.    "During the Cold War, the U.S. Government did not need to  engage very directly in the battle for the opening of markets in  support of U.S. products because this was done indirectly and  domestically through subsidies to local industries,  technological projects, and the national defense budget. But the  international arena has changed," a Brazilian ambassador and top  Itamaraty member said.    He added: "Now they are engaged in a real diplomacy of  commerce, of business. It is something similar to what Japan and  Europe are doing, though with different intensity."    Based on such prospects, the Brazilian Government decided to  intensify its efforts around its plan for the creation of what  the diplomatic bureaucracy has called the South American Free  Trade Zone.    In addition to a relative competition with the United States  for political influence in the region, there might be very  specific economic reasons that justify this Brazilian endeavor.    One of those reasons is that Brazil's participation in the  commercial flow within Mercosur [Common Market of the South] has  almost reached a saturation level: Brazil already supplies 25  percent of the total imports bought by Argentina, Paraguay, and  Uruguay.    Brazil's current participation in the trade operations of  the  rest of South America (that is, outside the Southern Cone) is  five times smaller. This group of countries is spending $36  billion annually in imports bought from the rest of the world.    In the eyes of the Brazilian Government, this is a very  promising market for Brazilian products. It has enough  possibilities for making current Brazilian commercial operations  grow at least four times as much.    In other words, it has the potential for becoming something  as important as Mercosur is now for the Brazilian economy after  a decade of negotiations. That is, the creation of a free trade  zone in South America has become a priority for Brazilian  foreign policy.</p>

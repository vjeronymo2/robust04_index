			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. PESC/94/57: "Statement of the </F> Presidency of the European Union on Mostar"]    [Text] The Council approved the Memorandum of  Understanding of the EU administration of Mostar which had been  negotiated and initialled in Brussels on 8-9 June 1994 with  Croat and Bosniac delegations from Mostar. The Council welcomed  the considerable efforts which the two parties from Mostar had  made and which showed their willingness to make further progress  towards mutual reconciliation. This Memorandum of Understanding,  when signed by all parties, will be the decisive step towards  the early establishment of the EU administration.    The Council calls on the parties from Bosnia-Hercegovina to  approve the Memorandum of Understanding on their side as soon as  possible, thus opening the way for signature. It hopes that this  will take place very soon. In making this major contribution to  the restoration of peace and stability in an important town  which has been the centre of much fighting and misery, the  European Union recalls that success will only be assured if all  concerned in Mostar and the region cooperate fully. It hopes  that the restoration of cooperation between the communities in  Mostar will be a model for other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

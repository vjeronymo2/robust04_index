			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 18, IRNA -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani opened ceremonies marking the Army Day at  Tehran's Azadi Square Monday morning.    Addressing the participants, the president condemned the  indifferent attitude that international bodies have adopted  against crimes in the besieged Muslim town of Gorazde and  stressed that the world was not seeking to defend the truth.    Those international organizations, he added, are seeking  their own interests as they did in the course of the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait in which they intervened.    He congratulated the army personnel on the occasion and  expressed hope that while the army is preserving its combat  power it will also take part in the reconstruction effort.    Various units of the army later paraded before the president  while the airborne parachute units performed operations and the  aircraft flew in formation.    The army combat and cargo planes as well as helicopters  performed operations during the ceremonies.    Also present at the ceremomies were Chief of Staff of Armed  Forces Brigadier General Hasan Firuzabadi, Army Chief of Staff  Major General 'Ali Shahbazi and a number of other senior army  officials.</p>

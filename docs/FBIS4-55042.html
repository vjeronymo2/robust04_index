			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak  on 3 May on page 10, under the headline "New `Lessons From the  Crisis-Ridden Development,'" carries a 4,500-word paper signed  by Augustin Marian Huska, deputy chairman of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), which analyzes the "ten most serious  mistakes" in the HZDS's activity. The text is preceded by an  introductory passage, which notes: "Materials of unclear and  even dubious origin appear on our editorial desk from time to  time. The one that we submit to you today carries the  type-written signature of A.M. Huska, the architect of HZDS  ideology. The style and ideas really indicate his authorship, or  the authorship of someone who is his brilliant imitator."    In the text itself, the author identifies the following "ten  most serious mistakes" in the HZDS's activity -- underestimation  of the influence of foreign interests in Slovakia; insufficient  personnel work; priority given to "tactical improvisation over  strategic concepts"; failure to tap the intellectual potential  of the so-called HZDS professional clubs; complacency of the  HZDS apparatus; failure to show that HZDS policies "follow up on  the spiritual and cultural traditions of the nation";  ineffective cooperation with academics and researchers; lack of  team work; failure to activate the young generation; and poor  cooperation with the media.    Speaking about the first point, the author says: "The  complex  geopolitical situation and the power vacuum in Central Europe  have activated neighboring countries and the centers of world  influence to assert their selfish interests. The manipulatory  circles became active particularly when they discovered that  Meciar's government wanted to consistently protect Slovak state  interests. A power struggle is at play, designed to secure the  dominance of foreign interests in the republic and testing  citizens' resilience to this influence. The aim of these  foreign interests is a weak government (that is, one that is  `cooperative' and ready for `compromise'). It is necessary to  get to know the foreign interests' lines of force and find  abroad allies for preserving Slovakia's sovereignty. It is  necessary to make use of the contradictory nature of foreign  interests in order to mutually neutralize them. It is necessary  to systematically explain the danger arising from domestic  circles' links with these foreign interests. It is necessary to  expose the opportunistic two-facedness of domestic political  forces that profit in a parasitical way from the identity  between their own and foreign interests. It is necessary to  launch extensive propaganda so that the state interests of  Slovakia become the framework for assessing the legitimacy of  all other interests operating here."    In Huska's opinion, the "foreign forces" make use of the  doctrine of "cosmopolitism" as an "instrument to enforce their  own dominance" and promote the "so-called civic society with the  aim of halting the process of emancipation in Slovakia."</p>

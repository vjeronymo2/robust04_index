			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- In statements made  over the past few days over the boat tragedy in Zhijiang's  Qiandao Lake, some politicians in Taibei [Taipei] have voiced  such words as "boycotting" mainland tours and investments,  "adjusting cross-strait exchange measures," and "suspending  cross-strait working level talks." Some even seized the  opportunity to advocate "Taiwan Independence." This phenomenon  has aroused concern on and outside the island.    In its 10 April editorial, Hong Kong's HSIN PAO said that  Taiwan officials' criticism of mainland over the Qiandao Lake  incident can be said to be unprecedented in recent years.  Whether the Taiwan authorities will slow down development of  cross-strait relations because of this incident is worth giving  thought.    Brief commentaries and column articles carried by the TAIWAN  WORLD FORUM [shi jie lun tan bao 0013 3954 6158 1086 1032] said:  As the Qiandao Lake boat tragedy is an isolated incident that  has unfortunately taken place, it should be analyzed objectively  and calmly so that its aftermath can best be dealt with and not  to push the incident toward a political confrontation between  the two sides of the strait. Its brief commentary pointed out:  Cross-strait peace will benefit both sides; although the  Qiandao Lake incident has grieved people, if it is to be viewed  from the perspective of the state and the nationality as a  whole, it virtually should not go to the extent of retrogressing  the cross-strait relations that only serves to sadden our own  people and gladden the enemy.    Some Hong Kong and Taiwan media also criticized certain  people on the island for capitalizing on the unfortunate  incident to advance advocation of "Taiwan Independence," an act  of self-deceiving "political morphine" that is doomed to fail.</p>

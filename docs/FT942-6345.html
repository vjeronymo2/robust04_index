			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: The ways of Confucius in business Sir, Charles Edwards (Letters, May 27) stresses the importance of a knowledge of the 'Analects of Confucius' in doing business in Taiwan. He speaks not just for Taiwan but for East Asia, a quarter of the globe. Maybe only a few scholars are word perfect in the Confucian classics. Everyone in East Asia inherently understands and follows the basic precepts of the Confucian Way. Anyone who tries to do business here without that understanding will probably fail. That Samuel Brittan ('Changing culture of capitalism', May 25) and other great western commentators deny this is another instance of how much further the west has still to go to understand the east.

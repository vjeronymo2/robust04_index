			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: SCORE THIS ONE AS A STRIKEOUT  </P> <P> Maybe it's simply that I no longer understand baseball. I used to; when I was a  kid, I seemed to know quite a bit about baseball. Maybe I've just gotten stupid  when it comes to baseball. That's the only logical explanation.  </P> <P> What brought this to mind was a newspaper story reporting that one Mark  Langston had become the highest-paid player in the history of baseball.  Langston, a left-handed pitcher, had signed a five-year contract with the  California Angels for $16 million. No other player has ever received a total  package of $16 million before.  </P> <P> The story was filled with dollar figures, and there was a nice quote from Mark  Langston's agent, and then finally -- in the next-to-last paragraph -- was the  one piece of information I had been looking for:  </P> <P> Langston's record last year was 16-14.  </P> <P> I thought that might be a typo. A pitcher has a season in which he wins 16  games and loses 14, and he becomes the highest-paid player in the history of  baseball?  </P> <P> I did some research. Mark Langston, the highest-paid player in the history of  baseball, has never had a season in which he won 20 games. The season before  last, Langston had a record of 15-11. Two years before that, he was 12-14. In  '85, he was 7-14. His career record is 86-76. The highest-paid player in the  history of baseball.  </P> <P> I called a friend whom I consider a true baseball expert. His name is Rob  Fleder; he is former articles editor for Sports Illustrated, and now is  executive editor of The National, the soon-to-debut sports daily. Basically  Fleder told me that, yes, I was stupid.  </P> <P> "This is a case where the records lie," Fleder said. "Mark Langston has played  most of his career for the Seattle Mariners, a terrible baseball team. You  can't judge Langston's skills by his won-loss record."  </P> <P> That seems to make sense -- at least a little sense. Certainly if Langston has  spent most of his career with a bad team, it figures that he might not have won  as many games as he might have with a good team. Still, though . . . a player  whose lifetime record is 86-76, a player coming off a 16-14 season, getting the  biggest contract in history?  </P> <P> "He's really pretty good," Fleder said.  </P> <P> I'm sure he is. Ted Williams was pretty good, too; many say he was the best  hitter who ever played baseball. In 1941, the year that Williams hit .406, he  was just coming off a contract that paid him $10,000 a year. That's not so  important, though -- $10,000 in 1941 meant something different. What is  important is what happened much later, in 1959. Williams, for the first time in  his baseball career, was having a bad year. For the first time ever, Williams  hit below .300. The Boston Red Sox, knowing how valuable he had been to the  team and the city, offered him a raise for the next year -- a salary of  $125,000, which would have been his highest salary ever. Williams turned it  down. He wanted less. He said he had not performed well, and he demanded a pay  cut. He got it. The Red Sox paid him $90,000.  </P> <P> Mark Langston (16-14), the highest-paid player in the history of baseball, will  make $3.2 million a year. "The thing you've got to remember," Rob Fleder said,  "is that Langston's timing was perfect."  </P> <P> Fleder was not referring to Langston's timing on the pitcher's mound. He was  referring to the fact that CBS television has just signed a $1.1-billion,  four-year deal to broadcast Major League baseball. This TV deal has made  baseball's owners incredibly wealthy before they sell a single ticket -- so  wealthy that they can afford to make Mark Langston (16-14, 86-76 lifetime) the  highest-paid player in the history of baseball.  </P> <P> "Then it really all comes down to Kim LeMasters, doesn't it?" I said.  </P> <P> "In a way, it does," Rob Fleder said.  </P> <P> Kim LeMasters is the CBS entertainment executive who resigned recently because  he had a bad streak of luck in choosing the shows on CBS' prime-time schedule.  Because of Kim LeMasters' losing streak, CBS has been finishing last in the  ratings. Because CBS has been finishing last, it needed a symbolic programming  stroke in an attempt to turn the network around. Because CBS needed the  symbolic programming stroke, it swallowed hard and paid $1.1 billion for the  rights to telecast baseball. Because it paid the $1.1 billion, the California  Angels could afford to hire Mark Langston.  </P> <P> Kim LeMasters may be temporarily out of work, but thanks to him Mark Langston  (16-14, 86-76 lifetime) is the highest-paid player in the history of baseball  -- a sport about which I am stupid. Was Ted Williams stupid, too?  </P></p>

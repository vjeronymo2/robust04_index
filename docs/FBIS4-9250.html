			<p>BFN     [Text] Hradec Kralove, East Bohemia April 20 (CTK) --  Czech Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde today described the  government coalition's ability to agree on the method for  elections to the Senate as a "test of its maturity."    At a press conference here today, Uhde (Civic Democratic  Party -- ODS) said that ODS deputies had voted for a  Constitution which embeds the creation of the Senate, the upper  chamber of the Czech parliament yet to be established.    "If the coalition agrees on a principle for the election law  to the Senate... the whole problem is over," Uhde said. Then it  would only be necessary to "find a suitable term for the  elections to take place -- 1995 or 1996."    From the outset, said Uhde, considerations were apparent  that, if the Senate were not created, Czechs would "get  accustomed to its absence." Uhde dislikes the idea of  abandoning the creation of a Senate simply because of the  failure to agree on an election method.    The government proposal of the election law to the  parliament's Chamber of Deputies and the Senate envisages the  creation of 81 constituencies, with one Senator being elected to  each of them. Premier Vaclav Klaus's ruling ODS is pushing for  this variant, but the other coalition partners -- the Civic  Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Christian  Democratic Party (KDS) -- oppose it.</p>

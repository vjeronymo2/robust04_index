The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

With respect to letters of credit constituting an acceptable form of margin, the following standards must be followed. First, in order to conform to the Uniform Commercial Code and to avoid any ambiguity as to the latest time for honoring demands upon letters of credit, letters of credit must state expressly that payment must be made prior to the close of business on the third banking day following demand. Second, letters of credit must be irrevocable. Third, letters of credit must expire on a quarterly basis. OCC also is adding to Rule 604 language to make explicit its authority to draw upon letters of credit at any time, whether or not the clearing member that deposited the letter of credit has been suspended or is in default, if OCC determines that such draws are advisable to protect OCC, other clearing members, or the general public. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29641 (August 30, 1991), 56 FR 46027 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;91&hyph;13] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through February 28, 1992); 30424 (February 28, 1992), 57 FR 8160 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;06] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through May 31, 1992); 30763 (June 1, 1992), 57 FR 24284 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;11] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through August 31, 1992); 31126 (September 1, 1992) 57 FR 40925 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;19] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through December 31, 1992); 31614 (December 17, 1992) 57 FR 61142 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;37] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through June 30, 1993); and 32532 (June 28, 1993), 58 FR 36232 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;93&hyph;14] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through June 30, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed discussion of the modifications to OCC's rules governing letters of credit deposited as margin, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29641,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since approval of its original letters of credit filing, OCC has received no adverse comments or complaints from any of its clearing members, banks, or other interested parties with respect to the modifications to Rule 604 or to the implementation of the revised letter of credit standards. Accordingly, OCC is requesting that the Commission again approve the revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of Act and the rules thereunder. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, OCC believes the proposed rule change promotes the protection of investors by enhancing OCC's ability to safeguard the securities and funds in its possession or subject to its control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: St Paul Cos writes off Dollars 365m THE St PAUL Companies, the Minnesota-based property-casualty insurer, has written off Dollars 365m of goodwill attaching to the Minet group, the troubled London-based insurance brokerage business which the US insurer acquired in 1988. St Paul announced it planned a non-cash charge, covering a write-off of goodwill for Minet, in November, although it did not specify the amount. The US company said that the write-off represented about 75 per cent of the goodwill attaching to Minet. It also warned that catastrophe losses - in a dreadful year for the US property-casualty sector generally - totalled Dollars 305m before tax in 1992. This is more than quadruple the losses seen by St Paul in 1990 and 1991. Hurricane Andrew, the devastating storm system which struck Florida in late-August, accounted for about Dollars 200m. As a result of goodwill write-off, the catastrophe losses, a much-smaller charge related to an early retirement programme, and 'disappointing' fourth-quarter results from its reinsurance and international underwriting operations, Minet expects an after-tax operating loss of about Dollars 335m for 1992.</p>

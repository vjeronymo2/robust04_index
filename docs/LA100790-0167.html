			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MADDOX STEPS OVER THE LINE AS BRUINS LOSE;  </P> <P> UCLA: QUARTERBACK'S APPARENT TOUCHDOWN PASS ON FINAL PLAY IS NULLIFIED BECAUSE  HE HAD CROSSED THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BEFORE THROWING IT. ARIZONA WINS ON  70-YARD INTERCEPTION RETURN IN LAST MINUTE, 28-21.  </P> <P> UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox is a 19-year-old redshirt freshman, but  Saturday's game against Arizona may linger with him a long time.  </P> <P> He threw three damaging interceptions at the Rose Bowl as Arizona beat UCLA,  28-21, in a Pacific 10 Conference game before 50,156.  </P> <P> Then, with his team trailing by a touchdown in the waning seconds, it seemed  for a moment that Maddox had redeemed himself.  </P> <P> With five seconds remaining, UCLA was on the Arizona 35-yard line, fourth and  10. Maddox scrambled and threw an apparent touchdown pass to wide receiver Sean  LaChapelle between two Arizona defensive backs.  </P> <P> However, it was ruled that Maddox had stepped over the line of scrimmage before  throwing the football and the touchdown was nullified.  </P> <P> Replays showed that Maddox was over the line by about a foot.  </P> <P> So the game ended with UCLA suffering its first conference loss, while Arizona  stayed alive in the league race. UCLA is 2-3 overall, 2-1 in league play.  Arizona is 4-1 and 2-1.  </P> <P> "I went from the greatest moment of my life to the worst moment of my life,"  said Maddox, referring to the touchdown pass that wasn't allowed.  </P> <P> "I thought I knew where the line of scrimmage was, and I thought I had pulled  up short. As soon as I threw it, somebody hit me and and I wasn't sure I was  across (the line)."  </P> <P> Maddox said, and it was confirmed by UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, that the Bruins  would have tried a two-point conversion if the touchdown had been legal.  </P> <P> Almost a minute earlier, UCLA seemed on the verge of winning the game with  either a touchdown or field goal.  </P> <P> The Bruins had a first down at the Arizona 36 with the score tied, 21-21.  Maddox then threw a sideline pass intended for split end Reggie Moore.  </P> <P> Cornerback Darryl Lewis stepped in front of Moore, intercepted and raced 70  yards untouched down the sideline for a touchdown.  </P> <P> "They ran the same play before and I didn't get a good jump," Lewis said. "On  the interception I looked at the wing, and I had a feeling he would throw it my  way.  </P> <P> "When I was running to the end zone, all I was thinking that it was a long ways  away. I was just praying I could get there."  </P> <P> It was Lewis' fifth interception of the season. The senior from Nogales High in  West Covina came into the game sharing the national lead in interceptions with  four.  </P> <P> "I saw number four (Lewis), but the ball fluttered on me a little bit," Maddox  said. "It was a ball that shouldn't have been thrown. It cost the game for us."  </P> <P> Maddox's miscues clouded the positive things that the quarterback did, such as  throwing three touchdown passes to flanker Scott Miller.  </P> <P> However, when it seemed that UCLA was on the verge of pulling away, the Bruins  let Arizona back into the game.  </P> <P> Examples:  </P> <P>  -- With the score tied, 14-14, in the second quarter, UCLA had second and goal  at the Arizona five-yard line.  </P> <P> Maddox threw a pass intended for tight end Corwin Anthony in the end zone, but  safety Jeff Hammerschmidt intercepted for a touchback.  </P> <P>  -- A few plays later, UCLA defensive tackle Matt Werner recovered fullback  Mike Streidnig's fumble at the Arizona 32, but UCLA's Brad Daluiso eventually  missed a 48-yard field goal.  </P> <P> So the half ended with the teams still tied, 14-14.  </P> <P> Early in the fourth quarter, with UCLA leading 21-14, Miller returned a punt 51  yards for an apparent touchdown.  </P> <P> Instead of a two-touchdown advantage, the play was nullified when UCLA's Pat  McPherson was cited for clipping, a 15-yard penalty.  </P> <P>  -- Two plays later, with the ball at the UCLA 39, Maddox's short pass intended  for tight end Randy Austin was intercepted by Arizona linebacker Zeno  Alexander.  </P> <P> "One of their defensive linemen grabbed my arm," Maddox said. "I tried to hold  up, but I couldn't."  </P> <P> After Alexander's eight-yard return, the Wildcats drove 35 yards to the tying  touchdown.  </P> <P> There were almost six minutes left when UCLA got the ball again.  </P> <P> Maddox drove the Bruins from his 11 to the Wildcat 36, where he threw his last  interception -- the 70-yard return by Lewis.  </P> <P> "We had a perfect opportunity to win it," Maddox said. "All we needed was a  field goal. We didn't take advantage of it, and I made a terrible mistake and  it cost us the game."  </P> <P> Maddox acknowledged that he didn't have a good day. He completed 14 of 33  passes for 269 yards. Scott Miller had scoring catches of 40, 45 and 32 yards.  </P> <P> Donahue wasn't overly critical of his young quarterback saying, "He's young and  made some mistakes and they hurt our team, but he's a fabulous player, and  he'll be even better in the future."  </P> <P> UCLA Notes  </P> <P> Arizona came into the game as the leading rushing team in the Pac-10 and the  worst passing team, averaging only 70.5 yards a game. However, the Wildcats had  149 yards passing at halftime. Coach Dick Tomey alternated his quarterbacks,  starter Ronald Veal and George Malauulu. . . . Malauulu was more effective. He  completed six of 11 passes for 122 yards and was a threat as an option runner.  He gained 52 yards and scored a touchdown on a six-yard run to tie the score,  14-14, in the second quarter. . . . "I thought we could pass well against  UCLA," Tomey said. "Our (run-oriented) offense is geared to making the  opponent's secondary do things they're not used to doing."  </P> <P> Arizona gained 480 yards rushing last year while beating UCLA, 42-7, in Tucson.  The Wildcats settled for a more-balanced attack Saturday with 158 yards rushing  and 178 by passing. UCLA had 425 yards in total offense as tailback Brian Brown  gained 103 yards rushing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * STOLEN MOMENT: Arizona cornerback Darren Lewis was burned early but came back  to return an interception for the game-winning touchdown.

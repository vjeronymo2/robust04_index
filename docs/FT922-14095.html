			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: FT election share index THE PREVAILING trend of the campaign was again visible yesterday as shares that might benefit from a Labour win outperformed those that might gain from a Conservative victory. Since the campaign started, 'Tory gainers' have dropped more than 12 per cent - twice the fall in the FT-SE index of big-company shares. 'Labour gainers' have fallen less than 4 per cent. The index sections reflect views of which companies stand to gain and lose most from the result.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Coordination by Federal Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Plan describes how the Federal response to a radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency will be organized. It includes guidelines for notification of Federal agencies and States, coordination and leadership of Federal response activities onscene, and coordination of Federal public information activities and Congressional relations by Federal agencies. The Plan suggests ways in which the State, local, and Federal agencies can most effectively integrate their actions. The degree to which the Federal response is merged or to which activities are adjusted will be based upon the requirements and priorities set by the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appropriate independent emergency actions may be taken by the participating Federal agencies within the limits of their own statutory authority to protect the public, minimize immediate hazards, and gather information about the emergency that might be lost by delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Federal Agency Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some Federal agencies have authority to respond to certain situations affecting public health and safety with or without a State request. Appendix C of this Plan cites relevant legislative and executive authorities. This Plan does not create any new authorities nor change any existing ones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A response to radiological emergencies on or affecting Federal lands not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied by a government agency should be coordinated with the agency responsible for managing that land to ensure that response activities are consistent with Federal statutes governing the use and occupancy of these lands. This coordination is necessary in the case of Indian tribal lands because Federally recognized Indian tribes have a special relationship with the U.S. Government, and the State and local governments may have limited or no authority on their reservations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event of an offsite radiological accident involving a nuclear weapon, special nuclear material, and/or classified components, the owner (either DOD, DOE, or NASA) will declare a National Defense Area (NDA) or National Security Area (NSA), respectively, and this area will become ``onsite'' for the purposes of this plan. NDAs and NSAs are established to safeguard classified information and/or restricted data or equipment and material. Establishment of these areas places non-Federal lands under Federal control and results only from an emergency event. It is possible that radioactive contamination would extend beyond the boundaries of these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with appropriate national security classification directives, information may be classified concerning nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials at reactors, and certain fuel cycle facilities producing military fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Federal Agency Resource Commitments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies committing resources under this Plan do so with the understanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the duration of the commitment will depend on the nature and extent of the emergency and the State and local resources available. Should another emergency occur that is more serious or of higher priority (such as one that may jeopardize national security), Federal agencies will reassess resources committed under this Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Requests for Federal Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State and local government requests for assistance, as well as those from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners and operators of radiological facilities or activities, may be made directly to the Federal agencies listed in Table II&hyph;1, FEMA, or to other Federal agencies with whom they have preexisting arrangements or relationships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Reimbursement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cost of each Federal agency's participation in support of the FRERP is the responsibility of that agency, unless other agreements or reimbursement mechanisms exist. GSA will be reimbursed for supplies and services provided under this Plan in accordance with prior interagency agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Training and Exercises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal agencies, in conjunction with State and local governments, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodically exercise the FRERP. Each agency will coordinate its exercises with the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee's (FRPCC's)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subcommittee on Federal Response to avoid duplication and to invite participation by other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies will assist other Federal agencies and State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments with planning and training activities designed to improve response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities. Each agency should coordinate its training programs with the FRPCC's Subcommittee on Training to avoid duplication and to make its training available to other agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

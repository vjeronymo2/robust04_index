			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Coors buys Spanish brewery Coors Brewing Company, the US beer producer, is acquiring a brewery in Zaragoza from El Aguila, Spain's second-ranked brewer, to serve as its European export base. The purchase, part of an initial Pta7bn (Dollars 51m) investment in Spain, gives Memphis-based Coors its first manufacturing base in Europe. Under the agreement, Coors will continue to produce El Aguila brands at the Zaragoza plant over a four-year period and will gradually introduce its own product, Coors Extra Gold, for the Spanish and the European markets. The sale of the plant relieves El Aguila, 51 per cent owned by Holland's Heineken group, of a considerable burden and represents the virtual completion of a lengthy rationalisation process.</p>

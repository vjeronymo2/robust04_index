			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Voting rules for leadership fight to be clarified The Labour party will elect its next leader by single transferable vote after taking advice from its solicitors following the confusion which arose over interpretation of rules passed by last year's annual conference. Rule 2(c) states that a candidate must receive half of the votes cast in the election in order to win. If this does not happen on the first ballot, 'further ballots shall be held on an elimination basis'. This could have been interpreted as meaning the party would have to hold a series of ballots and go back to the electorate involved each time. The party's lawyers have recommended to the ruling National Executive Committee that this can be interpreted to cover ballot voting with electors giving preferences among more than two candidates under the STV - or preferential voting - system. The NEC is expected to decide on when to hold the leadership election when it meets on 25 May. The choice is between going ahead quickly, with the result announced at a special one-day conference by the end of July, or waiting until the party's annual conference in early October. Voting will be in three sections, with each section accounting for a third of the total vote - the 4.5m union members who pay a political levy; the 250,000 or so individual members of the party; and Labour MPs and MEPs. Under Labour rules, the union members must not be 'members or supporters of any other party or otherwise ineligible to be members of the Labour party'. The party's rules make clear that voting will 'take place under the procedures of each affiliated organisation' on the basis of 'one person one vote'. Most unions are expected to use individual postal ballots of levy-paying members. They have to do this already by law when they hold ballots to secure the approval of all their members for having political funds. Unions must also hold postal ballots of their members for the election of their leaders and executive committees as well as before organising industrial disruption. Union leaders will no longer, as in the past, wield block votes in the election, but are likely to express their views and candidates can be expected to campaign around the union conference circuit over the next few weeks. The big difference with any other previous election for Labour leader is that the candidates will be able to appeal not just to small groups of activists, or the paid-up party members but to millions of ordinary people who do not belong to any political party - but pay the political levy to their union.</p>

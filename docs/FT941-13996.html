			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No respect for language Sir, I hasten to respond to Ms Sylvia Webb's letter (January 17) about Americanisms in books by British authors. As the (British) author of a forthcoming book for a (British) professional body, I was distressed to receive a catalog (sic) from my publishers, describing the book I have allegedly 'authored'. When I took issue with this usage, my complaint was dismissed on the grounds that the US is the largest single market for English-language textbooks. (The fact that 'written' would have been equally acceptable on both sides of the Atlantic was disregarded.) Ironically, the textbook is on international marketing - a basic tenet of which is respect for the language and culture of one's market. Julia Spencer, 14 The Grove, Palmers Green, London N13 5LG</p>

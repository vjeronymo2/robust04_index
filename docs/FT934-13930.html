			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (4): Skills well employed / Profile of David Saul DAVID SAUL, Bermuda's minister of finance, is a man of some contradictions. He is a successful local member of parliament who loves the cut and thrust of political debate, but who also hates to be labelled a typical politician. He clearly loves his work, yet also says that the only reason he does it is because he has no choice. He is an action man who loves scuba-diving, spear-fishing and kayaking - but who also likes growing roses and collecting stamps. If Mr Saul is anything, he is certainly not dull. Nor short of an opinion. His fondness for voicing his thoughts, frankly and with little consideration for the subtleties of Bermudian politics and business, have made him something of a maverick. Yet he is in other ways the consummate island insider; after all, he was once a business partner with former Bermuda prime minister Sir Edmund Gibbons. A first generation Bermudian, the 54-year old Mr Saul is the son of a British soldier who came to Bermuda with the Argyll Regiment and stayed on after he bought himself out of the military. The colonial influences in Mr Saul's life are strong - he attended university in England and Canada, graduating with a PhD in educational theory and a doctorate in educational psychology. The latter, he says, has been valuable as a financier 'because finance, the movement of the markets . . . is a game that must be studied from a psychological aspect'. If it is true, Mr Saul appears to have used his skills well, steering the Bermudian economy through the toughest recession in living memory with its finances and infrastructure intact. Mr Saul claims that he got into politics by accident. Having been a civil servant under various governments, he worked for Sir Edmund Gibbons for two years in the early 1980s. In 1984 he joined Fidelity, the US mutual fund group, but when he turned down their offer in 1989 to move to London with the company, Mr Saul found himself pressed into service as a member of parliament. After winning his local seat of Devonshire South, he was unexpectedly chosen as finance minister. His four years at the finance ministry have been marked by a pragmatic stewardship of the government's purse and by his steady, if not always popular support for a controlled deregulation of Bermuda's financial services industry. He was one of the prime movers behind breaking the banks's monopoly of the island's trust business, something which did not endear him to the banks. He is also keen to see the banks open up membership of the local stock exchange to other firms. Bermuda's bankers are not the only ones to have had their feathers ruffled by Mr Saul - other politicians and the local press often find him blunt and over confident to the point of arrogance. 'His tone of delivery gets some people's backs up,' says one businessman. It is a view of himself with which he does not necessarily disagree. 'I don't like politics with a capital P. I'm probably far too brash. I don't shake hands or kiss babies, and I don't suffer fools gladly.' He is looking forward to another term at the finance ministry but he does not intend to stay on for ever. 'I will not die in the job,' he says. When he does retire from politics he should have plenty to do. Just reading his list of hobbies - marathon running, scuba diving, kayaking and canoeing, hiking - leaves you short of breath.</p>

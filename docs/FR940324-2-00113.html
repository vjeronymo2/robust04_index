The proposed rail line would serve as an extension to TRRC's already-approved but not yet built 89-mile rail line from Miles City to Ashland, Montana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the DEIS, SEA preliminarily concluded that because of the environmental impacts associated with TRRC's proposed route, the Four Mile Creek Alternative would be environmentally preferable should the Commission decide to grant TRRC's construction application. However, based on comments to the DEIS, SEA's further investigation, TRRC's alignment changes to the proposed route, and a more comprehensive Mitigation Plan, SEA now believes that the Four Mile Creek Alternative would have more adverse consequences on the environment than TRRC's current proposed route. Generally, when a substantial change is made to the approach a Federal agency has taken in a DEIS, the rules of the Council on Environmental Quality implementing the National Environmental Policy Act require the preparation of a Supplement to the DEIS [40 CFR 1502.9(c)]. Because SEA no longer believes that the Four Mile Creek Alternative would be the environmentally preferable route if the Commission grants TRRC's application, SEA has prepared this Supplement to the DEIS (Supplement).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``no build'' alternative has been carefully considered by SEA. This alternative would be environmentally neutral since construction and operation of the proposed Extension and the related environmental impacts would not occur. Because TRRC already has obtained Commission authority to construct and operate a rail line between Miles City and Ashland, TRRC would be able to serve new mines in the project area even if the Commission denied the proposed Extension. Moreover, with the ``no build'' alternative, the present movement of coal from the Decker mines would be unaffected because the Burlington Northern Railroad is already providing service to these mines via an alternate route. In sum, the ``no build'' alternative would preserve the environmental status quo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEA invites comments on the Supplement. SEA specifically requests comments on (1) the environmental preferability of TRRC's current proposed route versus the Four Mile Creek Alternative; (2) the ``no build'' alternative; and (3) any other feasible alternatives. These comments should provide as much substantive information and supporting evidence as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEA will consider all comments to this Supplement and the prior comments to the DEIS before issuing a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS will take into account all the comments received during the entire environmental review process and include SEA's final environmental recommendations to the Commission. The Commission will then consider the FEIS and the entire environmental record in making its decision in this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Send an original and 10 copies of comments referring to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finance Docket No. 30186 (Sub No. 2) to: Dana White, Section of Environmental Analysis, room 3214, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423.

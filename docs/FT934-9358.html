			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Nissan pays Y17bn in US penalty taxes: Concern over moves against multinationals NISSAN, the Japanese car maker, has paid nearly Y17bn (Pounds 106.25m) in penalty taxes to the US Internal Revenue Service, in settlement of an IRS ruling that the company avoided US taxes by transferring part of its income from the US to Japan. The move by Nissan, which in effect accepts the IRS ruling, comes amid mounting international concern about US moves to tighten the tax grip on foreign multinationals operating in the US. The penalty payment by Nissan relates to an IRS ruling that Nissan set transfer prices on its passenger cars and trucks imported by its US subsidiary in California at much higher levels than the IRS deemed appropriate, and that as a result Nissan reported lower income in the US than it should have. Nissan contested the IRS ruling and the matter was referred to the National Tax Agency of Japan. 'We do not believe the prices we charged were inappropriate,' Nissan said. The Japanese Tax Agency has agreed to refund Nissan the Y17bn so that it can avoid double taxation. While the move by Japan signals acceptance that at least part of the income reported by Nissan in Japan should have been declared in the US, the case reflects 'a difference of interpretation' of what constitutes acceptable transfer prices for goods sold within the group, a National Tax Agency official said yesterday. The US has claimed that multinationals often abuse international transfer price rules which state that goods and services sold from one group company to another should be priced as if they were sold to any outside company. By setting higher or lower transfer prices, the US claims, multinational companies have been able to shift their US profits abroad, thereby escaping US taxation. But it is difficult to determine what an appropriate transfer price is, the Tax Agency official said. In the US, for example, the strategy of sacrificing profits for market share, which is common among Japanese companies, is seen as unnatural and raises suspicions of inappropriate transfer pricing practices, he noted. The US interpretation looked at profits alone and not at the entirety of business practices, the official added. It is not the first time for Nissan to be charged penalty taxes on the grounds that it had breached transfer pricing rules. The IRS ruled previously that Nissan breached transfer pricing rules in connection with income for the years from 1975 to 1984. During those years Nissan exported 5.2m passenger and commercial cars, including the Sentra, the Stanza and Datsun trucks, to the US. The company has already paid Y62bn in penalty taxes to the IRS, which has been refunded to it by the Japanese tax authorities. Nor is Nissan alone among Japanese companies in being charged on those grounds. The Japanese Tax Agency has intervened in negotiations with the IRS in at least eight cases involving Japanese businesses in the US.</p>

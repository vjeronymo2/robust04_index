			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo gains 2.3% as Hong Kong falls The yen's fall against the dollar encouraged buying among arbitrageurs, and the Nikkei 225 average gained 2.3 per cent, recovering the 19,000 level for the first time in three trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 rose 434.34 to 19,393.94 as the yen fell to the Y105 level on continued buying of the dollar by the Bank of Japan. The index registered a day's low of 18,826.68 in the morning before rising to a high of 19,415.14 in the afternoon on index-linked buying. However, some analysts were ambivalent over a continued rise in share prices. 'There is not much significance in the rise, since volume was so low,' said Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel. He thought that the yen would not weaken much further, and that it could remain at current levels for at least another month until a decisive breakthrough was made on trade talks between the US and Japan. Volume was 220m shares, against Friday's 265m. In spite of a sense of relief over the yen's weakening, most investors remained inactive. Large-lot buying by foreign investors, seen during the past month, was also absent. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 12.85 at 1,569.96 and the Nikkei 300 added 2.55 at 290.51. Advances overwhelmed declines by 661 to 327, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.69 to 1,307.11. Arbitrage buying supported bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y10 to Y3,200 and Sakura Bank moved ahead Y20 to Y1,470. The yen's decline supported export-oriented high-technology shares. Sony advanced Y80 to Y6,110 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y20 to Y1,720. Toyota Motor was also strong, rising Y60 to Y1,930, while Honda Motor appreciated Y40 to Y1,660. Telecommunications-related stocks gained ground, with buying focused on the multi-media theme. Nitsuko, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y70 to Y1,410 and Fujitsu Y26 to Y1,010. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y14,000 at Y914,000. Sega Enterprises fell Y60 to Y7,220 on continued pessimism over its earnings following a downward revision in profits last Friday. Pioneer Electronic slipped Y10 to Y2,570. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 168.20 to 21,264.40 in volume of 41.3m shares. Roundup There were mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday, although Hong Kong's decline was almost mirrored in Australia. HONG KONG closed sharply lower on institutional selling. The Hang Seng index fell by 369.43, or 3.4 per cent, to 10,456.45. Turnover slipped to HKDollars 4.3bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.7bn. Profit-taking was evident in the banking sector, where HSBC Holdings surrendered HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 116 and Hang Seng Bank receded HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 70.50. The property sub-index dropped 791, or 4 per cent, to 18,616, with Cheung Kong declining HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 43 and Sun Hung Kai Properties retreating HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 58. AUSTRALIA was dragged down by sharp falls overseas and weaker futures and bonds, and fell 2 per cent to its lowest level in a month, the All Ordinaries index finishing 44.7 down at 2,178.5. Worst hit were media and some resource stocks, particularly coal. News Corp fell 40 cents to ADollars 10.08 and the Nine Network 8 cents to ADollars 5.84 as the media index weakened 3.1 per cent. SINGAPORE moved cautiously higher, with many investors remaining absent ahead of tomorrow's budget. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 16.60 to 2,350.87. SEOUL moved upwards for the third consecutive session, helped by activity in blue chip issues, and the composite index added 13.07 at 946.00. Kepco, the electricity utility, and Posco, the steel manufacturer, gained Won800 and Won2,000 respectively at Won31,100 and Won64,200. TAIWAN eased back in the lowest day's volume seen so far this year. The weighted index receded 29.93 to 5,783.89 in turnover of TDollars 42.2bn. MANILA declined in late trading, influenced by the fall in Hong Kong and a setback in PLDT in New York on Friday. The Manila composite index shed 39.8 to 3,005.6 in turnover of 779m pesos, compared with Friday's 1.3bn pesos. PLDT, which lost Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 74 5/8 in New York on Friday, dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,140 pesos. JAKARTA fell 2 per cent, blaming overall bearish sentiment and increasing foreign sell orders as the JKSE index dipped a further 11.02 to 543.76. KARACHI anticipated more foreign buying as it rose on government incentives for the energy sector, the KSE-100 index closing 26.86 stronger at 2,375.41. BOMBAY climbed 5.5 per cent, the BSE index ending 214.48 higher at 4,129.52 in expectation of further economic reforms, including fiscal concessions to industry in the national budget next Monday. Brokers said that budget rumours included a reduction in corporate taxes, the raising of tax limits on individual incomes and full convertibil-ity for the rupee on current account.</p>

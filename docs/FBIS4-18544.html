			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 7 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  called on North Korea here Thursday [7 April] to open its  nuclear sites to international inspection, and warned that  Pyongyang's refusal to do so was a threat to stability and  security.    The EU issued a statement urging North Korea to comply with  its agreement on February 15 to allow inspectors of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) full access to North  Korean nuclear facilities.    "The EU reiterates that prospects for a better relationship  with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea would be greatly  enhanced if concerns over North Korea's nuclear activities and  intentions could be alleviated," it said.    The EU also called on North Korea to hold talks with South  Korea on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.    The EU also gave its full backing to the IAEA's efforts to  ensure that Pyongyang complies with the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and does not pursue development of  atomic weapons.    The statement followed North Korea's refusal last Monday to  continue opening up its nuclear sites to IAEA inspection, and a  North Korean Foreign Ministry statement that it was ending a  suspension of "peaceful nuclear activities."    Four days earlier, on May 31, the United Nations Security  Council had urged North Korea to allow a full inspection of its  nuclear facilities, and hinted at economic sanctions if the  inspections were not allowed.</p>

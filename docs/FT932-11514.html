			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: US healthcare facilities McDEVITT STREET BOVIS INC, one of the Bovis Construction Group's three US subsidiaries, is building a particular reputation in the healthcare sector. Its latest success is a USDollars 30m (Pounds 19.3m) contract for a 235,000 sq ft, eight-storey medical office building with an adjacent 1,500 space car parking deck in its home town of Charlotte, North Carolina. The client is Presbyterian Hospital on behalf of the Nalle Clinic, a local group of 85 multi-disciplined doctors. Preconstruction work is already under way with the 14-month building programme due to begin next year. Adding the Nalle Clinic to its list of on-going healthcare contracts gives MSB four projects for Presbyterian totalling some USDollars 70m (Pounds 45m). The company's penetration of the healthcare market has been increased by winning a medical office park in West Volusia, near Orlando in Florida, and a contract for additions and renovations to Titus County Memorial Hospital in Mount Pleasant, Texas. In Cheverly, Maryland, MSB has won a contract to build an ambulatory services pavilion for Prince George's County Hospital. The 56,240 sq ft building will house surgical suites with outpatient, intensive care and research facilities.</p>

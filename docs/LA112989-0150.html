			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: FREEDOM'S TRAIL FORCED TO FOLLOW LOW ROAD  </P> <P> From Heisman to the Heistmen.  </P> <P> Those Boilermakers pack quite a kick, don't they? One fourth-quarter field goal  by Purdue on Saturday and the Freedom Bowl is waylaid, losing Anthony Thompson  one second and replacing him the next with Team Renegade, the Florida Gators.  </P> <P> Or, what's left of them.  </P> <P> Florida is playing out the season with an interim coach. The incumbent, Galen  Hall, was forced to resign on Oct. 8 amid charges that he made illegal payments  to a player and two assistant coaches.  </P> <P> Florida is also playing out the season with an interim quarterback. The  starter, Kyle Morris, was dealt a year's suspension for betting on college  football games.  </P> <P> And now, Florida is playing out the season as the Freedom Bowl's interim  opponent for Washington. Indiana was Anaheim's team of choice until Saturday,  when the Hoosiers were forced to resign. A 15-14 upset loss to 3-8 Purdue did  them in, leaving Indiana with a 5-6 record and ineligible for bowl  consideration.  </P> <P> Florida has a winning record. It also has a reputation. The football program is  under NCAA investigation, but in the Freedom Bowl, the Gators have found  sanctuary -- one last fling before the first sanctions fall.  </P> <P> "They aren't under NCAA sanctions right now," says Freedom Bowl executive  director Tom Starr, looking on the bright side. "That certainly doesn't bother  us. I guess you're innocent until proven guilty, right?"  </P> <P> Starr scans this year's bowl-bound map and finds Florida keeping, well,  high-profile company.  </P> <P> "If you look across the country, you see so many allegations," Starr notes.  "There are allegations at Nebraska, at Minnesota.  </P> <P> "You don't know what are causing those allegations, disgruntled players or  what. Again, until you're proven guilty . . . "  </P> <P> Feel for Starr. It has to be tough directing a bowl game on the backpedal.  </P> <P> And before Saturday, it seemed all so easy. All Starr needed was one Indiana  victory over a ninth-place Purdue team -- the Hoosiers were 16 1/2-point  favorites, which Kyle Morris probably knew -- and Heisman Trophy front-runner  Thompson was coming to Anaheim.  </P> <P> Starr and other Freedom Bowl representatives flew to Indiana, primed for a  night of toasts and handshakes. Hello Anthony, hello sold-out Anaheim Stadium.  The whole gang was going to celebrate later that night at the Indiana-Miami  (Ohio) basketball game, court-side with Bobby Knight.  </P> <P> Starr still has his ticket. Unused.  </P> <P> "I've been in the bowl business 10 years and I usually have premonitions about  these things," Starr said. "But, to be honest, I was caught off guard. I  thought Indiana was pretty safe."  </P> <P> Now, the Hoosiers are out and Thompson's Heisman hopes have been damaged,  perhaps terminally. Purdue held Thompson, the nation's leading rusher and  scorer, to 97 net yards and kept him out of the end zone.  </P> <P> Now, Houston quarterback Andre Ware has moved ahead of Thompson in most  informal Heisman polls.  </P> <P> It was a lost afternoon for everyone who had the most to gain.  </P> <P> For Thompson, it was a big disappointment.  </P> <P> For the Freedom Bowl, however, it is simply a way of life. From Game I, when  the teams from Texas and Iowa nearly drowned in a December downpour, a hard  rain has been falling on Starr and associates.  </P> <P> That year, the deluge ensured a meager turnout of 24,093.  </P> <P> The next, a top-10 Air Force team led on Starr for weeks and then abruptly  committed to the Bluebonnet Bowl, forcing an 11th-hour scramble that left  Freedom II with some 7-4 leftovers from Colorado.  </P> <P> And this year, three of the four California Pac-10 teams -- UCLA, Stanford and  Cal -- did nose dives and the fourth, USC, qualified for the Rose Bowl. Like  that, the Freedom Bowl was shut out of a local draw.  </P> <P> Ultimately, it turns to Indiana to save Dec. 30 -- and Anthony Thompson turns  it over.  </P> <P> Bring on the backup. Hail Florida. And hope the NCAA gets through December  without deciding to jail Florida.  </P> <P> "Florida will be on national TV this weekend against Florida State," Starr  says. "Hopefully, people will look at the quality of the team Florida has and  the kind of quality back Emmitt Smith is."  </P> <P> And look the other way on the other stuff.  </P> <P> Then again, that could be part of Freedom Bowl VI's ticket drive. Catch The  Gators While You Can. You never know when Florida might be allowed to play in  one of these things again.  </P></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions set to agree changes at Rover UNIONS AT the Rover vehicle group are likely to recommend proposals for Japanese-style changes in working practices to their 30,000 members at the company after talks with management. The company said last week that, after more than five months of negotiations between management and unions, the talks had been successfully concluded. Representatives of the AEU engineering workers' and TGWU general workers' unions on the joint negotiating committee at Rover are likely to pave the way today for the main proposals. The union will then call a meeting of delegates from all sites to consider the proposals, which will later be presented to the workforce for a ballot. Mr John Allen, the AEU's chief Rover negotiator, said yesterday that the deal would 'strengthen the future viability of Rover'. The agreement is designed to help the company meet increasing competition from Japanese car plants in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Much of the proposed plan is based on Japanese working methods. The package, which would increase job security for workers by removing the threat of compulsory redundancies, would eliminate nearly all shopfloor demarcation lines and clear the way for flexible team working. The measures would create a single-status company by ending all remaining distinctions been staff and hourly-paid workers, including ending clocking-on arrangements for manual workers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Yakovlev, doctor of juridical </F> sciences, plenipotentiary of the president of the Russian  Federation in the Federal Assembly, by Olga Kondratyeva,  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent; place and date not given:  "Aleksandr Yakovlev: 'I Intend to Serve the Constitution, and  Not Political Ambitions'"]    [Text] A new position was recently introduced in the  administration of the Russian Federation president--the  plenipotentiary of the president of the Russian Federation in  the Federal Assembly. Doctor of Juridical Sciences Aleksandr  Yakovlev, with whom our correspondent met, has been assigned to  this position.    [Kondratyeva] Aleksandr Maksimovich, what do you see as the  substance of your activity?    [Yakovlev] The functions of the plenipotentiary of the  president in the Federal Assembly are based directly on those  norms of the constitution that stipulate the rights and duties  of the president with respect to parliament. The president has  the right of legislative initiative. Moreover, my task is to  present this initiative to the legislative organ and, if  necessary, to clarify, to convince, and to take counterproposals  into account.    My task is to see to it that the legislative and executive  authority work in a coordinated way. They are separated not for  rivalry, but for interaction. I am convinced: There are no such  contradictions that cannot be settled via the parliamentary  route within the framework of the constitution.    By the way, the function of feedback--from parliament to the  president--is not just my responsibility, but my moral and  political duty. I will be happy, if I am able to reconcile  disputes before they develop. After all, disputes frequently are  not the result of somebody's malicious will, but of  informational inadequacy. Disagreements are also possible on a  conceptual basis, but they are not terrible if they are opposed  by an agreement to resort to the constitutional method of  resolving a dispute, and with mutual respect by the sides.    I think of myself as a servant of the constitution, and I  intend to serve it only, and not political ambitions.    [Kondratyeva] Aleksandr Maksimovich, does a similar position  exist in the political practice of the West, in particular in  the United States? For example, is there an official in the  Clinton administration for organizing mutual relations with  Congress? Or is this our national character molded by the  confrontation we all remember between the president and the  Supreme Soviet?    [Yakovlev] A significant part of the activity of the  American  President consists of consultations and searches for mutually  acceptable decisions in contact both with senators and also with  members of the House of Representatives.    [Kondratyeva] That is, you want to say that in the  administration of the President of the United States a whole  service is engaged in the "building of bridges" with Congress?    [Yakovlev] Exactly this kind of a service is being  established now in B. Yeltsin's administration: a working  apparatus of the plenipotentiary of the president of the Russian  Federation in the Federal Assembly. I am right now engaged in  the formation of this apparatus, which will be joined by highly  qualified lawyers who have parliamentary work experience.    [Kondratyeva] If your service had been established a lot  sooner, at the beginning of the epoch of the confrontation of  the president and the Supreme Soviet--and we recall the  dramatism of the mutual relations of the two branches of  authority that heated up starting from December 1992--would it  have been possible to prevent the tragic events of last autumn?    [Yakovlev] The separation of powers is not a whim, but a  condition for the existence of a free government. But this idea  should have been put into practice by people who are accustomed  to the idea that the unity of authority is a predominant  principle. Therefore, a situation arose not of separation, but  of dualism of powers: Both centers tried to concentrate power in  their own hands; therefore, rivalry between them proved to be  inevitable. It is precisely in this that I see the tragedy of  the past.    It remains to be hoped that now, when the principle of the  separation of powers is logically embodied in the structure of  authority, the condition has developed for the creation of a  rule-of-law civilized state. But again only the condition! If  just one of the branches of authority begins to be guided not by  the constitution, but by political consideration, expect trouble.    At present, one frequently hears, they say, we did not elect  the right ones to parliament. We elected those who were  available! Indeed, we encountered phantom parties behind which  no one stands. But this is the result of the crudity of our  political history. The Labor Party of England was created over  centuries. The Democratic and Republican Parties in the United  States also have a couple of hundred years behind them.    Elections are the great political eliminators of ignorance.  We have already lived through one political campaign, now  elections to local organs of authority are going on, and within  two years we will have a still more serious test--elections of  both parliament and the president. This is the best school for  the political maturation of the people and the formation of  leaders and parties of a democratic persuasion.    The word "citizen" [grazhdanin] came from the word "city  dweller" [gorozhanin], which means "a free person." Strictly  speaking, until 1861, a majority of Russians were not citizens.  And they again stopped being citizens after 1917. It is only in  recent times that the process of reanimation of a civic society  started. What does it mean to be a citizen and a free person? To  possess political freedom? Not only. A beggar does not need  political freedom--in his hands it is a dangerous weapon. What  is also needed is economic freedom associated with the  development of the institution of private property. Without  economic prosperity and democracy, it is not worth a farthing.    [Kondratyeva] What percentage of the population should  become  citizens in order for society to be socially and economically  stable?    [Yakovlev] At least 30 percent. Then this third will entice  those who are wavering. You know, some schooners have a lead  keel underneath, which gives a maneuvering schooner stability.  That which history has called the "third estate" gives a firm  basis to a civic society.    [Kondratyeva] In your opinion, how much time is needed for  Russia to receive such a rigging? I think that an important  increase in the third estate will begin within three to five  years. This is my intuitive feeling of the style and pace of our  development. A lot depends on our faith in the future and in the  possibility of living as they do in the prosperous democratic  states.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HIGH RURAL-AREA SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOUND  </P> <P> Rural areas have arrest rates for drug- and alcohol-related offenses as high as  cities do, according to government researchers, who recommend that rural states  pool their resources to deal with the problem.  </P> <P> The General Accounting Office, in a report released Thursday by several  rural-state senators, found also that most prison inmates in sparsely populated  states have abused alcohol or drugs.  </P> <P> Substance abuse is so common among inmates that treatment programs are  "completely overwhelmed," the GAO reported.  </P> <P> "There is a problem in the rural parts of this country," Sen. Kent Conrad  (D-N.D.) said. "It's not just an urban problem. We need resources to deal with  it."  </P> <P> GAO investigators agreed, noting that "public, scholarly and policy-maker  attention" has been focused on "high-intensity" drug zones in major cities and  along the Mexican border.  </P> <P> "Much less attention has been paid to less densely populated rural areas  farther removed from the coasts or the country's southern border," the report  said.  </P> <P> Rural areas and small towns have lower arrest rates for illegal drug use but  higher rates for alcohol-related offenses. Total arrest rates for substance  abuse are as high in rural areas as in cities, the GAO said.  </P> <P> In studies of prison systems in Arkansas, Iowa, Montana and North Dakota,  researchers found that the majority of inmates have problems with substance  abuse. Ninety-one percent of Montana's inmates had abused alcohol or drugs, as  had 75% in Iowa, 73% in North Dakota and 71% in Arkansas.  </P> <P> The senators complained that formulas passed by Congress in 1988 tended to give  urban areas more than their fair share of federal funding for drug interdiction  and treatment programs.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure we're not discriminated against," Sen. Dale Bumpers  (D-Ark.) said. "We feel as strongly about the drug problem as anybody does."  </P> <P> Rural drug programs cost more to run because of the relatively small number of  clients, and rural areas have difficulty finding and retaining experienced  staff.  </P></p>

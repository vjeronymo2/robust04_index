			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BREEDING RARE ANIMALS HELPS TO PRESERVE DIVERSE GENE POOL  </P> <P> FREESTONE, Calif. -- Frazier, the four-horned Navajo-Churro ram, Dusty, the  curly-haired horse and a flock of skinny turkeys may look wacky, but Hans Peter  Jorgensen is serious when he says they can help save a world being consumed by  sameness.  </P> <P> The risks of factory farming -- which produces cheap, easy-to-raise "clone-like  animals" -- ultimately outweigh the benefits, said the manager of the C. S.  Foundation farm, which produced the skinny turkeys and the other unusual  animals.  </P> <P> "(Factory farming) is a short-term gain for a long-term, serious, serious  loss," Jorgensen said.  </P> <P> "When plants and animals are identical genetically, they have the same  strengths and weaknesses," said a paper produced by the private, New York  City-based C. S. Fund. "When one variety suffers destruction, entire plant and  animal populations can be irretrievably lost; uniformity engenders  vulnerability."  </P> <P> "Between 1600 and 1900, experts estimate, one plant or animal became extinct  every four years," the report said. "Today it is estimated that at least one  species is disappearing each day. By the late 1990s, if current trends  continue, one species will be lost every hour."  </P> <P> "Extinction is forever; you don't get them back," Jorgensen said. "Our position  is: Don't throw the genes away, your grandchildren might need them."  </P> <P> The foundation quoted recent studies that show less than 5% of the vegetable  seed varieties available in the United States in 1903 are still around today,  and similar reductions in animal gene diversity threaten food and clothing  sources.  </P> <P> Jorgensen compared the current situation to the Irish potato famine, which  resulted in the deaths of about 750,000 people from disease or starvation from  1845 to 1847. That is when the potato crop failed because of a plant blight  that he said might have been avoided if the Irish had relied on more varieties,  instead of a limited number that were all susceptible to the disease.  </P> <P> "That was a crisis in genetic diversity," he said.  </P> <P> The C. S. Foundation is financed by Maryanne Mott, a Montana rancher, nature  photographer and General Motors heiress, whose father, Charles Stewart Mott,  founded the auto giant. The foundation has various causes its directors believe  promote human and cultural survival: genetic diversity, peace and ecology.  </P> <P> About 15 acres of land in the sleepy Sonoma County town of Freestone,  population 54, about 65 miles north of San Francisco, were purchased by the  fund in 1983 when it moved from nearby Santa Rosa. Jorgensen, a former college  art teacher, cabinet maker, general contractor and son of a Midwestern dairy  farmer, was hired to run a project to conserve rare or minor breeds.  </P> <P> Rare breeds of cattle and horses are those with less than 200 annual  registrations; rare sheep, goat and pig breeds have less than 500. Minor breeds  of cattle, sheep, goats and horses are those with fewer than 1,000 annual  registrations.  </P> <P> The foundation hopes to carry its conservation message through public education  and by finding support for genetic diversity preservation.  </P> <P> The fund's first targets have included the Navajo-Churro sheep and  Bashkir-Curly horse. Recently added to the list was the naturally mating Bronze  turkey.  </P> <P> The hearty, long-haired Churro sheep has a 450-year history in North America,  dating to when they were left behind by Spanish conquistadors who had taken the  animals on their journeys as food. The Navajos began using the Churro -- with  its long, coarse, double-coated fleece -- for ceremonial rugs.  </P> <P> "That's why the old Navajo rugs would last 200 years," Jorgensen said.  </P> <P> The Churro quickly adapted to dramatic desert climate changes, altitude,  limited water resources and forage conditions, and Navajo flocks soon numbered  in the hundreds of thousands.  </P> <P> But poor herding practices, a federal livestock-reduction program that  Jorgensen said was aimed at humbling the Navajos and saving Lake Mead from  sheep-caused erosion led to their decimation.  </P> <P> Now near extinction, there are about 500 Churros; about 10% of their rare gene  pool is in the Freestone flock. A national Navajo-Churro sheep registry was set  up in 1988.  </P> <P> At Utah State University, Churro Sheep Project spokeswoman Kristy Selman touted  the animals' ability to resist internal parasites and contagious foot rot,  problems traditionally expensive for the sheep industry.  </P> <P> Churro lambs sell for $250 to $1,000 and are of great value for the Navajos'  "Two Gray Hills" style carpets that use the soft but strong black, brown and  white yarns that require no dyeing, Selman said.  </P> <P> Many older Navajo weavers still cherish the Churro, which the project supplies  to reservations in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.  </P> <P> "It's been a long time since they've seen any of these," she said. "When they  do, their whole faces light up. . . . When they see it, they want it and they  want it now."  </P> <P> The success of the foundation's efforts on behalf of the turkey remains to be  seen. The turkey commonly raised by commercial growers today has been bred for  white meat, an absence of pin feathers and breast muscles so large the poultry  cannot mate naturally. Instead, reproduction is handled by artificial  insemination.  </P> <P> "I think we've taken a little step too far," said Jorgensen while gazing at the  gobbling flock in what he calls the "Turkey Hilton."  </P> <P> The foundation donates its turkey eggs to poultry fanciers or sells them.  </P> <P> The small, sure-footed Bashkir-Curly horse represents one of the foundation's  mixed successes. Research into the historical origin and genetics of the rare  North American horses with curly hair showed that the stocky, gentle-natured  horse who sheds his long, kinky hair every summer was not a separate breed  after all, but a "very crossed-up bunch."  </P> <P> One goal of the foundation is to have "living history farms" or zoos keep rare  or endangered breeds of animals because they generally provide more continuity  than individual breeders.  </P> <P> At the UC Davis agricultural extension office, spokeswoman Heidi Johnson said  there has been increasing interest in rare breeds of animals. But she chalked  it up to a "kind of fad thing" that has evolved from a curiosity in exotic  animals about five years ago.  </P></p>

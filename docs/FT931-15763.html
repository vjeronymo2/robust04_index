			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Reversal of fortune at Phar-Mor  -The web of litigation around the US discount drugstore THE holiday tinsel has been stashed away and many remnants of the old year consigned to the rubbish-bin. But some of 1992's debris will take longer to bury. The scandal at Phar-Mor, one of the more colourful US business stories in 1992, is a case in point. Last August, this 'deep discount' drugstore operator announced it was taking a Dollars 350m charge against earnings - the result, it claimed, of an alleged fraud and embezzlement scheme which had led to overstated earnings and inflated stocks. Within weeks, the Ohio-based retailer plunged from fast track to bankruptcy. Not surprisingly, the sudden reversal of fortune created a trail of litigation and losses. Even now, as legal processes start grinding, some big names - including Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, Lazard Freres' Corporate Partners investment operation and National Westminster Bank of the UK - are still totting up the damage. At the centre of the Phar-Mor debacle is Mr Michael Monus, a businessman in his 40s whose family has run retail interests from Youngstown, a depressed former steel town, for years. Mr Monus is, by all accounts, something of a local character; aside from co-founding Phar-Mor, his notoriety stems from a burgeoning sports empire, a messy divorce, and a 'fast lane' life-style. Phar-Mor was born in the early-1980s after Giant Eagle, a Pittsburgh-based grocery chain, bought out the Monus family grocery business, and contacts between Mr Monus and Mr David Shapira, head of Giant Eagle, prompted them to go into business together. The Phar-Mor strategy was reportedly based on a deep-discount operation in Cleveland which they had visited together. Phar-Mor quickly won a reputation for striking hard bargains with suppliers, and seemed to prosper. Within a decade, annual sales had risen to Dollars 3bn, and the chain had grown to more than 300 outlets. On the back of such prosperity, Mr Monus - whose lawyers did not return calls - gave full rein to his private interests. He became the owner of 'Youngstown Pride', a 'World Basketball League' franchise operating as a second-tier, professional organisation for players under 6ft 7in tall. He also planned to become a big investor in the Colorado Rockies, one of baseball's two expansion franchises which start playing this year. Ironically, it was the sports ties which became the catalyst of Phar-Mor's downfall - at least according to a lawsuit filed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Phar-Mor's accountants. It claims to have first learnt of the alleged improprieties when asked to investigate 'certain cheques paid to a travel agent by Strouss Building Associates, a Phar-Mor related partnership, for expenses incurred by the World Basketball League'. This probe, the suit continues, eventually revealed that millions of dollars had been diverted from Phar-Mor into the league. C&amp;L also says that it was told by one of Phar-Mor's accountants of 'hidden books'. Inevitably, how the alleged scam worked, and who was responsible for it, is a matter of intense legal dispute. Phar-Mor, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within weeks of the Dollars 350m write-off announcement, has sued C&amp;L for negligence. In turn, C&amp;L has sued Mr Shapira, Mr Monus, and various other employees of Phar-Mor and its related companies. Mr Monus and Mr Patrick Finn, Phar-Mor's chief financial officer were fired almost immediately, and Mr Monus has since filed for personal bankruptcy. That is only the beginning. According to one lawyer involved in the affair, there are More than a dozen lawsuits outstanding. These include a class action filed by the unquoted retailer's shareholders, and about five actions against NatWest and its County NatWest Securities arm in the US, which handled a private placement of Phar-Mor shares. Among the plaintiffs are two big mutual fund operators - T. Rowe Price and Massachusetts Financial Services - which allege NatWest/County misled investors about Phar-Mor's financial condition. The various lawsuits make clear how difficult untangling the truth may prove to be. The Phar-Mor suit, for instance, blames Mr Monus, with collusion from Mr Finn, and suggests that C&amp;L - which issued clean audit reports in 1989, 1990 and 1991 - was negligent in uncovering sizeable accounting irregularities. C&amp;L's own suit is more detailed. As background, it claims that Mr Shapira and Mr Monus ran Phar-Mor 'as a personal fiefdom'. They were involved, for example, in a number of joint ventures or partnerships which leased stores, store fixtures and equipment to Phar-Mor. Various professional or supplier companies run by their relatives also worked for Phar-Mor. As to the alleged overstatements of the company's financial position, C&amp;L maintains that it uncovered evidence of stock shortages during the 1988 audit. This, it claimed, was the result of 'short' shipments from a Giant Eagle distribution subsidiary. However, a promised improvement in stock control methods was then delayed for a variety of reasons - including, for example, the employment of outside consultants to assess the situation. The suit also notes that Mr Monus and Mr Shapira called in reputable inventory consultants to count stocks at every store twice a year, on a rotating basis. The consultants' reports showed no problems. And the C&amp;L suit claims that stock levels were fictitiously inflated at each of the stores, except those which C&amp;L itself was testing. Whatever the truth of the claims and counter-claims, there is no doubt that some prestigious players in the financial community have had their fingers badly burnt. Phar-Mor was never quoted, but did place shares privately. In June 1991, for example, Corporate Partners - the investment partnership run by Lazard Freres - put Dollars 200m into Phar-Mor, in return for a 17 per cent equity stake. Westinghouse Electric Corporation was another victim, taking a Dollars 100m write-off on its Phar-Mor investment last October. So were the mutual fund investors, and so - indirectly - was NatWest/County, which claims that the allegations against it are 'completely without merit'. Are there any lessons to be learnt from the affair? The legal processes are only just getting under way, but Phar-Mor may again focus attention on how audits are conducted. Secondly, the willingness of investors to pour money into a discount retailer may indicate a general eagerness to unearth a second Wal-Mart - the Arkansas-based company which grew from one 'five-and-dime' store to become the nation's largest retailer, making a lot of shareholders very rich. The story, alas, is rather different this time.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: California files lawsuit in Executive Life affair THE CALIFORNIAN Insurance Commissioner, Mr John Garamendi, yesterday filed a sweeping lawsuit against numerous former officials of Executive Life, the large distressed insurer, and of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the defunct investment bank. Among those named in the suit are Mr Michael Milken, the former 'junk bond king' at Drexel who is currently serving a prison sentence for securities law violations, and Mr Fred Carr, Executive Life's former chairman. The suit also extends to Deloitte &amp; Touche, Executive Life's accounting firm, and to three large rating agencies - Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and AM Best - who graded Executive Life. The lawsuit, filed in the Los Angeles' courts, accuses the defendants of fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and various other actions which, it claims, contributed to the insurance company's collapse in 1991. It asks the defendants to pay for all losses and damages suffered as a result of these actions, plus interest, punitive damages and costs. 'It is expected that total damages could run well into hundreds of millions of dollars,' claimed Mr Garamendi. Executive Life, under Mr Carr's management, invested heavily in Drexel-issued junk bonds, and when the investment bank collapsed, Executive Life suffered a severe policyholder run. The Californian insurance department seized the insurer, effectively freezing its business, last April. Ironically, the suit comes as many of civil claims and counter-claims filed in the wake of Drexel's collapse, and directly related to the investment bank, may be close to resolution. Under a 'global' settlement proposal, Mr Milken has agreed to contribute another Dollars 500m to a settlement 'pool', while 200 of his former colleagues would provide Dollars 300m in Drexel employee partnership interests. The total 'pool' would amount to Dollars 1.3bn. Details of this settlement are being sent to interested parties. If the proposal is accepted within time constraints laid down by the Drexel bankruptcy process, participants could get immunity from any further Drexel-related lawsuits. It has been suggested Mr Milken's Dollars 500m represents 80 per cent of his remaining personal wealth - but this does not include assets belonging to his wife or immediate family. Few of the defendants have seen the suit. However, with this caveat, Standard &amp; Poor's said it believed the suit was without merit, while Deloitte said it knew of 'no legitimate basis for such a complaint'. AM Best, in a more detailed response, added that allegations of fraud or deceit which involved intentional actions were denied.</p>

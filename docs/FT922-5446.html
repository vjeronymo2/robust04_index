			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Musts for the wardrobe / A look at the second Boden catalogue WHEN JOHNNIE Boden, a former investment banker, bored with city ways and city life, launched his first Boden catalogue a few months back readers immediately took to his strictly edited range of carefully-chosen basics - no complicated choices, no vast ranges to peruse at great length, just great, simple clothes. Naturally, when things become successful they tend to grow so that after what Johnnie Boden calls The First Great Clothes Hunt we now have . . . yes, The Second Great Clothes Hunt. Many of the additions to the new catalogue have come about because customers have asked for them. For instance, the 100 per cent Irish Linen trousers emerge early on in the book because, according to Johnnie: 'I asked you which clothes you wanted to see next time round. Linen trousers came top. Not that I needed much persuasion.' He adds: 'All right, they're not cheap (Pounds 60). Linen creases annoyingly. But somehow you know this. You expect it. If you saw linen trousers that were cheap and didn't crease, well, they wouldn't be linen. 100 per cent pure Irish linen, the fabric that has served man and, above all, that hybrid, ex-patriate man, for centuries. 'When you wear linen trousers, you are saying, I don't care. So what if they crease. At times, you just have to wear the coolest fabric ever woven. Linen can absorb about a fifth of its own weight in moisture, releasing it quickly (now you know why it is used for drying-up cloths). The next time you feel The Mad Dog stir within you, find some midday sun, put these on and revel in it, ' says Boden. This gives you not only the specific details on the linen trousers but, possibly more importantly, conveys the authentic flavour of the catalogue. Every item chosen is discussed or justified if you like in Johnnie Boden's own inimitable style. The 100 per cent cotton China Blue Shirt at Pounds 37 a time has been chosen because: 'Occasionally, I wake up and don't care. It's a sunny day, the window box is in bloom, all's right with the world. On days like this, though a certain smartness may be required, the perfection of a poplin shirt seems out of step with the general abandonment. I need something, if not frivolous, then definitely lighthearted.' The new additions to the catalogue have all been chosen for similarly personal and idiosyncratic reasons, working on the principle he first propounded. that if it appealed to him, then it probably would appeal to others, too. There are linen shirts and panama hats, velvet slippers and check shirts, there are heavy duty cotton canvas linesman bags, 'I admit it, these bags are basic. The materials are straightforward, the construction is simple and strong. They have a fundamental, wholesome quality.' . Then there are pure wool picnic rugs (Pounds 45 a time), lots of cufflinks (plain and jokey, from Pounds 16 to Pounds 36), and a rather curious range of ties (flowered, checked,starred, spotted). One of the innovations is that the range of unisex clothing has been increased - items such as cotton-checked shirts come in sizes that women could happily don, panama hats and cotton sweaters, and the expanded range of bags and luggage are all designed to appeal as much to women as to men. He has, however, stuck to his original tenets - nothing high fashion, nothing quirky (well, if you do not count the distinctly quirky Thai baseball hat), nothing that even hints of a total life-style. And yet he manages to make sure that nothing in the catalogue is boring or fills one with that sense of having seen it all before - it is a clever mix of the classic 'must-haves' and the basics that are hard to track down. He aims to deliver orders within ten workings days of receiving them and will, if it is more convenient, deliver to a work address. Where he goes from here, it will be interesting to see. For the moment much of the charm of the operation lies in its smallness and its quirkiness - The Second Great Clothes Hunt has survived expansion with the original concept intact. The range is still sufficiently small for one not to feel overwhelmed when searching through it or for the basic principles to be compromised. Whether it could survive much more growth, I am not so sure. Anyone thinking that the Boden way of dressing is likely to be theirs should write for a copy of a free catalogue to: Boden, 9 Forge Court, Reading Road, Yately, Cambridge. Tel: 0252-861112. FOR CHAPS who believe that when it comes to the delicate matter of after-shave to indulge in it is better to err on the side of the discreet, rather than the insistent, Penhaligon's is one of the safe, sure names. Others may have higher profiles, others may laud their wares more flagrantly but Penhaligon's has an enviable reputation of tradition and know-how. Although the recent company is not all that old (Sheila Pickles revived it in the late 1970s) its reputation for quality,tradition and classicism has been built on the fact that it has revived centuries-old formulae such as Hammam Bouquet and Blenheim Bouquet to please its male customers. It has developed six new gentlemens' colognes and, again, in the Penhaligons' tradition, they have been recreated from century-old formulae. Eau de cologne (most classic of them all, mainly based on citrus oils), Extract of Limes, Esprit de Lavande, Eau San Pareil, Esprit du Roi and Eau de Verveine all come simply but beautifully bottled and boxed. They cost Pounds 16 for 50 ml, Pounds 35 for 200 ml and Pounds 50 for 500 ml and are available from all Penhaligon's shops, including the one at 41 Wellington Street, Covent Garden, London WC2, or by mail on 081-880-2050.</p>

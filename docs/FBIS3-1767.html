Latest statistics show that last year a total of 150 million  U.S. dollars in contractual volume came from American investors,  pushing the total investment Dalian has attracted from overseas  to 4.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 96.8 percent over the previous  year.    Officials said that favorite investment fields cover real  estate, commerce, the entertainment business and information  services. So far, a number of modern ventures involving science  and technology, industrial production, telecommunications,  transportation, posts and farming produce processing industries  have been established.    Infrastructural facilities were greatly improved last year  to  create a better investment environment, local officials said.  Tours to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia to invite  investors proved fruitful.    In addition, local officials issued bonds worth 10 billion  Japanese yen in Japan. They were sold off within eight days and  were labeled "A Plus" in terms of credibility.    There are now more than 3,000 foreign-funded enterprises in  the port city. The 1,439 enterprises which have started  production have generated 10.97 billion yuan in output value and  made 980 million U.S. dollars in exports.</p>

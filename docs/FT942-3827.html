			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Brussels rethink over steel plan The European Commission will this week reconsider its rescue plan for the steel industry amid renewed warnings from Mr Karel Van Miert, European Union competition commissioner, that he will walk away from it unless he wins support for a flexible interpretation of rules on state aid. Mr Van Miert's stand puts him on a collision course with Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator. Sir Leon is unhappy about the planned grant of Ecu415m (Pounds 319.55m) in Italian state aid in exchange for the closure of steelmaking in Brescia, northern Italy. Sir Leon fears that this would undermine efforts to reach a steel agreement with the US. Mr Van Miert said the Brescia cuts were crucial for the Commission to reach its target of reducing steelmaking capacity in the EU by 19m tonnes by September. Some bending of the rules was necessary if the targets were to be met, he added. In Brussels, Mr Van Miert's allies hope Sir Leon will soften his position to win the backing of the Italian government for his bid to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. A spokesman for Sir Leon said the two issues were separate. Mr Van Miert's decision to distance himself from the steel rescue plan means that the slim chances of a revival lie with Germany's Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner. Mr Bangemann, co-architect of the plan, wants a generous interpretation of the rules to take account of the complicated cross-ownership of the Brescia mini-mills. The web of company shareholdings means not all companies linked to steelmaking would close, raising the legal question of whether state aid can be used for 'partial closures'. Last month, Mr Van Miert suffered a defeat after Sir Leon argued in favour of a rigorous interpretation of the steel code on state subsidies. Mr Van Miert said he was relaxed about a possible collapse of the steel plan. 'I was simply trying to do what I had been asked, but if the conclusion is we can't go ahead, that is no problem,' he said. Mr Van Miert said he had opposed proposals to adopt an interventionist steel policy based on production quotas that would have resulted only in freezing capacity. German steel producers are believed to have favoured such a 'crisis cartel' approach. Van Miert interview, Page 2 See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang, heading a 15-member delegation, will leave Saturday  [9 April] for a ministerial-level meeting of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) scheduled to open in  Marrakech, Morocco April 15.    As a GATT observer, Taiwan has been invited to attend the  meeting, during which the 118 contracting parties will sign the  agreement reached during the Uruguay Round talks in  mid-December, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials said.    The GATT meeting will also make a final decision on the  exact  time for the establishment of the World Trade Organization  (WTO), they pointed out.    Under the Uruguay Round accord, all GATT signatories are set  to become members of the WTO, which will be given tougher  enforcement powers to supersede GATT.    During the GATT meeting, the officials noted, Chiang will  hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from New Zealand,  Canada, Australia, and the United States on problems involving  Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade regulating  body.    Taiwan, accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes  to become a full member by the end of this year.    Meanwhile, the 17 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  Forum ministers will hold an informal session during their stay  in Morocco, the officials noted.    APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Mainland China, Hong  Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New  Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,  Thailand, and the United States.    Chiang will proceed to Egypt for a three-day visit after the  GATT meeting.</p>

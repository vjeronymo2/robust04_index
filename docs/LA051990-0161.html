			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: BURKE NAMED NEW CHIEF AT CAPITAL CITIES  </P> <P> Daniel B. Burke has been elected to replace Thomas S. Murphy as chief executive  of Capital Cities-ABC Inc.  </P> <P> Burke's appointment, effective June 1, was approved unanimously by the  company's board, which met in Bristol, Conn., following the company's annual  meeting.  </P> <P> Burke, 61, served as Murphy's chief assistant for 19 years, 14 of them at  Capital Cities Communications Inc., which bought American Broadcasting Cos. for  $3.5 billion in 1985.  </P> <P> Murphy announced in January that he would step down June 1, a day after his  65th birthday. He will stay on as chairman but will not be involved in the  company's day-to-day operations.  </P> <P> Burke joined Capital Cities Communications Inc. in 1961 as general manager of  WTEN-TV, Albany, N.Y., and was elected vice president in 1962. Two years later,  he was appointed general manager of WJR-AMFM in Detroit.  </P> <P> Burke rose to the rank of executive vice president and director in 1967. From  1969 to 1972, he served as president of the company's publishing division  before being named president and chief operating officer. He continued in that  position when Capital Cities took over ABC in 1985.  </P> <P> Analysts believe that the transition will have little immediate impact because  Murphy and Burke share virtually identical philosophies about the operation and  role of the company.  </P> <P> When he announced that he was stepping aside, Murphy said he believed that a  corporation prospers under younger leadership.  </P> <P> Murphy became renowned in 1985 when his company took over ABC. The move marked  the first takeover of a major television network.  </P></p>

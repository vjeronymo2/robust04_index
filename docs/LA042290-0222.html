			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE MOVIES: THE WEEK'S OTHER PRIME-TIME FILMS  </P> <P> In the 1987 China Girl (KCOP, Tuesday at 8 p.m.), director Abel Ferrara has  created one of his potent ultra-violent, ultra-stylish Manhattan street fables.  </P> <P> This time, it's a Romeo (Richard Panebianco) and Juliet (Sari Chang) tale set  in the Lower East Side's cheek-by-jowl Little Italy and Chinatown. Not for  youngsters.  </P> <P> As if New York didn't already have enough to contend with, C.H.U.D. (KCAL,  Saturday at 8 p.m.), a routine 1984 social protest/horror picture, finds the  city's derelict population turned into hideous-looking ghouls through  contamination with radioactive waste. John Heard and Daniel Stern star.  </P></p>

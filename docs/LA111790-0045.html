			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ILLUSION WINS CLOSE CABO RACE;  </P> <P> SAILING: MCDOWELL'S BOAT TAKES SERIES OVER CHEVAL WITH BETTER PERFORMANCES IN  THREE OF FIVE EVENTS.  </P> <P> Ed McDowell's Grand Illusion scored the narrowest of victories and won the  closest of championships at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Friday.  </P> <P> After six days of slow, agonizing sailing, the Santa Cruz 70 from the King  Harbor Yacht Club finished 1 minute 22 seconds ahead of Mitchell Rouse's Taxi  Dancer to win the 870-mile race from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas, around  Guadalupe Island.  </P> <P> The victory, in the last of five point-scoring events for the ULDB 70 Assn.,  gave Grand Illusion the season title over Hal Ward's Cheval. With Cheval  finishing sixth, each had 55 points, but Grand Illusion placed higher than  Cheval in three of the five events.  </P> <P> If Taxi Dancer had beaten Grand Ilusion, Cheval would have won the  championship.  </P> <P> McDowell, a retired petroleum executive, wasn't there for his boat's big moment  but was in Chicago for a speaking engagement. The sailing master was Bill  Peterson, with Joe Buck the navigator.  </P> <P> Grand Illusion, Taxi Dancer and Peter Tong's third-place Blondie, the defending  champion, all passed Davis Pillsbury's Holua and Brack Duker's Evolution on the  final day, after the one day of good wind Wednesday died to a zephyr Thursday.  </P> <P> Tom Leweck, tactician aboard Evolution, said: "We passed Holua (Thursday night)  and thought we had won. Then, when the sun came up this morning, we saw Grand  Illusion and Taxi Dancer in front of us. The first six boats were in sight of  one another."  </P> <P> Grand Illusion and Taxi Dancer, taking advantage of stronger breezes inshore,  were virtually even the last few miles and managed to finish just as the wind  died, leaving the others to drift in more than two hours later.  </P> <P> Nine of the 21 boats had finished by late Friday afternoon. Seven others  dropped out along the way because of the light winds.  </P> <P> "Some of them may not make the awards banquet (tonight)," Leweck said.  </P> <P> Officials of the sponsoring Los Angeles Yacht Club indicated that they would  not try to sail around Guadalupe Island in future events because the November  winds are too light. That would cut about 60 miles off the distance and allow  boats to sail closer to shore in stronger winds.  </P></p>

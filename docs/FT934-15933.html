			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa 'bloodbath' continues COCOA FUTURES prices fell sharply again in a continuation of what one analyst called this week's 'bloodbath'. As the March position at the London Commodity Exchange fell to Pounds 911 a tonne, adding Pounds 39 to Wednesday's Pounds 21 setback, Mr Lawrence Eagles, of the GNI trading house, said some traders were talking about the slide continuing to about Pounds 850 a tonne. 'And when they talk about a figure it usually goes further,' he said. 'I would not rule out a fall to Pounds 830.' He said there had been no change in the market's fundamentals, which were still clearly bullish in the long term. But actual supply shortage  - as against bouts of temporary tightness - resulting from the continuing stocks drawdown could not be expected to make itself felt until 1995. Mr Eagles suggested that many operators thought the market had become 'a bit overblown' as the March position climbed to Monday's 40-month high of Pounds 983 a tonne. The final push to that level appeared to have been fuelled by 'the last of the bulls', he said, and when there was no follow- through the selling began in earnest. An extra margin call was made to all long-holders in the cocoa market after it fell the Pounds 40 permissible daily limit in the morning, clearing house and exchange officials said. 'This is entirely normal, however, when the move in one day exceeds the size of the margin,' one told the Reuter news agency.</p>

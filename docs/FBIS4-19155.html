			<p>BFN     [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry under  secretary, has said that for mutual trust to be established in  Cyprus the damage caused to the package of confidence-building  measures [CBM's] should be rectified and its contents restored  to its original form. Ulucevik arrived in the Turkish Republic  of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] this afternoon to assess the latest  developments on the Cyprus issue. He was received by President  Rauf Denktas.    In a statement prior to the meeting held at the presidency,  Ulucevik said that it is Turkey's national goal to secure the  lasting conditions imperative for the tranquil, secure and  prosperous existence of the Turkish Cypriot community. He noted  that Turkey shares the view expressed by the UN secretary  general on November, 1992, that there is a profound confidence  crisis between the two sides on the island. Ulucevik recalled  that activities aimed at securing an atmosphere of trust between  the two sides have been initiated as of May, 1993. He pointed  out that the Turkish Cypriot side accepted the principles stated  in the UN secretary general's report dated 1 July, 1993, which  included the issues of Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia]  International Airport in the belief that the package was going  to be implemented in full. Ulucevik added that as of 9 March,  Denktas noted that the package was being distorted and that  Turkey assessed the package and concurred with Denktas'  observation. He further recalled the Turkish Foreign Ministry  announcement concurring with the TRNC observation, adding that  the aim of his visit to rectify the damage caused to the package  and restore its contents to its original form.    In reply to a question, Ulucevik said that the fact that he  was visiting the island at the same time as Robert Lamb, U.S.  State Department's special Cyprus coordinator, was a  coincidence. Noting that Lamb asked to meet him, Ulucevik added  that the TRNC is conducting the negotiating process and that  Turkey is only trying to help advance the talks. He added that  within this framework it is normal for him to meet with Lamb.  In reply to another question, Ulucevik said that had the UN  Security Council not wished to rectify the damage caused to the  package, the issue would have been closed long ago. He  concluded by saying that Turkey favors securing an atmosphere of  trust between the two sides based on the CBM's agreed upon by  both sides.</p>

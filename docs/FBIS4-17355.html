			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the initiators of the Accord for Russia  Movement, member of the Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin, has  proposed urgent measures for Russia to overcome the crisis.  Valeriy Zorkin made the statement Friday in an interview with  Interfax.    After other leaders of the Movement discuss the proposals  they may be part of the Movement's program.    Zorkin sees as the main task the restoration of the power's  efficiency. With this aim in view he proposed to create a state  council out of representatives of influential political forces.  Is it worth to put cardinal transformations to the will on one  person even if he is elected by the people because he has no  team of professionals enjoying the people's confidence? asks  the judge. A state council could coordinate important decisions  taken by the executive power. This body could bear  responsibility before the people for the measures taken,  believes Zorkin.    The draft document outlines the main principles for the  country's pulling out of the economic crisis which are based on  the proposals by Sergei Glazyev and other economists. Zorkin is  sure that it is necessary to regulate prices for the time being  on key price-forming goods, to effect state control over prices  for electricity, oil, communal services, bread, milk, butter and  sugar. There is need to reform the taxation system to lower the  tax burden for current incomes.    Also important is to stop the crime tide, said Zorkin. He  proposed to create an anti-mafia structure, a standing body of  cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of  power to combat power abuse and organized crime, including in  the sphere of state government.    It would be worthwhile to adopt for three-five years  amendments to the Criminal Code toughening punishment for crimes  against individuals, said the judge.    He believes that army units should operate in areas with the  unfavorable criminal situation. Zorkin proposed to introduce  amendments into the Law on the State of Emergency which would  permit impose a special rule in such areas.</p>

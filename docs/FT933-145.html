			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hodder Headline rises 25% HODDER HEADLINE, the start-up publishing company which this summer took over Hodder &amp; Stoughton, one of the oldest names in British publishing, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 758,000 for the half year to June 30, an increase of 25 per cent. The results before the costs of the transaction apply only to Headline whose authors include Cilla Black, Peter Scudamore and Diana Ross. The acquisition, valuing Hodder at Pounds 48.9m, was only completed on June 28 and does not form part of Hodder Headline's results. Separate accounts provided for the 125-year old publishing house for the year to June showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.5m on turnover on continuing activities of Pounds 56.3m. Exceptionals included a Pounds 4m provision for advances to authors that are unlikely to be recovered and Pounds 3.5m in reorganisation costs, mainly redundancy payments. Three Hodder directors have left the board - Mr Patrick Wright, Mr Tom Biggs-Davison and Mr Michael Attenborough - and by next April when the integration is due to be completed there will be 625 staff compared with a combined total of 800 at the merger date. The company plans to double the output of Hodder's general publishing division from 300 to 600 titles a year and childrens's titles from 100 to 200. From late-1994 onwards there are additional plans for strategic acquisitions in the areas of academic, schools and childrens' book to take total sales towards Pounds 100m a year. Analysts are now expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m for the full year, rising to between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m next year. On the six month results for the old Headline business, earnings per share before transaction costs rose 14 per cent to 4.1p and the interim dividend is up 10 per cent to 1.65p. Bookline, the book distribution business, broke even in the first half and a strong performance is expected in the second half.</p>

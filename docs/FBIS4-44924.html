			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jalal Duwaydar: "Benefiting From the Experience </F> of Beijing and in the Arab Interest"]    [Excerpts] Although President Mubarak's short visit to  China, which ended yesterday morning, lasted only three days,  there is a general consensus that it has achieved the desired  results, and this is something that reflects the profound nature  of the relations between the two countries and their leaders.    The most important thing that distinguishes Egyptian-Chinese  relations, the roots of which go back dozens of years, is the  fact that they are based on mutual respect, trust, friendship,  and common interests.    In order that matters be clearly and openly put on the  table,  we must remark that President Mubarak, during this trip, has  expended all possible efforts to enable Egypt to benefit from  the achievements of the Chinese economic experiment--with all of  its positive and negative aspects.    There also took place, during the visit, the signing of two  agreements for investment and judicial cooperation between China  and Egypt.    In addition to these two agreements, and by means of the  discussions and meetings held by President Mubarak with the  Chinese leaders, a number of policies have been established for  joint cooperation between the two nations in new areas.    More precisely, the efforts undertaken by President Mubarak  during this exhausting trip--which is only one of the dozens of  trips he is undertaking for the sake of achieving advancement  for Egypt's people and solving Egypt's problems--are not  sufficient, because it is also necessary that the nation's  executive agencies assume responsibility and move effectively in  order to carry out, with the necessary speed, what was agreed  upon.    In order to break out of this dead-end situation, agreement  was reached to form working groups to follow up on the issues of  joint cooperation.    The most important elements of cooperation agreed upon in  President Mubarak's bilateral discussions with the Chinese  leaders, which were also expanded to include the participation  of 'Amr Musa, the minister of foreign affairs, and Safwat  al-Sharif, the minister of information, were the following:    1. Continuation of political coordination concerning Arab,  African, and world issues. The Chinese expressed their esteem  and support for Egypt's efforts aimed at achieving a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    2. The importance of working toward increasing the volume of  trade between Egypt and China, and increasing the rates of  Egypt's exports to a degree that reflects the strength of the  relations between the two nations.    3. It was agreed that China will set up free-trade zones in  Egypt for Chinese industries as a form of investment because of  Egypt's location and proximity to the markets of Europe, the  Middle East, and Africa, and it was also agreed that protocols  dealing with industrial and technical cooperation will be signed.    4. Beijing's readiness to cooperate technologically with  Egypt and to provide all types of possibilities that will help  Egypt to achieve progress and to benefit from China's pioneering  experiment in this field. Now it is up to Egypt's government  organizations to move to seize this available opportunity.    5. An exchange of views concerning the problems of  development and the open-door economic policy. These are  difficulties that exist in both Egypt and China, and that they  can find solutions for if they engage in joint efforts.    6. Judging by the meetings which took place, it is evident  that most of the investments made in the new Chinese  [free-trade] zones have been financed by members of the oversees  Chinese communities (55 million persons). Also, a large  percentage was contributed by the Chinese in Thailand and Hong  Kong, in addition to the capital that comes from Japan and  Singapore.    From the giant nation of China--which is moving firmly and  steadfastly to take its place among the great powers, which will  result in the achievement of the balance which is being sought  in the new world order--President Mubarak has arrived in Abu  Dhabi, the capital of the fellow-Arab nation of the United Arab  Emirates [UAE], which has always opened up its heart and its  arms to Egypt as its Arab big brother. [passage omitted]  The trips abroad that President Mubarak occasionally takes  always have the aim of guaranteeing continuity and pursuing  strong relations of friendship with other nations. This helps  these other nations to understand Egypt's problems and needs,  and creates willingness [among them] to support Egypt in many of  the positions it takes that are connected with the interests of  the Egyptian people.</p>

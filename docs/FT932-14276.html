			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Private-sector rail plan considered THE government yesterday acknowledged for the first time that it was considering a plan by a private-sector consortium to finance a much-needed Pounds 900m upgrade of the railway line between London Euston, the Midlands and north-west England. Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'It's a very exciting idea, and we are discussing with our colleagues in the Treasury how it would work.' The government had also been approached with similar plans for other lines, Mr Freeman said. The scheme under consideration, prompted by the government's recently avowed enthusiasm for attracting private finance into public-sector infrastructure projects, has been proposed by three of Britain's biggest engineering companies: GEC Alsthom, Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty. The Pounds 900m bill for the project would also cover the purchase of a fleet of trains to be provided by GEC Alsthom. However, Mr Freeman yesterday said this part of the scheme might be funded separately under a Pounds 150m leasing facility awarded to BR in last year's Autumn Statement. Alternatively, the Pounds 150m could be used to lease more Networker commuter trains to operate on Network SouthEast's Kent Coast and Great Northern routes. Tenders would be invited for both options, Mr Freeman said, with the eventual choice depending on the bids received.</p>

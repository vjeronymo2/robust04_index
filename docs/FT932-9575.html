			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Technology: Trap set for the office time waster - Hours are lost tinkering with the PC Far from making the modern office worker more productive, the personal computer has become a highly expensive time waster. Playing with on-screen graphics, tinkering with layouts and experimenting with fonts is an international obsession - and a costly one - according to new studies. The average PC user wastes 5.1 hours every week, reports SBT Accounting Systems, the US software house. Its survey revealed that 5bn hours may be lost in the US each year; based on the average white-collar wage this equates to Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn), or 2 per cent of its GDP. Placing so much power on the desktop can be counter-productive. In the US, white-collar productivity increased by just 0.2 per cent a year during the 1980s, despite having the world's highest number of PCs per head. In Japan, however, efficiency levels are matched by one of the lowest desktop investments in the developed world, according to Barry Graham of Xephon, a UK consultancy. Last year PCs accounted for 37 per cent of Japanese hardware expenditure, compared with 53 per cent in the UK and 47 per cent in Germany. 'The reason is cultural. Managers in Japan and Germany often consider it beneath them to be seen at a screen,' explained Graham. On-screen time wasting now accounts for up to 25 per cent of a PC user's time, estimates Xephon, which concludes that however unfashionable, the mainframe may still be the most secure and cost-effective option. And yet many managers continue to download applications on to the desktop, unaware of the expenses that will be incurred. Before they do so, they must consider the consequences, advises ICL's corporate systems business manager Peter Slavid. 'PCs, Unix systems and mainframes all have an important role to play as part of the system. But where people go wrong is making radical changes in any direction just because the hardware looks cheap,' he says. A survey by KPMG Management Consulting revealed that the total price for owning a PC, including 'hidden' costs, could be as high as Pounds 5,900 a year. Even by Xephon's more conservative estimate, networked PCs cost businesses between Pounds 10,300 and Pounds 15,500 for every end-user over five years. By comparison, the mainframe works out at a mere Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 6,750 per user. Managers are losing control, concludes KPMG. It has discovered that 'over 90 per cent of total workstation ownership costs are not being actively managed'. This includes what KPMG terms 'local workstation gurus'. These people are to be found in every office, and are well-versed in PCs. Every time a less-experienced user has a problem, it is the 'gurus' who are called upon to help, distracting them from their own work. 'Unless management recognises and actively manages this resource, there is a grave danger that a significant degree of the organisation's resources will continue to run out of control,' warns KPMG. Such findings are seen by Xephon as proof that downsizing is not the cost-effective solution many businesses assume it to be. Computer suppliers such as ICL argue that cost is not the only issue. 'All this proves is that you can't just dump PCs on people's desks and hope to get an efficient system out of it,' says Slavid. 'The objective is an effective system, and you need to avoid being seduced into restructuring by the availability of cheap power on the desktop. It's only cheap if people make good use of it.' Graham agrees, but insists that even if the cost issue is ignored, mainframes still make more sense. By acting as a centralised point of control they can even offer a solution to the time-wasting temptation. 'Mainframes eliminate the time taken to make back-up copies, for instance, because this is done automatically, and they can also control access to data,' he says. 'This can restrict the amount of time a clerk has the information, so they have no choice but to get the job done efficiently. If they exceed the time limit, questions will be asked.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "Ministry of Defense Full of </F> Beetles"]    [Text] In a large housing estate in Prague, there is a  supermarket. Not only is it the only supermarket, but there  also does not exist any building lot where a second supermarket  could be built. There is not even room for small shops. The  owner rents out the supermarket to its manager. Naturally, they  conclude a lease contract. The contract concerns only the  building in which the supermarket is located. The former  manager of the supermarket thus becomes its lessee. The owner  lets him keep all of the furnishings, some of which are older  and some brand new, without asking anything for it. That is not  all, however. Out of sheer goodness, he leaves in the  supermarket all of the merchandise plus a full warehouse. The  only thing the new lessee must do is hire shop assistants and  start selling. For a while, he does not even have to buy new  stock, of which he had received enough.    The owner does not ask anything for it. He does not even  have  an idea how many millions or tens of millions [currency not  specified] worth of merchandise he had donated to his former  employee in this way. Nonsense? No, this is the style of the  Army's economic management, only transferred into a different  environment.    This is exactly how the Ministry of Defense proceeds in  relation to the Klinlab limited liability company (just a little  reminder: this is the company that had administered those  innocuous virus strains that were hastily destroyed on 25  February of this year). First, on 10 September 1993, the  Municipal Military Accommodation Administration signs a lease  contract with a still nonexistent company, which is signed on  behalf of Klinlab by Army members Moravek, MD, and Choluj, MD,  as Klinlab's statutory representatives and managing directors.  At the same time, these gentlemen collect from the Army a  lump-sum payment as compensation for not being engaged in  private enterprise. Only a month later, on 21 October, the  Klinlab partnership agreement is signed, and, another 11 days  later, Klinlab is registered by the Municipal District Court in  Prague-1. Certain activities are then set apart from the  Central Military Medical Institute and transferred to Klinlab.  <H5>  Through Loss Toward Savings? </H5>   However, the Army, whose motive for the entire operation,  according to M. Kalousek, deputy minister of defense in charge  of economic affairs, is to achieve savings in its budget,  transfers to the private company Klinlab only those activities  that were well established, lucrative, and profitable, such as  diagnostics. Activities that are loss-making and that the  ministry must continue to subsidize are left in its own  facility, the Central Military Medical Institute. From the  viewpoint of the private company Klinlab, this sounds logical.  Why should anyone rush into a business that will cost him  money? It is less logical, however, from the viewpoint of the  "cost-conscious" Army.  <H5>  Setting the Wolf To Mind the Sheep? </H5>   At an extraordinary news conference on 19 March, M. Kalousek  even claimed that the Ministry of Defense would save 50 million  korunas [Kc] a year thanks to Klinlab. This amount is  equivalent to the annual overhead expenses of the entire former  Central Military Medical Institute. It is peculiar that a  deputy minister in charge of economic affairs operates with sums  that include only expenditures and disregard revenues, such as  payments from the Military Health Insurance for medical services  performed, and so forth. He also "forgot" to mention that the  Ministry of Defense must continue to subsidize the nonprofitable  activities of the Central Military Medical Institute. In  substantiating the savings, Deputy Minister Kalousek thus  evidently did not speak the truth, the opposite of which is  called a lie. Klinlab has thus taken over from the institute  well-established activities, clients, and, within the framework  of the UVN [possibly Ustredni Vojenska Nemocnice, Central  Military Hospital], also a monopoly position. What did it pay  for it? Nothing. It only concluded a contract on the lease of  the six-storey building and undertook to pay annual rent of  Kc760,123. Furthermore, the Army "leased to it free of charge"  the appliances and equipment. True, the appliances and  equipment have been leased for a definite period only. However,  this definite period is defined very shrewdly. The formulation  reads: "until a proper lease contract is concluded." The lease  is set to begin on 23 December 1993. Apart from this, just like  in the fictitious supermarket, the Ministry of Defense has left  the working stock at Klinlab's disposal. Was this stock worth  millions or tens of millions? Who cares? A pleasant way of  starting a business, is it not?  <H5>  Good Personal Relations </H5>   It is worth noting that, naturally, there was no  competition.  Another physician, an emigre who has returned from Canada, also  showed interest in the privatization of the complex, a part of  which was subsequently acquired by Klinlab, at the beginning of  last year. He was told that these activities could not be  privatized. In their analysis, the gentlemen from Klinlab also  mention the reasons because of which the lucrative activities  should be transferred to them. Apart from the "traditionally  good personal relations" (between Moravek, Choluj, and the  management of the Army's medical service), they also emphasize  the fact that, when they acquire these activities, the entry of  foreign capital will be prevented. Quite so. But did they not  get the time wrong? And are the economic section of the  Ministry of Defense and Deputy Minister Kalousek not getting it  wrong?    The beetle is lying on its back and does not react to  prodding. You prod again but nothing happens. So you prod even  more strongly, but the beetle still does not move. Could it be  dead? The beetle perhaps, but Defense Minister Antonin Baudys  is unquestionably very much alive, and still he does not react.  Did he choose to act like a dead beetle?</p>

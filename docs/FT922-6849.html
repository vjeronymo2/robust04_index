			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / The Finance Bill: Ex-rebel is 'no sloppy interventionist' - The former health minister who will guide the proposals through the Commons THE Treasury is regarded as the rightwing redoubt of Mr John Major's government. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is as dry on economic policy as any member of the cabinet. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, is as close as anything the Thatcherite wing of the party has to an heir-apparent. But every rule has its exception. In the case of the Treasury it is Mr Stephen Dorrell. The financial secretary, charged over the next few weeks with piloting the Finance Bill through the Commons, is now firmly established among the rising stars in the middle ranks of Mr Major's administration. The responsibilities of the third-ranking member of the Treasury team include the detailed tax work involved in Budget-making along with a brief to give substance to Mr Major's pledge to create a nation of savers and share owners. He is also the minister directly responsible for privatisation, competition and de-regulation. More immediately, Mr Dorrell's oversight of the Civil Service means that he will have to grapple with what is shaping up as a bitter clash over pay with the Whitehall unions. His boyish looks belie a grasp of economics as well as politics that have allowed the 'wringing wet' rebel of the early 1980s to become the Treasury minister of the 1990s. If he proves his mettle over the next two or three years, the reward should be a place on the shortlist for the next batch of entrants to Mr Major's cabinet. It is quite a turnround for the 40-year-old MP for Loughborough, the youngest of the Tory arrivals at Westminster in 1979. He spent most of the first half of the 1980s rebelling against his government's economic strategy. He was once driven by Mrs Thatcher's faith in monetarism to describe his party as 'the better of two evils'. When Mrs Thatcher appointed him to the whips office in 1987, colleagues at Westminster saw it as an inexplicable act of forgiveness by the prime minister. Mr Dorrell, long an acolyte of Mr Peter Walker, is refreshingly unfussed about a past that embraced public opposition to Treasury cuts in unemployment benefit and repeated defiance of Mrs Thatcher's opposition to the European exchange rate mechanism. In the present government the latter view - which in 1986 prompted a public rebuke from Mrs Thatcher - has served to strengthen the relationship he forged with Mr Major during his spell as the whip responsible for Treasury affairs. Like most attached to the One-Nation strand of Toryism, the financial secretary's thoughts on economic policy have moved on: 'We all change, don't we, as we respond to new influences. So, yes, they (his opinions) have changed'. Not all. He is still firmly wedded to the concept of a welfare state that is more than a basic safety-net for the very poorest. 'I'm personally totally committed to the principle, for example, that health and education are services that we should seek to provide not as a safety net but as a universal service . . . and they don't come free.' As the former health minister who spent much of the past two years defending the NHS reforms, though, he is convinced that those services cannot be immune from the disciplines of the private sector. 'What we need to be doing is constantly testing which (public services) have to remain in the public sector and ensure that the efficiency of those which do remain there is constantly tested.' An official who worked with him attests that he is 'no sloppy interventionist'. A large shareholder in and former manager of his family's textile business, Mr Dorrell insists that he has always been committed to low direct taxation to sharpen the incentives that drive wealth creation. He insists that there is no contradiction between the government's pledge for better public services and his responsibilities as financial secre-tary to find new ways of reducing the tax burden. He displays little of the evangelical zeal of those in the party - including Mr Portillo - who believe that a renewed drive to cut income tax must be given priority over virtually all else. Pressed on the right balance between public spending and taxation, Mr Dorrell retreats to the pragmatic response that there is no 'final state of knowledge' on where the line should be drawn. He comments: 'Life isn't like that'. Closer to home, Mr Dorrell is cautious about how the government will live up to its promise to entrench the habit of saving among the less affluent as well as the wealthy. This year's finance bill is unspectacular in polit-ical terms, the left-overs Mr Dorrell's Treasury officials can be expected to explain that, even with the next budget still nine months off, it is not quite as easy as it looks to manipulate the tax system to turn us into a nation of savers. For now, he is reluctant to pre-empt anything that Mr Lamont might have in mind on the tax front. He is apparently unsure how to persuade a sceptical City to support the government's efforts to provide new incentives for individual shareholders. That should not prove too much of a handicap to a man who is as astute a politician as he is hard-working as a minister. It does no harm these days to be seen as the young face of Majorism.</p>

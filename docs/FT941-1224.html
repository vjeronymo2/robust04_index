			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Net profits stabilise at L'Air Liquide L'Air Liquide, the world's largest industrial gases group, saw net profits stabilise last year at FFr2.225bn (Dollars 370m) against FFr2.221bn in 1992. Mr Edouard de Royere, chairman, said the static result had been achieved 'despite the difficult economic situation'. He declined to comment on the group's prospects for the current year but noted the improvement in conditions in both the US and Europe. L'Air Liquide mustered a 1.5 per cent increase in turnover to FFr30.37bn last year from FFr29.92bn in 1992. The group, which last year implemented a wide-ranging internal reorganisation programme, maintained its level of investment during 1993, but managed to reduce gearing by two percentage points, to 18 per cent.</p>

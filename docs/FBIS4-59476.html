			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 15 May (MENA) -- A new 314-strong Palestinian  police force commanded by Colonel 'Abd-al-Majid Fadl Salih  crossed at the Rafah border point on the way to Gaza today.    Col. Salih said the unit comes from the 'Ayn Jalut forces in  Egypt together with some personnel from the forces stationed in  Libya and Sudan.    Salih said the deployment of the Palestinian police forces  continues in Gaza and Jericho. He said Badr forces have been  deployed in Jericho and Rafah and that the northern, central,  and southern sectors of the Gaza Strip have also been covered  through deployment in Khan Yunus, Dayr al-Balah, Jabaliyh, and  al- Shaja'iyah. It remains for the Palestinian force to deploy  in Gaza City and the Eretz checkpoint on the border between  Palestine and Israel, he said.    He said Palestinian police forces are now working to  maintain  security and order and protect vital installations, such as  electricity and water stations, custom departments, ports, and  airports.    Col. Salih praised the facilities provided by Egypt and the  efforts made by the Egyptian Administration at the Customs  Office, Passport Department, and border security to organize the  entry of Palestinian forces.</p>

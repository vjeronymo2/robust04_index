			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: Television The battle of the the sexes is likely to be fought out on sofas across Britain as Panorama (Monday, 9.30-10.10pm, BBC1) takes on the masculinist backlash and asks why boys are so badly done by? Girls now do better than boys at every level of education, and women are out-smarting men in the boardroom and beating them to some of the best jobs. The reason, according to this programme, is an inbuilt bias against men. So do boys now need positive discrimination? A new series of Cutting Edge (Monday, 9.00-10.00pm, C4) begins with a wince-inducing but very watchable fly-on-the-tiled-wall documentary on dentistry. The patients range from a toddler with a mouth full of stumps to a woman who worries about her teeth falling out during copulation. The programme-makers are so keen on an authentic ambience that the sound engineers attempted to make the drill sound just like it does when it's resonating through your cranial cavities. The director's director de jour is Quentin Tarantino, a former video salesman, and it shows. His films are stuffed so full of references to other films they almost distract you from the violence. As his latest, Pulp Fiction, opens, Omnibus (Tuesday, 10.25-11.20pm, BBC1) finds out why his work is considered too gamey for video release, while the big-name actors he attracts talk about his talent. ITV's hunger for a popular drama to rival The Sweeney has cooked up Ellington (Wednesday, 8.30-10.00pm), in which Chris Ellison plays a sports promotor and erstwhile boxer who hasn't given up fighting: one paw is still pushed inside a boxing glove while the other is signing deals. It's all here: sharp suits, shooters and shady women. But our hero is too clean to be entirely convincing. Panel games and political satire go together like Enoch Powell and Tony Benn, but Have I Got News For You (Friday, 10.00-10.30pm, BBC2) manages to make the combination work. Expect more name-calling between quiz master Angus Deayton and team captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, who will be rubbing knees this season with a line-up which includes Glenda Jackson and Teddy Taylor. A new season of Performance begins with a revival of Dennis Potter's prophetically-named Message For Posterity (Saturday, 9.30-11.10pm, BBC2) written in 1967. John Neville is the prime minister forced out of office sitting for his portrait, and Eric Porter the painter whose political palette is restricted to the red end of the spectrum. Quintessential early Potter with its contrast between public and private morality and a script that is finely honed.</p>

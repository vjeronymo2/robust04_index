			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Secondary issues set peak as Dow firms Wall Street Although blue chip issues mainly continued to drift in directionless trading yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended modestly firmer, while secondary stocks advanced to set a new high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow blue chip indicator was up 11.07 at 3,253.02, near its high for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.12 at 435.49, while the Nasdaq composite was 3.33 higher at 700.77, another record close for the index. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 257.6m shares. The markets are currently trapped in a pattern of narrow gains, punctuated by the occasional sell-off, reflecting that investors are searching for an external lead, but finding nothing. Corporate earnings in the latest quarterly reporting season have been inconclusive, neither sufficiently positive or negative to affect sentiment. As for the economic background, conditions continue to improve, but at a disappointingly slow pace. The 'Beige Book' report yesterday found that retail sales were 'significantly better' over the Christmas holiday season, a general improvement in manufacturing, more strength in the residential housing market, and increased loan demand. The Federal Reserve said, however, that the upturn in various industrial sectors has not sparked an improvement in the depressed labour markets. McDonnell Douglas rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 1/2 in spite of a 42 per cent decline in income from continuing operations during the final quarter of 1992. Investors, however, were cheered by a statement from McDonnell that said, but for its C17 military aircraft programme, the government aerospace programmes had their best year in the company's history. McDonnell was also optimistic about the outlook for 1993, including the C17 programme. Tandem Computers was the most active stock, falling Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 14 1/8 in volume of 8.2m shares after disappointing the market with fiscal first-quarter net income of Dollars 17.5m, or 16 cents a share. Bank shares were in mixed form following recent results which showed an improvement in sector earnings. Wells Fargo remained in strong demand, rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 98 1/4 . Bear Stearns eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 3/8 on news that fiscal second-quarter earnings at the broking firm fell 17 per cent to Dollars 64.3m, primarily as the result of lower investment banking and principal trading revenues. On the Nasdaq market, the composite index was lifted by a strong performance from its leading stock, Microsoft, which advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 89 1/2 as 2.3m shares changed hands. Canada A FALLING Canadian dollar and bond market sent stocks lower in active trading. The TSE 300 index receded 15.1 to 3,275.1, while declining issues outpaced rises by 358 to 248 after volume of 41.7m shares. The banks index slipped 0.9 per cent. An analyst said investors' confidence in the Canadian banks' earnings potential is slipping. News that Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has made two issues of preferred shares weighed heavily on the sector and CIBC slid CDollars 7/8 to CDollars 24.</p>

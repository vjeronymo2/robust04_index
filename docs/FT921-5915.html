			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Public schools face up to fees crisis: Pupils are being withdrawn as the recession hits parents' ability to pay, say heads PUPILS whose parents have fallen behind with school fees are having to leave England's public schools, as the independent sector experiences its most acute economic downturn for more more than a decade. Boarding schools have been worst affected, experiencing an average four per cent decline in pupil numbers last year even before the recession began to bite. At a conference of independent school heads in London this week, almost every head teacher approached reported some pupils being withdrawn because parents could not cope with fees. Most schools represented at the conference have lost three or four pupils this year - 'but talk to any bursar, and he'll tell you the actual leavers are the tip of the iceberg', said one head. With the recession hitting hardest in the south - home to the majority of public schools - many middle class parents are falling behind with fees, and some have had to give up trying to pay them. Mrs Jean Glover, educational grants adviser to the Independent Schools Information Service, said applications for help had doubled to 1,000 last year, with a similar number expected this year. Charitable help is available to keep children at schools, but cannot pay arrears. Many parents left it too late to ask for help, said Mrs Glover. None of the big schools is yet threatening to close its doors, but many smaller institutions - particularly boarding schools - face acute financial problems. Some heads forecast widespread closures unless the situation improves. Independent schools are faced with matching this year's 7.8 per cent teachers' pay award in the state sector. Fee increases announced this year are averaging above 9 per cent - more than twice the inflation rate, after a decade of steeply increasing fees. Even before the increase, annual fees averaged Pounds 6,700 a year for boarding schools, and Pounds 3,600 for day schools. Mr Jeremy Nichols, headmaster of Stowe School, Bucks, said: 'Things are clearly tight. The recession has hit our parents as much as anybody else. We are all concerned because of the current situation, but at the moment it is not panic measures.' Only one pupil has been withdrawn because of problems with fees, according to Mr Nichols. 'We do try to help out in cases of real need and distress. Provided that parents get in touch with the school bursar that is fine. One would hate to pull the rug from a child on financial grounds,' he said. Major Gerard Cox, bursar of Badminton School, Bristol, said that the school had lost two or three pupils in the last six months. 'At the beginning of term I rather thought we were going to have problems. 'People rang up and said, 'Awfully sorry, old boy, it's going to be a bit late this year.' But what I thought would be a flood has remained a trickle. In fact, the speed our fees were paid this term was the fastest ever.' He suggested that many parents gave school fees priority over other bills. 'People are very optimistic. They tend to say, 'once the recession is over, we shan't need help,''. However, a prominent West Country school reported that only 92 per cent of its fees had been collected in January, against 98 per cent for the same month last year. 'When you work on our margins, that's a pretty gloomy position', said its head.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Pentagon was chided for making little progress toward major reform of the  Defense Department. Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.), chairman of the House  Armed Services investigations subcommittee, said "it has been 2 1/2 years since  passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. At some point, 'trying to implement' the  law becomes basic non-compliance with its provisions." The Goldwater-Nichols  Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 strengthened the authority of  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in advising on the budget and  evaluating preparedness by, among other things, shifting responsibilities from  the members to the chairman and creating the position of vice chairman.  </P></p>

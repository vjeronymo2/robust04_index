			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text]Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS -- The Baltics have coordinated  their common tactics and aims for the talks with Russia,  Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar said at a press conference  today.    Laar was speaking to reporters after returning from  Stockholm  where Laar, his Latvian counterpart Valdis Birkavs, and  Lithuania's Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius attended an  annual meeting of the Nordic Council.    But Laar declined to elaborate on the topic of the common  tactics.    He said relations of all three with Russia were quite  similar  at the moment.    "Also the situation of Lithuania is not much better than  that  of Estonia and Latvia, because problems are created by the  Kaliningrad region and Russia's military transits through  Lithuania. When Estonia and Latvia once succeed in getting the  Russian troops out, the Kaliningrad region surely will become  one of the main security political problems of the Baltic  region," the Estonian leader said.    He added that the Nordic prime ministers had issued  clear-worded political support to demands by Estonia and Latvia  that Russian troops be pulled out from these countries by Aug.  31.    The Nordic prime ministers in a statement issued at the  meeting Monday said Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia  and Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994.    Laar said it was very important that the statement included  the final date for the troop withdrawal.    He said the meeting in Stockholm had named absurd Russia's  demands that Estonia must pay 23 million U.S. dollars to build  houses for the repatriated Russian military.    "Some of the Nordic countries have already allocated money  for building flats for military leaving to Russia and have also  signed agreements on the issue. Sweden is ready to allocate  money at once after the troop withdrawal agreement is signed.  There was also an idea voiced in Stockholm that the aid should  be channeled directly to the Baltic countries if Russia  continues its present course," Laar said.    The Estonian prime minister had separate meetings in  Stockholm with prime ministers Carl Bildt of Sweden and Esko Aho  of Finland.    "At those bilateral meetings I didn't deal with complaining  about the situation that has emerged, but tried to seek concrete  ways for solution. For Estonia speedy integration with Europe  surely is one possibility," he concluded.</p>

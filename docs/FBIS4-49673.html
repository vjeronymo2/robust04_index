			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Vice-Chairman  Tian Jiyun of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) said  here today that his four-nation South-Pacific trip has achieved  the purpose of "increasing understanding, getting acquainted  with friends and promoting cooperation."    Tian, who is leading an NPC delegation now on a visit to  Australia, described his visit to the four South-Pacific nations  as a "successful, satisfactory and fruitful one."    In an interview with the Chinese reporters based in  Australia  here today, Tian said there is no fundamental conflict of  interests between the four countries and China, and on the  contrary, they share many common interests.    "To keep peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, to  make the pace of each country's development more faster and to  make the life of their people better" are the common desires of  China and these countries, Tian stressed.    Tian said both Australia and New Zealand believed that "we  bear the important and historic responsibilities for  safeguarding peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region."    On the prospect for cooperation between China and the four  nations, Tian said that the economies of both China and the four  nations have strong complements and the potential is great for  furthering economic and trade cooperation.    He mentioned particularly the considerable potential of  cooperation between China and both Australia and New Zealand.    He cited as an example the husbandry industry of New  Zealand,  which he said has unique strong points in improving the  grassland and the breed of ox and sheep.    Tian also talked of the rich resources that Australia  boasts,  saying that China has a considerable demand for resources as  China is striving for achieving its goal of modernization.    He stressed that as China is on its way towards  modernization, "China should not only expand its markets in the  world, but also find resources markets outside the country."    Tian believed that China, while paying attention to the  markets in Europe, America and Japan, "must attach importance to  the South-Pacific region."    "There is much room for China to manoeuver in expanding  trade  and cooperation in the region," he added.    Pointing to the importance of parliamentary diplomacy, Tian  said, "to do a good job in this regard can play a major role in  increasing friendship and cooperation between China and the  countries in the world."    During his visit to the four nations, Tian met leaders of  the  parliaments and governments, had extensive contacts with the  parliamentarians and exchanged views with the figures from the  industrial and business circles on furthering bilateral economic  and trade cooperation.    Tian left here for Brisbane this afternoon to continue his  visit in Australia, the last leg of his four-nation tour.</p>

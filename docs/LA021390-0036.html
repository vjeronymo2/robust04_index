			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONSTELLATION AWEIGH; 1ST OF 2 CARRIERS LEAVES  </P> <P> The aircraft carrier Constellation pulled out of San Diego Monday morning,  departing for a 29-month overhaul and leaving questions in its wake about the  carrier presence at one of the Navy's major bases.  </P> <P> For the city, the Constellation's departure means an annual loss of more than  $45 million in sailors' payroll, supplies and services. But the exact price tag  of the carrier's departure is unknown because Navy officials do not calculate  how much will be lost when the spouses and families of the 2,500 crew members  also depart.  </P> <P> "In the short term, we are not going to feel it," said Pete Litrenta, vice  president of military affairs with the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.  "Initially, it will seem like the ship is going out on a deployment."  </P> <P> The San Diego area is host to 145,000 Navy personnel and benefits from about  $9.5 billion in annual military expenditures, so the loss of one aircraft  carrier is not significant, Litrenta said. After the Constellation's  $750-million refurbishment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, the 85,000-ton  carrier is scheduled to return to San Diego in early 1993, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob  Pritchard, a Navy spokesman.  </P> <P> The Constellation's refurbishment will include improving the engineering plant,  combat systems, and living quarters. As part of the Navy's Service Life  Extension program, workers will also overhaul the aircraft launching and  arresting equipment.  </P> <P> The Constellation's departure leaves San Diego with two aircraft carriers, the  Independence and the Ranger. But the situation could easily change. The  Independence is slated for a June, 1991, deployment to Japan, where it will  replace the aging carrier Midway, high-ranking Navy officers said. The Midway  was commissioned in 1945 and is one of the Navy's oldest carriers. Some say it  has outlived its usefulness.  </P> <P> With the Constellation absent for repairs and the Independence in Japan, San  Diego would be left with one carrier.  </P> <P> "I am not going to start crying that the sky is falling until I know what the  Navy's plans are," Litrenta said. "But a million here, a million there -- it  starts adding up to some real money."  </P> <P> For San Diego and other Navy hosts, there is considerable uncertainty as  President Bush hammers out a new military budget that calls for the closing of  bases and the mothballing of ships. Under the latest proposal, two carriers in  Northern California -- the Carl Vinson and the Enterprise -- would need a home  port. San Diego, some say, would be a logical choice.  </P> <P> And, while lawmakers haggle over a variety of other military expenses, none yet  have questioned the aircraft carriers. But Navy officers are quick to jump to  their defense.  </P> <P> "If you want to be able to influence events in the world, then there is no  better platform than an aircraft carrier." said Capt. Tom Slater, commanding  officer of the Independence.  </P> <P> Navy pilots who fly and land aboard the 1,079-foot-long Constellation will  remain unaffected by the carrier's new assignment. The aircraft squadrons once  assigned to the Constellation are now assigned to the Independence, Pritchard  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Observer: Gobbledygook Good to see that Britain's Labour party is taking Al Gore's grand address on US policy for telecommunications 'super highways' so seriously. Even before the US vice-president had spoken yesterday, Jim Cousins, Labour's 'communications spokesperson', had issued his response via an electronic fax statement. Unfortunately, something was lost in transmission. It began with 'UnlessweactsoonweU&gt;willu&gt; beAEleftoout*of', and the rest was equally unintelligible.</p>

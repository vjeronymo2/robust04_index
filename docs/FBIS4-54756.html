This transpires from data the  Slovak Statistical Office published in late April. According to  this data, the CR remains Slovakia's key trading partner.  Slovakia exports to the CR 37.6 percent of all of its total  export volume and obtains from the CR 30.4 percent of its  imports. Compared with the same period last year, Slovak  exports to the CR declined 2.2 percent, while imports went up  14.7 percent.    Apart from some food and agricultural products, such as  cheese, wheat, corn, sweets, chocolate, bakery products, wine,  and fruit juice, the CR purchases in Slovakia chiefly chemical  products--mineral oils, gasoline, mineral fertilizers, paints  and varnishes, herbicides, plastic goods, tires, and hides.  Products of the consumer goods industry that the CR purchases in  Slovakia include bathtubs, showers, washbasins, beef hides,  wooden pallets and wood, combed and carded cotton, and all kinds  of bottles, flasks, and demijohns.    Metallurgical, engineering, and electrical engineering  products--rolled iron and steel products, wire, generators,  pumps, excavators, bulldozers, lathes, forming machines, ball  bearings, and tractors--represent an important part of Slovak  exports to the CR. Important Slovak export commodities include,  furthermore, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines,  television sets, forklift trucks, and transformers.    Slovak imports consisted mainly of food--cream, fermented  milk, yogurt, fats, sugar, salami and sausages, sweets, and  bakery products. Slovakia imports from the CR, furthermore,  coal, briquettes and coke, gasoline, mineral oils,  pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, plastic products, rubber, tires, and  newsprint.

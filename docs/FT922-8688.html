			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Cascades to take control of Paperboard Industries CASCADES, the Canadian packaging products group with three plants in Europe, plans to buy 50 per cent of Toronto-based Paperboard Industries, become its managing partner and also take an option on the remaining 50 per cent. Paperboard, with 17 plants in Canada and the US, has 3,000 employees and annual sales of well over CDollars 500m (USDollars 416m). It is profitable in spite of being hit by the recession. The company has been owned by a group of banks led by the Royal Bank of Canada for the past two years, following the failure of the previous owner. Paperboard and Cascades would form a company ranking in the top five international packaging groups. Domtar, a big pulp and paper and building products group, lost CDollars 46m, or 46 cents a share, in the first quarter, against a loss of CDollars 28m, or 35 cents, a year earlier, on unchanged sales of CDollars 450m. Domtar, Canada's largest fine paper producer, suffered very weak prices though demand increased. It hopes to break even late this year and return to profitability in 1993.</p>

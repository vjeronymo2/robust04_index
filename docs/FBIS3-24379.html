			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, by N. Batalova: </F> "We Cannot Leave the People of Sevastopol Alone"; place and date  not given]    [Text] We are perhaps only just beginning to comprehend the  extent of the tragedy. The tragedy of people who, at the whim of  politicians, have ended up separated from their motherland,  outside of their own country. It has singed Russians and our  hometown Muscovites.    Recall how proud we were to see points on the map of the  Union named in honor of the capital. State farms named  "Moskovskiy" and "Krasnopresnenskiy" were organized on the  virgin lands of Kazakhstan: it was from Moscow railway stations  that trainloads of young people departed to develop the virgin  lands. We were proud that boys at the Moskva frontier post were  guarding the country's borders.    But could the soldiers of the Moskva frontier detachment  ever  have expected that the border would cross the hot Tajik-Afghan  mountains? Could the virgin-land developers have imagined, even  momentarily, that Moscow and their native Presnya would now be  in another country?    And now, at the center of political, not ocean, storms is  the  antisubmarine missile cruiser Moskva, a ship of the Black Sea  Fleet. Each morning the command is given on board the cruiser,  as it is on all the ships based in Sevastopol: "Hoist the flag!"  And the flag of Russia unfurls over the fleet's ships. The  sailors remain true to their oath of allegiance. To them the  Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet, just as Sevastopol, city of  Russian glory and great historical military traditions of the  Russian state, is a Russian national shrine.    Perhaps that is why one of the signs in Sevastopol greeting  the Moscow delegation headed by Mayor Yu. Luzhkov bore the  words: "Sevastopol--Moscow--Russia!" The delegation visited the  city during Fatherland Defenders' Day. We asked Yuriy  Mikhaylovich Luzhkov to comment on that visit.    "First, the purpose of our visit. Our primary purpose was to  meet with fellow Muscovites, sailors serving on the cruiser  Moskva. That day we wanted to meet the crew of a ship which for  many years has been under the patronage of the capital's  enterprises and organizations whose names include the name  Moscow. Muscovites fully realize how difficult it is to serve in  the Black Sea Fleet, how difficult it is today for sailors and  their families waiting for them on shore, how difficult it is  for the people of Sevastopol. Our Il-76 plane delivered 30 tons  of food gifts: sugar, canned meat, products of a Moscow cracker  and dried lunch plant, cigarettes, toiletries. Personnel of the  Moskva and Moskovskiy department stores prepared gifts for the  sailors, officers and children. Our delegation included  performers, and it was good to see how Moscow artists were  received on the cruiser and at the Culture House.    "In Sevastopol we keenly felt how much such meetings mean to  people. We spoke with sailors and many inhabitants of the city:  they spoke frankly of the situation developing in Sevastopol and  around it. Indeed, how is that, in a city where the majority of  the population are Russians for whom Russian is their native  language, all business is conducted in the Ukrainian language  and the people cannot view Russian TV programs? Currently there  are only two Russian-language newspapers in Sevastopol, and  radio broadcasts are also only in Ukrainian. Kindergartens,  schools and other educational establishments are being  Ukrainized. The Ukrainian authorities are doing all this  contrary to the interests and desires of the bulk of the city  population.    "People may say that today Ukraine is an independent country  with its own state language. But the thing is that Sevastopol is  a very special city. In conversations with people we felt that  they cannot conceive of themselves outside of Russia. They  consider themselves a part of Russia. That is why people here  respond so keenly and painfully to any injustice or  ill-considered action of the administration.    "Some may not like my words, some may protest, but I must  say: our delegation gained the impression that the Ukrainian  authorities were not too eager for us to meet with the people of  Sevastopol, so the plane's landing was switched several times  from one airfield to another.    "Yet we were traveling to Sevastopol with the best  intentions. We consider that Russians and Muscovites cannot  leave the people of Sevastopol alone. They must help them  resolve vitally important social problems. That is why we  attended a ceremony to lay the foundation of a 100-apartment  house, construction of which will be paid for with money  provided by a Moscow construction complex. Sailors will receive  housing already this year."    "Will apartments in it be offered only to officers from the  cruiser Moskva?"    "Those from our protege cruiser first, of course. But the  housing problem is so acute for the Black Sea Fleet that  apartments will also probably be offered to others in need.    "But I must say that resolution of the housing problem in  Sevastopol is aggravated by the fact that politics is  intervening in such a seemingly essentially public matter.  Imagine an officer who needs an apartment, but he is a Russian  officer and serves in the Russian navy; he is a Russian citizen,  but to get an apartment he must become a Ukrainian citizen,  because that country doesn't recognize dual citizenship. You can  imagine what it means for a man of honor and duty to get a  passport of another country.    "I think it is necessary to formulate a special statute for  Sevastopol. Without that it is impossible to resolve its  problems and create suitable conditions for the sailors'  military service. The Russian government must finally say its  word. After all, the Black Sea Fleet protects the frontiers of  Russia. It is a guarantor of peace in the Black Sea region. As  for me, firstly, I will report our delegation's impressions of  this visit to the president. Secondly, we have already appealed  to the administration heads of 22 Russian regions whose  representatives serve on ships and in units of the Black Sea  Fleet, asking to help the sailors and people of Sevastopol in  today's hard times: they should constantly feel that Russia is  concerned for them and will not abandon them. That they are  Russians."</p>

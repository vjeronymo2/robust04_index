			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Nafta Relief over Nafta's passage through Congress is not confined to the Clinton Administration. Financial markets, too, have been spared a nasty shock, but that does not give them much of an excuse to forge ahead as yesterday's Wall Street reaction showed. Nafta will not change the perception that US equity ratings are stretched or that bond prices are vulnerable to signs of inflationary pressure. Indeed, given the existing trade agreement between the US and Canada and the low average Mexican tariffs on US imports, Nafta will do little to alter short run US growth expectations. Its main impact is psychological. Inevitably, expectations for a successful Gatt deal will grow. Ironically, though, Nafta - and regional trade policies generally - were always seen in the US as an alternative to the Gatt. With such a fall-back in place, the US Congress may have less incentive to accept a Gatt agreement, which in any case depends heavily on an end to French intransigence. The big winner ought to be Mexico. The relative impact of Nafta on its economy, which is only 5 per cent that of the US and Canada combined, will be considerable. But Mexican equities had already risen sharply in the run-up to the vote and the overvalued peso is a cloud on the horizon. As the excitement wears off, there may be a temptation to sell on the good news south of the Rio Grande too.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OUT: AQMD RULES TO AFFECT WHAT PROJECTS BUILT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: NEW AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT POLICY WILL INFLUENCE ALL MAJOR  PROJECTS, INCLUDING OFFICE BUILDINGS, SHOPPING CENTERS AND INDUSTRIAL PARKS.  </P> <P> The Southern California real estate development industry will soon undergo the  most dramatic changes since the imposition of environmental impact reports in  the 1970s. Why?  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), under the mandate of  the state and federal governments, is determined to improve Southern  California's air quality by regulating all significant direct and indirect  sources of pollution -- including buildings.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the AQMD board adopted a policy of evaluating and commenting  on every regionally significant real estate project that requires an  environmental impact statement, including office buildings with more than  250,000 square feet, shopping centers with at least 500,000 square feet,  industrial parks employing more than 1,000 people and even residential  developments with 500 or more dwellings.  </P> <P> The AQMD will recommend air-quality mitigation measures for local government to  consider on these projects.  </P> <P> To thrive under these new circumstances, developers and architects must  carefully study proposed AQMD regulations that will affect what, how and where  projects are built. With this knowledge, developers and architects can  effectively plan the building of the future -- one that will meet the impending  municipal or AQMD pollution-reducing requirements.  </P> <P> "Sources of a building's pollution emissions fall into two categories: direct  and indirect," said James M. Lents, AQMD chief executive officer. "The direct  pollution primarily comes from building systems and maintenance work. The  indirect sources are the building's energy consumption, which causes pollution  at distant power plants, and the automobiles used by employees for commuting to  work."  </P> <P> The most common source of direct pollution comes from architectural coatings  that protect and color the facades of office, industrial and retail buildings.  The solvents in many paints contain large amounts of "reactive organic gases"  that are destabilized by sunlight and then combine with nitrogen dioxide in the  lower atmosphere to form smog.  </P> <P> To replace these pollution-generating coatings, proposed AQMD regulations would  require water-soluble, lower-solvent and higher-solid coatings. In addition,  developers may be required to use permanent materials like concrete or brick,  which do not require any pollution-generating coatings.  </P> <P> Another source of direct pollution at commercial buildings is water heaters and  the boilers for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which  produce carbon monoxide as a major byproduct of natural gas combustion. To  reduce these carbon monoxide emissions, developers may be urged to install more  efficient boilers.  </P> <P> One potential technology, now under study by the AQMD, is the "fuel cell." In  this system, each building has its own on-site generator powered by natural  gas, which is converted to clean-burning hydrogen before its combustion in the  fuel cell. The waste heat of this generator is reclaimed and warms the hot  water tank and the boiler, which supplies the building's heat.  </P> <P> For office and retail buildings, indirect sources are the major cause of  pollution.  </P> <P> The most important indirect source is the exhaust from the motor vehicles that  take people to and from work or on personal errands during the day. Motor  vehicles alone account for 90% of the carbon monoxide, 70% of the nitrogen  oxides and 50% of the reactive organic gases that degrade Southern California's  air quality.  </P> <P> With the recent implementation of Regulation 15 ("the commuter program"), the  AQMD is requiring Southland firms with more than 100 employees to enact  trip-reduction plans such as ride-share programs and mass transit use  incentives.  </P> <P> In addition, the AQMD will influence the design of parking structures at office  buildings. In the near future, fewer parking spaces will be provided relative  to an office's floor area than is customary today, and more "priority" spaces  will be reserved for van pool and car-pool vehicles, plus bicycles.  </P> <P> Additionally, the AQMD will probably encourage large office complexes to  include on-site services and amenities -- such as day-care centers,  restaurants, small markets and drugstores -- so that employees will not need to  make automobile errands during the day.  </P> <P> AQMD also will encourage companies to enact "flex-time" programs in which many  employees work during off-peak hours. And flex-time will affect the planning  and management of the building of the future.  </P> <P> Security will become a big factor, because employees will be entering buildings  during night-time hours. Card-operated security systems, which provide  continuous protection without requiring round-the-clock security guards, will  become increasingly common.  </P> <P> Heating, air-conditioning and lighting systems will be highly customized  because employees will be using only fractions of the total floor area during  off-peak hours.  </P> <P> Ventilation and lighting systems that operate on a single on/off switch will  become obsolete. Instead, office lighting and each floor's ventilation will be  individually controlled by the employees who work there or by a central  computer.  </P> <P> The AQMD also will promote increased "telecommuting" by office employees.  Through the use of advanced communications, employees can perform various tasks  without leaving the office and making motor vehicle trips.  </P> <P> For instance, modem pooling allows employees at separate locations to work  simultaneously on the same project at their computer screens.  </P> <P> Another common form of telecommuting is teleconferencing, which allows  executives in widely dispersed facilities to conduct meetings without traveling  to a single site.  </P> <P> Besides influencing building design and construction throughout Southern  California, the AQMD also supports the development of balanced communities to  prevent a jobs/housing imbalance.  </P> <P> This imbalance is the shortage of employment opportunities in new, outlying  suburbs that forces those residents to make long, pollution-generating drives  to work and, conversely, the surplus of jobs in other areas that causes  congestion during peak business hours.  </P> <P> To facilitate a better jobs/housing balance, the AQMD is removing from existing  rules the requirements that discourage the relocation of industry within the  air basin.  </P> <P> Once again, Southern California is becoming a trend-setter for the nation's  real estate development industry, and the environmentally sensitive building of  the future will reduce the region's air pollution and improve the quality of  life for its residents.  </P> <P> Of course, some Southland developers, architects and builders will not like  these sweeping changes in their industry.  </P> <P> However, the AQMD enjoys widespread popular support, and environmental  protection has become a mainstream political force throughout California.  </P> <P> And the changes are almost here, if Lents' strong statements and the AQMD's  plans are any indication. Those architects and developers who adapt to these  new conditions will prosper in coming years.  </P></p>

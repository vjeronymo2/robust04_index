			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] As Russia's new government set down to work on  Friday, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was speaking in an  exclusive interview with INTERFAX News Agency.    IF: How did you get on with the President while discussing  the make up of a new cabinet? Is it possible to speak in terms  of a "government crisis?"    CHERNOMYRDIN: To start with your second question, I think it  is not at all serious to talk of a government crisis as such.  Of course, in a society as divided and turbulent as ours is  there are forces seeking to sow the seeds of chaos and panic so  as to fish in troubled waters.    But all of it is simpler than that in reality. Under the  country's new constitution, the Prime Minister submits a list of  cabinet members to the head of state. Naturally, the President  and I had to discuss at length both the key cabinet figures and  a new government team as a whole, but there is nothing unusual  about that.    As in any team, there is a clash of interests in a  government. So we tried to pick up a team of the like-minded  individuals. I hope I have managed to do so after all. To  offset any speculations about the new government's make up, I  would like to say this: I myself am to work with these people,  not someone else, so I will be personally responsible for my  choice.    Of course, my consultations with Boris Yeltsin were far from  smooth but we had both sought the same goal: to create a team of  professionals seeking to update the country through reforms.    IF: Much was said about incompatible differences during the  latest cabinet shake up. What is the cause and substance of  those differences if there were any?    CHERNOMYRDIN: To begin with, there have always been  differences and no one tried to hide them. On the contrary,  there was much said and written about them, that the divisions  on ways of embracing reforms had deepened. But all of this is  in the past.    But I think it is more important to realize one thing: the  country, the society and economy are in a difficult period of  transition and each stage has its own logic and priorities.    The time has now come to focus attention on curbing  production slump in all economic sectors as the only way to  resolve the gamut of social problems facing the country.    What sort of reforms or democracy can one talk about at a  time when huge enterprises and private businesses come to a  standstill while coal miners, oil workers, doctors and  journalists go on strike? When private farmers, cooperatives  and state farms are starved of cash to buy equipment, fuel,  fertilizers and cornseed in the run up to this year's sowing  campaign?    No matter how progressive, theory as such cannot salvage a  huge country from shortages of food, energy and commodities and  by definition, from social upheavals which will make the reforms  next to impossible. If we fail to boost up production, we will  fail to salvage the newly-emerging market economy. This is an  axiom.    IF: Don't you think that a cabinet must be made up of people  upholding different views on the direction of reforms?    CHERNOMYRDIN: A government called upon to run a huge country  at a hard time such as the present is not a debating society.  This is obvious.    There is no time for "flash in the pan"-style discussions. I  prefer a team of the like-minded individuals, which is alone  capable of acting with a fair amount of efficiency.    But this does not mean we are against any sensible  opposition  provided it offers its own cure for the problem. More  importantly, we prefer precisely this style of work. Some  observers try in vain to suggest that Chernomyrdin had  ostensibly formed a government of silent consensus. This is not  true and I hope the country will be able to ascertain this in  the next few months.    IF: Do you think the latest shake up will lead to some  corrections in the pace of reforms? If so, what changes are  likely to be made?    CHERNOMYRDIN: It seems we have been carried away too far  with putting labels on leading politicians such as reformist  democrats or hardline upholders of the state planning and so on.  This leads to a situation when the role of a personality is  blown out of proportion.    It is clear to all and sundry that the reform is past the  point of no return. The main task now is to try to enforce  reforms with the least possible sacrifice for the society, each  individual and each household. There is no tragedy if one  government member is replaced by another. This is a normal  process. Besides, we would not take up the job if we were  uncertain about our ability to halt the production slump. There  is an abundance of those who criticize us but not many who are  prepared to do the daily work, something that we are ready to  cope with it.    IF: The new government is widely described as being made up  of a managerial corps lacking an explicit macroeconomic policy.  Does the cap fit?    CHERNOMYRDIN: I do want to deprive those cap passers of  their daily bread though some of their descriptions are far from  being decent at times. Perhaps, it would be more correct to  describe the new cabinet as a team of pragmatists aiming to  fulfil concrete tasks. But it would be absolutely wrong to say  we are out to throw macroeconomic approaches overboard. The  government is not alone, it leans upon an enormous scientific  basis and experts of world renown. This means, we will be able  to co-relate global issues with the solving of day-to-day tasks  without which the country will not be able to survive.    IF: In what way do you think the emergence of a new  government will affect Russia's relations with international  financial institutions and the problem of the country's foreign  debt?    CHERNOMYRDIN: I state with full responsibility that new  government appointments will in no way affect Russia's  obligations to its foreign partners. Russia will continue to  service its debt in line with the conditions and schedule set by  the IMF, the World Bank and other financial structures of the  West.    The same applies to our commitments in respect of separate  countries. Our partners should not have even the slightest  cause for concern.    Russia's policy on this remains unchanged and does not  depend  on separate cabinet members. President Yeltsin himself acts as  guarantor of this.    IF: What do you make of a sharp fall in the ruble rate in  the past few days?    CHERNOMYRDIN: I think it must be clear to all by now that  the setback earlier this week had nothing to do either with the  economic situation or government actions.    The ruble gained somewhat on Thursday which indicates that  the panic caused by a government reshuffle is now subsiding.  The banks' behavior at the currency market also indicate that  panic buying of the dollar was artificial because of being  caused by irresponsible statements by some of the government  staff members.</p>

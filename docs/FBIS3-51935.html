Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, delivering the  traditional throne speech at the opening of a new session of  parliament, said particular attention would be paid to the  special needs of low wage earners, the unemployed, senior  citizens, women and young people.    "We will strengthen mechanisms aimed at ensuring that the  fruits of economic expansion are equitably shared and enjoyed by  all categories of persons in the society," Sir Clement told the  National Assembly.    "We will also continue to implement a variety of programmes  .... To provide a social safety net for the protection of lower  income groups," the head of state added.    As Sir Clement spoke, loud explosions could be heard outside  as the police fired stun grenades to keep back a crowd of  opposition supporters calling for new elections.    The four elected St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party MPs boycotted  the ceremony. [passage omitted]</p>

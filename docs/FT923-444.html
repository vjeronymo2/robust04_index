			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (19): A bitter toast to Seagram's Mr Sam SAMUEL BRONFMAN: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SEAGRAM'S MR SAM by Michael A MarrusUniversity Press of New England Dollars 35 AFTER READING this authorised biography of the leader of Canada's Jewish community I am profoundly glad my paternal grandfather never got there as he had intended. For in Canada - more than in most non-European countries - anti-Semitism survived the Holocaust alive and well. As late as 1947 the country's director of immigration was still talking of the danger of 'expanding non-assimilable racial groups', and you may be sure he was not referring to any potential Gentile threat. Bronfman's attitude to this ingrained anti-Semitism was typical of his generation: he simply tried to conform the harder, to make even more obsessive efforts to prove himself (and thus Jews in general) worthy of the marvellous society in which he - quite genuinely in his case - felt honoured to live. Younger generations would do well not to sneer at what must now seem like Uncle-Tomism. Unlike Bronfman and the majority of the Jewish community (in Britain and the US as well as in Canada) they can afford to ignore the intermittent pogroms and endemic persecution in Tsarist Russia from which Mr Sam's family fled in the last quarter of the 19th century. The Jewish dimension - which was inherited by his son Edgar, now president of the World Jewish Congress - is one of the most fascinating aspects of a biography which, although authorised, gives a rounded, and thus pretty 'wartish', portrait of an extraordinary monster - 'Mr Sam,' founder and inspirer of one of the world's dominant liquor groups, and the only one now not controlled from Britain. Allowing facts to speak for themselves is a good way of getting round the difficulties and limitations inevitable with an authorised biography - though it helps when the younger generation does not mind the author describing what a terrible parent the founder was. He was absent most of the time, on his weekly commute from the family home in Montreal to New York, and when he was at home insisted on the combination of strict formality and unreasonably high expectations which mar the childhood of most children of obsessive high achievers; although they did not have to endure the outbreaks of vicious and foul-mouthed temper which regularly marked his dealings with underlings, they also seem to have been received fewer of the spontaneous acts of kindness of which he was also capable. Mr Sam was driven, obsessive, and that meant being Number One in every walk of life, above all in the drinks business, first in North America and then throughout the world. A member of a large and ambitious family, which had probably been in the drinks business back in Russia (Bronf-man means whisky-man), he was at his most ruthless when coping with competition from his elder brother, Harry. This was open enough: Sam even started one fraternal letter: 'Hello opposition.' Harry was pushed aside after being unlucky enough to be the fall guy in the family's inevitable brushes with the law - Canada being periodically subject to waves of Prohibitionist hysteria. But Mr Sam was also obsessive about the quality of his products; he had an excellent palate and rightly insisted, long before it became fashionable, that the best, most honourable (as well as, in the long term, most profitable) policy in the liquor business was to prefer quality to quantity: Drink Less, but Drink Better, which in Mr Sam's eyes inevitably meant drinking one of his up-market blends, like Lord Calvert, Crown Royal or Seven Crown, for decades the world's best-selling spirit. As so often in these cases a firmly-held policy was also exceedingly convenient. After Prohibition was repealed in the US in 1934, Canadian distillers found themselves with stocks of proper straight, malt liquor which were totally inadequate to meet the demand. So they preferred to blend the malts, the bourbons or the rye whiskies with neutral, mass produced, grain spirit. Mr Sam was perfectly sincere in his belief in the superiority of blends over straight whisky. Unlike his great rival, Lew Rosensteil, of Schenley, he ensured that his blends were properly matured: he was obsessive about holding adequate stocks of maturing whisky which he would not release even on the thirstiest of markets until they were ready, and one of his greatest triumphs was the invention of Chivas Regal, the most successful premium blended Scotch of the post-war years. Unfortunately Mr Marrus does not give us enough about distillation techniques and the reason for the supposed superiority of the Seagram blends, and he is apparently unaware of the old monster's capacity to change with the times. The biography does not recount how in the late 1960s Mr Sam, always on the alert for opportunity, bought Augier, the oldest firm in Cognac, and started to build stocks of old brandies with a view to launching Cognac's equivalent to Chivas. He may have pretended that Cognac was a blend, but it is fundamentally different from blended whisky. Mr Sam died before the new brand was launched, and in the confusion following his death - his firm was notoriously unorganised, everything depending on the old man's iron whims - his sons brought in 'marketing men' who did not understand the liquor business. It has been left to his grandson to fill the enormous gap in the firm's portfolio by buying Martell for more than Pounds 600m, expenditure which would have proved unnecessary had Mr Sam's policy been followed. You can just imagine the old bugger shouting 'I told you so' from the grave.</p>

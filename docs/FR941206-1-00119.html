			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (t) Subpart 201&hyph;20.1 requires agencies to perform an analysis of alternatives based on the requirements analysis to determine the most advantageous alternative that will meet their needs. Like the requirements analysis, the analysis of alternatives must be ``commensurate with the size and complexity of the agency's need''. As indicated in &sect;201&hyph;20.203&hyph;1(a)(1), GSA's intention was that agencies only include in the analysis of alternatives those alternatives that are truly feasible to implement. It has come to our attention, however, that some agencies are analyzing all alternatives, whether or not they are feasible in the specific circumstance. This unnecessarily complicates and lengthens the acquisition process. Accordingly, &sect;201&hyph;20.202, which states the FIRMR policy on performing analyses of alternatives, is being revised to emphasize that agencies should limit the number of alternatives analyzed to those that are feasible to implement. Other changes are also being made to this subpart. Section 201&hyph;20.203&hyph;2 is being revised to increase from $50,000 to $1,000,000 the threshold for performing a more detailed analysis of alternatives. Agencies will be given the option of performing either an analysis using the present value of money if the estimated amount of their proposed acquisition is less than $1,000,000 or an analysis that demonstrates that the benefits of the acquisition will outweigh the costs. This change will help to streamline the acquisition process by reducing documentation requirements for a greater number of smaller acquisitions. Additionally, paragraph 201&hyph;20.203&hyph;2(c) is being revised to delete the title of OMB Circular A&hyph;94 and to move it to the new &sect;201&hyph;4.003. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (u) Section 201&hyph;20.203 paragraph (d)(2) is revised to permit agency heads to grant exceptions to FED&hyph;STDS provided GSA is notified at least 30 days prior to any use of the excepted FED&hyph;STD, e.g., in a solicitation. This change empowers agencies to accomplish their missions more effectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Section 201&hyph;20.304 paragraphs (a) and b(1) deal with capability and performance validation. They are revised to require use of validation techniques that are more economical to Government and industry than use of a benchmark or an operational capability demonstration (OCD). In the early years of computing, comprehensive benchmarks, stress tests, and OCDS were useful for validating reliability, performance and other requirements. In today's mature industry, the reliability and stability of the marketplace offerings are much higher. Also, there is substantial empirical data available from independent sources to assist agencies in assessing how a proposed system will perform in their environment and with their workloads. As a result, the use of benchmarks or OCDs may not be the most advantageous approach in many acquisitions. This is more likely to be the case for those acquisitions that do not require customized hardware and/or software. Agencies will not be required to select the most economical technique available that will meet their minimum needs. Additionally, &sect;201&hyph;20.304(b)(2) is revised to delete the adjective ``actual'' in front of the word ``requirements''. The world ``actual'' caused some confusion about the meaning of ``When a benchmark is used as part of performance validation, agencies shall ensure, that the FIP software selected for benchmarks is representative of actual requirements *&blank;*&blank;*'' In fact, agencies acquire systems to accommodate a workload over a life cycle of some years. Any agency's definition of its requirements at the time of acquisition is its best estimate of workload that will ultimately occur over the ensuing years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (w) Section 201&hyph;20.305&hyph;3 is revised to emphasize the agency requirement for the submission of post delegation information to GAS for specific delegations. With the increased emphasis on results oriented performance, GAS will seek information demonstrating that agencies are obtaining the benefits cited in their agency procurement requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) Section 201&hyph;21.201 paragraph (b) is revised to reflect the current name and symbol of a GSA organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (y) Section 201&hyph;21.301 paragraphs (a) and (d) are revised to delete references to OMB Circular A&hyph;130, Appendix III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (z) Section 201&hyph;21.401 paragraph (c) is revised to remove references to OMB Circular A&hyph;130, Appendix II, which is proposed for revision; and to remove the title of the Circular since it appears in the new &sect;201&hyph;4.003. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (aa) Section 201&hyph;21.43 is amended to change the annual report date from November 30 to October 20 for reporting the dollar amount charged to users for the sharing of excess FIP resources. This earlier due date allows for more timely submission of GSA's consolidated Governmentwide report to Congress. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

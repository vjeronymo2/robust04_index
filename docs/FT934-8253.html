			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (10): Marriage of art and finance - Banking / As the region's leading bank has 2,752 cash machines in the city, Joan Miro's design for its emblem is never far away AS 1993 was named the Ano Miro, the emblem of La Caixa (Catalonia's leading financial institution) became the most obvious example of how the Catalan painter's work was omnipresent. In 1980, Miro was commissioned by the bank to paint a picture, in which appeared the star that is now its corporate logo. La Caixa is the biggest financial institution in Spain, measured by its deposits, which are currently Pta 5,200bn, and one of the biggest in Europe. As it has 2,752 cash machines and 107 branches in Barcelona, Miro's star is never far from view. In addition to La Caixa and the other Catalan banks, such as Banc de Sabadell, Barcelona has the whole range of Spanish financial groups, as would be expected in the country's industrial centre. These include: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Banesto and Banco Central Hispano, which has given the city its the special claim of having the highest density of cash machines in the world. The head offices of the banks are mostly to be found in a relatively concentrated area of the city which is known as the central business district. This area is formed by Placa Catalunya, Passeig de Gracia and Diagonal. In terms of deposits, Catalonia accounts for a little over a fifth of the national total and a little under a fifth of its commercial and retail banking loans, most of which are concentrated in Barcelona. 'There is quite a lot going on here,' said Sheena Campbell, president of the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, 'Madrid is the financial centre, but there are a lot of multinationals here.' The rating agency IBCA established its only Spanish office in Barcelona, in 1991. And although the Barcelona stock exchange has seen its volume drop to negligible proportions since trading concentrated in Madrid after the 1989 stock market reform, Barcelona has kept an outlet for financial innovation in the Mercat de Futurs Financers, its futures market, which was founded in 1990.</p>

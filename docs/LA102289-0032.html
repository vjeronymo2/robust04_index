			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORPORATE MIND?  </P> <P> Re Claudia Puig's Oct. 8 article, "Music to Someone's Ears": Some of the KKBT  scenes and executives described by Puig call to mind the cold, efficient  corporate thinking and fax-minded corporate underlings portrayed in the movie  "Robocop." (Major chill!)  </P> <P> For myself, it seems this was a good year to leave Los Angeles. Southern  California's culture peaked with the Dodgers -- the region's last repository of  higher culture -- winning the '88 Series. Since then, it's been all downhill.  </P> <P> J. R.

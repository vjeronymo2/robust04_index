			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Moller Group doubles turnover to DKr47bn AP MOLLER Group, the Danish shipping, shipbuilding and oil and gas business, and its associated companies, last year doubled turnover to DKr46.9bn (Dollars 7.8bn). Turnover in the core shipping and oil and gas operations amounted to DKr23.72bn. The group's results include the turnover, profit and equity capital figures for 18 associated companies. These include: Maersk Air, the airline; a big supermarket chain; and the Odense Steel Shipyard. Turnover in the associated companies totalled DKr23.26bn, which includes DKr13.71bn in the supermarket chain. While the core companies made a net profit last year of DKr1.92bn, the associated companies, four of which incurred losses, reported combined profits of DKr173m. Equity capital in the core companies at the end of last year was DKr16.52bn, while equity in the core companies was DKr4.06bn. The Moller Group's figures are still incomplete as they do not reveal turnover in the group's foreign subsidiaries. Neither does the group make it clear which of the associated companies are wholly or partly owned by the group.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Jan 28, BNS -- Complying with Estonia's  request, the Russian delegation will during the next round of  negotiations Feb. 1-2 present a detailed timetable for the  withdrawal of its troops from Estonia, Vasiliy Svirin, Russia's  top negotiator, told BNS.    The timetable includes full information about when one or  another unit leaves Estonia and the number of men in it. "We  hope that this step of Russia's to meet Estonia's wishes  inspires also the Estonian delegation to take constructive steps  to meet us halfway," Svirin said. As reported earlier, a  general schedule for troop withdrawal was presented to Estonia  during the last round of talks late in 1993.    Svirin said that Estonia has recently been hinting at its  wish to replace a comprehensive agreement on the troop  withdrawal and the conditions for their temporary stay in  Estonia with a short protocol containing only the date for the  completion of the pullout with the timetable as an appendix to  it. He emphasized that Russia has clearly stated it considers  this approach absolutely unacceptable. Svirin explained that it  would leave unresolved a wide range of problems concerning the  pullout and the stay in Estonia of the troops, and the fate of  the army's immovable property, which would only lead to  deterioration of bilateral relations.    Commenting on Vaino Reinart's appointment as the head of the  Estonian delegation for talks with Russia, Svirin said the  Russian side accepted it favorably, with full understanding and  readiness to continue constructive cooperation.    As to Russia's "ostensible concern" about Russians living in  Estonia, Svirin said "we've heard it before." He referred to  Reinart's Jan. 20 statement at a Council of Europe deputy  ministers' meeting in Strasbourg when Reinart charged that  Russia's accusations of human rights violations in the Baltic  states stem, not from genuine concern about human rights, but  from Russia's domestic political situation. "We regard such  statements as carefully thought out speculations of some  Estonian politicians," Svirin said.</p>

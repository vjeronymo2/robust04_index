			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (CNS) -- Minister of the State  Planning Commission, Mr. Chen Jinhua said at a forum on  macro-economy in China that marked achievements had been made in  the process of strengthening and improving decisions for  macro-control and adjustment but tasks in this sector still  remained arduous.    Mr. Chen said that a series of policies regarding the  strengthening and improving of decisions for macro-control and  adjustment adopted by the party central committee and the State  Council last June had effectively curbed the overheated and  disordered economy in the country, creating better conditions  for reform and opening to the outside world as well as for  economic development. In the first quarter of this year, the  investment growth of state-owned units dropped to 37.2 percent  from 57 percent in the same period last year. The financial  situation in the country had also shown a favorable turn with a  turn of net cash withdrawal in the first quarter of this year  from the net cash input in the same period last year. Financial  confusion such as rampant money collecting and illegal issuance  of inter-bank loans had been basically curbed and the national  economy continued a better momentum of increase.    Mr. Chen said that certain marked problems existing in  economic operations had not yet been thoroughly solved and the  strengthening and improvement of macro-control and adjustment  remained an arduous task. The serious problems facing the  present economy was the soaring inflation. [as received]    The reasons for such inflation could be analyzed from  various  angles, Mr. Chen said. The main reason was too much social  demand and overly big investment scale exceeding the national  power in particularly. At present the local authorities planned  to further expand their investment scale with the expectancy  that macro-control measures would be relaxed in the latter half  of this year.    Mr. Chen said that it was very necessary to further unify  ideas and increase consciousness to carry out macro-control and  adjustment measures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] Cuban emigres who have just returned to Miami from  Havana after attending the Nation and the Emigre Community  conference are now victims of death threats and all types of  pressures by the exile industry, who have made the anti-Cuban  policy a lucrative business with a quasi-Mafioso structure. In  one Florida county, the police had to search the home of one of  those people who had received repeated death threats, because of  the possibility of criminal activity.    Why have these criminal group leaders assumed such an  aggressive attitude? Why do they violate U.S. laws and try to  revamp them in Miami and use forms of extortion like those used  by the Chicago Mafia during the 1930's? The answer is very  simple: Repeated myths and lies are being weakened in a large  sector of the emigre community, which is not beneficial to the  Mafia heads, from the financial standpoint, or to the political  tyranny exercised by personalities from the U.S. business and  political sector.    This cannot be interpreted to mean that the Cuban emigre  community in Miami is undergoing a radical change in its  political and ideological views. That was clear at the meeting  here in Havana. To put it plainly, the sector of Cuban  emigration to which I am referring is that group of persons who  are the victims of the aggression. It is they who are making  another evaluation of the Cuban reality -- their own evaluation,  within their own political and ideological views -- and that  does not fit well with the totalitarian and strong-arm  [matonezca] version of the traffickers in hatred and anti-Cuban  sentiments.    It is curious, but not coincidental, how in this crusade of  deeply rooted antagonism the most vile figures gang up with  those who pose as intellectuals in an attempt to dominate other  sectors of the emigre community. I mention no names, but  everyone knows whom I refer to. I am talking about those who  organize anti-Cuban congresses throughout the world, visit  governments, travel nonstop, all without revealing who is  financing their incessant movement.</p>

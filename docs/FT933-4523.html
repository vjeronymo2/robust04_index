			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Belgian prices stage recovery from dramatic sell-off THE Belgian bond market staged a one-point recovery yesterday, after last week's dramatic sell-off, which was triggered when the authorities raised interest rates to protect the currency. However, the market has still not fully retraced last week's losses. Ten-year yields fell to 7.24 per cent, down from 7.38 per cent on Monday but still some way off last week's level of just over 7 per cent. The yield spread between the Belgian 10-year benchmark and its German counterpart narrowed to 109 basis points from 125 on Monday - the highest in two years - but is still way above the 30 basis point gap recorded in July. Dealers said volume was moderate rather than heavy, as some index-fund managers came back into the market. 'But nearly all our clients completely liquidated their positions last week,' one trader added. GERMAN bonds weakened slightly amid growing doubts over the likelihood of rate cuts at Thursday's Bundesbank Council meeting. 'It's a tough call - money supply and inflation don't suggest an easing but the D-Mark's strength and technical considerations do,' said a Frankfurt trader. But according to Mr Karsten Walprecht, a futures broker at Deutsche Bank, the Bundesbank may once again surprise the markets. 'Expectations for a rate cut are relatively low, but since the Bundesbank likes to act contrary to market expectations, the chances may actually be quite good.' On the supply front, the German government will auction a second tranche of its 6 1/2 per cent bonds due July 15 2003 today. Some traders say the auction may replace the Bund issue scheduled for the end of September. Moreover, many banks need to cover short positions following the first tranche, says a trader, who expects some DM6bn to DM8bn of bonds to be issued. UK GILTS ended slightly higher in fairly low volume yesterday, as the market remained locked in a trading range, with no significant economic data due this week. On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the December long gilt future ended the day at 114 1/8 . One dealer said the future is stuck in a 113 1/2 to 114 1/2 range, 'and it will take something big to move it through that resistance level'. FRENCH 10-year bonds shed early gains to end a slow session little changed while the short and ultra-long sectors of the yield curve eased. The long end was damped recently by heavy selling, while two to five-year maturities weakened on waning hopes for near-term rate cuts. In the morning, some switching from Bunds boosted French bonds but prices drifted back down as follow-through buying failed to materialise. JAPANESE bonds were little changed but remain underpinned by hopes of a cut in the 2 1/2 per cent official discount rate. While JGBs have factored in a rate cut, they will remain well supported until it happens, said Mr Nick Stamenkovich, economist with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, who expects a half-point ODR cut soon - possibly on Friday, when the Bank of Japan releases its quarterly Tankan report. However, the cut is likely to trigger profit-taking which could drive the 10-year yield back above 4 per cent, he said. FOLLOW-through buying from Friday's strong rally and plunging gold prices pushed longer-dated US Treasury securities to new highs yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 105 3/32 , yielding a record low of 5.884 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/4 , to yield 3.6726 per cent. Longer-dated prices opened higher after the long weekend as sentiment remained buoyant in the wake of Friday's unexpected decline in August non-farm payrolls.</p>

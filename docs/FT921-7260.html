			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / US-China trade fuels MFN debate NEW US-China trade figures are expected to provide ammunition in the Senate debate, due to begin soon, over legislation imposing stringent conditions on China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status, writes Nancy Dunne from Washington. The US International Trade Commission said China's imports in the first nine months of 1991 rose from Dollars 11bn in 1990 to Dollars 13.1bn. Textile and clothing accounted for Dollars 3bn of this, but shipments of bicycles and costume jewellery were also up. Retailers continue to rely heavily on imports of toys, games, and sports and electrical equipment. The US, which is trying to negotiate away Chinese trade barriers, had a Dollars 9bn trade deficit with China in the first nine months. Its largest exports to China were fertilisers (Dollars 728m), and aircraft (Dollars 641.5m). China disputes US trade figures principally because it separates direct exports from exports to the US transferred through Hong Kong. Aside from trade issues, the debate over MFN will focus on China's arm sales to Iran and the Middle East. Leading the attack, Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, is also highlighting China's human rights abuses and prison labour exports. President Bush will veto the legislation. However, he is likely to get a new version if, as expected, he opts to continue China's MFN status, without conditions, at its yearly renewal date in June. Meanwhile, his China trade policy is coming under attack in the presidential primaries. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, is carrying the weight of the defence. In the administration's Section 301 trade case against China, she emphasises: 'initial progress in beginning the process of reducing prohibitively high tariffs, import licensing requirements and improving transparency.'</p>

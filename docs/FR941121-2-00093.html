			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal recognizes that when a designated Nasdaq/NM security becomes involved in a merger or acquisition, CBOE market makers may need to hedge positions in options on the designated Nasdaq/NM security by buying or selling shares of stock of the other company involved in the merger or acquisition, whether or not the other company's stock has listed overlying options. Indeed, where there are no options on that stock, buying or selling the stock itself may at times be the only feasible way for a market maker to hedge positions in options on the designated Nasdaq/NM security, given the risk arbitrage relationship that is likely to exist between the two stocks. The proposed rule change will facilitate hedging by options market makers in this circumstance, by allowing them to sell short shares of the other company involved in the merger for hedging purposes, and to designate those short sales as bid test exempt. The CBOE believes that its proposal will enhance the ability of CBOE market makers to perform their market making functions, thereby contributing to the liquidity of the market for options, as well as the market for the stocks of both companies. This proposed rule change, like the remainder of Rule 15.10, is intended to operate in coordination with an exemption from the bid test provided for in the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. It is CBOE's understanding that the NASD intends to publish an interpretation of its bid test rule that is consistent with the amendment to CBOE Rule 15.10 proposed herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will enhance the ability of market makers to perform their market making activities, thereby contributing to the depth and liquidity of the options market, and thus will serve in furtherance of the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and promote the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

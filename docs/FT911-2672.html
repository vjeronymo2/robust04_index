			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Brussels blocks Pounds 100m UK aid THE European Commission is withholding Pounds 100m in grants for British coal mining communities until the UK government explains how it is using EC regional aid. This is the first time that Brussels has blocked transfers from its structural funds, the EC's second largest budget after farm spending. The funds, intended to boost development in backward and industrially declining regions, were doubled to Ecu63bn (Pounds 45bn) for 1989-93, of which the UK was allocated Ecu3.9bn. The Pounds 100m, aimed at regenerating former mining areas under the EC's Ecu300m Rechar programme, has been awaiting signature in Brussels since January. The UK, some of whose ministers have privately criticised the Commission's administration of the structural funds as wasteful, has been singled out because its disbursement of the aid has not been 'transparent'. London questionsion's principle of 'additionality' - that EC funds should supplement central or local government commitments to the projects selected. Officials in Brussels say the aid 'goes into a Whitehall pot, which makes it difficult for us to see that our money is getting to where it's aimed.' The funding thereby 'loses its deliberately discriminatory effect', which is to help poorer regions catch up with richer areas. Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for regional policy and former Scottish secretary last week met three UK ministers including Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, to seek a solution. Commission officials say his questions were not answered but that the UK had 'agreed to produce the factual information we asked for sometime ago.' The British government contends that additionality does not apply because the UK's allocation from the structural funds was not increased when they were doubled in 1988, and there was no such requirement under the previous regional aid system. However, the Commission complains that, first, the UK does not supply 'base figures to which we can see our money being added,' and second, that it uses EC aid to spread its own spending on the regions more evenly. 'We do have some evidence from the user end that the money is not getting through in its entirety ..that they even it out, keeping money spare for other regions,' a senior Brussels official said. The UK case sets a precedent for all member states, since there was no explicit sanction for misuse of aid written in when the structural funds were reformed in 1988.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By N. K. Han and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- The Republic of China  [ROC] welcomes the U.S. Senate resolution supporting its bid to  join the United Nations and other international organizations,  the Ministry of Foreign affairs said Wednesday [15 June].    "We are grateful for the U.S. Senate support and hope the  U.S. executive branch can implement the resolution," said a  ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.    The resolution, introduced by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and  unanimously passed by the Senate by voice vote on June 10, says  the U.S. President, acting through the U.S. permanent  representative to the United Nations, should encourage the UN to  permit Taiwan to participate fully in the activities of the UN  and its specialized agencies.    The resolution, printed in the congressional record, also  says that cabinet-level exchanges between Taiwan and the United  States should take place in the interests of both nations.    The Foreign Ministry official said the resolution is not  expected to have a strong binding force on the U.S.  administration at the moment.    "Nevertheless, we still hope more similar calls will mount  in  the U.S. in the future to support our UN bid and high-level  Taipei- Washington exchanges," the official said. "If we can win  the support of the U.S. media and public, we believe the U.S.  Government will weigh their opinions while dealing with  Taiwan-related issues."    The preamble of the resolution notes that the U.S. has had a  long histroy of friendship with the Republic of China, that  Taiwan is now a strong, vibrant economy having the largest  foreign exchange reserves of any nation, and that Taiwan  respects human rights and routinely holds free and fair  elections in a multiparty political system.    The preamble further says that Taiwan has much to contribute  to the work and funding of the UN, and that it is in the  interest of the U.S. and the UN to maintain good relations with  a government and an economy as significant as that of Taiwan.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Observer: Political fallout Democracy is proving to be a pretty exhausting business in Ukraine. The country has just had its third go at filling its 450-member Verkhovna Rada, or parliament, and is still more than 40 short. Only nine new members were voted in after last weekend's elections because rigid election rules, inherited from the Soviet era, require at least a 50 per cent voter turnout. Most Ukrainians, buffeted by economic hardships and an exhausting two-step presidential election, have lost interest. Elections for the remaining seats have now been put off indefinitely to give voters a rest from the ballot box and to save money.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] On 1 March, the government made an energetic  defense of the traditional use of coca leaf, and it rejected the  proposal by the UN International Drug Control Board (JIFE) that  Bolivia and Peru should declare illegal the cultivation and use  of coca leaf in all its forms.    Through an official document, the Foreign Ministry reminded  JIFE that Bolivia "acknowledges as legal the traditional use" of  the coca leaf. Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas stated that  "Bolivia is a sovereign country," where there is a law that  differentiates between the legal and illegal use of coca leaf.    "I believe that Bolivia demands respect for its laws and  sovereignty. Coca leaf will continue to exist because a large  part of the country uses it for medicinal, healing, and cultural  rituals," Cardenas said.    Foreign Minister Antonio Arinibar reported that the case of  excessive coca leaf production has caused a conflictive  situation due to the process of the change in governments.    "The basis of the government's policy is that of voluntary  eradication in coordination with a responsive and joint effort  with the producers," he said.    Regarding the eradication of coca and the latest incidents  in  Chapare, Felix Santos, executive secretary of the General Trade  Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia, stated that  this sector wants to live in peace, not under a regime of  violence. "But the government causes violence by forcefully  eradicating coca plantations that are the only economic support  for the workers in Cochabamba's tropical region," he said.  [passage omitted]</p>

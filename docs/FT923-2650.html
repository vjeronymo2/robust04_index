			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Local co-operation to oust Tories proposed CO-OPERATION at local level between Labour and Liberal Democrats was envisaged as the way forward for the centre-left by two MPs yesterday. But, as the Liberal Democrats prepared to debate party strategy today, there were clear signs that they were still deeply divided. The conference organisers have devised a 'purist' amendment effectively ruling out formal dialogue on electoral pacts with any other party. The party leadership last night made clear it would oppose the amendment. At a packed fringe meeting Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, and Sir David Steel, former Liberal Democrat leader, discussed how much the parties had in common and spoke of using local agreements between the parties to defeat the Conservatives. If Labour came to its senses it would realise that there was little point in forcing constituency Labour parties to put up candidates in Tory-Lib Dem marginals, Sir David said. He was unrepentant about the fact that such an arrangement would be a 'one-way bargain' and said that the prize for Labour would be the greater chance of the creation of an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons. 'Without that, we will always be caricatured as the patsies who are going to put Labour into government, and that doesn't do us any good.' Mr Field highlighted the difference in attitude between Liberal Democrat voters and party activists. He said that formal pacts would not work because about half Liberal Democrat voters disliked Labour more than the Tories, but said that as a joint agenda developed co-operation would emerge 'because Labour activists and Liberal Democrat activists believe they have some genuine common purpose to achieve by defeating the incumbent Tory'. Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the first president of the former Social Democratic party, also called for co-operation between parties. If the past three elections showed anything, he said, 'they show that neither the Liberal Democrats nor Labour can beat the Conservatives on their own.' Co-operation on individual policy issues such as freedom of information where the parties agreed was put forward at another meeting by Ms Mo Mowlam, a member of Labour's shadow cabinet. She called for an end to the 'farce' of opposition 'where absolutely everything they do is silly and everything we do is right.' The Labour leadership has maintained an official silence on the question of pacts but is said to be sympathetic to Ms Mowlam's approach.</p>

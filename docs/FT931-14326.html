			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lilley company bought LILLEY Construction, Scotland, part of Lilley, the troubled UK contracting and construction group, was yesterday acquired by the Lonrho subsidiary Sunley Turriff. The amount of the deal was not disclosed. The group asked to be put into receivership earlier this month after a financial rescue package failed to obtain the unanimous support of its bankers. The Glasgow-based group, which employs 2,800 people, faced difficult conditions in its core construction activities and had been over-exposed to property development. Mr Ken McClelland, managing director of Lilley Construction, Scotland, said the workforce would have to be reduced by about 25 per cent to 350. Before receivership orders in hand and in prospect had been worth about Pounds 20m and he expected that about 60 per cent of this business would be retained. Turnover this year is expected to be about Pounds 40m.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> LOAN FOR ARMORY CENTER  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors approved a $180,000 interest-free loan and a  grant of $36,350 for the new Armory Center for the Visual Arts at its meeting  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The money will cover unanticipated costs arising from the renovation of the  56-year-old National Guard building at 145 N. Raymond Ave. The center operates  an art gallery and children's art program rent free in the city-owned building,  which it rehabilitated and now maintains.  </P> <P> Center Director Elisa Greben Crystal said the center received sufficient  three-year fund-raising pledges to pay for the $630,000 renovation but lacked  $184,716 due now for work already completed. The city also should pay for  $36,350 worth of ceiling repairs because city officials failed to secure  California Conservation Corps workers as promised, Crystal said.  </P> <P> Mayor William Thomson and Director Bill Paparian objected to the grant and  loan, saying that the city is also being asked to provide $84,568 to the Day  One anti-drug program and $75,000 to Pasadena Planned Parenthood.  </P> <P> The board agreed to fund the three but put a hold on aid to other nonprofit  social service agencies until a city policy is formulated.  </P></p>

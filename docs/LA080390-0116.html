			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SILVEIRA LEADS BY 3 AFTER A 62  </P> <P> Larry Silveira tamed the Tournament Player's Club course at Southwind with a  course record nine-under-par 62 Thursday to take a three-stroke lead after the  first round of the St. Jude Classic at Memphis, Tenn.  </P> <P> Silveira, a second-year pro who started on the back nine, made the turn at  four-under 31 after dropping a 20-foot birdie putt at the par-four 18th and  then turned in a string of four birdies in five holes beginning at the par-four  second hole.  </P> <P> The former University of Arizona All-American broke the previous record of 63,  set last year by Doug Tewell and Hubert Green, with a two-foot birdie putt at  the par-four ninth.  </P> <P> Buddy Gardner, Rick Fehr, Nick Price and Chip Beck, the winner at last week's  Buick Open, are three shots back.  </P> <P> Silveira, who has failed to make the cut in 10 of 19 tournaments this year, had  a best finish of 10th at the Deposit Guaranty Classic.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what the course record was," he said. "I just got on a roll and  things started happening. I didn't leave a putt short, so that shows you what  kind of confidence I had."  </P> <P> Korean Ok-Hee Ku celebrated her 34th birthday with a tournament-record 64 for a  five-stroke lead after the first round of the $350,000 LPGA Boston Five Classic  at Danvers, Mass.  </P> <P> Ku, who has been having her worst year in five on the pro tour and had missed  the cut in her past three tournaments, had nine birdies and one bogey to break  the tournament record of 65 set by Marta Figueras-Dotti in 1985 and tied in  1986 by Laurie Rinker.  </P> <P> The round, which matched Ku's best competitive effort, put her into the lead at  windy Tara Ferncroft Country Club as Dottie Mochrie and Cindy Rarick tied for  second at 69.  </P> <P> Ku sank birdie putts ranging up to 27 feet and birdied four of the last five  holes on the front side, finishing with a four-footer that gave her the record.  </P> <P> Ku's best finish in 1990 is a seventh at Tucson more than four months ago. She  has earned only $20,515 in 10 tournaments.  </P> <P> Katrina Douglas of England, recovering from a wasp sting during a practice  round, shot a four-under-par 69 to take the first-round lead in the British  Women's Open at Woburn, England.  </P> <P> Pearl Sinn of Bellflower was in a group tied for second, one stroke behind.  </P> <P> Two strokes off the lead was Muffin Spencer-Devlin, making her first appearance  at Woburn since she was disqualified from a tournament in April for an outburst  at a pro-am dinner.  </P> <P> She banged her fists on a table and shouted at the tournament director in a  dispute over where she should sit. She later blamed the outburst on manic  depression.  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Broker ordered to cease business Clifton Stockbrokers, a long-established private client broker based in Torquay, has been ordered to cease carrying on investment business by the Securities &amp; Futures Authority, David Wighton writes. The regulator said the firm was 'not fit and proper to carry out investment business and has committed serious acts of misconduct'. These related to its failure to meet its financial resources requirement laid down by the SFA and to 'organise and control its internal affairs in a responsible manner'. In particular the SFA said the firm had failed to register all its directors.</p>

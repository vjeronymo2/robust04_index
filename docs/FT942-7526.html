			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Observer: Finite Patient souls awaiting that most elusive event in the City calendar, the flotation of 3i, sustained a near mortal blow yesterday in the shape of a letter from Barings. With admirable foresight, 3i's financial advisers are giving advance warning of a briefing on the pathfinder prospectus - for Friday May 27 2094. Just in case anyone thought that was a misprint, the letter goes on to reveal that the annual results for the year ended March 31 2094 will also be treated at the meeting.</p>

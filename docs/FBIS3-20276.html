"I am very pleased because we have been able to avoid at the  very last minute what threatened to be a serious crisis which  would have cost the EU much of its credibility," stressed Mr.  Claes on Tuesday evening in Istanbul where he is completing an  official two-day visit to Turkey.    The recantations of recent weeks suggest, however, that a  difficult debate is likely at the 1996 intergovernmental  conference on EU institutional reforms.    Mr. Claes nevertheless remains optimistic: "We showed on  Sunday that we are able to provide satisfactory responses to  very complex matters," he stated.    The Belgian foreign minister now wants to allow things to  settle down and rejects the idea of quickly setting up a  committee of wise men charged with clearing the way in  preparation for 1996.    "We must not be too hasty. This committee should not start  its activities until around mid-1995. It serves no purpose to  immediately start a discussion between the different factions  and therefore encumber the normal activities of the Community  and the enlargement debates currently in progress with the four  candidate countries," he added.</p>

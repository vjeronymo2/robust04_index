			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Enter more dragons: John Burton assesses South Korean President Kim's achievements in his first year and the challenges ahead Mr Kim Young-sam's first year as South Korean president has been a good one, dispelling the low expectations held by officials and business leaders when he was elected. His most notable and durable achievement so far has been in purging the remnants of the military elite that ruled the country from 1961 until early last year, while curbing the powers of the once-feared intelligence agency. University professors have replaced ex-army officers in senior government posts. The political house-cleaning, begun shortly after the former political dissident was inaugurated as president on February 25 last year, has made his government the most democratic in Korean history. South Korea now has one of the most politically free societies in Asia, on a par with Japan in terms of fair elections, an unfettered press and civil liberties. Mr Kim has also attacked the corruption in the political system by banning corporate funding of politicians' election campaigns. Bribery of bureaucrats has been made more difficult by last summer's abolition of anonymous bank accounts, which tended to conceal illicit funds. More than 1,500 officials have been sacked or forced to resign on corruption charges after having to disclose their personal assets. Mr Kim's aura of success has been helped by an improving economy. Exports rose by 9.6 per cent in 1993 as the Korean won fell against the yen, the currency of its main trading rival, Japan. The strength of exports has boosted investment, as companies have increased production capacity, particularly in Korea's main export markets of semiconductors, shipbuilding and cars. Factory expansion has been encouraged by lower interest rates, which have fallen to 12 per cent from 17 per cent a year ago as the government has sought to stimulate the economy by cutting the cost of borrowing. Gross national product rose 5.3 per cent last year, against 4.7 per cent in 1992, and is expected to grow by at least 6 per cent this year. Meanwhile, labour unrest has waned (the number of strikes dropped to 144 last year from 235 in 1992) and companies are forecasting improved earnings this year thanks to the growth in exports. Corporate confidence has sent the Seoul stock market general index towards its April 1989 peak of 1,006 points. Taken together, the political reforms and surging economy made Mr Kim a popular president last year, with approval ratings reaching 90 per cent at one point. But the president is now risking his popularity. He is trying to move the country into a new phase, in which he hopes to keep South Korea on Asia's economic fast track by tackling its traditional xenophobic attitude. He has support for his attempts to persuade North Korea, locked in its extreme nationalist doctrine of juche (self-reliance), to open itself to foreign investment as well as international nuclear inspections. But he has run into opposition at home with his promises to 'internationalise' the South Korean economy, by increasing its exposure to market forces and by dismantling protectionist trade barriers. When he announced last November that South Korea would accept limited rice imports as part of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt talks, opinion surveys indicated that 60 per cent of South Koreans opposed the move. There were daily demonstrations in the streets of Seoul. Protesters argued that rice imports would throw farmers out of work and destroy Korea's strong agricultural tradition. The cabinet was forced to resign in response to the criticism, and President Kim's popularity declined to its current rating of 60 per cent. Falling public support could eventually weaken the president's commitment to economic reforms. Few dispute the president's personal belief in the need for reform, but, as Mr Ahn Chung-si, a professor of political science at Seoul National University, says: 'Kim is a populist and he closely watches the opinion polls.' 'I'm convinced that Kim firmly believes that the internationalisation of the economy is necessary if Korea is to stay competitive,' says one western ambassador. 'The problem is that there is great resistence to change lower down in the bureaucracy, because it means a loss of power.' So far, Mr Kim's progress towards opening up South Korea has been tentative. The government has produced a series of five-year plans to deregulate the economy and liberalise financial markets to achieve its goal of joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by 1996. But most of the promised reforms are not scheduled to take effect until the last two years of Mr Kim's mandatory single term, which ends in early 1998. Some foreign businessmen worry this will give bureaucrats time to stall the changes. For example, the finance ministry tried recently to cool the stock market by requiring advanced deposits on stock purchases from institutional investors. Its action, described by the ministry as an anti-inflation move, has discouraged foreign investment. It has also fuelled fears that the government will try to delay a plan to increase the proportion of listed shares that overseas funds can buy, currently 10 per cent. 'Appearance is often more important than substance in Korean society and the issuance of five-year plans may be seen as a substitute for actual progress,' says one frustrated western broker. But the president may be ready to confront recalcitrant bureaucrats. He appears to be seeking a tactical alliance with the chaebol, the country's leading conglomerates, to push through his reforms. The chaebol welcome his promises of cutting red tape and the lifting of state-imposed credit restrictions. When he came to power a year ago, Mr Kim attacked the chaebol for their close ties with his conservative political opponents, and he promised to reduce their industrial power. He is now praising them for pioneering Korea's internationalisation efforts through their widespread activities abroad, including in the European Union. He is encouraging bureaucrats to study chaebol management methods and is sending his own staff to a management institute run by Samsung, one of the biggest industrial groups. But Mr Kim's change of attitude towards the chaebol may undercut public support for his economic reforms. Many Koreans distrust the big conglomerates because of their collaboration with the former military dictatorship and the concentration of economic power in their hands. Public suspicion of Mr Kim's plans for internationalisation has also been stirred up by western pressure on North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. The issue arouses anti-US feelings in South Korea, where the influential media claim 'American hardliners' are raising tensions to persuade Seoul to buy US weapons. At the same time, the US is being blamed for forcing South Korea to open its rice market. Small manufacturing companies and service industries, threatened with increased foreign competition in the domestic market, are exploiting such anti-US sentiment to build public resistance to the lifting of trade barriers. When the government recently announced that foreigners could operate private educational institutes, the head of the domestic association of private schools declared: 'What these foreign countries have in mind is to disseminate their cultures as the surest way of selling more goods here. The US is our biggest enemy as far as trade negotiations are concerned.' Such declarations highlight the uphill battle Mr Kim faces in persuading Koreans to accept internationalisation. A public backlash against his plans could benefit the opposition Democratic party, which holds protectionist views, in the 1996 parliamentary elections. Liberalisation will increase economic problems in the short term, as it forces companies, large and small, to rationalise and shed jobs in order to become efficient. The danger for the president is that many Koreans may rebel against making such sacrifices, rather than embrace the opportunities for longer-term prosperity. In spite of past successes, the economy is a source of concern among the public, as opinion surveys indicate. Inflation is rising, reaching an annual rate of 6.4 per cent in January. Unemployment, although low at 3 per cent, is inching upwards as small industries relocate abroad to take advantage of cheaper labour. The president is still popular, but the painful changes he is prescribing may whittle away the support he needs to see his reforms through.</p>

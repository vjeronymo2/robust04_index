			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Gloomy day in Europe as Bundesbank holds fast GOVERNMENT bond markets in continental Europe had a mainly gloomy day, with both German and French futures losing roughly half a point. Although no interest rate cuts had been expected from the Bundesbank after its council meeting, a smattering of hope must have remained to create some disappointment at the lack of movement. The Bank of France did cut its intervention rate from 8.25 per cent to 8 per cent. But, being just as expected, it failed to halt the decline. After interest rate cuts totalling 75 basis points over the past couple of weeks, one economist said the pace of change was likely to slow, with perhaps another 25 basis points coming off by the end of the month. Some profit-taking was seen behind the falls in the markets, and some setting up of new short positions. A report by France's state auditor forecasting a budget deficit of between FFr320bn and FFr360bn this year - twice the level forecast by the last government - acted as a reminder of the supply problems faced throughout Europe. The German futures contract fell from 95.17 to 94.64 during the day. THE UK government bond market again traded sluggishly in the absence of economic data and with attention turning to the next auction announcement, a week away. Declines tended to be a little smaller than in the continental European markets. The 7 1/4 per cent bond due 1998 shed just over  1/4 point, the 10-year stock about  1/3 and the 8 3/4 per cent due 2017 just over 1/2 . The gilt futures contract also shed about  1/2 to close at 103 3/4 . Neither the Newbury parliamentary by-election nor the local authority elections were expected to cause much of a stir as the market had accepted that there would be Conservative losses. THE ITALIAN government bond market proved an exception to the gloom - or 'not moody at all' as one wag put it - as it continued to recover from the setback delivered on Wednesday by Moody's downgrading of the state's foreign currency debt. The BTP contract traded more than half a point ahead of Wednesday night's close, itself an improvement on the initial reaction to the news THE CZECH Republic is preparing to launch a second domestic treasury bond issue for at least Kcs2bn (Dollars 70m), Patrick Blum writes. The bonds will have a maturity of less than four years, and the sale will be by auction. An initial issue for Kcs2.5bn was successfully launched in March. The proceeds will be used to help finance the 1991 budget deficit, said Mr Jiri Klumpar, Czech central bank financial markets director, according to the Czech news agency CTK. THE JAPANESE government bond market reopened at a higher level after the Golden Week holidays, helped by the yen's buoyancy and the strengthening of US Treasuries since last Friday. The June futures contract firmed a little more in Tokyo, to close at 108.56, about  3/4 points up on Friday's close. In a quiet day's trading, the benchmark 145 issue due 2002 saw little change during the day. It was yielding about 4.33 per cent, compared with 4.40 at the end of last week. There seemed little impetus to the market, which is waiting to see whether the currency will break through the Y110-to-the-dollar barrier. Nor did yesterday's decline in the Nikkei Average stock market index make any waves. It was viewed as profit-taking rather than a downward trend. US TREASURY prices were mixed in light trading yesterday as many investors and dealers stayed on the sidelines until today's key April employment report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at 104 1/16 , yielding 6.801 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 5/32 , yielding 3.776 per cent. Trading during the day was quiet, with the market ignoring news that initial claims for state unemployment insurance were unchanged in the final week of April. The data gave no clue as to what today's April employment report will reveal, and a reluctance to get involved until that data was released kept trading subdued. The lack of movement was also attributable to continued confusion over what the Treasury's changes to its debt mix mean for the market. On Wednesday the Treasury announced it would reduce the sale of long bonds, eliminate seven-year note auctions and increase issuance of shorter-dated securities, all to cut the government's interest costs.</p>

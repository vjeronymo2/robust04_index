			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Bankruptcies rise as Japan's economy slows JAPAN received further evidence of economic slowdown yesterday, as bankruptcy figures rose, corporate advertising and entertainment spending declined, and crude steel output posted a double-digit dip. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, yesterday expressed his concern, stressing the need for adjustments to corporate inventories and individuals' stock of durable goods, before the country's economy could recover. Bankruptcies last month rose 35.3 per cent from the same month last year, to 1,145 cases, in the 24th consecutive year-on-year rise. Liabilities rose 24.9 per cent from a year earlier, to Y706.7bn (Pounds 3.3bn). Liabilities were up by 85.9 per cent from the previous month due to the rise in large-scale bankruptcies of real estate companies. Teikoku Data Bank, the private credit research agency, said failures of manufacturing, transportation and communications companies had all risen by 85 per cent from the previous year. In the six months to September, bankruptcies rose a year-on-year 32.6 per cent, to 6,952 cases. However, total liabilities fell by 6.1 per cent to Y3,583.6bn, declining for the first time since the second half of fiscal year 1989. Teikoku attributed the decline to large-scale failures of land and stock speculators. Bankruptcies stemming from 'zaitech' - speculative land and stock investment  -fell in both number and size, with the total number of cases falling 5 per cent to 115, and liabilities decreasing 19.8 per cent to Y638.6bn. However, failures of real estate companies increased, reflecting the virtual halt of trading in real estate. The sector posted a 9.6 per cent increase, to 571 cases, while liabilities for the six months surged 43.7 per cent to Y1,153.9bn. Figures released by Teikoku also revealed a plunge in corporate advertising and entertainment spending, reflecting cost-cutting efforts. In fiscal year 1991, which ran to last March, advertising spending by leading companies totalled Y783.5bn, down 25.4 per cent from fiscal 1987, the height of the 'bubble' boom. Entertainment spending at the leading 1,000 companies fell 15.3 per cent to Y111.7bn. Meanwhile, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation yesterday announced that Japan's crude steel production for the first half of the 1992 fiscal year fell 12.6 per cent from a year before, to 48.6m tons. The federation said it was the first time in five years the figure had fallen short of 50m tons, and blamed the sharp fall in demand from industries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France Signs the Convention of </F> London on Ban of Immersion of Nuclear Waste"]    [Text] France has decided to sign the international  Convention of London on the "total and definitive" ban on  immersion of nuclear waste, Environment Minister Michel Barnier  disclosed on Monday, 20 December. France thus joins the 37  states, including the United States and Japan, which decided to  sign [the Convention] last month during a meeting in London.    Although France has not dumped any radioactive waste in the  sea since 1969, it abstained from signing, together with  Belgium, China, the United Kingdom, and Russia. France only  sought a simple renewal of the 1983 moratorium, so that it would  retain the right to reassess the problem "in 15 years in light  of the scientific knowledge at that time."    However, the majority vote on 12 November was accompanied by  a clause: The countries abstaining from voting and the 29  nations not present in London would have 100 days to vote for or  against [the convention], otherwise they would be excluded from  the convention. "In compliance with Prime Minister Balladur's  willingness to conduct an energy policy respecting the  environment," says Michel Barnier's message, but also due to the  lobbying of the ecological movements, the French Government,  which could have saved itself the trouble of a controversy by  signing the convention last month, has thus come into line with  the resolution adopted in London.</p>

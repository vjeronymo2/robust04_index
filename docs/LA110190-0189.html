			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STICKING TOGETHER TO FINISH;  </P> <P> LIFESTYLE: WHEN THE TIGHTKNIT KEARL CLAN OF LA CANADA TAKES OFF ON A FAMILY  VACATION, THERE'S NO TIME TO RELAX. THE NEXT STOP: THE NEW YORK MARATHON.  </P> <P> La Canada anesthesiologist Sherman Kearl, his wife, Karen, and their five  children will set a vacation pace few could match while visiting New York this  week.  </P> <P> After three days filled with as many sightseeing outings as possible, the  Kearls and their children, ages 17 to 27, will run the New York City Marathon  on Sunday.  </P> <P> But the breakneck pace will not be the Kearls' only vacation memory. They will  be joined in the marathon by Karen Kearl's sister and brother-in-law, making  them the largest single family entry in the marathon's 21-year history, said  race director Fred Lebow.  </P> <P> The Kearls undoubtedly will be sore after the 26.2-mile race, but they say a  few aching muscles are a small price to pay for continuing their longtime  tradition of building closeness on family vacations.  </P> <P> "My father recognized that a lot of families that had successful children did  so because they did things together," said Gregory Kearl, 27, a third-year  student at Chicago Medical School. "Our credo has been to work hard and play  hard together."  </P> <P> "That is what life is all about," said Karen Kearl, 50. "The warm feeling you  get when somebody cares when you spend time together."  </P> <P> The vacations began when the children were young and the Kearls traveled with  scores of families to Aspen, Colo., in the winter and to Lake Powell in  southern Utah in the summer.  </P> <P> As the children grew older, the family turned to more exotic pursuits. The  Kearls took some or all of their children to Africa, Alaska, Australia, Europe  and Hawaii. They have rafted on the Colorado River and kayaked from Catalina to  San Pedro.  </P> <P> In 1985, Sherman, 53, and son Matthew, 21, drove a dune buggy to victory in the  challenger class of the Baja California International 500-mile off-road race.  The family has also walked the 175-mile stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail from  the Mexican border to Palm Springs, and in 1987 all the Kearl children ran the  Los Angeles Marathon.  </P> <P> That marathon was the last time the family gathered in the same city, however,  and Sherman and Karen wanted a reunion.  </P> <P> The New York City Marathon came to mind. Sherman Kearl met Lebow when Kearl  worked as commissioner of shooting events for two years prior to the 1984  Olympics. He extracted Lebow's promise that if the family ran the New York  Marathon together, the race executive would present them with the medals  distributed to all finishers. In the past, Lebow has presented awards only to  winners.  </P> <P> The Kearls began training months ago, and on Wednesday night Sherman and Karen,  an accountant, were scheduled to fly to New York. They were bringing their  daughter Kristin, 17, a La Canada High School senior recently named Miss La  Canada, and their son, Patrick, 19, a student at Glendale Community College.  </P> <P> Gregory was scheduled to fly to New York from Chicago. Bradley, 26, a  construction worker, and Matthew, a premed student at Brigham Young University,  were to come from Provo, Utah.  </P> <P> Gregory Kearl said he treasures his memories of early family gatherings.  </P> <P> "On weekends we would all get together and do all yardwork so we could finish  it and then go out together," he said. "We'd try to do family activities once  or twice a week.  </P> <P> "Our church, the Mormon church, has a scheduled family night that usually takes  place on Monday. It can be anything from ice skating to discussing gospel  principles, but we always had a lot of fun together, and we've tried to build  on that."  </P> <P> Sherman Kearl explained the family unity this way: "I do not think we do things  together because the church encourages it," he said. "The church's  encouragement just makes it simpler. . . . We do things because we enjoy it."  </P> <P> Sometimes the children preferred to spend time with friends and were reluctant  to attend family outings. Matthew said he didn't always want to go to Lake  Powell but wound up enjoying the boating, water skiing and windsurfing.  </P> <P> "It might have bothered me (to have to go with my family and leave my  friends)," he said. "But when I was with my family it didn't bother me as much  because . . . my family made it fun for us."  </P> <P> Nor did the children and their parents avoid conflict at home.  </P> <P> "All this family stuff doesn't mean that the kids don't bicker or complain or  refuse to cooperate," Karen said. "We're not the Waltons. It's not 'Good night,  John Boy.' "  </P> <P> The Kearls have lived for 23 years in a 5,500-square-foot, Spanish-style home  surrounded by 16 redwoods. A basketball court and a swimming pool with three-  and one-meter diving boards sit beside the house. The Kearls do their own house  and yardwork.  </P> <P> "Their issues would be, 'I don't want to do housework, I don't want to clean  the swimming pool,' " Karen said.  </P> <P> Sherman Kearl's decision to spend time with his family began during medical  school. The third-generation physician worked as a free-lance anesthesiologist,  rather than affiliating with a hospital, for 20 years.  </P> <P> "If you hook up with one hospital," he said, "You won't have much say in how  much time you can take off. If my boy had a game or my daughter was in a play,  I wanted to be able to go."  </P> <P> Now that his children are grown, Kearl works regularly for Los Angeles  County-USC Medical Center. Although he puts in as many as 100 hours a week, he  recently found time to prepare his customary quiz on sites on the upcoming  vacation.  </P> <P> In a memo to family members, he also listed sources where they could study for  the 40-question exam. The family member who scores highest on the quiz earns  $100; second place wins $50.  </P> <P> "Preparing for a quiz such as this not only results in extra spending money,"  Kearl wrote in the memo, "but the brief study (for the quiz) results in ideas  about what to see and do, as well as a better understanding and appreciation of  the area. . . . "  </P> <P> After seeing as many sights as possible before the race, the family hopes to  see more during the event.  </P> <P> "We are determined to stay together and run the race as slowly as the slowest  one of us can go," Sherman said. "They are going through Harlem, the Orthodox  Jewish section of Brooklyn and a lot of Jamaican and Puerto Rican  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "They will go past Yankee Stadium and the Verrazano-Narrows, the bridge with  the largest main span in the world. . . . If there is something to stop at,  we're going to look at it."  </P> <P> But Sherman Kearl will not be surprised if the race doesn't go exactly as  planned.  </P> <P> Late on a recent afternoon as they drove to the Rose Bowl to work out for the  marathon, Kristin told her father that she wanted to attend a Billy Idol  concert that evening.  </P> <P> "Is that one of those bad guys?" Sherman wondered. "Does he sing songs that you  would be embarrassed to say? Kristin, you should think twice about this."  </P> <P> After it became clear that Sherman would not persuade his daughter to stay  home, he had another idea.  </P> <P> "Here's what you do," he said. "You take a Sony Walkman. Put on some  Tchaikovsky in your earphones and listen to that and your friends won't even  know it."  </P></p>

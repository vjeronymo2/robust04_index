			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Jerome Bicamumpaka, foreign </F> minister of transitional government, by Dominique de Courcelles  in Paris; date not given]    [Text] Our guest this morning is Jerome Bicamumpaka, the  foreign minister of the transitional Rwandan Government. The  transitional government, which is based some 40 km south of  Kigali, was set up after President Habyarimana's death. The  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is refusing to talk to this  government, claiming that it is a self-appointed clique of  murderers. Jerome Bicamumpaka, who is currently visiting Paris,  rejects responsibility for the death of the president, for the  massacres, and for the war against the RPF.    The army, he claims, is only defending itself against the  aggressor and the government is attempting to calm people. Here  is the Rwandan foreign minister, interviewed by Dominique de  Courcelles.    [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] Ever since the government  launched a pacification action, ever since it called on the  gendarmerie to deploy in order to halt massacres and looting, it  has succeeded in reducing massacres throughout the national  territory. So if this government had not acted as it did we  believe that the destruction would have been far worse.    [De Courcelles] Are you saying that massacres are now  abating  in Rwanda?    [Bicamumpaka] They are, quite dramatically, but the problem  is that in the part of the country controlled by the RPF in the  north, the RPF carried out horrendous killings, near Moutarra  for instance, where it is estimated that some 20,000 were killed  by the RPF. All these actions by the RPF do not make our work  any easier.    [De Courcelles] Minister, you seem to be saying that all  evil  comes from the RPF, that the RPF killed, that it bombed the  town, that it brought the war to Kigali. Is the RPF the only  party responsible? Was it the RPF which started the killings  following President Habyarimana's death?    [Bicamumpaka] Yes. Why? Because just after President  Habyarimana's death -- you know how the Rwandan president died  -- the RPF went immediately on the offensive. The units in the  [word indistinct] palace in Kigali went on the offensive; they  also attacked on the northern front. Following this attack  massacres spread throughout the country.    [De Courcelles] You probably know what many are saying, that  the army -- and the presidential guard within the army -- is  mostly responsible for these massacres.    [Bicamumpaka] In fact many of these allegations are  erroneous. The Rwandan Government did not break the Arusha  agreement or go on the offensive -- it was the RPF. The cause  of this is the death of the president which we blame on the RPF  and on the powers supporting it. In the military sphere we note  that the RPF is supported by the Ugandan Army; we estimate the  size of Ugandan units supporting the RPF at five battalions.  There are also Ugandan army Soviet-made helicopters. So the  fact that the president was killed and that an attack on the  northern front and in Kigali followed shortly after prompts us  to say the RPF is at the root of all the evil, of all the  massacres currently taking place in the country.    [De Courcelles] Therefore you consider that the gendarmerie,  the army, and the presidential guard are beyond any reproach.    [Bicamumpaka] There are certainly elements in the Rwandan  Army which have committed crimes, in particular the  assassination of some officials, but it cannot be said that they  represent the whole of the army. It would have been impossible  for the Rwandan Army to face the RPF attack and to massacre  people at the same time.</p>

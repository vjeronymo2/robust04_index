			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Touche partner fined Pounds 1,500 An insolvency partner with Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has been reprimanded, fined Pounds 1,500 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 1,000 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales for failing to hold creditors' meetings on time for a company of which he was liquidator. Mr Roger Powdrill, who was appointed liquidator to KM Joinery (Haverill) in 1991, did not hold meetings in 1992 and 1993 within the time set down in the 1986 Insolvency Act. It is believed that administrative delays held up the meeting in 1992, and that the one in 1993 was delayed to save money and to combine it with a final creditors' meeting. Touche Ross said no creditors attended any of the meetings. The issue raises questions over the legal requirement for holding annual creditors' meetings in liquidations, which frequently are unattended.</p>

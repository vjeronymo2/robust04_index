			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Reforms for The Law Commission The Law Commission yesterday called for reforms to cut delays in handling legal challenges to government decisions. Judicial review applications have risen from 160 in 1974 to 1,500 by 1987 and almost 2,900 last year. The rise has continued this year, with 1,851 applications in the first seven months compared with 1,728 in the same period of last year. The government's law reform body said that if delays in hearing legal challenges were to be reduced procedures for judicial review would have to be streamlined. It is proposing several changes to make procedures easier for applicants. The terms and remedies available will be changed to make their function and purpose more easily understood. The commission also recommends that courts hearing public law cases should have the power to order restitution where organisations or individuals have wrongly been required to pay out money. It says rules on time limits, the availability of interim remedies pending a full hearing - in particular against ministers and central government departments - and rules on appeals all need clarifying and updating.

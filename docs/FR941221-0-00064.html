			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 880.612a is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;880.612a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Preference for occupancy by elderly families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Election by owners of eligible projects.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an ``elderly project.'' ``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list on the basis of having made the election.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD approval of election not required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evidence supporting project eligibility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primary sources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source such as: The application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Secondary sources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sources in conflict.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> clear evidence  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home loans come down THE FALL in interest rates has been followed by an avalanche of fixed-rate mortgage offers from the main building societies. Several are at well below 9 per cent and one lender, National Counties, has even put a variable-rate mortgage on the market with a discount that brings it down to 7.99 per cent. Even people who locked into fixed rates of 9.75 per cent a week or two back must now be feeling unhappy. In the City, the betting seems to be on further falls in mortgage rates. So, instead of seeking a fixed rate, it looks sensible to try to find a capped-rate product which will allow your payments to fall in line with the market. Birmingham Midshires is offering two two-year mortgages, one capped and one fixed. They are available for endowment, pension, PEP and re-mortgages, although there is a ceiling of 75 per cent of the value of the property for re-mortgages. The fixed rate is available at 8.90 per cent and the capped rate at 9.20, with an APR of 10.30 per cent in both cases. There is no compulsory insurance but there is a Pounds 225 arrangement fee. Early redemption penalties are three months' interest. Woolwich, the third-largest society, and Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-biggest, both are marketing new fixed-rate mortgages. Woolwich is offering 8.99 per cent (APR 10.1 per cent) fixed for five years for endowment or pension mortgages only. There is a Pounds 275 application fee but no compulsory insurance and the early-redemption penalty is three months. Alliance &amp; Leicester is offering two mortgages, one at 8.5 per cent, the other at 8.75 per cent, both for two years. Which rate you get depends on whether you want a mortgage for more or less than 75 per cent of the property's value. The loans must be larger than Pounds 30,000. Both are portable: if you move, you can transfer the mortgage to the new property. More attractive still is the 8.25 per cent, two-year fixed-rate from Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, with an application fee of Pounds 100. It is available for all types of mortgage; redemption penalty is three months' interest. It is likely, though, that we will see lower rates before much longer from C&amp;G and the other large societies. Their present fixed rates compare well with those of the past decade, but they do not look particularly enticing if you believe that inflation in Britain is going to remain around 3 per cent or less for the short and medium term future, with base rates also remaining low.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A breakdown of consensus YESTERDAY'S PAY deal for German public sector workers will succeed in putting the western half of the country back to work after 11 days of strike action. But it is bad news for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, bad news for Germany and bad news for Europe. At a time when Germany needs to tighten belts to cope with the immense unsolved challenges of unification, the public sector is leading the way towards wage rises which the country cannot afford. Mr Kohl belatedly pushed through tax increases last year to keep down sharply rising budget deficits. These are now effectively being offset by increases in the public sector wage bill. After yesterday's agreement for a 5.4 per cent pay rise, plus individual one-off payments, the well-organised and well-financed oTV public sector union is congratulating itself on a notable victory. It is likely to be pyrrhic. By hardening the Bundesbank's determination to force down inflation from its present level of 4.5 per cent, yesterday's outcome is likely to maintain German interest rates at their current high levels for many months. The central bank failed to take action at its council meeting yesterday. But a further increase in its official lending rates now looks a possibility. This would bring fresh pain not only to the German economy, but to the rest of Europe. In spite of an unseasonal growth spurt at the beginning of the year, signs of sluggishness in the German economy are increasing. Further tightening by the Bundesbank would turn a slowdown into recession. For Mr Kohl, the political effects may be still more sobering. For the second year in succession, the government has failed to persuade German workers to accept lower wage rises in the interest of their country's longer-term financial health. The government is allowing through a deal which is barely distinguishable from the arbitration proposal it rejected last month as being unacceptably high. The cuts in spending and subsidies outlined on Tuesday by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, are now more urgent than ever. Mr Kohl seems unlikely to summon the necessary authority to push these measures through. West Germany's system of consensus between wage-earners and employers was a pivotal factor behind the stability and prosperity which made unification possible 19 months ago. Just when Germany needs it most, the system looks to be breaking down. Germany has very few options to replace it with anything better, and time to find solutions is running out.</p>

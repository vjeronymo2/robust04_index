			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Isolated Buthelezi may stand down: Inkatha leader's departure would transform S African politics Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and chief rival of the African National Congress, is thinking about retiring. So he told the Financial Times in an interview last week, during which he outlined his objections to the constitution due to go the white-dominated South African parliament for approval, possibly as early as today. The constitution was agreed last month in essentially bilateral negotiations between the ANC and its allies and the government. South Africa's immediate future will depend on the chief's decision: will he sign the constitution? If not, will he at least participate in the first all-race elections next April 27, arguing that voters should elect him to see the constitution improved? Will he oppose the poll, and risk seeing his base, Natal province, plunged in ever greater violence? Or will he, as he insists is possible, walk off the political stage where he has held a prominent place for decades, and retire forever? His departure would transform the political scene, not only in Natal province but also in the townships near Johannesburg which have seen so much recent carnage. Not that he is personally responsible for the killings, which have left some 12,000 people dead in political violence since 1990; but Inkatha would be crucially - probably terminally - weakened by the loss of the man who formed the organisation as a cultural movement in the early 1970s, and who has led it ever since. Chief Buthelezi is Inkatha; his lieutenants are weak men, with little popular base. It is hard to see them taking over. But Chief Buthelezi himself has become increasingly isolated in recent months, and this too is hurting Inkatha. Foreign embassies, previously friendly, have severely censured him for pulling out of multi-party talks. Once the darling of the local business community, he must have been shocked to learn that a recent poll showed his support among leading businessmen had fallen to zero; and in a surprise move at the weekend, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, who had never done more than repeat the views of Chief Buthelezi, openly criticised Inkatha for pulling out of talks. Asked why he might retire, Chief Buthelezi replied: 'If people are messing up the country and they think they are right, well let them do so. . . I am sick and tired to the pit of my stomach with being blamed when I'm right.' His said he held out 'no hope' that continuing talks between the government and the right-wing Freedom Alliance (which includes Inkatha) would yield agreement on constitutional amendments to meet his objections. These focus on the powers of regional governments, and on the fact that regions can raise no taxes without central government approval. The government appears to have conceded some independent taxation powers for regions, but it was not clear whether Chief Buthelezi's demand for 'exclusive' powers for regions in other areas would be met. The two sides have met almost constantly since the new constitution was approved at the multi-party negotiating forum, trying to strike a deal before it goes before parliament to become law. Chief Buthelezi said he foresaw problems with the installation of the Transitional Executive Council, due to meet for the first time tomorrow to oversee government in the run-up to elections. 'Even if they've got their army, I don't know how they actually implement it. . . because my people and I don't accept it. We have the right to resist it,' he said, then added 'peacefully'.</p>

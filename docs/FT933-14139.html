			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Royal Trustco to bail out share scheme executives THE PARENT company of Royal Trust, the Canadian financial institution controlled by the Bronfman family whose operations are being sold to Royal Bank of Canada, will spend about CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.6m) on life insurance policies to bail 151 managers out of an executive compensation scheme which went badly awry. Royal Bank has refused to employ any RT managers unless they are relieved of all obligations under a share purchase plan, which forced them as a condition of employment to buy large parcels of shares in Royal Trustco, RT's parent company. The purchases were financed by corporate loans. The idea of the scheme was that the managers would augment their salaries with handsome capital gains as RT's profits improved and the share price appreciated. Dividends would be used to pay interest on the loans. Instead of improving, business has gone into reverse, however. Earlier this year Mr Hartland MacDougall, RT chairman, announced that losses for 1992 were in the region of CDollars 900m. The share price of Royal Trustco, which recently changed its name to Gentra, has collapsed from a peak of more than CDollars 19 in 1989 to 37 cents. Many RT managers faced financial ruin if their loans were called in under the original terms of the purchase plan. Their total indebtedness under the scheme is CDollars 53.5m. Gentra now plans to extend the term of the loans for up to 70 years. The loans will be payable only if the shares rise above the original purchase price, or when the participant dies. In the latter event, the participant's obligations will be covered by the insurance policy. The bailout does not apply to 74 employees, with loans totalling CDollars 21m, who will not remain with RT after its sale to Royal Bank. Similar compensation plans have been in force at other companies controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. But the share prices of these companies have generally performed better than Royal Trustco, and fewer employees have been involved in the share purchase schemes. None the less, several of the Bronfmans' most senior executives have received large loans to relieve them of the burden of falling share prices.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN LEYTON WON'T RUN AGAIN  </P> <P> City Councilman Gene A. Leyton has announced that he will not run for  reelection in November.  </P> <P> Leyton, 64, told his colleagues that he wants to spend more time with his wife  and family.  </P> <P> He has had major surgery twice in the past two years, but he assured the  council that his health is fine.  </P> <P> The longtime Brea resident was appointed to the council to fill the vacancy  left by the death of Sam Cooper in 1985. He has been active in the community  for many years, serving three years as director of the Brea Foundation and six  years as parks, recreation and human services commissioner.  </P> <P> Leyton's five years on the council have been a time of change for Brea. The  city is in the midst of a major redevelopment project that included tearing  down the old high school and building a new one and widening State College  Boulevard and Lambert Street.  </P> <P> "This term was one of the busiest and one of the most productive," Leyton said.  "You don't realize how much time (being on the council) takes." DANIELLE  FOUQUETTE  </P></p>

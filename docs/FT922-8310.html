			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (7): Electrification is the top priority - China and India put coal first CONTINUING rapid electrification of the Indian and Chinese economies will keep power demand growing at 8-10 per cent annually during the 1990s, resulting in a doubling in electricity demand and power station coal burn by 2000. Growth could be higher, but the world's two most populous countries seem destined to see demand capped by their limited ability to bring on new generating sets. A blinkered emphasis on bringing capacity on stream quickly pays scant regard for the environment. The two countries' problems stem from the fact that they have much ground to catch up. Both have a very low level of electrification. Some 400m people - a quarter of their combined populations - still lack access to electricity. Average power consumption per head is a fifth of that in Thailand An extension of electrification into the more remote rural regins will boost demand, but not as much as building new stations and improving the lamentable performance of the existing stations. China has for more than a decade acknowledged that her factories have suffered regular and prolonged power cuts due to capacity shortages. It is estimated that power cuts force industry to stand idle for a third of the time. In India, the situation is less desperate, although persistent shortages have occurred in some areas, while all areas have been plagued by temporary cuts because of fuel shortages or urgent repairs to power stations. Plant availability, the proportion of time which generators can be on full power, has been low in both countries: well under 75 per cent for most years. While aid agencies, led by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, have been keen to boost the performance of existing stations, most of the emphasis has been put on building new plant. Both countries are planning for coal fired capacity to be more than doubled by 2000. Financing this build-up is a challenge for the state-owned utilities. India, and to a lesser extent, China, has sought to involve private and foreign investors in power generation. China took the initial lead in the mid 1980s, with its Shajiao B (700MW) coal station built by Hong Kong's Hopewell Holdings and operated under a build-own-operate deal. However, it is India which is setting the pace now, having at the end of 1991 passed legislation, paving the way for private investment in power stations. More recently, in an effort to underscore the commitment to private power, the government has said that private power station backers can also invest in captive mines to feed the stations. In this rush to build plant the environmental concerns, as the OECD sees them, have been largely ignored. An analyst close to the World Bank says mention of the environment in India or China brings the response of 'oh, the problem with dams'. Acid gas and carbon dioxide emissions are nowhere near the top of the agenda. While Mrs Maneka Gandhi raised the exposure of India's environmental department, the energy ministry have made few concessions in the direction of cleaner power generation, save that of landscaping new power plants. Flue gas de-sulphurisation, by which stack gases are scrubbed of sulphur dioxide, is considered an excessively expensive option especially given that Indian coal has a comparatively low sulphur content. The Chinese environmental movement barely keeps its head above water. The comment in Beijing about FGD is: 'very nice, but who's going to pay for it?' Increasing the efficiency of generation provides some scope to limit the damage from the planned increase in coal generation. Larger unit sizes with higher operating pressures and temperatures, greater emphasis on preventative maintenance, better system integration could boost efficiencies from the current levels of around 30 per cent to near 35. This could save up to 120m tonnes of coal in 2000. Even so, China and India are set to see a big increase in power station coal burn over the decade. By 2000, some 800m tonnes will be burned, virtually all of it in plant without control on sulphur dioxide or nitrous oxide emissions. Telling these giants to clean up their act will be futile, especially when these countries are still trying to raise per capital electricity consumption to third the level of the OECD in the 1950s.

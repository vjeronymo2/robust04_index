There is no doubt that Egypt has not faced such a disturbing  phenomenon in its modern history. Despite all the measures that  the police are adopting with courage and devotion, the  conditions that produce terrorism still exist, whether  internally as a result of economic and social difficulties, the  weakness of the political influence of the parties and the  popular organizations, and the inability of some services to  fulfill their role, particularly in the information field, or  externally as a result of interference by some states that  support the terrorists with money and political guidance.    Combating and ending terrorism is difficult to accomplish  through the security services alone. A studied and integrated  plan to group the responsible ministries in a higher council for  combating terrorism is needed. [passage omitted]    The call for national dialogue shows the beginning of  interest in and appreciation of the need to mobilize the efforts  of all forces that believe in a civilized society and are  against terrorism as a method of political action. Until such  dialogue, which has caused much argument, takes place, the  executive authority must establish this higher council to combat  terrorism. This council should include the leaders of the  political and party forces in order to have cohesion between the  people and the government.    Defense Minister Tantawi's statement came at the appropriate  time, because it shows the readiness of the Armed Forces to  secure the internal front within the framework of constitutional  legitimacy. [passage omitted]    After 20 years of peace following the October war, we feel  that the phenomenon of terrorism exercised by groups that  falsely call themselves Muslim have begun to represent a danger  and threat to the internal front. This prompts us to ask about  the role that the Armed Forces can play. Field Marshal Tantawi  answered this question when he said that this can take place  through coordination with the various ministries and services.    The Armed Forces can provide many services to promote  production and develop the services. But this must be done as  part of a studied government plan. Nevertheless, coordination  between the police and the Armed Forces has become necessary to  raise the standard of performance against terrorism.    I read a statement by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi in  AL-MUSAWWAR magazine in which he said some policemen are trained  by the Army. This is good. But some manifestations indicate  that either this is being done on a limited basis or that it is  not part of a comprehensive scientific plan to raise the  standard of the police force. [passage omitted]    This is not a call to give the Armed Forces a bigger role  over the other political, legislative, and executive  authorities. This is a call for coordination among all the  forces that live in Egypt within the framework of a civilized  society based on democracy and human rights.</p>

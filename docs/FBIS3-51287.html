			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mexico City, 15 Jan (EFE) -- Mexican Foreign  Secretary Manuel Tello last night described as offensive to  Mexico a proposal by U.S. Representative Robert Torricelli, a  Democrat, that the U.S. Congress investigate the Chiapas events.    Torricelli is calling on Clinton administration officials  and  human rights advocates to testify at a hearing on the Chiapas  uprising.    "The United States should make very clear to the Mexican  Government the type of political reforms required if we are to  maintain a new relationship," stated the Democratic  representative, who said the hearing has been scheduled for 2  February.    Tello said Torricelli's initiative is unfriendly and  offensive. It seems that the legislator is unaware, Tello  stated, of the measures the Mexican Government has taken to find  a peaceful solution to the conflict in Chiapas.    It seems that they want to take up the old arguments that  went on during the NAFTA debate and link commercial policies to  interventionist intentions in Mexico, the foreign relations  secretary concluded. [no quotation marks as received]    A group of U.S. legislators who support NAFTA have sent a  letter to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to express their  concern over the events in Chiapas and to ask him to facilitate  investigations by human rights groups and the media in the area  of conflict.

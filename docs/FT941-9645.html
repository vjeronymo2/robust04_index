			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / MPs briefed on bill consultations MPs on the standing committee studying the incapacity for work bill will tomorrow be briefed by Whitehall officials on consultations that the government is conducting on a proposed medical test for benefit recipients. The move is intended partly to try and reassure opposition MPs that the government is acting in good faith on what is a controversial measure. Such conciliatory gestures are unusual in the confrontational forum of a standing committee. The bill is intended to ensure that incapacity benefit will only be paid to those properly entitled to it.</p>

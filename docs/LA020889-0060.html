			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTIONIST POLICY EMERGES IN S. KOREAN DEAL;  </P> <P> JAPAN'S TEXTILES LIMIT CONTRADICTS CLAIM ON IMPORTS  </P> <P> During his trip to the United States that ended Tuesday, Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita cited a spurt in imports by Japan last year as proof that his country  is transforming itself into a new kind of economic animal -- one intent on  welcoming products from abroad.  </P> <P> But an ominous contradiction of that claim has emerged.  </P> <P> A dispute over imports of textiles from South Korea, once regarded as a key  test of Takeshita's pledge at the Toronto economic summit last summer to  promote more imports from Japan's Asian neighbors, has ended -- with Japan  failing the test.  </P> <P> After eight months of threats, culminating with the filing of an anti-dumping  suit against Korean knitwear imports, Japan extracted an agreement from South  Korea to limit exports of knitted sweaters to a 1% annual increase for three  years, beginning this year. Korean manufacturers also agreed to set minimum  prices on knitwear sold to Japan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticized by Newspapers  </P> <P> The agreement consisted of a pledge by executives of South Korea's textile  industry to executives of Japan's industry. In that form, it enabled Takeshita  to keep unblemished Japan's record as the only industrialized nation other than  Switzerland that does not impose governmental textile import restrictions, even  though they are of a type approved under a special General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade accord.  </P> <P> Both governments worked hard behind the scenes to hammer it out, and Japan's  minister of international trade and industry, Hiroshi Mitsuzaka, publicly said  he "evaluated it highly."  </P> <P> However, Japanese newspapers condemned the agreement.  </P> <P> The Asahi said in an editorial that Japan had forced the South Koreans to  accept the "voluntary" restraints through threats -- in much the same way that  the United States had threatened Japan to bring about this country's  "voluntary" restrictions on exports of steel, machine tools, automobiles,  textiles and other Japanese goods to the United States.  </P> <P> The precedent, the Asahi complained, could spur a host of other Japanese  industries -- cement and steel, in particular -- to demand similar protection.  </P> <P> Indeed, Kagayaki Miyazaki, chairman of the Japan Knitting Industry Assn.,  declared openly that he "expected this agreement to become a model for other  industries."  </P> <P> But officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said no other  industry had made moves to emulate the textile makers. They also declared that  the voluntary restrictions amounted to an extraordinary "emergency measure,"  not a harbinger of the future.  </P> <P> The dispute did, in fact, serve to expose just how far Japan's textile market  had opened to imports, as well as to spotlight the great expansion of sales of  South Korean products here.  </P> <P> Last year, Japanese trading companies, supermarkets and other importers  purchased about 110 million sweaters and cardigans from foreign countries,  mostly in Asia -- or nine for every 10 men, women and children in the country.  Japan has a population of 122.4 million.  </P> <P> Of the imported sweaters, about 63.5 million came from South Korea, according  to the trade ministry. Imports in 1988 represented a 60% gain on top of a 62%  upsurge in 1987.  </P> <P> Knitted sweaters from South Korea have been selling for between $15 and $30,  while Japanese sweaters are priced from $39.  </P> <P> Overall textile imports rose 39% to $10.6 billion last year to become Japan's  second-biggest category of imports after oil and petroleum products. And in an  industry in which Japan, until 1986, had consistently enjoyed a trade surplus  dating back into the 19th Century, its deficit in manufactured textile trade  rose to $3.1 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Japan's Ability in Doubt  </P> <P> The turnabout, nonetheless, represented just a small move in the direction of  the U.S. example. With its $25 billion in textile imports, the United States  still far outstrips Japan as the world's No. 1 importer.  </P> <P> Analysts, however, were already expressing doubt that Japan would be able to  halt the import surge.  </P> <P> Trading companies and supermarkets were reported shifting orders for sweaters  to other Asian countries. South Korea, meanwhile, was expected to upgrade the  quality and price of the sweaters it sells to Japan.  </P> <P> As a result, the effort to protect some 7,000 small Japanese textile firms,  analysts said, is doomed as what one called a "mole-tapping" exercise -- trying  to dispose of moles by running from hole to hole and beating the animals, one  by one, as they come out.  </P></p>

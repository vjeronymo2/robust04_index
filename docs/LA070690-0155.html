			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLISH CABINET DROPS ALL BUT 1 FORMER COMMUNIST  </P> <P> Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki ousted all but one former Communist from his  Cabinet today to counter criticism of his 10-month-old government's  performance.  </P> <P> But some Solidarity activists said the changes weren't sweeping enough.  </P> <P> In a speech before Parliament that was broadcast nationwide, Mazowiecki said  political battles in the non-Communist-led government were threatening the  country's peaceful evolution to democracy.  </P> <P> The prime minister announced the resignation of five Cabinet ministers,  including three of the four former Communists who remained in the government as  the price for Solidarity replacing the Communist regime in September.  </P> <P> Prominent among those ousted was the interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak,  who is in charge of the police, and Defense Minister Florian Siwicki.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki retained ex-Communist Marcin Swiecicki, the young foreign trade  minister who has been instrumental in trade talks with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Some Solidarity activists said they were not satisfied with the shake-up.  </P> <P> "These changes are not sufficient," said Bogdan Lis, a Solidarity senator from  Gdansk.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 28 KYODO -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin reiterated Monday [29 March] that dialogue among North and  South Korea, the United States and the U.N. nuclear watchdog is  the only way to resolve the heightening tensions on the Korean  peninsula, South Korean journalists said.    "The only appropriate way that parties directly involved  will  resolve the issue constructively is with patience," said Jiang,  concurrently general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.    Jiang was speaking to the Korean reporters for some 20  minutes after summit talks with South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam.    The Chinese leader was quoted as saying there is a limit to  what China can do. He expressed hope that the nuclear problem  would be solved through existing channels of dialogue among  Seoul, Pyongyang, Washington and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), the journalists said.    "I discussed the nuclear issue frankly with the South Korean  side and agreed that a solution through dialogue is the proper  way," Jiang said.    The IAEA referred North Korea's nuclear issue to the U.N.  Security Council after Pyongyang hampered full inspections of  its suspected nuclear facilities to verify whether it had  diverted materials for the development of nuclear weapons.    The U.S. has proposed a Security Council resolution urging  North Korea to agree to follow-up inspections of its nuclear  facilities within one month.    But China, which is eager to keep open the door for dialogue  with North Korea, has suggested that the Security Council issue  a nonbinding statement in the name of its president,  Jaen-Bernard Merimee of France.    Jiang also told the Korean reporters that if tensions mount  on the peninsula, the Korean people will suffer most and the  situation will not be good for Northeast Asia.    In talks with Kim on Monday, Jiang reiterated the need for  patience on all sides and added that pressure should not be  used, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    Kim, who flew into Shanghai from Tokyo on Saturday, arrived  in Beijing late Sunday to meet Chinese leaders to discuss the  North's suspected nuclear development program and expand Seoul's  trade ties with Beijing. He will return home Wednesday.</p>

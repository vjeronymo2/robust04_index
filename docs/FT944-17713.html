			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI hit by US selling A two-way pull appeared to be developing in ICI shares yesterday as word went round the market that one US house was trying to steal a march on its rivals and call the top of the chemicals sector. Relatively high turnover of 4m shares and a drop of 28 to 787p yesterday was attributed to heavy US selling, and some dealers said one house had taken the stock off its buy list as part of a macroeconomic rerating. Morgan Stanley was cited, although the investment bank denied any change of stance. Shares in the UK's sector leader had reflected the boom in commodity prices and ICI stock touched an all-time high of 868p in early August. Since then it has fallen with the market, but many analysts have lifted profits forecasts for the company ahead of third-quarter figures due on October 27. Goldman Sachs, for example, believes that the stock will outperform by 10 per cent until the new year. The house chemicals team cites double-digit growth in key commodities such as ethylene throughout September.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 27 Mar (EFE) -- The Peruvian media reported  today that the Mexican Government has asked Peru to help their  anti-terrorist struggle.    The Lima daily EXPRESO says that within the next few days  two  National Police Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) experts  will travel to the Mexican capital with President Alberto  Fujimori's authorization.    EXPRESO cites high-ranking police sources who state that the  officers are Colonel Juan Gonzalez Sandoval and Lieutenant  Colonel Alberto Sarmiento Gutierrez.    It adds that Gonzalez and Sarmiento will be in Mexico for at  least 10 days.    Mexican officials want to learn the Peruvian way of facing a  possible upsurge of the terrorist phenomenon following the  Chiapas rebellion and the death of presidential candidate Luis  Donaldo Colosio.</p>

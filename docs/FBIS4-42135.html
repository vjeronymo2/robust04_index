			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who represented  Turkey at the European Stability Pact conference in Paris, has  declared that Turkey believes in the benefit of the newly  forming European Stability Pact and is ready to contribute to it  in any possible way if requested. Cetin returned to Turkey  tonight after attending the opening of the conference.    In a statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin said that  the opening conference of the European Stability Pact, which  turned into a joint European Union [EU] initiative at the last  minute, was extremely beneficial as a result of the  participation of some 40 countries. The ineffectiveness of the  security organizations in the face of the tragedies in  Bosnia-Herzegovina played a role in the emergence of the idea  for a stability pact in Europe, Cetin remarked. He noted that  the essential approach of this idea consists of preventive  diplomacy. Stressing that the pact is aimed at resolving the  problems among the Baltic countries, Romania, and Bulgaria  without carrying them over into the EU, Cetin reported that two  documents were issued at the end of the conference. The foreign  minister continued:    [Begin Cetin recording] At this stage, we must not make  definitive statements about the role, contribution, or  participation of countries like Turkey which are not directly  targeted by the European Stability Pact. I would like to note  that in addition to Turkey and Russia, Ukraine, the United  States, and Canada fall into this category. We declared that if  requested, we are ready to make every possible contribution to  this process. [end recording]    Cetin explained that the Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy has not  actually ended yet and stressed that the creation process of the  European Stability Pact must be rid of the impression that the  perpetrators of the policy of ethnic cleansing will be allowed  to profit from their actions.    Cetin said that during the conference he held very useful  talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on regional and  international issues and discussed the measures that must be  adopted to end the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict with the  Armenian deputy foreign minister. Cetin concluded by saying  that in his meeting with the U.S. assistant secretary of state  he declared that the decisions adopted by the U.S. Congress are  the product of erroneous assessments and are not welcomed by  Turkey.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Economic  Relations Minister Oleg Davydov is to hold talks with U.S.  officials in Washington on the removal of obstacles in bilateral  trade-economic relations, the official ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY  said today.    The talks, scheduled to begin on Tuesday [21 June] within  the  framework of the joint Russian-U.S. Commission known as the  Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission, will also focus on major U.S.  investments in Russia.    Before leaving for Washington on Sunday night, Davydov told  reporters that in 1993, the two countries' trade turnover  increased by 1.2 times from 1,992 to 4.3 billion U.S. dollars.    Russia's exports increased considerably, trebling from the  1992 figure to 1,997 million dollars last year, while its  imports diminished from 2883.7 million dollars in the same year  to 2303.7 million dollars in 1993.    This enabled the two nations to reduce the traditional  deficit in mutual turnover to a minimum, the minister pointed  out.    He said that statistics for the first quarter of this year  make it possible to conclude that this positive trend in the  development of trade between Russia and the United States will  continue in 1994.    The achievement of an approximate parity in trade between  the  two countries was largely due to the sharp cut in grain  purchases, which earlier accounted for at least one half of all  Russian imports from the United States, Davydov said.    As to the remaining obstacles in bilateral trade relations,  he stated that they include the low competitiveness of many  Russian goods, the barriers to exports of high-tech goods from  the United States and the severe anti-dumping legislation.    Investment cooperation is playing an increasingly important  role in economic interaction between the two countries,  according to the Russian minister. U.S. firms are in the lead  among Western investors seeking to set up joint ventures in  Russia.    The Russian official said that there are 1,400 joint  ventures  in the country with U.S. capital investment, reaching nearly 400  million U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>   [Text] A senior military source this weekend admitted that  in the framework of the current timetable "it will be impossible  to complete the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal plan by mid-April in  accordance with the original plan."    The source added: "It is possible that we will need one or  two more months to transfer the territory to the Palestinians  smoothly."    Meanwhile the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is continuing to  prepare for the withdrawal. Many reserve units have recently  received call-up notices for February and March to implement  "rainbow" plan -- the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal and redeployment  plan.    IDF sources say: "We are continuing with the redeployment  without any connection to the political negotiations. We want  to attain a situation wherein we will be able to efficiently  implement any political plan on short notice."    The military source confirmed that the IDF has sent call-up  notices to transport, supplies, and other logistic units. He  explained, however, that the implementation of the plan is  dependent on the political echelon's approval.    The IDF has also completed its preparations for the release  of more than 3,000 Palestinian prisoners in case a significant  breakthrough is made on the Palestinian track. Among those  slated to be released are sick and elderly prisoners, women, and  prisoners who are not members of rejectionist front  organizations and "who do not have blood on their hands."    The Finance Ministry has approved an allocation of 350  million shekels for IDF redeployment following its withdrawal.</p>

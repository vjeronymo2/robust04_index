			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Carlton agreed bid values Central at Pounds 758m Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications launched the ITV takeover game yesterday with an agreed bid for Central Independent Television which valued the second largest ITV company at Pounds 758m. The cash and shares conditional deal at the equivalent of Pounds 26 a share came just five days after Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, proposed changing the ITV ownership rules to allow, for the first time, a single company to own a total of two broadcasting licences. Labour last night criticised Mr Brooke for the 'impropriety' of his announcement, allowing Carlton to create by far the largest ITV company, commanding around 30 per cent of total ITV advertising revenue. Mr Green will become the most powerful figure in UK commercial television if the Central deal, conditional on parliamentary approval, goes through. Central owns 20 per cent of Meridian, the south of England broadcaster, and Carlton owns 20 per cent of Good Morning Television, the commercial broadcaster. Mr Green is also chairman of ITN. The debate on the ITV ownership rules is expected within the next two weeks and, if approved, the new rules will come into effect on January 1. At the same time, Carlton, which has interests ranging from television facilities and professional equipment to video-cassette duplication, underlined its growing strength by announcing a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.1m. Central's share price rose more than Pounds 4 yesterday to Pounds 25.73 and Carlton finished 30p up at 797p. Eventually, Granada is expected to bid for London Weekend Television, a company in which it holds 20 per cent, and Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian Broadcasting, is predicted to go for either Anglia Television or HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ming Man] </F>   [Text] Key advisers to Beijing say the Hong Kong  Government is headed for smoother relations with the mainland  following the move to stop two dissidents entering the  territory. Pro-Beijing legislator and Preliminary Working  Committee member Tam Yiu-chung said Hong Kong's relationship  with Beijing would be helped by keeping out people China  believed were subversive.    The British Consulate-General in New York last week rejected  visa applications for Hong Kong from Liu Binyin and Ruan Ming to  attend a seminar coinciding with the fifth anniversary of  Beijing's June 4 crackdown at Tiananmen Square. The United  States-exiled Chinese said the consulate had refused them visas  on instructions from Hong Kong's Immigration Department.    Mr Tam said the move would help a smooth transition to  Chinese rule in 1997. "Sino-British relations would be improved  if Hong Kong keeps out people who China feels are subversive or  antagonistic towards the mainland," Mr Tam said.    Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress Liu  Yiu-chu said the government's decision to refuse visas was due  to the need to cooperate with China for a smooth transition. Ms  Liu attacked the two dissidents for trying to "rock" Hong Kong  by importing "their political fight."    Exiled Mr Liu earned notoriety for revealing government  corruption as a People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] reporter. Mr Ruan  was secretary to former Chinese Communist Party general  secretary Hu Yaobang, whose death in May 1989 triggered the  Tiananmen protests.    While pro-Beijing groups welcome the government's stand,  Governor Chris Patten is set to come under fire from liberal  legislators when he returns to Hong Kong this week. Several  said they would raise the issue at the Legislative Council on  Tuesday [31 May].    Independent legislator Christine Loh said she was not  surprised at the visa rejection as the territory had a history  of turning away "subversives". Ms Loh argued the "one country,  two systems" concept of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong may  disappear as China tries to dictate to Hong Kong.    Independent legislator Emily Lau said she could not  understand why the two exiled scholars were refused entry.  "They're not raving subversives. It's quite ridiculous," Ms  Lau said.    Last Thursday Acting Governor Anson Chan said Hong Kong  should not be used as a base for subversive activities for the  June 4 anniversary. Last week China revealed a softening stance  towards Hong Kong by indicating its willingness to allow four  foreigners to sit as judges on the territory's Court of Final  Appeal.</p>

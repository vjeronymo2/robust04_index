			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hungary agrees to sell 51% of HungarHotels Hungary's privatisation authorities yesterday backed down and agreed to sell a 51 per cent stake in the country's last state-owned hotel chain to American General Hospitality, a privately-held US hotel management group. AGH won the right to negotiate for HungarHotels last month but talks broke down between the company and the privatisation body, after a last-minute price increase and political pressure to hand over the group to the cash-strapped social security fund.</p>

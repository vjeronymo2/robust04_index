			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Mr Yeltsin and democracy THE carte blanche which western leaders have given to President Boris Yeltsin is increasingly under challenge from Russian parliamentarians and press. This is right. Russia wishes to be accepted both as a democratic state and as an economy at least approaching the market, so it must expect to be judged by the prevailing norms of both as it prepares for parliamentary elections. They take place in the shadow of a parliament still bearing the scorch marks of its suppression by the army last month. The end of the parliament means that the constitution, which crucially deals with the division of powers between the presidency and the legislature, is being framed without any representation whatever from the latter. The assault on parliament has been, as Mr Yeltsin slyly noted last week, a lesson hastily taken by every locus of power in the country; all treat him now with greater deference. Like the much bloodier and much less justifiable suppression of dissent in Tiananmen Square, it has had the effect of strengthening the centre and of encouraging foreign investment (in Russia's case, this is still tentative); but it has also unmistakably inhibited debate, and given the president nearly all the aces. Compromises Thus, in the construction of the new constitution, the compromises which Mr Yeltsin's team had made in earlier drafts to the parliament, to the regions and to political forces have largely been cancelled. When the constitution is unveiled on Wednesday, it seems that parliament's first term will be limited to two years and that, in the second term, the deputies of the upper house who are to be elected in this December's polls will thereafter be nominated by the regions and the republics. This is likely to result in the senior chamber being dominated by regional placemen answerable to presidentially-appointed governors rather than to the people. Meanwhile, the conduct of the election has been uneven. The parties of the far left and right have suffered significant problems in securing office space and telephones, while those who have fielded candidates who were deputies in the old parliament have seen their phones cut off and the tenancy of their flats threatened. The media has been unbalanced in favour of the pro-presidential parties. Newspapers, especially the increasingly influential regional ones, are largely for the Yeltsin parties; they are also supported by the state budget. Some anti-Yeltsin voices, like the popular, far-right television programme 600 Seconds, remain banned. Trauma Now, it appears, Mr Yeltsin has decided not to hold pre-term presidential elections next June, as he had earlier insisted he would. What could have been an opportunity for renewing his mandate after the trauma of the last few months is to be forgone in favour of a continuation of his presidency until its appointed end in June 1996. All of this gives occasion for some alarm. The field is not level, the media are not balanced, the rules are being made up on the hoof. The only source of ultimate authority is the president. But this does not yet amount to authoritarian rule. It is rather the product of confusion, conflicting ambitions and lack of democratic experience. What still shines through the twists and turns of the Yeltsin camp is the intense desire to create the institutions of a functioning democratic state and of a functioning market economy. The vacuum where a balance of powers should be is due to the suicidal course taken by parliament in attempting to pit itself uncompromisingly against the executive power, ultimately up to the use of arms. Those who are left holding the instruments of the state can do no other than construct a system in this vacuum. Mr Yeltsin's decision to soldier on to 1996 is not alarming in itself; a greater worry is that his health and energy will not stand it, and that the parliament he is bringing to life will find itself too constrained in its role to develop as a responsible legislature. But overall, the vigour of the pre-election process and the diversity of view shown a mere five weeks after the fate of the state itself was briefly in the balance, is impressive and reassuring. Mr Yeltsin remains the best bet yet.</p>

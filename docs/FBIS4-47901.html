			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting has been taking place since this morning  at the Gabonese Trade Union Confederation headquarters between  Mines and Fuel Minister Paul Toungui and representatives of the  various petroleum companies. The meeting follows the extension  of the 48-hour warning strike launched by the workers of the  Libreville Petroleum Group. This strike first resulted in a gas  shortage and now a fuel shortage which has caused a lot of  inconvenience for housewives and many drivers who could not get  to work this morning. The petroleum workers, who are threatening  to extend their strike to 8 May, are demanding a 15-percent  salary increase.    [Paris AFP in French at 1158 GMT on 4 May in a similar  Libreville-datelined report adds: "A two-day strike by workers  of petroleum products distribution companies has today led to  the suspension of domestic flights and a fuel and gas shortage  in Libreville. All domestic flights will be suspended until 8  May unless a solution is found between now and then, airline  sources say. However, national Air Gabon Airlines are  maintaining international flights. Gas stations have not  received supplies since 2 May and a lot of them, even though  pump attendants are not participating in the strike, have had to  stop distributing fuel. It is also impossible to find gas  cylinders, which are distributed by the petroleum companies."]</p>

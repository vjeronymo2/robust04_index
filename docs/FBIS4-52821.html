			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Moscow has protested to  Seoul about the allegedly overheated media coverage in South  Korea of the issue of North Korean escapees from Siberian  logging camps, diplomatic sources here said Thursday.    The Russian Government has stated that it might reconsider  the basic policy on the loggers previously agreed with Seoul,  thereby putting bilateral relations in a high state of tension,  according to the sources.    The two countries' foreign ministers met in Moscow last  month  to agree on a basic policy under which Russia would deal with  the North Korean escapees according to its domestic law but from  a humanitarian point of view. [sentence as received]    The agreement also calls on Moscow to give Seoul maximum  cooperation if the North Koreans want to resettle in the South.    Seoul is devising concrete measures to help North Korean  refugees resettle in South Korea -- providing opportunities for  vocational education and social adaptation training, for example.    Russia, however, took a tougher line when the loggers  started  receiving heavy coverage in the South Korean media, some of  which compared the issue to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall  in 1990.    The Russians, hoping not to further dampen relations with  North Korea, expressed their bewilderment and dissatisfaction  with such reports through a diplomatic channel to the South  Korean Government, sources said.    Some Russian public security officials even suggested that  Moscow should forget the earlier agreement with Seoul and not  cooperate in dealing with the loggers, sources said.    A Russian Foreign Ministry official said the issue of the  loggers would have already become a serious diplomatic problem  had it not been for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's  scheduled visit to Moscow in June.    Working-level consultations among related ministries on  resettlement of the North Korean loggers are under way in  Moscow, but some ministry officials are apparently mindful of  North Korea raising objections, sources said.    Some Russian Government officials said Moscow may allow some  North Korean loggers go to the South on the occasion of  President Kim Yong-sam's visit, but that it may stop if South  Korean papers keep playing up the issue.    So despite President Kim's visit to Moscow, the logger  problem may seriously damage bilateral relations, experts on  Korean issues say.    Complicating matters, Russia is anxious to mend fences with  North Korea.    The diplomatic experts said Russia is seeking good relations  with North Korea in a bid to gain more influence in Korean  affairs, including the nuclear dispute.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- Silk production is  increasing in Korea.    The Korean Silk Association overfulfilled its April plan by  5.7 percent, according to the data available.    The association fulfilled its first quarterly year plan ten  days ahead of the schedule.    Korea with a long history of silk production is one of the  famous silk production countries in the world.    Many large and small silk and silk-textile mills and  workshops have been built in various places of the country.  Among them are Pyongyang silk mill, Hamhung silk mill,  Yongbyon, Pakchon and Kumya silk-textile mills.    Modern silk processing centres have been built to turn out  2,000 kinds of silk cloth, thread and clothes including Yaksan  silk, brocade and Kuryong silk, special products of Korea.    Most of them are exported to foreign countries and are  gaining favour at world market.    The export output value doubled in recent five years.    Especially, brocade took two gold medals at an international  exhibition.    The prospect of silk production is very good in Korea.    In recent years silk production capacity greatly increased  with the promotion of expansion projects and the introduction of  modern equipment.    Joint venture with foreign countries is encouraged.    Mulberry fields are expanded year by year and breeds of  silkworms and feeds are developed, providing favourable  conditions for development of sericulture.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Victor Manuel Rebolledo, designated </F> administration secretary general of government, by Maria Eugenia  Oyarzun at his residence in Santiago; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Oyarzun] Congressional  sources have said that the General Secretariat of Government  will have a lower profile during the next administration. What  do you know about this?    [Rebolledo] I have been unable to establish the basis or the  source of these reports. The president has said the secretary  general of government will continue to act as the government  spokesman. I have already performed several assignments for the  administration that will be installed in March. Moreover, this  is one of the three posts that deal with the political sector  and as such it has an indisputably political role.    [Oyarzun] How do you see your post within the government's  three political ministries?    [Rebolledo] To efficiently fulfill the duties the law  assigns  to the General Secretariat of Government through the  directorates under its jurisdiction, and to look after social  organizations and the government's political communications. In  addition, there is a political role which is more intangible and  which deals with issues on the agenda.    [Oyarzun] Do you think the Frei administration will have a  more difficult task than [Chilean President Patricio] Aylwin's?    [Rebolledo] I believe the Frei administration will face  different problems. Many issues that were a priority in  President Aylwin's administration -- such as development and the  progress of the democratic transition -- are not at the top of  the agenda as they were in 1990. Better civic-military ties,  the certainty of continued economic stability that results in  interesting growth rates, the expansion of Chilean markets, and  healthy macroeconomic guidelines will help. Right now we have a  more complex economic situation than President Aylwin's  administration had to face: International recession has an  impact on our economy. Although I am not frightened by it, some  believe that as democracy consolidates itself, social conflicts  -- which in Chile have been extremely scarce -- will increase.    [Oyarzun] What is your response to criticism that  President-elect Frei has been more "politically cautious" in  appointing his cabinet than Aylwin?    [Rebolledo] I disagree. President-elect Frei appointed his  cabinet fully exercising his prerogatives. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] You have admitted that you were not surprised by  your appointment as minister in charge of the political sector.  Why?    [Rebolledo] We made a great effort in the current  legislature  to show our representative force nationwide but this was not the  case in the last legislature where we only had seven deputies.  One of our goals was for one of our members to head a political  affairs ministry.    [Oyarzun] How long do you think you will be in the cabinet?    [Rebolledo] One tends to think that during a six-year term,  an administration such as the one headed by President Frei will  work with a couple of teams, at least. But beyond what is  established by common sense, it is very difficult to predict.    [Oyarzun] Are you planning to run for deputy or senator in  four years or so?    [Rebolledo] I am very involved in politics and thus cannot  reject this possibility, but I am not working toward this goal.  I am fully concentrated on being a loyal and efficient cabinet  member of the Frei administration.    [Oyarzun] Will this administration be beyond political  parties or will political parties have great participation?    [Rebolledo] I believe both. President Aylwin's  administration was beyond political parties but it also allowed  the participation of those political parties that had incipient  cadres as a result of the military government that we were  leaving behind. For the past four years, political parties have  experienced three national elections: the 1989 presidential and  legislative elections, the 1992 municipal elections, and the  1993 presidential election held last December. Political  parties are stronger, they are more clearly aware of their true  forces and know which of the almost 30 political parties both in  the government and the opposition are mere acronyms. President  Frei will have an administration that is beyond political  parties.    [Oyarzun] The newly appointed PS [Socialist Party] President  Camilo Escalona, has stated he will ask the government to  restore diplomatic ties with Cuba. Do you agree?    [Rebolledo] Yes, I have always said that Chile should have  diplomatic ties with all countries, particularly with Latin  American countries. Chile and Paraguay are the only Latin  American countries that do not have diplomatic ties with Cuba;  restoring these ties would be advantageous for Chile and for  Chilean businessmen.    [Oyarzun] Will Fidel Castro be invited to the inauguration?    [Rebolledo] No, because Chile does not maintain diplomatic  ties with Cuba. That is my personal opinion, but the foreign  policy is encompassed in the platform of the Coalition of  Parties for Democracy and is implemented by the president and  his foreign minister. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] All administrations -- including the current one  -- pressure the media, either through summons, appeals,  suggestions, etc. How will you handle the situation?    [Rebolledo] I would never pressure any member of the media  nor would I summon them out of principle or for simple practical  reasons. I believe it is improper and harmful to pressure the  media. However, I will react if faced with any erroneous  reportage, but this is something else.    [Oyarzun] Why do people say that you are against  journalists?    [Rebolledo] I am very pleased with my ties with the press. I  have studied each situation individually and conclude that I  know many important journalists and many who are just starting.  This has been gratifying because we are engaged in an activity  that is good for the country with people from different levels.  I have a positive assessment of the responsible way in which  the press has worked during these four years of the transition  process. I believe it has greatly contributed to the excellent  transition period we have experienced. Even though this  administration does not control any member of the media, it is  leaving office with great prestige. This is because the press  has acted objectively and responsibly.    [Oyarzun] During your years in exile, did you ever think of  overthrowing the military government through armed struggle?    [Rebolledo] Never. I have never believed in the armed  struggle and have always rejected it.    [Oyarzun] What credit would you give to the 17-year military  government?    [Rebolledo] Although at a very heavy cost -- with which I  disagree -- I believe they helped to modernize the country.  [passage omitted]</p>

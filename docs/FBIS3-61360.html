			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Presentation by Ukrainian President L.M. Kravchuk at the </F> Center for Cadre Skill Improvement of the Institute of State  Government and Self-Government of the Cabinet of Ministers of  Ukraine; no date given: "We Are Working With More Than One Day  in Mind"]    [Text] It is good that we met at this difficult, even  extremely complicated time for Ukraine in order to ponder  together problems that need to be solved, noted the president.  First of all, these are socioeconomic issues and joint actions,  our position on elections.    We predicted that crisis phenomena would occur inevitably if  there were to be the partition of states and reforms in society.  However, we did not imagine the entire scope of the crisis.    Among the reasons for the current difficult situation, there  are domestic reasons that include structural changes in  industry, the establishment of new relations between enterprises  within Ukraine, and reforms in the financial, banking, and  credit systems. Of course, we do not have either a precise  program, or an adequate number of persons capable of effecting  profound transformations. After all, this is not just about the  professional qualifications of people but about fundamentally  new approaches and a new system of actions. This requires time,  reinterpretation, and retraining.    External factors--they frequently say that, supposedly,  Ukraine is some kind of a recalcitrant fellow who triggered the  processes of economic breakup. Supposedly, this is one of the  main reasons why the crisis has become deeper, and so on. I do  not disclaim my responsibility and that of the government and  other power structures for not acting precisely and consistently  at all times. However, it is a mistake to believe that the cause  of the crisis is solely in severing the relations. This prevents  people from taking more resolute and persistent steps in order  to find one solution or another here, in Ukraine, rather than  sit on the ramparts as Yaroslavna and lament the severance of  relations.    I do not want this to be immediately perceived as  interference in Russia's domestic processes, but you see that  plants are being stopped there--tractor and combined harvester  plants, cotton mills. The question is--are we the reason for  that? Difficult processes are underway in both Ukraine and  Russia.    There are people who say: Let us quickly get back together,  and everything will fall into place: Sausage will be cheap, and  everything will be problem-free. Perhaps those who talk about  this desire to restore everything the way it was: "centralized,"  "administrative," and "power of the united force," and so on. Is  this possible? It is impossible. Everybody knows this well, but  instead of somehow persuading the people to think and act  realistically, certain leaders and the mass media follow the  path of least resistance, playing along to the mood of some  people.    However, there also are examples to the contrary. For  example, the Zaporozhye Motorsich plant established relations  with Russia--nobody forbade it to them--and is now operating in  a stable manner. The director of this plant, Bohuslayev, said  correctly as he reported to the congress of industrialists that  we should now find direct relations and integrate at the level  of enterprises and collectives.    I see a strange picture. I receive telegrams: Give us money,  do this, open that. What is this, a civilized state? Is it the  function of the president to be a patron of all structures with  regard to material-technical supplies?    I would like to agree with you about one issue, without  analyzing the entire set of problems. How are we to come  together so as not to divide now into those who are to blame and  those who are not?    I am giving you the numbers. The total amount of  expenditures  from the state budget during nine months of this year came to  almost 15 trillion karbovantsy. This exceeded revenues by more  than 5 trillion. Meanwhile, 983 billion were approved for the  year, let us say, 1 trillion. How is it possible to keep  increasing expenditures without increasing the revenue side of  the budget? Of course, it is possible if the printing press  operates and continues to put into circulation money that is not  backed up with anything. However, in a month to 1.5 months, ruin  would be inevitable.    Ways to replenish the budget should be found promptly; the  tax service should be resolutely put in order. For this I appeal  directly to you. The tax service should work together with  organs that are involved in this and with administrations, and  mobilize revenues to all levels of the budget on the basis of  law and order. We will simply not survive otherwise.    I will resolutely support you in putting the tax system in  order, stopping the shipment of goods out of the country, and  fighting corruption and crime.    I would like to once again revisit the question of prices.  We  did not have an opportunity to not raise prices, but there  should be correspondence between them and remuneration for  labor. However, there is a nuance: If production falls, and  labor productivity falls, whereas wages increase, this is a  purely inflationary process. To prevent a slump in production is  the only possible way to stop the impoverishment of the people  and improve their welfare. Giving the producer freedom is the  only way to do this. I have proceeded to grant greater rights to  regions. This has to do first of all with economic rights and  freedoms and liberalization of government at the level of  regions. We will also proceed to give the collectives the right  to manage the resources that they have and that they are earning.    Intimidating the people with a mafia that is grabbing  everything through privatization amounts to deliberately  promoting tension in our society in order to stop privatization  and conversion to joint-stock operations, because a plant that  is given to its collective through conversion to joint-stock  format operates to benefit the Ukrainian economy. The task of  the state is to create external conditions for the development  of production. Customs duties, taxes, price regulators, and  wages should be effective. All of this is provided by the state,  and the rest by the collective. That is, I would like us to  agree in this critical period in the life of our state that  Ukraine needs to survive economically. This will give us the  power to take a step forward. Do we have grounds to say that we  can survive? Definitely. However, everyone should act with  initiative to this end. Had kolkhozes and sovkhozes failed to  find sources of diesel fuel, lubricants, and gasoline on their  own this year, I think that we would not have brought the crop  in. Recently, representatives of collective farms have been  approaching me; managers are asking for permission to sell  products remaining on the farms and obtain in exchange diesel  fuel, gasoline, and spare parts for spring work. At present, we  should act as the situation warrants. If there are products and  a farm wants to sell them in order to not take from the state  but rather purchase on its own what it cannot get by without,  this should be allowed. I am calling upon you to act accordingly  in your localities. I do not see any other way, and I cannot  guarantee that the state will collect foreign exchange and will  be able to buy the necessary resources in a centralized manner  and give them to agricultural producers.    Some people think to this day that there is a strategic  course that was set forth in 1917, and some deviation from this  course is now occurring which will end, and everything will  return to the way it was. What will the final result of such a  return be? It is blood. It is possible, after all, to analyze  how the situation is developing and what outcome it may have.    In this regard, I would like to remind you of one  comparison.  At present, Finland, in which only five percent of the land is  suitable for agricultural production feeds itself and has an  opportunity to sell 30 percent of its products beyond the  borders of the country. It is a civilized modern country with a  high level of the culture of consumption, democracy, and  protection of human rights. I will ask this question. Tell me  please, had Finland remained within the great and omnipotent  Soviet Union, would it now be what it is? It would be the way we  now are. This is the first point. The second point: Give me the  name of a single country of the former socialist system, of the  former Soviet Union that is now on an equal footing with the  highly developed countries of the world.    Would we now be facing this difficult situation had Ukraine  been in 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, at the level  of economic development of, say, Japan or the United States,  producing high-quality competitive products, and had it not been  as it is in Ukrainian villages, whereby in Poltava Oblast alone,  100,000 houses have thatch roofs and 30 percent of the schools  are suitable for classes? Everything fell apart back then, and  now old problems have become extremely acute. In this situation,  accusations are being leveled against independence. You have got  what you wanted, they say.    I do not understand how a statesman can say from the rostrum  that the state that he represents is not needed and may not  exist. Meanwhile, this sometimes happens to the sound of  applause. He lives in this land and does not believe in this  land, does not believe in the people, and does not want to be  the owner.    Some of those who call themselves democrats have now stooped  to one of them mounting the rostrum and saying: "Do not give  them any loans, do not give them credit." Yet another hero came  up and said: "Do not admit Ukraine to European structures  because human rights are being violated here." That is to say,  they spit upon and tear into themselves. They yell--we are for  Ukraine, we will give the shirt off our backs for it. However,  pardon the expression, they will keep the pants with a pocket  for deposit. This is the kind of democrats they are.    Yesterday, I met with the parties. What disturbs you, of  what  do you accuse the president? The Supreme Council has passed an  election law. So, proceed toward the election. If the Ukrainian  people love you so much they will elect you. You will engage in  politics, and I will be the first one to congratulate you on  your election. I will never come to the podium, and will not  lecture you after that, as some gentlemen do now. They sat in a  chair over there, and worked and failed, and when they moved  down--they are already in the opposition, they are already  teaching how to work. I will never allow myself to do this  because I have honor. This is a serious matter. We are choosing  the progress of our state. We should unite.    I have thus come to the election. My point of view is as  follows. The law on elections exists. We may criticize it yet  again, we can see its shortcomings. There are shortcomings, but  the law has been approved and signed. Elections should be held  on the basis of this law. We should determine our tasks in  implementing the law on elections.    First, it is monitoring compliance with this law;    second, it is ensuring equal rights for all candidates;    third, it is preventing the inflow of funds not envisioned  by  the law from other structures in order to use them to benefit  individual persons.    Further on, I will ask questions. Can we restrict ourselves  to just that and not be interested in intelligent, dedicated,  moderate, honest, and principled people coming to the Supreme  Council? Can we stand aside?    I believe that we cannot. As not only representatives of the  president, but as citizens of our state, we may, want, and have  the right to do so that precisely such people come to the  parliament. At present, I am not segregating them by political  coloring. We need new statesmen who are capable of ensuring  economic, political, and diplomatic international authority of  the state; people who are capable of pursuing a policy  intelligently and carrying on friendship, cooperation, and  partnership with our neighbors to both the east and the west:  Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania,  Germany, and other countries. That is, we should ensure the  normal life of Ukraine in a worldwide, European process while at  the same time implementing domestic reforms step by step.    Voices are now being heard--what is to be done, say, if we  do  not elect a parliament? Some people suggest--let the president  then take over everything. I would like to state my philosophy  regarding this question here. Can this not bring about a  dictatorship? If I apply this to myself, I think that I am no  dictator. I will not allow this to happen. However, who can  guarantee that another man will not come after me who will use  authoritarian tendencies to the hilt?    I for one have confidence in B.N. Yeltsin. The Constitution  that has been adopted in Russia gives extremely great powers to  the president. I believe that Boris Nikolayevich will use these  powers in the interest of Russia, Europe, and the world.  However, can I say that after Yeltsin this Constitution will not  be used by someone in a different direction? Is there a  guarantee that it will not? Nobody will give you one.    I want to be understood. If we write a Constitution and talk  about democracy, we should take steps that would safeguard the  people against the cataclysms in the long run because the nature  of each person is embodied in the law, and the law should be  such that nobody could take advantage of it contrary to the  interests of his own people and the world.    This is why I take a very cautious attitude toward such  questions and such proposals. There should be counterbalances. I  have had a lot of unpleasantness with the current parliament. I  have, but I will tell you frankly and openly: The parliament is  a counterbalance to possible steps that could have brought about  a different interpretation, a different vision of democracy as  such. In our evolving democracy, in our evolving state only a  parliament may be such a counterbalance, along with other  representative organs. And you are supposed, accordingly, to  counterbalance them. So, the Constitution and legislation on the  power structure are still imperfect here. However, this is not  to say that we should reject the significance of the parliament.    Consequently, we have to do everything in order for  elections  to be held and for people to come to the parliament who are  responsible for the state, for Ukraine. This is our main task.    Now about your personal participation in the election  campaign. I will say frankly that anyone can nominate himself as  a candidate for deputy. However, everyone must weigh what he is  capable of and who he draws on. There are relevant clauses in  the law but they do not rule out the opportunity to take part in  an election campaign.    Our initiative should be based on law and the actual  situation. The time before March is going to be extremely  difficult. If we overcome inflation--and we should do this--if  we overcome the drop in production, if we handle all economic  problems and ensure the holding of elections, and elect a  professional, responsible, and far-sighted parliament, believe  me, this will be a very important step toward resolving upcoming  problems, economic, political, and social alike.    What has the government done? It has prepared a  privatization  program that has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The  government is now completing the drawing up of the budget and  the social development plan. We want to give greater powers to  regions and basic-level cities from the point of view of the  sources of financing and taking advantage of realistic  opportunities. A program for anti-inflationary measures has been  approved. There is a program for the supply of energy resources  to Ukraine during the winter-and-spring season. Work is now  underway on arrangements for implementing the plan.    The documents that we have adopted are realistic for  present-day conditions, and everything should be done in order  for these conditions not to deteriorate. All programs will be  carried out in this case. The programs in question are  market-oriented, reformist programs; however, carrying them out  will depend on us.    At this difficult time, I am calling on all of you to  proceed  from the fact that Ukraine is a state; it should be preserved.  We have resources, we have potential; they should be used in the  best way possible. Certainly, there were and there will be  conflicts, and we will not get by without them. However,  conflicts may not, should not bring about confrontation,  intimidation, menace, strike threats, and so on.    I think that if someone goes for a strike and threatens an  all-Ukrainian strike, it will be the last strike--the last  organized strike, and after that a perpetual strike will come.  It will no longer be necessary to organize because it will no  longer be possible to return to the real concerns. All those who  threaten a strike so actively should know and understand this.    A way out should be sought, especially for low-income  individuals; persons with many children, the handicapped,  retirees, those who need our specific assistance should be  helped in every way at every opportunity. In turn, for those who  can work, conditions should be created such that they will be  able to work and have earnings. Believe me, I see no other way.</p>

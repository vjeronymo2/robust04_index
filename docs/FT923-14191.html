			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Move over Trabant, here comes the big cat JAGUAR is taking the first steps to set up distribution and sales networks for its luxury cars in eastern Europe. It expects initial sales to be small, but is anxious to establish a foothold in the region in the expectation of significant future growth. The company also indicated that it was wary of growing Japanese manufacturers' interest in the area. In twin moves announced yesterday, Jaguar has appointed a distributor in Poland and is setting up its first service dealership in east Germany. It is also assessing how best to establish a presence in two other key east European countries, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Jaguars are to be imported and sold in Poland by Jaguar Poland, a subsidiary set up by Overseas Marketing Corporation, a London-based independent Anglo-Polish trading company which already has extensive experience of automotive retailing in eastern Europe, including that of cars produced by Ford, Jaguar's parent. Initially, it is to have premises in Warsaw, which are expected to become operational within the next three months. First year sales are expected to be only 20 to 25 cars. However, 'it is important that we quickly establish a presence in these markets', Mr Roger Puttnam, sales and marketing director, said. 'They will undoubtedly grow in the future and as their economies expand so will the demand for luxury cars'. Jaguar's service dealership is located at Freital, near Dresden, and is the first of five sales and service outlets planned to be operational within the next 12 to 18 months. Unlike the Polish operation, they are to be set up and controlled by a wholly-owned Jaguar subsidiary, Jaguar Deutschland.</p>

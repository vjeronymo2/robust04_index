			<p>BFN     [Text] All last night, Ukrainian national television was  broadcasting Easter services from churches of various religious  confessions, while this morning the Socialist Party called on  people to attend an officially sanctioned May Day rally and  march to the Lenin monument to lay flowers.    At this moment there are three demonstrations in progress in  Moscow. They are being organized by the Federation of Trade  Unions, the Moscow Labor [Trudovaya Moskva] Movement, the  Liberal Patriotic Party of Rebirth, and a bloc of communist  parties.    Today, for the first of time in recent years, International  Labor Day is being celebrated in Yerevan. The workforces of  dozens of Yerevan's enterprises and institutions will turn out  for a rally in the city.    An unsanctioned May Day rally is planned to be held on the  central square of Bishkek by the Civic Council [Grazhdanskiy  sovet]. This Kyrgyz public organization was set up two months  ago under the aegis of the republic's legal rights movement to  defend the rights of pensioners and the needy.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Letter: Spiral into unequal losses for external Lloyd's Names Sir, While the forecasts for the 1989 Lloyd's losses may be similar for working and external Names with some individual agencies (Letters, April 2 and 4), this is certainly not the case for the market as a whole. My own calculations, based on the split of external/working capacity by syndicate recently released by Lloyd's, and on the forecasts by underwriters, suggest that working Names will incur a 12 per cent loss in 1989, while external Names will incur a 16.5 per cent loss. In 1988, working Names had 1.2 per cent lower losses than external Names; in 1989, if the forecast holds, 4.5 per cent. So if working Names do not put their own interests first, how did we get such an unequal result? Perhaps the problem lies in the LMX spiral. The seven largest loss makers in 1989, accounting for more than a third of the market loss, are all LMX syndicates. All had below average working capacity. External Names on these syndicates have been left holding the can and in many cases facing financial ruin. It is to be hoped that Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, can come up with a convincing explanation and some equally convincing remedies.

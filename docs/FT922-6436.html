			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Books: Visionary trip through English literature - Fiction / Peter Ackroyd's latest novel ENGLISH MUSIC by Peter Ackroyd Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 400 pages 'SHAKESPEARE AND Dickens too hard, say teachers', reads a headline in the Sunday Times this week. The report continues: 'teachers claim that set texts central to the back-to-basics drive by ministers, are beyond the abilities of too many pupils . . .' This deeply depressing item seems to emanate from a different world from that inhabited by Peter Ackroyd, whose new novel, steeped and saturated as it is in the English literary tradition, is both a passionate argument for the recognition and acknowledgement of an all-pervading Englishness of spirit and also a moving account of the infinite delicacy and complexity of a father-son relationship. There is a straightforward central narrative: Clement Harcombe is a charismatic healer, who, accompanied by his son, Timothy, holds meetings for the oppressed and depressed of the East End in the years after the First World War. Timothy narrates, in alternative chapters, the story of his father's 'cures' (which seem, mysteriously, to require his son's presence); his own removal to Wiltshire to live with his mother's parents; his schooldays; his attempts to rejoin his father, who moves further and further into destitution until he is finally discovered in the circus from which he originally emerged. The growth of Timothy's consciousness, the way in which the silk of knowledge and inheritance is spun from parental cocoon to filial spool, is movingly achieved with an authorial voice which is more simple and intense than anything Ackroyd has previously demonstrated in the ventriloquisms which have become his trademark. But sparkling ventriloquisms are also integral to Ackroyd's main purpose here, which is an extended exegesis on the idea of Englishness, and an implicit paean of praise, through the medium of inspired pastiche, for English writing. Timothy's life is punctuated by visionary dreams, nourished and triggered by the extensive reading encouraged by his father. Every other chapter is an excursion into a visionary literary England, made up of images which are part of the inalienable heritage of those of us lucky enough to pre-date the benighted subjects of the Sunday Times report. Falling asleep as his father reads to him, Timothy meets Alice and Christian in a chapter written, if it can be imagined, by Bunyan and Lewis Carroll; watching the film of Great Expectations, he too is grabbed by Magwitch and enters the world of Miss Havisham, Pip and Estelle; as he searches for his father he dreams of the detective Austin Smallwood; he dreams of Crusoe's Island, of Williem Byrd, the father of English music, and he journeys through London with Hogarth. In another chapter, triggered by his spell as a picture gallery attendant, English landscape is celebrated. We know already, from Hawksmoor, Chatterton and The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde, that Ackroyd can throw off any impersonation he feels like: and here he proves himself yet again to be the very Rory Bremner and John Sessions of the current literary scene. He can dazzle effortlessly and at not inconsiderable length. To read Ackroyd, the playful pasticheur, is to be put through a series of severe tests (an extensive knowledge of English literature is an advantage) but, as all bird-watchers know, there is nothing like the pleasure of a positive identification. More seriously, it is sometimes rather too much like watching those games of charades which are more fun for the performers than for the audience. But the real problem is one of weight and balance. It is possible to feel that Ackroy's idea of Englishness - order, harmony, good sense, 'lines of light', line of landscape, faces and forms which occur in all generations - is used as the passionate argument of this capacious book, not because it makes sense in itself, but because it is what he know about and is good at. There is an uneasy whiff of the obsessive autodidact in much of the pastiche passages, and in the way in which everything is grist to his thematic mill: the bones of the argument are just a little too prominent. On the other hand, the story of Clement and Timothy is an almost self-contained narrative of great depth and feeling: the delicacy with which Ackroyd traces how a son only comes to know his father by degrees, how misconceptions are gradually stripped away, how knowledge changes and deepens love, is wholly successful. It is in these sections of this sprawling work that the order and harmony that Ackroyd sees as the hallmarks of Englishness truly reside. Indeed, in a sense, the execution of this book, itself gives the lie to the author's central thesis: there is an overwhelming, verbose cloudiness in the central visionary passages which denies all the harmony. But, nevertheless, the book is a splendid experience, an affirmation of the cultural spirit which has to survive, in spite of the current difficulties with those set texts.</p>

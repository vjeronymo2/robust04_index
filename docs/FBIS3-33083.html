The U.S. Army has been participating in joint activities  with  Honduran Armed Forces on Honduran territory for a long time.  These activities include specifically military civic action and  the construction of roads and landing strips.    Raul Enrique Funez Santos was killed by a grenade explosion  because he took a grenade home after finding it on the road.  According to Funez Santos' relatives, the victim took the fuse  from the grenade, which, in addition to killing him, injured  those who were around him at the time of the explosion.    In the suit filed with the courts, the U.S. and the Honduran  Armies are accused of homicide and injuries caused by explosive  devices that were left behind in the area where they had  conducted military operations in May 1993 in the village of  Puntillas, in Olanchito, Yoro.    The plaintiffs are Maria Josefa Antunez, Lucrecia Rosales on  behalf of the minor Maribel Melendez, Edin Martinez, and Mario  Denis Rosales, all residents of Puntillas. Another group of  plaintiffs includes Santos Diaz on behalf of his youngest son  Rigoberto Villafranca Diaz, Enit Yovani Garcia Zelaya, and Juan  Francisco Tejeda on behalf of his youngest son Juan Francisco  Tejeda, who live in El Carril, Olanchito.    It was learned that the suit is basically against the  Honduran Government because, according to the Executive Branch,  National Congress authorities were the ones to approve  operations of this type.    The explosion that killed Funez Santos injured the  following:  Maribel Melendez (11), Edin Marina Martinez (31), Mario Denis  Rosales (19), Maria Josefa Antunez (31), Rigoberto Villafranca  (17), Enit Yovani Zelaya (23), and Francisco Tejeda (11).  Villafranca lost his left eye and part of his left foot.  According to witnesses, Funez Santos and his brothers Denis  Yovani and Francisco Alexis found seven grenades that were used  by the U.S. and Honduran Armies and took them home.    It was reported that the suit was filed through the  Committee  for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: CLARK GETS ONE RECORD, AIMS FOR SOME MORE  </P> <P> Christian's Tony Clark broke another scoring record Friday, and if he continues  as he has (he is averaging 43 points a game), he might break a couple more by  the end of the season.  </P> <P> Clark scored 58 points in Christian's 88-52 victory over Clairemont and by  doing so reached 1,987 points, breaking the San Diego Section record for career  scoring. Paul Halupa of Bonita Vista scored 1,982 from 1968-70.  </P> <P> The 58 points were the third most scored in a county game. Madison's Mitchell  Lilly scored 61 against San Diego in 1976.  </P> <P> Another record well within Clark's range is points in a single season. He has  777 in 18 games and a minimum of six games remaining (five league and at least  one in the playoffs), barring injury. Maintaining his 43-point average would  give him 1,035 after 24 games, easily beating the record of 960 in 33 games set  by Helix's Bill Walton in 1970.  </P> <P> Last year at Valhalla, Clark scored 847 points in 28 games to rank fourth  behind Walton's record.  </P> <P> The Clairemont girls' basketball team is undergoing yet another coaching change  following David Watson's departure Monday. Watson, a former assistant, had  taken over when Ken Grainger was fired Jan. 19.  </P> <P> Replacing Watson will be on-site aide Lamont Jackson. Jackson, a former  Clairemont athlete, will coach on an interim basis for the remainder of the  season, after which a new coach will be hired. Jackson will have to be teamed  with a certified teacher, Vice Principal Peter Schroeder said.  </P> <P> Schroeder said Watson is leaving because he will begin full-time teaching at  Kearny on Monday. Watson had been part-time at Kearny, giving him time to coach  at Clairemont, but had said he would eventually have to give up the Clairemont  position if his teaching hours increased.  </P> <P> "It was my decision that he would leave now," Schroeder said. "It is a good  time since we are between the first and second round of the (league) basketball  season."  </P> <P> Torrey Pines hopes to attract some of the country's best high school basketball  teams when it plays host to the San Diego Above the Rim Holiday tournament next  Dec. 26-29.  </P> <P> The 12-team tournament will begin at Torrey Pines and conclude at the San Diego  Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Some of the top-ranked schools that may attend are Mater Dei (Santa Ana), St.  Anthony's (N.J.) and Miami (Fla.) High. Torrey Pines and three other county  schools (to be named) will also play.  </P> <P> Having no gym and being forced to practice outside hasn't hampered the Our Lady  of Peace girls' basketball team. The No. 9 Pilots (16-3, 4-0) defeated  Christian, 49-38, Tuesday to break a tie with Christian for first place in the  City Harbor League.  </P> <P> OLP plays home games at St. Augustine but never really feels a home-court  advantage, Coach Yvonne Sanchez said.  </P> <P> "It's tough driving all over, and it takes its toll on the girls," Sanchez  said. "We had a game all the way out at Valhalla that was tough, and we  couldn't schedule a home game with them."  </P> <P> Sanchez said she cringed during the recent rains, although the team was able to  practice at St. Michael's School in Poway on a couple of days.  </P> <P> Tammy Tavares leads OLP by averaging 18.4 points per game, ninth in the county  in scoring. April Velk is averaging 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> After a fourth-place finish in the Palomar League last season, the Mt. Carmel  girls' soccer team has shut out 12 opponents this season and is second in the  league behind Torrey Pines.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines (15-0-3, 6-0-2) tied Poway, 1-1, in last year's section 3-A final  to share the title. Mt. Carmel (12-4-1, 5-2-1) has already broken its school  record of eight shutouts in a season set in 1983.  </P> <P> Senior goalkeeper Heather Petterson is Mt. Carmel's only four-year varsity  player. She started on the freshman team, but when Coach Jim Dutton needed a  replacement on the varsity, she was moved up. In her first varsity game, Mt.  Carmel tied Poway, 2-2.  </P> <P> Petterson broke her thumb in the second league game her sophomore year and  missed most of the rest of the season. But since then, she has been a constant  force for Mt. Carmel with 27 career shutouts, 11 this season.  </P> <P> "She has great defense in front of her," Dutton said. "She does an excellent  job of taking control."  </P> <P> Petterson is backed by senior Michelle Daigle, called by Dutton "the best  backup goalkeeper in San Diego".  </P> <P> Sophomore Leigh Anne Baker leads Mt. Carmel in scoring with 12 goals this  season -- she had three in a 5-0 victory over Vista last week -- and has six  assists. She had 35 goals on the freshman team last year. Jan Dolloff, also a  sophomore forward, has six assists.  </P> <P> "We're peaking when we need to," Dutton said. "We're reducing mistakes and  playing smarter ball. We want to play 80 minutes of good soccer and more team  soccer."  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel's senior midfielders have been with the program since they were  freshmen -- Theresa Miranda, Kim Franzen, Christine Phillips and Jennifer  Timms.  </P></p>

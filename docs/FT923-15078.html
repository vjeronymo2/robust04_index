			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Skinner is ejected again MR DENNIS Skinner, the outspoken Labour backbencher, was ejected from the Commons yesterday for the eighth time in 13 years. This followed his refusal to withdraw remarks addressed to Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister. It was the first time Ms Betty Boothroyd had used her powers to ask an MP to leave the Commons since she became Speaker earlier this year. The row came as the Bolsover MP called for a public inquiry into the level of dioxins on agricultural land in his constituency.</p>

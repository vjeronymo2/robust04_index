			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Parliament Deputy Givi Abalaki: "We Will Get Our </F> Daily Bread by Supporting the Countryside"]    [Text] I fully share the general concern over the situation  we are in today and wish to express a few specific thoughts  about the agrarian sector.    I want to say that if we cannot halt the inertia of the old  thinking, dismantle the old management structures, institute  broad reforms in the agrarian sector, implement mass  privatization of all means of production, and boost agriculture  and put that sector's big reserves to work, we are not going to  be able to avert famine, let alone consolidate the country's  financial situation, to which the agrarian sector can make a  major contribution.    Georgia's agriculture today is in total ruins; in my  opinion,  this is the bitter result of launching reforms without enough  preparation.    There are those who think that agricultural reform involves  land privatization only. Let me remind them that despite the  major shortcomings that came from increasing the amount of the  people's household land, more than half the cultivated farmland  was turned over to the private sector--and still crops are less  than they were five or ten years ago, when the private sector  owned less than 15 percent of the cultivated land.    The fact is that, along with land privatization,  agricultural  reform equally requires the establishment of market forms, the  nurturing of independent entrepreneurs, the creation of a modern  system of relations between them and the state, the expansion of  free communications, the fostering of a new spirit of  proprietorship, and, most important, protection of the peasant.  Unless these market levers are adopted and put to work, it will  be impossible to nurture the new-type farmer, who will remain  trapped in the habits of the state farm worker or kolkhoznik.  Naturally, one-sided reform (which is what is happening now, if  you can even call it reform) has only served to worsen our  situation.    The way out of the predicament is to implement reforms  rationally and to support the development primarily of private  structures (i.e., entrepreneurs) and create the necessary  conditions for them to operate, in order to solve the food  crisis swiftly. We also need to keep in mind that while the old  collectivization deflected agriculture from its normal path of  development, indiscriminate privatization today will end up  making the same mistake.    I don't share the widespread notion that Georgia is a  country  that is poor in agricultural resources. If we use our land and  resources wisely, they can feed the country and even enable us  to help others. How can we speak of making productive use of our  land when we have never managed to have a hectare produce an  average of more than 26 quintals of grain, 60 quintals of fruit,  130 quintals of potatoes, and so on. Yet with progressive forms  of management our fertile land could easily produce 40 to 50  quintals of grain, 150 to 200 quintals of fruit, 250 to 300  quintals of potatoes, and so on. To confirm this, just remember  the abundant and bountiful lives of our German colonists before  the war.    Again, future generations are not going to think we acted  wisely when we frittered away the assets of the kolkhozes and  state farms at the behest and under the leadership of those  pathetic representatives of the national movement. It was their  stupid doctrines and actions that resulted in the looting of  agriculture equipment, vehicles, livestock, crops and produce,  monetary resources, and the wealth built up by the rural  population's joint efforts. The people who created this  monstrosity are basically those who have done nothing to create  social wealth and only care about getting rich without working.    We have to face the truth and admit that the old structures  of agricultural proprietorship have been destroyed, and those  who destroyed them have created nothing new; destruction and  construction are different things. Not only that, we do not yet  even have in place the legal base necessary to design the  strategy and tactics to convert agriculture to the market  economy. Well, why don't we? It wouldn't have required capital  investment for fuel and lubricants, would it? You have to agree  that one reason why we don't have proprietary farmers (of either  the old or the new type) is that agricultural productivity has  dropped drastically. How are we going to produce anything if we  have given land to the rural population in an unsystematic  manner and nobody has even thought to create the essential  conditions for the use of the land that feeds us? The results  are there for all to see! Over the past two years, many  thousands of hectares have remained uncultivated, and, sad to  say, it looks as if things will get no better this year.    I simply don't understand why no land tax system has been  worked out yet, and the state has been losing large amounts of  revenues for three years--quite apart from its role as an  incentive to encourage the owner of the land to produce goods.  How can we excuse the fact that, on the pretext of  privatization, we have divided up large tracts that would have  provided excellent conditions for the use of mechanization?  Also, the small plots have been given out in many places,  creating chaos. Hundreds of hectares of farmland have been  stolen; in many places, even the rayon authorities don't know  whose hands they are in. How can we excuse the fact that local  agricultural agencies, farm managers, and farm specialists have  been left out of land privatization policy? These and many other  violations have brought us to our present predicament, and if we  don't realize the danger today, tomorrow it will be too late.    In order to get out of this grave situation, it is essential  to put a stop to methods of land privatization which have a bad  odor because of the incompetent intervention by certain  dilettantes in agricultural matters, especially considering that  it is taking place under conditions of complete chaos and  dereliction by the authorities. As for instituting taxes this  year on lands distributed to the population, an intermediate way  has to be found which will maximally enhance every citizen's  responsibility and will frankly recognize all of the land area  actually in his possession, in order to avoid expectable  difficulties which, very likely, the law ought to take into  account. The way to do this, I think, is to formalize citizens'  possession of their land by way of declaration and levy taxes on  that basis. I believe that this move will do much to promote  abundant agricultural production.    At the same time, the Georgian Parliament must speed up the  creation of the legal base for comprehensive agricultural  reform, and the executive branch will have to see that it is  properly implemented. Laws passed by the Parliament must be used  to check on the legality of the lands that have been already  been issued, in order to rectify violations. It is painful to  see the present government's failure to take care of the land,  which is costing our people dearly.    It is criminal how hasty privatization of the land has  resulted in mass giveaways and fragmentation of the land, the  uprooting of orchards and vineyards, neglect and deterioration  of croplands, missed opportunities to set up  individual-proprietor farms, conflicts between individuals and  villages, and many other misfortunes which have done great harm  to the state.    The people want to know who the main culprits are and  whether  they are being called to account.    Another essential condition is to reorganize the kolkhozes  and state farms in such a way that formations of independent  entrepreneurs take shape based in them in accordance with market  relations, formations which are the owners and proprietors of  their means of production and the goods they produce. Each farm,  village, district, resident, and individual must find a place  and role in a reformed agriculture; the confusion,  misunderstanding, and mistrust that have ravaged the countryside  for the past three or four years must come to an end.    Land areas which remain after privatization but which are  not  large enough for collective farm management must be transferred  immediately to the population on the basis of mutually  acceptable agreements and obligations. Large tracts, moreover,  must not be broken up into smaller ones, and we must strictly  comply with principles of land use and compactness.    Instead, because of slipshod privatization measures,  disreputable and incompetent people have largely taken over the  privatization commissions. Their criminal actions have promoted  giveaways, and much of the land has wound up in the hands of  people who don't care about farming and are just waiting for a  chance to sell it off and get rich. The Cabinet of Ministers has  done wrong to pass decrees by which local commissions have been  given unrestricted rights to allot land to the population, and  the government can't interfere (or at least isn't interfering)  even when the commissions' decisions are clearly in conflict  with governmental decrees and the interests of the country. What  is essential, then, is to re-inventory the land, not only with  the participation of the village commissions, which will  definitely have to be reconstituted, but also by representatives  of state agencies. Their figures alone must be used in  continuing privatization and rectifying mistakes. We must  register every square meter of land with the state. The  government has to know who owns the land and pays the taxes.    As far as possible we must provide production services for  farm entrepreneurs, especially in the case of household peasant  and individual farm operations, which have been left on their  own--yet it is they who are best able to produce a fast return.  Because of the fact that the managers of kolkhozes and state  farms (in most places) have, on purpose or not, ended up distant  from agricultural reform, they are no longer providing any help  in working the land that has been given to the rural population.  In places where social-sector farms no longer exist, their  tractors, motor vehicles, farm equipment and other assets have  been sold off wholesale, written off, or stolen. A wise  proprietor would have created formations to service household  farm operations, on a cost accounting basis, to do farm work for  the population for an appropriate fee. Hence, conditions today  demand that we create a system to provide services to household  farm operations using locally existing farm equipment. Where  kolkhozes and state farms still exist, they should take over  this duty; where they no longer exist, we should create  specialized links to provide the services, for which we should  bring together the equipment that has been sold off through  various machinations. That's just for now; in the future, it  will not be sufficient, and we must immediately undertake to  create a broad network of state, commercial, and private sectors  to service farm entrepreneurs. It should be in charge not only  of tractor operations but also the whole cycle of production  services. This will free the entrepreneur from all kinds of  extraneous worries so that he can devote his energy to boosting  production.    Let me say at this point that instead of helping, the  finance  and credit system (which, we can say confidently, no longer  exists now) forced many to give up on commercial farming and to  take up occupations that are easier. It's true we are hard-up  ourselves, but if we are to improve things we must find ways and  means to give farmers a break. During parliamentary discussions  of this question I have been surprised by some of my colleagues'  opposition to credit for agriculture, although I fully share  their doubts over the proper use of allocated funds, of which  there are plenty of bad examples. We think agriculture needs to  be granted immediate preferential credit in the necessary  amounts; in turn, the government and the Agriculture Ministry  must work out specific mechanisms to ensure proper use of the  credit.    We must immediately implement privatization in livestock  farming, because the chaos which we have created is doing  irreparable harm to this sector, and one of the best ways to get  out of this predicament, I think, is through well organized  privatization. Buildings and structures, livestock, tools and  equipment, and feed croplands also need to be privatized. It  should, moreover, be on the basis of competition. I really don't  understand why it's taking so long to privatize livestock  farming. Privatization will give each livestock operation a true  proprietor and put a stop to thievery. Why are we dragging our  feet? Can it be that certain people will not benefit from  stability, law, and order in the sector?    Another thing is that we have been harmed greatly by the  mass  blackmailing of professional, experienced and competent workers  in agriculture in the past three or four years. A lot of worthy  and highly qualified specialists have quit the field as a  result. All of you know who took their places and what that has  cost the people.... The time is late, of course, but we must  help the countryside by turning things over to worthy people who  understand reform and know how to implement it. The people will  certainly trust and follow them. At the same time, the one to be  considered the winner in the competition should not be the one  who pays the most but rather the citizen or group that submits  the best program for the operation of the livestock farm or  complex in terms of its rated capacity and pledges to implement  that program meticulously. I would not only support the sale but  even the free transfer of all the above assets under that  procedure.    To illustrate the importance of the village leader I will  cite one example: on Gorskiy Rayon's Kintsnisi State Farm, which  has been under the leadership of Batoni Mikheil Koblianidze for  a long time, not a single farm window was smashed during the  events in Samachablo (the farm is located near Tskhinvali). The  tractor fleet and farm equipment there have been preserved  intact, whereas in many other places which were relatively calm,  everything has been wrecked. Even sadder is the fact that many  farms have been looted with at least the connivance if not the  actual participation of village leaders. But for some reason,  enforcement of the law, which would inspire hope and trust in  the working people of the village, has been delayed or dragged  out.    I spoke out more specifically on all the above recently in  Parliament, but unfortunately no one showed much interest in  these problems. I, on the other hand, feel these things very  deeply. I feel the pain of the countryside, because my own  family lives in a typical Georgian village and has never  abandoned the land. My family is still considered an ordinary  village proprietor. Last year, we had per-hectare yields of more  than 100 quintals of corn, 150 quintals of fruit, 700 quintals  of beets, 500 quintals of vegetables, and so on.    Let me say in conclusion that we seem to have forgotten the  countryside while playing at democracy, and we've been reaping  what we deserve. This reproach probably applies equally to all  levels of government in the past five years, and to today's  Parliament as well, which has failed to create the necessary  legal base for agriculture reform. It also applies to the  Cabinet of Ministers, which has failed to protect village  proprietors; it applies to local authorities, who have turned  their backs on the plight of the peasant; and it applies to us,  together and singly, because we have done nothing effective to  preserve and enhance this vital sector.    Given its predicament, the countryside has turned its back  on  us; today it is powerless, it cannot feed the country or  contribute anything to the state budget. Yet it could fill half  the budget.    If we want to have our daily bread in abundance we will have  to come to the aid of the countryside and support it. This is  the only way to achieve bountiful agricultural production.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAMES DESTROY L.A.'S HISTORIC PAN PACIFIC AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> This item may be of interest to your readers, possibly the older ones like me.  In 1935 the Pan Pacific put on its first show for the Actors' Benefit Fund. I  know of this because as a very young dancer I and others like me had the honor  to be part of this great event.  </P> <P> Charlie Chaplin let us practice in his studio; everyone was generous and  wonderful for the good cause of raising funds for retired actors and actresses.  On the performance night the stars came out and did skits from their best  movies -- it was a night!  </P> <P> I feel so sad about what happened. I feel that many dreams went up in smoke for  us all. A wonderful and historical landmark is gone forever.  </P> <P> JUNE E. de SULIMA-PRZYBOROWSKI  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

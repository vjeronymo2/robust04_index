			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: An odd light on Butterfly - Opera The stage is almost bare. The few things that remain - a solitary rock, a chair, the people - seem to function principally as objects to be lit. Everybody moves slowly, but less for any dramatic purpose, so it seems, than for the requirements of the lighting. Light is the hero: light in the phosphorescent blue on the rock, the white on a hand, or golden gleam on a body. And this is Madame Butterfly? No, this is Robert Wilson. In his productions of traditional operas Wilson has stressed how his visual contribution must be independent of the music and text, and yet his choice has hitherto fallen on works which fit with his earlier original creations in their elongated time schemes, their mythic resonances and their symbolism: Parsifal, Lohengrin, The Magic Flute. Puccini's works are entirely different, and the new Madame Butterfly at the Bastille in Paris (Wilson's third production there in the theatre's short history) might seem to allow more scope for independence to exert itself. Most often the performers - who seem to be singing the characters' music but not enacting them as people - behave with a sublime disregard for what is going on, or for what they are having to deliver. Signal points in the drama are registered not by these statuesque people but, typically, by the lighting: by a sudden blackout, for instance, when the Bonze denounces Butterfly's spiritual defection. Music that is customarily seen as demanding movement - such as the rush for the child's entry near the end - sweeps, most effectively, across an entirely still stage. Not only does the production fail to deliver the expected visual appurtenances, it makes a point of its failure, as when Pinkerton and Sharpless in the first act ostentatiously mime holding glasses in their hands. However, these displays of independence are a mite superficial, for it is obvious that Wilson was attracted to Madame Butterfly by the Japanese in it, and by the idea that he could bring this out in his setting. He uses a wooden walkway like that of the Japanese theatre, and the severe costumes (by Frida Parmeggiani) look in the same direction. But suggestion is all. There remain two huge problems. One is that Wilson is dealing with opera singers, not with actors trained for decades in a demanding tradition of deportment and gesture. The other is that Madame Butterfly is not a noh play. Wilson's attempt to make it one smacks disturbingly of the scorn and opportunism which the opera makes an effort to denounce in Pinkerton. Alien manners are being tried on without any care for the density of meaning they convey. For all the atmosphere of seriousness, the production is disturbingly hollow: one can read the director's signature, but it is placed on an empty and ignorant canvas. There is one area of exception. Some of Wilson's earlier work made startling use of non-professional performers, and here the child (a grave Steeve (sic) Lopez) becomes a major participant. In the long nocturne-interlude he alone moves about the stage in childish games while Butterfly and Suzuki wait, and it is his hand, warding Pinkerton off, that provides the final gesture. However, the very poignancy of this proves how far the production has come from its stated aim of following an independent, parallel path. The orchestra, under Myung-Whun Chung, occasionally remind one of Puccini's admiration for Debussy, though the sound is thin in this theatre and the balance odd. Valentina Sedipova was the Butterfly I heard, coming to firmness and lustre in the second act; she shares the title role with Diana Soviero. Of the rest of the cast, only Georges Gautier as Goro stood out.</p>

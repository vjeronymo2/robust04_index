			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: AGF to forge link with SocGen Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of France's largest insurance groups, has chosen to forge closer links with Societe Generale after its privatisation, rather than Credit Lyonnais. Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais have for some months been competing to become AGF's strategic partner in the banking sector. Both banks have cross-shareholding agreements with AGF, which yesterday confirmed it had plumped for Societe Generale. The news is blow to Credit Lyonnais, which is still reeling from controversy over its recent announcement of a FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.7bn) government-backed rescue package. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new chairman, had made no secret of wanting a closer liaison with AGF as part of his long-term recovery strategy. Societe Generale yesterday affirmed plans to raise its 1.7 per cent stake in AGF when the insurer is privatised later this year. It has yet to decide how big its eventual stake will be. Societe Generale increased its stake in the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company from 1.8 to 5 per cent at the time of its recent privatisation. Societe Generale said it was still considering whether to develop operational links with AGF. The bank has ruled out the possibility of joining forces in life insurance, as it already has interests in that area. But it said AGF might form part of its eventual expansion into damage insurance. The liaison between AGF and Societe Generale forms part of a trend in French finance. Union des Assurances de Paris has used its privatisation (now nearing completion) as an opportunity to strengthen its long-standing links with Banque Nationale de Paris.</p>

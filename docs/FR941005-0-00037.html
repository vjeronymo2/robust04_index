This is appropriate because the northern American peregrine falcons have recovered similarly to arctic peregrine falcons. Limiting the delisting rule to arctic peregrine falcons is confusing, inconsistent, and ignores a large portion of a stable, recovered, and definable population of American peregrine falcons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service listed arctic and American peregrine falcons as endangered under the Endangered Species Protection Act in 1970. They were listed separately, by subspecies, in order to differentiate these subspecies from Peale's peregrine falcons, which did not warrant or receive protection. Arctic and American peregrine falcon populations were affected by pesticides differently_arctic peregrine falcons did not decline to the same extent as American peregrine falcons and they recovered more quickly after the use of organochlorine pesticides was restricted. Additionally, although the recovery of arctic peregrine falcons appears to have progressed to a comparable degree throughout the range of the subspecies, American peregrine falcons have recovered to dissimilar degrees and at various rates in different portions of their range. As a result, the Service is handling the reclassification of American peregrine falcons separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is difficult to identify subspecies of peregrine falcons in the wild. The conservation of listed subspecies, which may be confused with arctic peregrine falcons, will be compromised if arctic peregrine falcons are delisted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service considers all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Falco peregrinus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the conterminous 48 States to be endangered under the similarity of appearance provision of the Act and this consideration will not be affected by delisting arctic peregrine falcons (see Effects of This Rule section below). This is to ensure that protection given to American peregrine falcons, currently considered to be endangered, is not weakened by confusion with members of other subspecies. Although this protection pertains only to peregrine falcons in the United States, the Service hopes that other nations, where the subspecies ranges overlap, will similarly regard all peregrine falcons as endangered in order to assist the full recovery of American peregrine falcons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Delisting will affect international laws and legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule applies only to United States domestic law. All peregrine falcons are listed under Appendix I to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Delisting arctic peregrine falcons under the Act will not directly affect classification of the species or subspecies under CITES. Separate procedures to delist the subspecies under CITES can be pursued. Such amendments of the CITES appendices are done cooperatively by the numerous parties to the Convention in accordance with provisions outlined in the Convention's Articles XV and XVI. There are no other international laws or legislation that will be affected by this delisting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 9: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The opinions of Canada and Greenland, countries principally involved, have not been solicited, considered, or provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

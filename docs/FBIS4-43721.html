			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "eli/mes": "Geissler Warns of Growing </F> Nationalism"]    [Text] Heiner Geissler, acting chairman of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] faction, has issued a warning about  increasing nationalism and a return to thinking in nationalist  terms. In an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, he said that  nationalist thinking has moved to the forefront since  unification. But, he said, Germany's future lies not in the  reestablishment of a national state, but in opening up to other  ideas, and in the creation of a federal European structure. "A  national state is too little for big things and too big for  little things," he said.    With his statements, Geissler confirmed similar opinions by  CDU politicians recently expressed at the traditional  "Roemeberg" talks in Frankfurt. The CDU had reacted with some  concern to these opinions because Wolfgang Schaeuble,  CDU/Christian-Social Union [CSU] chairman, wrote in his book  that the nation's thoughts must be filled with vitality to  prevent society from drifting apart. Schaueble's book is to be  presented by Chancellor Kohl this Monday [20 Jun].    Geissler said that although he agrees with Schaueble that  society is splitting up into groups, "nationalist feelings as a  collective ethnic emotion cannot be considered the basis of  collective responsibility. One must love one's neighbor, not  one's people."    "The citizens of East Berlin and Leipzig did not create the  revolution in 1989 to reestablish the nationalist state, but to  push through democracy, freedom, and justice," Geissler  continues. "But, in 1990, the center of gravity changed.  Nationalist feelings moved to the forefront." Although equality  and justice still form the mainstays of internal unity, "we will  never attain them by means of nationalist feelings, but by means  of a feeling of responsibility toward one's fellow man," said  Geissler.    Geissler does not think the CDU is full of nationalist  sentiment. "Were it not for Helmut Kohl, the situation would  certainly have been more difficult," he says. Geissler does not  think it is necessary to seek an identity in Germany. "That is  an artificial task. Nationalist feelings are good only if they  are premeditated and restrained. The idea of nationalism has  been discredited, and rightly so. Nationalism is an ideological  plague, just like fundamentalism, fascism, and communism."    Geissler calls for "unity, justice, and freedom, instead of  Germany above all else. When the flag flutters in the air,  one's mind lies in the trumpet that blows the fanfare," he says.  "The patrons of the new Germany are not Kaiser Wilhelm or Otto  von Bismarck, but Konrad Adenauer, Willy Brandt, Richard von  Weizsaecker, and Helmut Kohl."</p>

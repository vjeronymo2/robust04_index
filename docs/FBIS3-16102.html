			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Chytov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok March 14 TASS -- "A strong Russia needs  a strong navy," Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey  Kozyrev said when visiting big anti-submarine ship Admiral  Panteleyev here today.    The visit, which preceded Kozyrev's talks with U.S.  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, was seen by many as having a  special symbolic overtone. "We did not plan for it," the Russian  minister told ITAR-TASS. "But it is indicative that the ship was  part of the multinational force which sailed to the Persian Gulf  to train interaction with U.S. naval ships".    According to first deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet  Vice-Admiral Igor Khmelnov, the joint exercises confirmed that  the Russian combat equipment and the combat training of the  Russian sailors are in no way worse than those of the United  States.    Andrey Kozyrev said the ships under the Russian flag in the  Gulf were a factor of stability in the region. He called upon  the sailors to prepare for a new mission, probably in the Latin  American direction among others.    "Our presence in the world ocean must expand, the Russian  minister stressed, "our partners will respect us all the more  for this".    The ship's crew members told the minister with satisfaction  that unlike the Black Sea Fleet, the Pacific Fleet is not  threatened with a rift.    "We can speak about the division of the Black Sea Fleet only  in a conventional manner. Under the well-known agreement  reached in Masandra, the fleet must be united". He called on  the sailors to upgrade their training and advised "to pay less  attention to the political races".    "We have our president, we have our Constitution, and we  have  a firm political course", the Russian foreign minister said.  "The great Russian power existed, exists and will exist".</p>

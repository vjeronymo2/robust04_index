			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: PCs to shake off dunce's image The days of the humble television set are numbered. Within a few years, it will be supplanted in the home and office by the personal computer - albeit in modified form - which is set to become the principal vehicle for the multimedia revolution. Who says so? Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, for one. He predicts that homes will soon have at least two PCs capable of displaying multimedia programmes. The first, shorn of its keyboard and boasting a large screen will live in the lounge. It will combine still and moving images, sound, text and graphics and the service will be interactive - video on demand or three dimensional computer games are typical examples. 'Then there will be a device in your den for when you want to browse for shopping or do your personal finances. You will sit less than a metre from it and it will have a keyboard and a superior ability to display text,' he says. Gates' plan is that Windows, the operating software that has been a principal key to Microsoft's position as software market leader, will control both these PCs. The drawback to date, however, has been that PCs, sharp though they are at arithmetic, are pretty much dunces where it comes to displaying video images. They are simply not designed to handle or store the sheer volume of information contained in a moving picture. Thus, video sequences in multimedia presentations are limited to a postage stamp sized area of the screen. Any attempt to enlarge the image causes a sharp loss of quality and fidelity. Now, Videologic, of Kings Langley on the outskirts of London, claims to have an answer to the problem. It has developed a set of silicon chips capable of taking digitised video images and displaying them on a PC screen - full size, offering cinema quality motion and fully compatible with Gates' Windows. And the cost of the chips should be no more than Dollars 25 in quantity - in other words, chips for a mass market. The company's claim should be taken seriously for a number of reasons. First, because it is already the world leader in an earlier form of PC video. In 1988 it developed chips which overlaid video pictures on a PC screen, by passing the central processor and memory. The new chips, however, mix the digits representing video, text and graphics in the computer's memory, something, Videologic says, no other company has yet accomplished. It is a cheaper solution and it makes it possible for the computer to manipulate any part or aspect of the video picture, something that was impossible with the earlier technology. Second, because it has some very powerful partners including International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, British Telecom and Motorola, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer. Its agreement with IBM covers the joint design, development and marketing of multimedia products. Videologic has, however, retained its intellectual property rights. Third, because the company already has a raft of blue chip customers, including Microsoft, the Bank of England, Deutsche Bank and the John Lewis Partnership. According to Derek Maclaren, chairman, the company has a six-month lead on the competition protected by patents, knowledge and an adherence to industry standards others have yet to emulate. The concepts are difficult to grasp, especially for a consumer product. so Videologic is selling its flagship product, '928Movie' as a way of speeding up Windows graphics with, it says, 'multimedia for free'.</p>

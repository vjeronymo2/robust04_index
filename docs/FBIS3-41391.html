			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed V.V: "Drugs and Illegal Immigration--Highly </F> Successful Year for French Customs"]    [Text] Budget Minister and Government Spokesman Nicolas  Sarkozy performed yesterday what amounted to an evaluation of  the single market in its first year when he unveiled the amounts  of drugs seized by French Customs in 1993. With some 38 tonnes  of cannabis--or twice as much as was seized in the previous  year--last year's seizures "reached an unprecedented level."  Concurrently, 233 kilograms of heroin were seized--a 48-percent  increase with respect to the previous year. As for cocaine, the  increase is minimal, even though the absolute number is high:  1,284 kilograms (1,278 in 1992). Last, in the mercifully small  LSD market, 23 grams of lysergid were seized in a single  operation in 1993--enough to produce 400,000 doses for the  underground British market. Here too, these are unprecedented  amounts.  <H5>  New Tools [subhead] </H5>   While record amounts of cocaine (1,400 kilograms) and heroin  (400 kilograms) had been seized in 1990 and 1991, respectively,  1993 saw a steady average progression. That is, "a 50-percent  increase as compared with 1992," the minister explained, adding  that it was difficult to determine the relative impact of better  operation on the part of customs, and increased amounts of drugs  smuggled into the national territory. "In any case, this  indicates a highly alarming reality," Nicolas Sarkozy concluded,  with new General Customs Director Jean-Luc Vialla looking on.    Mr. Vialla's services describe an "unprecedented level" of  seizures for all types of drugs except opium and hemp plant and  hemp oil.    Active international cooperation, selective road checks, air  and marine monitoring are all part of the array of weapons used  by customs, which intend to "use new tools"--that is, fighting  smugglers of chemical products used as precursors for the  production of drugs, promoting cooperation in the international  trade sector to identify illegal shipments, in addition to open  sea interceptions and increased cooperation--including with  Eastern European countries. Since 1 January 1993, customs have  also been very active against illegal immigration, in  cooperation with border police. The array of possibilities and  prerogatives of customs has been extended in view of the  implementation of the Schengen Convention, although the latter  remains to come into effect. Last year's results--8,729 persons  held for questioning as compared with 5,177 in 1992 and 5,246 in  1991--are indicative of the scope of the new measures. However,  one must differentiate between foreign nationals in an irregular  situation (2,907, a figure marginally higher than in previous  years) and those turned away (5,822, or over twice as much as  the 1991 and 1992 figures).    Last, Jean-Luc Vialla indicated that the Tracfin action  group, which specializes in intelligence and operations against  underground financial channels--used, among other things, for  the laundering of "dirty" money--receives "50 to 60 statements  of suspicion" a month from banks. Although none of the 40 cases  currently processed by the courts has been judged yet due to  their complexity, there is "no question of terminating Tracfin,"  Nicolas Sarkozy indicated.</p>

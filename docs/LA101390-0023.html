			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOARA ESTABLISHES ITS GROUND GAME, BEATS EL DORADO  </P> <P> Loara Coach John deFries had a modest game plan Friday night -- contain El  Dorado's running game, and establish his own.  </P> <P> By halftime, deFries had succeeded on both accounts.  </P> <P> Loara's defense held El Dorado to minus-7 yards rushing, while the Loara  offense rolled up 187 yards on the ground.  </P> <P> Loara led, 28-0, at the half, and won, 37-6, the Empire League opener for both  teams.  </P> <P> "We finally put a game together," deFries said. "Execution was the key  tonight."  </P> <P> Loara tailback Sean Easter -- a transfer from Servite -- gained 23 yards on the  first play from scrimmage. The Saxons (3-3, 1-0) capped the drive with a  three-yard off-tackle run by Easter.  </P> <P> In the second quarter, Loara fullback David Kang rammed straight ahead from two  yards out for a 14-0 lead.  </P> <P> On Loara's next possession, quarterback Charles Gipson kept the ball and headed  down the right sideline, then cut back inside and into the end zone for a  42-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> Two plays after Bryan Blanks intercepted a Jason Bluth pass at the El Dorado  18-yard line, Easter broke a pair of tackles and sprinted 17 yards for another  touchdown and a 28-0 lead.  </P> <P> Luigi Gagow led Loara with 76 yards rushing in 16 attempts. Easter carried  eight times for 71 yards.  </P> <P> El Dorado (1-5, 0-1) hasn't won since beating Century, 34-9, in the season  opener.  </P> <P> El Dorado finally scored after sophomore quarterback Jim Beck -- replacing  Bluth -- led the Hawks 80 yards in nine plays in the third quarter. Sophomore  Bryan Warner capped the drive with a one-yard touchdown dive. STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

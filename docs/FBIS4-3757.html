			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Shihuan (3769 0013 3562)] </F>   [Text] Xian, 25 Mar (XINHUA)--Song Ping concluded his  17-day inspection of Shaanxi yesterday. During his inspection  tour, Song Ping stressed: We must regard agriculture as the  foundation of the national economy. After we ensure grain and  cotton acreages and increase their total output, we must adjust  the agricultural production structure in rural areas and raise  peasants' income level.    From 8 to 24 March, accompanied by Zhang Boxing, secretary  of  the Shaanxi Provincial CPC Party Committee; Cheng Andong, member  of the Shaanxi provincial committee standing committee and  secretary of the Xian city party committee; and Li Huanzheng,  member of the Shaanxi provincial committee standing committee  and secretary of the provincial party committee's Commission for  Discipline Inspection, Song Ping visited factories, rural areas,  and schools, and called on workers, peasants, experts,  professors, and veteran comrades to acquire a better  understanding of industrial and agricultural production, and the  development of cultural and educational undertakings. Wherever  he went, he held talks with local cadres and people and  encouraged them to make greater progress.    Song Ping has worked in Shaanxi for 15 years. Song Ping  said: Under the party's correct leadership, the provincial party  committee and government have done a large amount of work.  Shaanxi has developed rapidly and the major changes it has  undergone are gratifying. Shaanxi has many strong points and  should seize the opportunity to deepen reform and quicken  development.    During his talks with grass-roots cadres, Song Ping said:  Cadres should concentrate their efforts on mobilizing peasants  to improve their living standards, vigorously develop village  and town enterprises, and develop industry to assist in  agricultural development. Cadres should work diligently at  their posts, be honest in performing their official duties, and  serve the people wholeheartedly. They should go down to the  grass-roots units and establish close contact with people in an  effort to communicate with units of lower levels and to resolve  the masses' problems. Weinan prefecture carries out a very good  measure requiring leading cadres to report their major decisions  to the masses for approval. In this way, cadres are under the  supervision of the party and the masses. Weinan must continue  this measure. It is very important for us to build good  grass-roots party and political power organs and to play the  exemplary role of a party member. Only when we build good  grass-roots party and political power organs, can we carry out  the party's decisions and policies. While we are paying  attention to material civilization construction, we must make  great efforts to promote spiritual civilization construction,  collectivism, patriotism, and socialism. We should do a good  job in family planning and in promoting the overall development  of the rural economy. Song Ping hoped party committee and  government cadres at all levels would work hand in hand and make  concerted efforts to build a better Shaanxi.</p>

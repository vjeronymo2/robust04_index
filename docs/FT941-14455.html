			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Quake damage may hit Dollars 30bn: Clinton pledges federal aid as he tours devastated areas of LA As President Bill Clinton toured devastated areas of Los Angeles yesterday, damage estimates from Monday's earthquake rose as high as Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.2bn) - making it the most costly disaster in US history. Mr Clinton, who was met by a sharp after-shock as he surveyed a collapsed freeway bridge, promised 'unusual and unprecedented' federal relief funds, including an initial, immediate payment of Dollars 45m for highway repairs and Dollars 239m in low interest loans to small businesses. After talking to groups of residents gathered along his route through some of the most badly hit areas of the San Fernando Valley, the president addressed officials and residents at the Burbank airport. Earlier yesterday, California's Governor, Mr Pete Wilson, told the Federal Emergency Management Agency that the total cost of the quake could be anywhere between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 30bn. His figures were in part derived from estimates provided to the state by EQE International, a San Francisco engineering consultancy firm that specialises in assessing natural disaster risks. Mr Earl Aurelius, vice-president of EQE, said the preliminary estimate of damage was Dollars 15.1bn, excluding business losses. Of that, he estimated that between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 1.9bn was covered by insurance. EQE has used a computer model, combined with the observations of 30 of its engineers, to assess the damage. 'We are feeling increasingly comfortable with our Dollars 15.1bn estimate as we get further reports from the field,' Mr Aurelius said. Damage was far more serious than in the 1989 San Francisco bay area earthquake, where costs rose to Dollars 7bn, because of the higher concentration of properties near the epicentre, he said. A spokesman for the governor said the estimates were preliminary, but the Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn estimate provided a good 'ballpark'. Although severe damage is limited to the western and north western parts of the city, it is nonetheless overwhelming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it expected to spend at least Dollars 1bn on repairs. The California Transportation Department says repairs to freeways will cost at least Dollars 100m, an estimate that is expected to double or triple as more structural damage is revealed. Whatever the cost, it will take time - probably years - to undo what the forces of nature accomplished in less than a minute. On Tuesday, crews began demolishing quake-torn overpasses on the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways. Working around the clock, they hope to have the structures down in about a week. Rebuilding will take about a year. Workers also struggled yesterday to mend the San Fernando Valley's wrecked aqueducts as water in the lone reservoir serving the area dwindled. Ruptured aqueducts have cut off much of the water supply to the 260-square-mile suburban expanse hardest hit by the quake.

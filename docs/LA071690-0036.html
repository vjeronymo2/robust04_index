			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AUSSIES RISE ABOVE FLAT WAVES AT LIFE'S A BEACH  </P> <P> Australian residents Martin Potter, Pam Burridge and Nat Young have just about  as much experience on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' world tour as anyone  in their divisions.  </P> <P> So when the waves south of the Oceanside Pier, which had been fairly consistent  throughout the week, turned mushy and flat during Sunday's final rounds of the  $112,500 Life's A Beach contest, Potter, Burridge and Young cashed in on some  of that experience to win.  </P> <P> Potter, the defending world champion, won the men's division in a rout over  Hawaii's Sunny Garcia, 74.8-53.5. Potter scored well on four of his first five  waves -- contestants are judged on their four best waves out of a maximum of 15  in the finals -- and Garcia managed just two good rides throughout the  30-minute final.  </P> <P> Asked what he would do differently if he could have the final to do over,  Garcia answered simply, "Catch some waves."  </P> <P> For Potter, who is a citizen of Great Britain, it was his first victory in six  events this season and 13th in 10 years on the world tour. He earned $10,000  and 1,400 tour points to move from 12th to seventh with 5,008. Australia's  Robbie Bain, who finished tied for fifth, remained the tour leader with 6,592  points.  </P> <P> "Winning the world title last year, you know, I came out surfing thinking like  I had to defend the title (in every event)," Potter said. "When you try to  defend something, it's almost twice as hard winning. I ended up putting a lot  of unnecessary pressure on myself. I made a lot of mistakes early in the year.  </P> <P> "This was sort of a barrier for me to try to stop putting the pressure on  myself and just go out and start surfing, which is what I did last year."  </P> <P> Burridge, who holds a number of ASP records including most appearances (87) and  most top eight finishes (nine), convincingly defeated Florida's Lisa Anderson,  76.3-60.3, in the women's division, despite catching only five waves to  Anderson's nine.  </P> <P> It was also Burridge's first victory of the season after finishing second three  times.  </P> <P> "I had a string of second places which I walked away quite happy from. And I  didn't like that," Burridge said. "I wanted to prove to myself that I could win  an event again and be worthy of it. Lisa's been, I guess, the form surfer  lately, and she's been stopping people in her tracks. So I'm happy."  </P> <P> Burridge won $3,500 and increased her leading tour points to 6,814. She is  trying to win her first world title after finishing second a record four times  and third three times in nine years on the tour.  </P> <P> While Potter and Burridge are 25 and 24, respectively, Young is 43, and had to  go against 14-year-old Joel Tudor of San Diego -- the youngest finalist ever in  an ASP contest -- as well as Dale Dobson of Oceanside and Stuart Entwistle of  Australia in the four-man final of the longboarding division, the first such  ASP competition ever held on the United States mainland.  </P> <P> Young, the defending world champion, won $4,000. Dobson was second, Tudor third  and Entwistle fourth.  </P> <P> While the others paddled about trying to find a hot spot, Young stayed close to  the pier throughout and caught the most waves of the day, 11.  </P> <P> "It's something that Pottz (Potter) and I had in common -- consistency," Young  said. "As far as wave selection, my feeling is, the only time a wave is over is  when it's a ripple on the sand . . . when it totally dissipates. There wasn't a  lot of waves, but you do your best with what you've got."  </P></p>

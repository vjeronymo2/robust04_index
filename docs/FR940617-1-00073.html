			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the agency's comments (Ref. 12), the manufacturer of triclosan requested further guidance, and asserted, ``The overall antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a function of the total formulation rather than a single ingredient. Although it is impossible to anticipate and test all possible formulations, adequate in vivo evaluations of triclosan-containing formulations for specific end uses are available to fully justify Category I status for triclosan as an active ingredient in surgical hand scrubs, health-care personnel handwashes, and antimicrobial soaps.'' The comment submitted effectiveness data from four in vivo studies on formulations of triclosan (Ref. 13). These data included three previously unsubmitted studies (RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981), RDP/19/21 (February 2, 1981), and CAB/AVD (February 2, 1982)), and one previously submitted study (66&hyph;D15&hyph;W221, OTC Volume 020038) that had been reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33128). In study  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , following modified glove juice test procedures, a test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol) and a control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) were compared for reduction of normal baseline flora and persistence of that reduction for 3 hours on the hands of 15 test subjects. The test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol) and the control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) immediately reduced approximately 99.5 percent of the baseline number of bacteria. After 3 hours, 0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol suppressed the baseline count better than the vehicle control; for example the test product allowed about a onefold increase in bacterial count within 3 hours, while the vehicle control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) allowed an approximately twelvefold increase. Although the test used was not the glove juice test described in the antimicrobial tentative final monograph, alternative methods are acceptable, provided criteria meet those of the glove juice test procedures described in the guidelines. (See ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test),'' 43 FR 1210 at 1242.) The agency has the following comments regarding the protocol for the study: only 15 subjects (an insufficient number) were tested; a baseline count from 3 samplings was not established before the test; the log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction in bacteria from baseline was determined after 3 hours, but not after 6 hours; and the results of the test were not analyzed statistically. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In study  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RDP/19/21 (February 2, 1981) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 2 percent triclosan in a liquid soap vehicle reduced baseline counts of test bacteria  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATCC 11229,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. aeruginosa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATCC 15442, and Staphylococcus species on the hands of human test subjects by 1 log greater than the water control after 2 minutes of handwashing.

Using the Quinn Split-Use Modification of the Price-Cade Method, increased skin-degerming activity was shown after 3 days of repeated (10) applications of triclosan as compared to the control. However, the number of test subjects (5) is not adequate to demonstrate general recognition of effectiveness. (See the ``Modified Cade Procedure,'' 43 FR 1210 at 1243.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency concludes that the data (Ref. 13) discussed above indicate that formulations of triclosan significantly reduce the baseline count of bacterial skin flora. However, before triclosan may be generally recognized as an effective health-care antiseptic for use in antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products, additional in vivo data, i.e., glove juice test data, are needed. The in vivo data should correlate with data obtained from in vitro studies. Because of the nature of the intended uses of health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency believes it is essential to assure the effectiveness of the active ingredient, triclosan, in final formulations. To demonstrate effectiveness in vitro, information is needed on the germicidal activity of the vehicle alone, so that the germicidal contribution of triclosan attributed to the total effectiveness of the finished formulation can be determined. (See section I.N., comment 28.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, triclosan (up to 1 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) is being classified as Category III for use in health-care antiseptic drug products as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub. The agency's conclusions are summarized below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,r25 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Short-term use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Long-term (repeated/daily) uses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation IIIE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Antiseptic Handwash or Health-Care Personnel Handwash IIISE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> Surgical Hand Scrub IIISE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> S=Safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> E=Effectiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has communicated further with EPA and has ascertained that there is no specific report on the proliferation of triclosan (Ref. 14). Regarding exclusive patent rights, the agency advises that these are not among the determining criteria to establish general recognition of safety and effectiveness, and therefore cannot be used in the evaluation. However, having reviewed the new data along with the previously submitted data, the agency concludes that there is no proliferation problem with triclosan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The U.S. under-secretary of state claimed Tuesday [5 April]  that Iran and Syria were not serious in their anti-drug campaign.    Talking to IRNA, Seyfollahi said that the anti-drug efforts  by various Iranian organizations particulary the law enforcement  pesonnel and especially in the border areas with Pakistan and  Afghanistan, had been admired several times by the international  organizations.    He said that the international drug smugglers conducted by  the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) earned billions of  dollars for the U.S. annually, however, as a result of Iran's  vigorous campaign against the transit of drug to Europe and  America via that Iranian territory, the U.S. Administration has  suffered huge losses he added.    Seyfollahi said the U.S. by raising directed and calculated  claims [passage indistinct]    He noted that the traffickers are generally equipped with  the  advanced U.S.-made weapons, and that a big part of the  international drug trafficking operations are carried out under  the financial and arms supports of the U.S.    "The U.S. and persons like [UN Human Rights Commission  Special Representative Reynaldo] Galindo Pohl who are under the  influence of U.S., have times and again forwarded the unfounded  claims that Iran executes political prisoners under the name of  drug traffickers, in a bid to prevent Iran's decisive measures  against narcotics."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, June 1 (AFP) -- The UN military chief in  Rwanda, General Romeo Dallaire, on Wednesday [1 June] met  Rwandan rebel leader Paul Kagame to discuss security for UN  operations the day after a peacekeeper was killed, a UN  spokesman said. "The safety of the UN troops is very high on  the agenda," military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said as  the two went into talks.    UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said one attempt had been made to  deliver food in Kigali, which is under siege by Kagame's Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF), but the UN vehicle came under fire. "We  do not know who shot at it," Kabia said, adding that nobody was  hurt in the incident.    All UN humanitarian operations, including the distribution  of  food, otherwise remained halted for the day, pending guarantees  of safety from the warring parties, UN sources said.    The UN mission in Rwanda suspended relief operations after a  Senegalese army captain was killed Tuesday when a shell  apparently fired at government army positions by the RPF  exploded near his car.    The United Nations had earlier Tuesday continued to evacuate  hundreds of civilians caught up in the bloodshed to safer  positions behind the lines respectively of the mainly Tutsi  rebels and the Hutu majority government forces.    UN officials refused to specify where Dallaire, a Canadian,  and Kagame, were meeting on Wednesday, saying only that it was  "somewhere in Rwanda".    Up to 500,000 Rwandans are estimated to have been killed  since the beginning of April, while half a million others have  fled abroad. Hundreds of thousands of people are internally  displaced.    The Senegalese officer was the 12th UN soldier to lose his  life in Rwanda.</p>

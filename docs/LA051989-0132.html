			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3 -- A;  </P> <P> ROUSH PITCHES 1-HITTER; SAN CLEMENTE WINS, 1-0  </P> <P> Kathy Johnson doubled home the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning  Thursday to give San Clemente High School a 1-0 victory over University in a  Southern Section 3-A first-round girls' softball playoff game at San Clemente.  </P> <P> Johnson's game-winning hit supported the one-hit pitching of Tara Roush (9-6),  who struck out eight, to pick up the victory that advances San Clemente (12-13)  to Tuesday's second-round game against West Torrance, a 1-0 winner over Laguna  Hills Tuesday.  </P> <P> University sophomore Shareen Patton (11-7) retired the first 17 batters she  faced before Kim Denyer ruined her perfect-game bid by lining a single to  right.  </P> <P> "She just threw the ball right up the middle and it was ready for me to hit  it," said Denyer, who was 0 for 25 in South Coast League play.  </P> <P> Patton, who retired the next eight batters after Denyer was caught stealing to  end the sixth, also yielded a single to Denyer with two outs in the ninth.  Denyer, who stole second, came around to score when Johnson slammed a 2-2 pitch  through the right-center field gap for the game-winning double.  </P> <P> University (15-9), which played without its leading hitter, freshman Thea  Curtis (flu), got its only hit off Roush in the top of the first on Lakita  Johnson's two-out single. After that, the Trojans didn't have another  base-runner until Roush walked Lisa Anthony with two outs in the seventh.  </P> <P> In other 3-A softball:  </P> <P> El Toro 3, Tustin 1 -- Junior Paige Lauby (13-7) pitched a one-hitter, striking  out seven and walking none, to lead El Toro (13-8) at Tustin (17-8). Jaime  Smith had two hits, scored a run and drove in a run for El Toro, which will  play Montclair (22-4) in a quarterfinal game Tuesday.  </P> <P> Irvine 3, Mayfair 0 -- The host Vaqueros (19-7) scored three unearned runs in  the third inning to beat Mayfair (15-10). Jennifer Brundage pitched a  three-hitter, struck out six, walked one, and also went two for three with a  run scored for Irvine, which will play Saddleback (24-4) Tuesday.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 4, South Torrance 1 -- Mission Viejo, an at-large team from the  South Coast League, upset host South Torrance (14-5), the winner of the Ocean  League. Erin Fitzgerald (9-4) pitched four-hitter and Michele Daugherty hit a  two-run home run for the Diablos (15-8), who will play top-seeded La Mirada  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Saddleback 2, Woodbridge 0 (10 innings) -- Desi Abrego pitched a five-hitter  with nine strikeouts and no walks for visiting Saddleback (24-4). The  Roadrunners scored twice in the 10th on a bases-loaded dropped third strikeout  with two outs.  </P></p>

In this regard, on 28  December, the government decided to make it a strong organ. In  addition to deliberation and investigation rights, the  government decided to allow the organ to have its own  secretariat and to give advice to ministers. It is a concept  designed to make the organ similar, in terms of its form and  power, to the National Railway Reconstruction Administration  Council, which was charged with overseeing the privatization of  the national railway system. The government plans to submit  legislation establishing the body to the next ordinary Diet  session, pending consultations with coalition parties.    The concept of establishing the third party organ was formed  in response to a report by the Economic Reform Study Council --  a private consultative body to Prime Minister Hosokawa -- and  recommendations by the Provisional Council for Promotion of  Administrative Reform (third administrative reform council).  The new body's main tasks will be: 1) to discuss the five-year  deregulation program to be created by the administrative reform  promotion headquarters to be established as early as mid-January  and to watch how it will be carried out; and 2) to work out the  draft of the freedom-of-information legislation on the basis of  government inquiries. If necessary, the body will be authorized  to intervene in discussions on the creation of deregulation  programs by individual ministries and agencies and watch the  progress of program implementation and advise cabinet ministers.    For the time being, it is likely that an influential person  in the financial world will be appointed to head the body.    Moreover, the government is studying the possibility of  appointing academicians, private citizens, retired bureaucrats,  and journalists to the body. In particular, the government  intends to allow the Diet to appoint council members.    The idea of allowing the organ to have its own secretariat  stems from an Economic Reform Council proposal made in its final  report, saying that the organ should "have its own secretariat."  It seems that the secretariat will be staffed by officials from  the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] and other  ministries and agencies.    Regarding the third party organ, Prime Minister Hosokawa and  MCA Director General Koshiro Ishida agreed on the basis of the  National Administrative Organization Act's Clause 8 to establish  the body in the Prime Minister's Office. Following the  agreement, coordination was made within the government. As a  result, the concept of forming the third party organ was formed.    The government intends to make the organ similar to the  National Railway Reconstruction Administration Council, which  was also formed on the basis of Clause 8 and had its own  secretariat and right to advise ministers. It will be a  stronger body than the Provisional Council for Promotion of  Administrative Reform, which did not have the right to advise  ministers.    However, some members of the coalition parties, such as  members of Naoto Kan's system revision study group which is  composed of supra-partisan faction members, want the proposed  body to report directly to the Diet to ensure that the  organization is completely independent of the government.  Because of this, coordination within the government and the  ruling parties for the body's formation may be rough sailing.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Generale de Banque lifts dividend after advance GENERALE de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, yesterday announced net profits for 1990 of BFr8bn (Dollars 232m) a rise of 7.8 per cent above those of 1988, the last comparable year. Generale de Banque, whose 1989 results were depressed by heavy provisions against foreign loan losses, said despite continued problems due to the economic downturn in the US, deposits in Belgian francs grew by 8 per cent following Belgium's decision to tie its franc more closely to the D-Mark. Declaring a BFr5 increase in its dividend to BFr270 a share, Mr Jacques Groothaert, the bank's chairman, said that while the bank had made certain exceptional profits last year, from the sale of its stake in European American Bancorp and in Lease International, it also had to pay out BFr2bn last year towards redundancies, aimed at shedding some 1,500 staff by the end of this year. Mr Groothaert said Generale de Banque, which recently abandoned an ambitious cross-border merger plan with Amro Bank of the Netherlands, had no intentions of linking up with any Belgian bank at home. Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, one of the largest Belgian holding companies, yesterday announced consolidated profits for 1990 of BFr5.68bn, up from BFr4.25bn the year before. The results included capital gains from the sale of GBL's stake in Wagons-Lits, the Belgian tourism and hotel company, which was offset by an exceptional BFr3bn book loss from the deconsolidation of the US assets of the group. Much of this, BFr2.5bn, was 'purely a book-keeping loss' due to the accumulated depreciation of dollar assets since 1982. GBL raised its dividend for 1990 to BFr274-a-share, up from BFr215 the year before. Barco, the Flemish electronics group, has maintained its dividend of BFr26 a share, even though pre-profit tax for 1990 fell to BFr899m, from BFr1.22bn in 1989. The poorer profits reflected mainly the cost of acquisitions in the US and Europe.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (20): Further sites are planned - Export processing zones: have the benefits faded? When it comes to enthusiasm for a government programme, Silas Ita is hard to beat. The chief executive of Kenya's export processing zones (EPZs) authority enthuses about their likely success. 'We have had more than 300 inquiries,' he says. EPZs were created by law in 1990. The aim was to offer companies ready-to-occupy units, with all necessary infrastructure and a series of incentives, such as exemption for 10 years from income tax, value added tax, import duties and withholding taxes on dividends. Other benefits included: no exchange controls, on-site customs clearance, unrestricted employment of foreigners in senior and skilled positions, and no restrictions on management or technical procedures or the level of foreign investment. Sameer Industrial Park, the first EPZ to open, is privately owned by Firestone East Africa. Clyde Tabor, managing director, says 12 companies have leased nearly all the space on the 45-acre site, and that he expects to cover all costs within 10 years. 'It's been a good investment.' Firestone had decided to develop an industrial park in Nairobi beside its existing site, and took advantage of EPZ designation once the legislation was mooted. Sameer provides security and maintenance services, for which it charges Dollars 3.20 a square foot annually. Mr Tabor highlights one of the principal benefits for companies locating in Kenya as the quality and cost of the labour force; and the biggest problem as the infrastructure. A further five private EPZ sites have been planned, while a significant investment in the country has come from Thomas de la Rue, the security printer, which has been granted the status for a factory on the outskirts of Nairobi. Two large government EPZs are also under way with support from the World Bank and the African Development Bank: the Athi River Zone, near Nairobi's international airport, which opens this year; and the Mombasa EPZ, in two phases, construction of which is expected to begin this year. A number of business executives, who preferred not to be named, are rather more sceptical of the attractions of the government's EPZ sites and how rapidly or completely they will be filled. Some of the initial benefits have faded as liberalisation has reduced the advantages over operation in the rest of the country. One of them questioned whether the rents charged would be sufficient, or the level of services adequate. Another, from a company long established in the country, said: 'We looked at the idea of moving into one of the zones, but we found we would just be substituting high customs duties for high rents.' Mr Ita is frank about some of the shortcomings. 'We are still moving slowly on how we interface with other organisations,' he says. He highlights goods to or from EPZs being delayed at customs, which should not be handling them. He says there are problems with VAT being charged on telephone calls and electricity bills, in spite of the exemption. Looking forward, he says he wants to see the government's EPZs privatised, though this may fall short of a full sale and amount rather to handing over management, or possibly a lease on the sites, to the private sector. He says there are no plans by the government to develop additional EPZs, but that it is considering turning Mombasa into a free port, to compete with other centres, such as Rotterdam and Dubai, as 'bulk-breaking' centres for repackages large consignments for re-export.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: Future of the Travelcard Sir, Why is it that the deregulation of London buses should be paid for by their riders ('Travelcard doomed', April 22)? I use my Travelcard to go by bus where I cannot easily travel by the Underground. Is the Travelcard underpriced? Its 'critics' appear to forget that London Transport gets my annual fare upfront; would that all customers were so willing. Can it really be beyond the wit of 40 or so bus operators (about one bus load, incidentally) to draw up a revenue-sharing agreement? It would be more equitable to use the smart-card technology to record individual journeys at the point of sale - that is, the bus - and use that data to apportion the pooled revenue. That at least might encourage some competition between the operators. Maxwell Blake, McCowan Blake, 119 Bishopsgate, London EC2M 3TE</p>

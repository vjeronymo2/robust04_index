Recalling that eight rounds of working contact have been  held  between the sides since the North side proposed the exchange of  presidential envoys in may last year, the statement says:    The North side made reasonable proposals on the rank and  duty  of the special envoys and procedures of their exchange and  showed sincerity by holding working contacts year by year in  real earnest to reach an agreement at an early date.    The South side, however, refused even to accept our proposal  for the exchange of special envoys without any justifiable  reason from the very beginning and refused the working contact  itself, delaying it for five months. Even after it came out to  the contact under the pressure of public opinion at home and  abroad, the South side hampered the exchange of special envoys  by repeatedly creating artificial obstacles and difficulties in  the way of the contact.    What must not be overlooked is that the South Korean ruling  quarters have repeatedly resorted to such insidious intrigues as  abusing the working-level contact to impede and put the brakes  on the DPRK-USA talks.    The DPRK-USA talks and the inter-Korean exchange of special  envoys are, by nature, different matters. It was an act of  flunkeyist treachery against the nation that the South Korean  ruling quarters abused the exchange of special envoys to hinder  the DPRK-USA talks.    We have approached the working contact with sincerity,  patiently urging dialogue and negotiation and not abandoning our  will for the exchange of special envoys even when the South  Korean authorities broke off the working-level contact,  antagonizing the fellow countrymen from an anti-national  position and resorting to malicious moves to do harm to us in  conspiracy with outside forces.    At the sixth round of working contact, our side proposed to  dispel the apprehensions of all the fellow countrymen for the  exchange of special envoys by announcing in a joint communique  that the sides confirmed again each other's intention to  exchange special envoys and agreed on their early exchange, and  thus took a broad-minded attitude with regard to its just  four-point demand that all large-scale nuclear war manoeuvres  against the dialogue partner be discontinued, the "international  cooperation system" be abandoned, the planned introduction of  Patriot missiles be rescinded and the remarks that they "cannot  shake hands with a party possesed of nuclear weapons" be  withdrawn.    Even at that time, however, the South side blindly took  exception to the North side's constructive proposal and, outside  of conference hall, cried that "the exchange of special envoys  is a precondition for the third round of DPRK-USA talks" and  decided on a "policy of tough reaction" toward the North at "a  high-level strategic meeting of officials concerned". The South  side freely addressed itself to such extremely insolent acts as  calling for the resumption of "Team Spirit" nuclear war  exercises, promotion of the planned introduction of Patriot  missiles and "international sanctions" against the North.    Such abrupt provocative acts of the South Korean rulers were  virtually a declaration of breaking off the working-level  contact, a declaration of abandoning the exchange of special  envoys and a declaration of all-out confrontation with us.    By thus provoking the dialogue partner and declaring a  unilateral breakoff of the North-South working contact at a time  when the third round of DPRK-USA talks were five to six days  away, the South Korean rulers committed an unpardonable criminal  act of deliberately putting the brakes on the DPRK-USA talks.    We strongly condemn the South Korean authorities for finally  breaking up the working contact between the North and the South  by consistently using the exchange of special envoys for their  sinister political purpose, revealing their ulterior intention  to part with us.    The developments in South Korea today show that,  loud-mouthed  as it is about "civilian government," the Kim Yong-sam group is  aggravating the North-South relations more maliciously than  former military dictators, leading them to a phase of  confrontation and war.    Those who run amok with the sword between their clenched  teeth, while advertising "civilian" rule, cannot be treated  otherwise.    Criminals are destined to face punishment.    Those who cannot defend independence, the life and soul of  the nation, but foment antagonism and confrontation within the  nation and lead the situation to a phase of war by following  outside forces, will get nothing but curses of the nation and  destruction.    No dictators who had turned their back on the fellow  countrymen and engaged in anti-national moves in league with  outside forces ever lived their days, and such sycophant  traitors met a miserable end without exception.    The North side delegation to the working contact will follow  the development after the declaration of the chief delegate of  the South side that they "would not hold talks with the North  side any further".</p>

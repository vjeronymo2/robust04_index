			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on profit-taking and arbitrage selling SHARES LOST ground as arbitrage selling and profit-taking outweighed small-lot buying by public funds and bargain hunters, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei average fell 151.05 to 17,289.97, having opened at the day's high of 17,421.97 before slowly losing ground throughout the day, and hitting the day's low of 17,255.47 just before the close. Volume dropped to 150m shares from 511m. Declines led advances by 672 to 275, with 193 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 8.80 to 1,316.35, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 1.24 to 1,061.98. Investors failed to find trading incentives in last Friday's main events, the Bank of Japan tankan (quarterly business sentiment report) or the Japanese cabinet reshuffle. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said the BoJ survey contained no surprises and that the reported comments of Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the new minister of finance, that he did not intend to cut income taxes did not provide insight to future policy. Foreign investors became net buyers of stock in the week of November 30 to December 4 for the first time in five weeks. Although some traders hope that further foreign interest will lift trading in the near term, most overseas investors face a year-end closing of books, and are unlikely to take an active role in the market. Traders said issues which are seen as beneficiaries of asset revaluation, required by the international consolidation of accounting laws in 1995, gained ground. Assets at most Japanese companies are currently booked at initial purchase prices rather than at market levels. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y7,000 to Y550,000. Short-covering supported Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled housing loan company. The issue was the most actively traded of the day, rising Y6 to Y324. Interest rate-sensitive stocks weakened on disappointment over the failure of the central bank to cut the official discount rate. Financial shares and large-capital issues receded on profit-taking: Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y30 to Y2,530, Nomura Securities Y10 to Y1,500 and Nippon Steel Y1 to Y290. High-technology stocks were hurt by profit-taking. Hitachi relinquished Y4 to Y741 and Fujitsu lost Y18 to Y562. Nippon Express, a package delivery company, improved Y2 to Y766 on projections that it will post a 4 per cent increase in profits in the current fiscal year. In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 166.64 to 18,862.42 in volume of 21.3m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim region was mixed, with activity beginning to ease ahead of the holidays. HONG KONG gained ground. Banks were actively traded as the Hang Seng index put on 14.55 to 5,267.73 in low turnover of HKDollars 1.73bn. HSBC Holdings declined 50 cents to HKDollars 54.50, while Hang Seng Bank appreciated 75 cents to HKDollars 48.50. SEOUL rose for the fourth consecutive session in thin trading as many investors remained absent ahead of Friday's presidential election. The composite index added 3.95 at 651.23 in turnover of some Won516bn. MANILA declined in the absence of fresh news, with the composite index falling 29.79 to 1,202.56 in combined turnover of 343m pesos. Overnight losses by PLDT in the US saw its shares close 25 pesos cheaper at 850 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR fell on scattered profit-taking. The composite index lost 2.72 to 632.54 in turnover of MDollars 208m. Multi-Purpose Holdings shed 20 cents to MDollars 2.25 as an application by two members of the group, Magnum and Dunlop Estates, to participate in a gaming venture in southern China met further delays. Magnum dipped 35 cents to MDollars 9.65 and Dunlop slipped 40 cents to MDollars 8.40. In SINGAPORE the Straits Times Industrial index eased 2.05 to 1,445.52. AUSTRALIA overcame early weakness and the All Ordinaries index ended 11.8 up at 1,512.4 in turnover of ADollars 254.8m. Among the active issues, CRA moved forward 8 cents to ADollars 12.68 after saying that the decision by Klockner-Werke, in which it holds a 10 per cent shareholding, to seek protection from its creditors would have no immediate impact. BHP ended 12 cents ahead at ADollars 12.68 and National Australia Bank 15 cents up at ADollars 7.70. NEW ZEALAND closed firmer, with strong interest in Goodman Fielder as the NZSE-40 index gained 10.18 to 1,532.10. Turnover came to NZDollars 30.5m. Goodman Fielder put on 15 cents to NZDollars 2.22 on unsubstantiated rumours that Nestle was interested in taking a stake. Telecom eased 5 cents to NZDollars 2.34 on US weakness. BANGKOK was slightly lower with the SET index down 2.43 at 850.18 in turnover of Bt2.5bn. Thai Farmers Bank rose Bt12 to Bt700 and Siam Commercial Bt6 to Bt1,060. BOMBAY fell again in trading restricted to 90 minutes against the normal three hours, the BSE index losing 67.42 to 2,469.45 in a continued reaction to last week's Hindu-Moslem riots, in which over 1,000 people died.</p>

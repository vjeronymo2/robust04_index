			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Illumination on the sons of light: After 40 years, the controversial Dead Sea Scrolls are finally available for public scrutiny After 40 years of extremely slow progress, the Dead Sea Scrolls have been catapulted back into the news. This Christmas is the first one at which ordinary readers can study almost all the texts in translation, and the new openness has led to all manner of wild historical claims. Until quite recently, there appeared to be a learned consensus. The scrolls had been found at Qumran, the religious headquarters of a Jewish sect who were almost certainly to be labelled as Essenes. Their scrolls had originated at various dates between the second century BC and the middle of the first century AD. Keen members of the community studied scriptures, copied manuscripts and were probably expected to have nothing to do with women, although a few female skeletons were found in the nearby cemetery. There was a strict hierarchy, quite a lot of washing, endless praying and denunciations of polygamy, a practice which was not uncommon among richer Jews at this date. The administration included a chaplain, or priest, and two positions whose titles could be rendered as bursar and warden. 'It is not clear whether the bursar was distinct from the warden or whether one man dealt with both tasks,' according to Professor Geza Vermes, a leading authority in the study of the scrolls and author of the soundest books on them in English. The community described itself as the 'sons of light', revered the wisdom of a founding 'teacher of righteousness' and hated the memory of a 'wicked priest' in its history. They also believed that they were fighting a holy war which was about to erupt in the final drama of the end of the world. In the early 1980s, there were times in my own Qumran of a library when I idly felt that their life did not sound so very different from my Oxford college, still all-male and confronted with the demonised Mrs Thatcher. Since the mid-1980s almost every element in this picture has been attacked. We have been told that the religious headquarters was really a fortress (although its water-supply was exposed to attack) and that its scrolls are a rag-bag from various groups and places (although the main batch have a coherence which refutes this notion). More radically, the residents have been seen as militant zealots, literally bent on holy war (although their language was clearly metaphorical). Worst of all, they have been equated with early Christians at a time when Christians in Palestine were known as Nazarenes (supposedly derived from the same root as one term for the sect in the scrolls). Their revered teacher of righteousness could be Jesus himself and the wicked priest could be none other than St. Paul, or at least Paul could have gone in his Jewish phase to persecute this group in 'Damascus', a term which is loosely used in one of their texts. All these theories are untenable, especially the most recent Christian ones which are absolute rubbish. However, they have arisen from, and have been exacerbated by, impatience with the 'official' team of publishers who had sat on the remaining scrolls for too long. Here, there has been a breakthrough which is the public achievement of 1991-92. It began when two Hebrew scholars in Cincinnati published their own reconstruction of unpublished scrolls, ingeniously basing them on a published dictionary of all words used in the Dead Sea texts. Their version has turned out to be remarkably accurate. Among all the fuss, it then emerged, sensationally, that the Huntington Library in California was holding photographs of the unpublished texts and in the face of official protests from Israel, the library went ahead and published the lot. Meanwhile, a comparable bunch of facsimiles were rapidly made available from Jerusalem for study in Oxford under the guidance of Prof Vermes. They are a fitting tribute to his years of contribution to the texts' correct interpretation. At last, the scrolls are where they should be, out in the open under scholarly scrutiny. This year has also seen the first accessible translation and commentary by Professors Robert Eisenmann and Michael Wise, entitled The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered. Unfortunately, their own theories on the texts' significance are not reliable. Most readers may well wonder why this continuing battle matters, except to specialists. It depends on who you are. Many people, but especially Jews, are intrigued to discover yet more variety in the Judaism of the years from c150 BC to 50 AD. We cannot talk of orthodoxy or a single way, despite older textbooks on the subject. The sect in the scrolls were neither Pharisees nor Sadducees. Its members lived in bitter hatred of the existing temple's hierarchy, although they sent offerings to the temple itself and hoped for a replacement. Their calendar was eccentric; their view of history was lopsided; they studied horoscopes and astrology and aspired to heavenly visions; they called fellow Jews 'sons of darkness'. They also ruled that leaders must retire at 60 because God then enfeebled man's intelligence, and that no member should deal with outsiders without charging a price. Despite these sensible rulings, the keenest members probably led a life quite like the routine of the first monks. They had a lively hope of the end of the world and a sense that the spirit was among them. Christians, of course, need to pay attention. Far too much polemic has been wasted on the belief that the scrolls will somehow 'undermine' Christianity or make it seem 'unoriginal'. If the texts really do call people 'sons of God', so do bits of the Old Testament. Certainly, they allude to messiahs, but we always knew that Jesus was not the only candidate; a recent claim that one messiah in a scroll is said to have been 'pierced' in the side has collapsed on scrutiny. On a calm view, it is well-known (though some scholars, especially in Germany, have sometimes forgotten) that the first Christians were Jews and that their originality was simply that they believed the messiah had come as Jesus and risen from the dead. Their impact did not lie in entirely new titles or language. Parallels are to be expected, but the emphasis was different. The scrolls do add to the historical context in which early Christianity also emerged. Among their sect, there was mention of a special meal of bread and new wine, to be repeated in due course with the messiah; there was a new covenant and a new 12 tribes of Israel; the end was imminent and a spirit was active. There was no idea of redemption, and whatever their great teacher of righteousness may have taught, he did not use parables or work miracles or proclaim a kingdom. As for the messiah, the scrolls seem to recognise two whose identities are very obscure. Odd bits of the Christian epistle to the Hebrews do look less odd when seen beside bits of these texts. It is also fun to wonder if wild John the Baptist had an earlier connection with them, although that cannot be known. The closest link with Christianity lies in the rather similar imagery of early Christians - who were possibly celibate - in the first Syriac texts surviving from the Middle East. Again, it is certainly not known if some of the sectarians of the scrolls had simply converted to Christianity. For those who are neither Jews nor Christians, there is a reassuring moral. Members of the sect believed that their doctrine was absolutely infallible, that the world would shortly end with their triumph over everyone else, that their history could be extracted from existing scriptures and that the end would begin in 40 years. It is a point of the highest interest that their texts of our Old Testament books are earlier, and often rather different, to those printed in conventional Hebrew bibles. This discovery is extremely significant for the textual history of the so-called word of God. There is another conclusion, hardly less satisfying. Despite their self-proclaimed infallibility they were wrong on every single point. The scriptures did not refer to them at all; they mistook the end; they never triumphed; they got it utterly wrong. After the war with Rome in 70 AD, they and their history disappeared. Mercifully, the 'sons of darkness' won. At dawn and dusk, every day, members of the sect would pray, supposedly in the company of the angels whose singing they joined with their own. 'Hark, the herald angels sing . . .' When I sing these Christian words each year as an atheist, I also remember those singers in the Dead Sea wilderness, convinced of the angelic presence, yet utterly mistaken in what they believed to be infallibly known.

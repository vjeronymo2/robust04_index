			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / European Government Bonds: Traders look for cuts in German rates to restore optimism THIS year promises to be a relatively favourable one for world bond markets, given the likelihood that it will see continued weak economic growth, subdued inflationary pressures and the prospect of low or falling interest rates in many of the world economies. Last year saw a continued fall in interest rates in the US, Japan, and the UK - particularly once sterling broke free of the constraints of the European exchange rate mechanism - while German interest rates remained stubbornly high, forcing other European economies to keep their domestic interest rates at relatively high levels. However, most economists expect to see an easing in German interest rates this year once its inflation shows some sign of coming under control, and this should pave the way for rate cuts across much of continental Europe. The D-Mark bloc bond markets were among the top performers in 1992 in local currency terms. With Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in its referendum on June 2 1992, investors feared the No vote had spelt an end to European economic and monetary union and to the convergence of inflation rates and interest rates across Europe. The weaker members of the ERM came under intense speculative pressure. Some buckled under the strain, with Spain choosing to devalue within the mechanism. Others were forced to float freely - namely sterling and the Italian lira, both of which remain outside the ERM. On the outskirts of Europe, countries such as Finland, Sweden and Norway - which are not ERM members but had pegged their currencies to the Ecu - found the strain too severe and were forced to sever the links. Investors stampeded out of the higher-yielding bond markets such as Spain and Italy, and into the safe haven of the D-Mark bloc where they hoped to benefit eventually from falling interest rates. As a result of strong buying of the D-Mark bloc, returns from these bond markets were high in local currency terms. Dutch government bonds gave a return of 15.7 per cent, according to J. P. Morgan, while Belgian bonds gained 13.87 per cent and German bunds rose 13.01 per cent in 1992. Following the reunification of Germany, the Bundesbank was forced to tighten monetary policy to try to curb rising inflation. German rates have reached historically high levels: the discount rate peaked at 8.75 per cent while the Lombard rate reached 9.75 per cent. However, while the Bundesbank allowed a small easing - with the discount rate cut half a point to 8.25 per cent and the Lombard rate snipped 25 basis points to 9.50 per cent in September 1992 - the German central bank has repeatedly stressed its commitment to conquering inflation before further cuts can be allowed. 'Despite clear evidence of a recession, the Bundesbank remains concerned about domestic inflationary pressures,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. He forecast a 0.9 per cent fall in German GNP in 1993. 'Although west German inflation is stubbornly high, the Bundesbank has been remarkably successful at containing the inflationary cost of unification. The Bundesbank is unlikely to lower rates prematurely; instead it will remain cautious and lower rates only when it believes inflation has fallen,' he said. As a result, the prospects for the long end of the bund market remain attractive, 'primarily because the anti-inflationary credibility of the Bundesbank more than offsets any negative impact from the persistent budget deficit and stubbornly high consumer prices,' claims DKB International. The Bundesbank raised its money supply target for 1993 to 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in 1992, at the end of last year. Money supply growth has overshot the bank's target range with the speculative attacks within the ERM helping to distort M3 growth towards the end of 1992. Mr Stefan Schneider, an economist with Nomura Research Institute, pointed out that 'although the 1992 M3 target (of 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent) will offer it some additional leeway, the Bundesbank will wait for further moderation in the growth of bank lending which could materialise in the first quarter as a result of weaker activity'. Most of the economists polled by the Financial Times expect to see a fall in German government bond yields by the end of 1993 as the Bundesbank allows an easing in interest rates during the year. However, they do not all agree. Goldman Sachs provides the most bearish forecasts, predicting two-year and five-year bond yields of 7.2 per cent, and 10-year bund yields of 7.5 per cent, while Nomura expects bund yields to be at the 7 per cent level in the five-year and 10-year maturities. Among the more optimistic forecasters are DKB International, Midland Montagu and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Midland Montagu sees two-year yields at 6 per cent by year-end, but forecasts 10-year yields of 7 per cent - just above the average of the forecasts. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew predicts that German yields will be 6.2 per cent for two-year notes, 6.3 per cent for five-year paper, and 6.4 per cent for 10-year bonds. Any easing by the Bundesbank should relieve some of the tensions within the ERM and allow members to cut their domestic interest rates. Attention is likely to focus on the French government bond market in particular. The French franc managed to survive the intense speculative pressure seen during the second half of 1992, and the government has repeatedly stressed its commitment to closer monetary ties with Germany. Many economists expect the franc to come under renewed pressure at the start of this year, and views appear mixed on whether it can survive as a member of the ERM without a devaluation. Some economists point out that France enjoys such favourable economic fundamentals, with low inflation and a trade surplus, that it could cut interest rates independently of the Bundesbank. 'However, fears of a devaluation suggest that investors will continue to demand a premium on the franc. As a result, the Bank of France is unlikely to act prematurely as it could undermine credibility and weaken the franc,' said DKB International. Nevertheless, economists do expect to see a drop in French government bond yields by the end of 1993, with two-year bond yields ranging between 6.5 per cent (according to Midland Montagu) and 7.4 per cent (Nomura Research Institute), while 30-year yields are expected to be between 7.2 per cent (UBS Phillips &amp; Drew) and 8.05 per cent (Deutsche Bank).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mary Binks, Political Editor] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten has again vented his  frustration over almost two years of protracted negotiations on  the financing of the new airport. The negotiations--already  deadlocked--have become a casualty of the Sino-British fall-out  over political reform.    "What would help us a great deal is to be in a situation in  which we didn't feel as though we're playing darts blindfold in  the dark, hoping to hit the bull's-eye," he said.    "What would be a help would be if the Chinese side gave  precisely what funding arrangements they would regard as  acceptable.    "These funds would help in the future of the Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government the community here in  Hong Kong and for the railway and the airport itself."    Patten voiced concern that the airport negotiations were  becoming bogged down by obscure political bickering and he again  urged the Chinese to return to the negotiating table. "We could  rapidly resolve all that I would have hoped in the airport  committee if the will was there."    It is now unlikely the airport project will be completed by  mid- 1997, but rather months after the transfer of sovereignty.    "Instead of offering one another advice across the airwaves,  we should actually do what people in Hongkong would like us to  do which is to resolve these questions around the table," he  said.</p>

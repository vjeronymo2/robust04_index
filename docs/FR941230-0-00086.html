			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council suggested that, assuming a 0-percent release mortality, the size limit increase would reduce the numbers of red snapper by 48 percent from 1993 harvest levels. They state that this would offset any increase in mean weight of each fish due to the larger size limit. The Council's letter also noted that charter vessel and headboat operators have stated that the five-fish bag limit will reduce demand for fishing trips, thereby offsetting an increase in harvest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, one of the signers of the second minority report opposing the seven-fish bag limit suggested a 13-inch (13.0 cm) minimum size limit to reduce the release mortality of undersized fish and the average weight of each fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS does not agree that simply changing the size limit would produce the necessary reduction in recreational harvest. The Council's statistician advised at the meeting that a seven-fish bag limit and 15-inch (38.1 cm) size limit would result in a harvest higher than the allocation, even under the most liberal conditions of zero release mortality and full compliance. The best available scientific information does not support the Council's position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The minority report opposing the regulatory amendment referenced a comment by a member of the Council's SAP that size limits were more effective than bag limits in supporting the recovery program. Furthermore, the report noted that public testimony to the Council indicated that size limit changes were more acceptable to the industry than reductions in bag limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The best available scientific information, as referenced on page 7 of the stock assessment, indicates that size limits alone are relatively ineffective in increasing yield per recruit or SPR. At this stage in the recovery of the overfished red snapper resource, a combination of more conservative size and bag limits is appropriate to reduce recreational harvest. For these reasons, NMFS disagrees with the comment and supports the more conservative size and bag limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three public comments opposed the proposed increase in the size limit as unnecessary, since the existing catch restrictions would continue to improve the red snapper resource.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Despite improvements in the status of the resource, red snapper still are overfished. Status quo, as suggested by the commenter, would allow continued overfishing of red snapper at a size that would jeopardize the rebuilding schedule. This, in turn, would adversely impact the biological integrity of the resource.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A letter from a charter vessel and headboat association suggested that an 8-million-pound (m lb) (3.63 m kg) total allowable catch (TAC) be implemented with a seven-fish recreational bag limit and 15-inch (38.1 cm) size limit. If continuation of the 6.0-m lb (2.72 m kg) TAC is necessary, the association suggested approval of the 15-inch (38.1 cm) size limit, a seven-fish bag limit for party boats and charter vessels (zero bag limit for operators and crews), and a five-fish bag limit for other recreational fishermen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second minority report objecting to the Council's vote for a seven-fish bag limit contended that, due to the uncertainty in the analyses, the TAC could be raised to as high as 8.0 m lb (3.63 m kg) with a 13-inch (33.0 cm) size limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The framework procedure indicates that TAC may not exceed allowable biological catch (ABC). Based on data in the assessment and the FMP's rebuilding schedule, the SAP set the upper range of the ABC range at 6.0 m lb (2.72 m kg). The Council's SEP recommended that the 6.0-m lb (2.72 m kg) upper limit be established as the ABC. Based on the SAP and SEP recommendations, the Council proposed a continuation of the 6.0-m lb (2.72 m kg) TAC at the upper end of the ABC range. The 6.0-m lb (2.72 m kg) TAC approved for 1995 is consistent with the rebuilding program for red snapper, and within the constraints of the framework procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The best available scientific information supports an increase in the minimum size limit to 15 inches (38.1 cm), not a decrease to 13 inches (33.0 cm). Moreover, increasing the TAC to 8.0 m lb (3.63 m kg) would be in excess of the boundaries of the ABC range. NMFS therefore disagrees with these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Headboat and Charter Vessel Operator and Crew Catch Prohibition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council requested rescission of the zero bag limit it had proposed for charter vessel and headboat operators and crew because of NMFS' evaluation that it would not result in any significant additional savings not already accounted for by the other management proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Twenty-one public comments opposed the zero bag limit, stating that it was unfair to charter vessel and headboat operators and crew.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

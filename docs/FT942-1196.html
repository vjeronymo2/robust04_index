			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Judge's ruling reopens dam row A leading UK pressure group yesterday won the first round in a legal battle to halt Britain's funding of Malaysia's Pergau dam project. The World Development Movement, a pressure group on Third World issues, was granted its application for a judicial review of the decision by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to fund the project. The group is calling for the review on the grounds that the offer of Pounds 234m for the dam broke British law, which states that aid money can only be spent on beneficial economic projects. Lawyers for the group are also pressing the High Court to block the Pounds 200m that is yet to be paid to the Malaysian government under the agreement signed by Mr Hurd. Mr Ben Jackson, the campaign co-ordinator, said the decision by Mr Justice Auld to grant the application was 'a major victory' for his movement. Mr Hurd's lawyers did not oppose the granting of leave for the application. But his counsel, Mr Stephen Richards, said the full hearing later this year would be contested 'with vigour'. The High Court decision re-opens the row over the funding of the Pergau dam at a time when the UK is anxious to restore trade relations with Malaysia. Much of the controversy over the project earlier this year was focused on whether the government had broken its own guidelines in 1988 by linking the offer of aid to a defence deal worth about Pounds 1bn. Mr Hurd has admitted there was a 'temporary entanglement' between the two deals but that they were both pursued separately later. The World Development Movement is challenging Mr Hurd on the broader point that his decision in 1991 to fund the project broke the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act. Mr Nigel Pleming QC, for the group, said that, under the act, aid could be given only 'for the purpose of promoting the development or maintaining the economy of a country or the welfare of its people'. Mr Hurd had been informed by his officials that the project was uneconomic. Sir Timothy Lankester, the former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, told the foreign secretary that the dam was an 'abuse of the aid programme', but was overruled by Mr Hurd on the basis of 'wider considerations'. The group acknowledged that because it is not a charity, it would need substantial donations from the public to proceed with the case.</p>

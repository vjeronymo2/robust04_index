			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Prepared for a purge French opposition leaders will be tempted to celebrate their likely election victory at the end of this month by purging state industry of the company chairmen most loyal to the Socialists. It might seem curious that this is possible in a modern and competitive European economy, yet there is pressure on both sides of the right-wing RPR-UDF alliance to put supporters of the new government at the head of state companies before they are privatised. There is also the urge for revenge. The conservatives have not forgotten the wholesale management changes staged by the Socialists during the nationalisations after their 1981 election victory. Heads have rolled, though not so many, after each change of power since then. The prospect is said to have brought decision-making in some state groups to a near halt, for fear that a new chairman might follow a different strategy. Foreign partners are worried, notably Volvo, which is keeping its fingers crossed that there will no change in the management of Renault, the government-owned carmaker in which it holds a 20 per cent stake. Mr Edouard Balladur, tipped as a leading prime ministerial candidate for the conservative RPR, has told his team that he does not want a witch-hunt. He is sensitive to the fact that French state industry's foreign competitors suffer no such political risk. Whether moderates like him get their way depends on the election results. Even though the outcome is not clear, the vulnerable company chiefs are: Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf Aquitaine, the oil group which is France's largest company in terms of turnover. The right is thought unlikely to want to leave a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand in charge of this strategically important company. The previous conservative government kicked Mr Le Floch- Prigent out of his last state industry job, as chairman of Rhone-Poulenc in 1986 and might drop him again, to the applause of his enemies at the influential Treasury, but possibly to the alarm of his private sector shareholders. Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's largest banks. He is blamed for the bank's high-risk expansion and its exposure to embarrassing problems such as Hollywood's MGM studios, which have frustrated right-wing hopes of a quick privatisation for Credit Lyonnais. Mr Haberer's close links with Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, count against him, though he also has highly placed friends on the right. Mr Rene Thomas, chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris. His management is respected, but Mr Thomas, 64, is due to retire at the end of the year, offering the right a convenient opportunity to hand this important job to a supporter. Shadows are hanging over the futures of Mr Gilles Menage, a former chief of staff to Mr Mitterrand, who now runs Electricite de France, and over Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, the biggest state insurer. Also at risk are Mr Alain Gomez, the Socialist appointee who has run Thomson, the troubled electronics group for the past 11 years, making him the longest-surviving chairman of a state-owned group, and Mr Yves Lyon-Caen, chairman of the Credit National bank and a close colleague of former Socialist prime minister Mr Michel Rocard.</p>

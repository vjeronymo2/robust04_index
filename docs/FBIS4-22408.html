			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ajarian Supreme Council Chairman Aslan </F> Abashidze by SARKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA Correspondent Gia Chelidze,  Batumi: "`Where is Aslan?!'": date not given]    [Text] Our people are again focusing their attention  on the result of Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze's  recent visit to Turkey, the political documents that were signed  in Ankara, and the package of economic and cultural cooperation  agreements designed to foster good-neighborly relations and  cooperation between our two countries.    The Georgian delegation included Ajarian Supreme  Council Chairman Aslan Abashidze.    [Abashidze] I will say from the outset that this first  official visit marks a new stage in our country's history and  relations, which will certainly yield solid, practical results.    As far as history is concerned.... You yourself know how  troubled our two countries' relations have been over the  centuries. There was more darkness than light, but times have  changed. We are all gratified now about this sharp turnaround in  our relations, as reflected in the visit to independent Georgia  by Turkey's present president (who was the Prime Minister then)  Suleiman Demirel. He was the first to announce out loud,  "Georgia and Turkey must have not only friendly but brotherly  relations."    This was followed by 50 million dollars' worth of credit for  Georgia, wheat, humanitarian aid, and so on. Turkey was the  first to extend a helping hand to us.    I will not attempt to describe the wonderful reception our  head of state got in Turkey; that has already been reported. I  will try to single out a few highlights.    Shevardnadze's great popularity and respect in Turkey was  something we felt a half hour before we were to land in Ankara,  when our airplane was met by an honor escort consisting of four  of the Turkish Air Force's Phantoms escorted to Ankara airport.  It was an impressive sight.    Before that, we, the people and leaders of Ajaria, counted  it  a real honor when the head of state's airplane made a major  change in its route to land in Batumi so the Ajarian delegation  could join. This fact places a great responsibility on us in the  future, and we will try to reciprocate.    Earlier, again by way of Batumi, a "working group" headed by  Batoni Zurab Kervalishvili headed to Turkey; in Batumi we looked  over the programs together, to which we contributed our own  proposals as well. For example, Batumi was also added to the  housing plan; it had not been included. Naturally, this carries  considerable political weight, because our two countries'  relations begin at the border, in this case from Sarpi and  Batumi. This is a very important factor.    The lavish ceremony that was put on in front of Turkey's  presidential palace in honor of Batoni Eduard was most  impressive, a confirmation of the esteem the hosts hold our  outstanding political leader in. And wasn't it the same in  Germany, China, and elsewhere? As I watched, I felt a mixture of  pride and regret, thinking what strange and ungrateful people we  Georgians are: even today, hardly anybody in the world knows  about Georgia, but just mention the name of Shevardnadze and...  everything falls into place.    But are we making use of the Shevardnadze factor? Quite the  contrary: it is as if we are sacrificing Georgia's great  opportunities today to certain persons' individual and party  interests. Forgive the awkward comparison, but even a soccer  team, if it is in trouble, will go to any lengths to buy someone  who will take charge and help it win. Not us: instead of making  use of this big factor, we have yet to show him anything but  pain, distrust, abuse, and ungratefulness. It is sad, but "a  prophet is without honor in his own country...." If other  countries had a man like him, they would probably have stood the  world on its ear by now and made their own country into an Eden  instead of building state policy on personal sympathies and  antipathies.    Please consider this a lyrical digression.    [Chelidze] Your recent statement about supporting the  Georgian Citizens' Alliance made your position clear once more.    [Abashidze] I'm not the kind of man to shout about it every  day, but I have said more than once: the head of state needs the  kind of faithful allies who will stand by him in deed rather  than in words. We ourselves, and the whole population of Ajaria,  have done everything we could. In our recent interview we  acquainted readers with the relevant documents, but that's not  the main thing. The point is how to help the country, how to put  the economy back on its feet, how to renew the rebuilding  process. This is what we had in mind two years ago when we  created the Ajaria Revival Alliance with the slogan "Georgia  Above All." This new stage of relations with Turkey holds  promise for Georgia and for Ajaria, which directly borders on  Turkey.    Keep in mind, moreover, that many of our brothers, our close  relatives, live and work in Turkey. The two days we were in  Ankara, our whole diaspora practically camped in our hotel. You  should have seen how delighted they were, how much they wanted  to help and cooperate with us.    One of them was a close relative of mine, my grandfather's  nephew, General Akhmed Adzhari [name transliterated], a well  known Turkish military man and industrialist. He now holds a  high position in Turkey's military-industrial complex, which  also includes other leading sectors of the economy. He has come  to Batumi a number of times, and he asked me to introduce him to  our head of state, which I did in Ankara. This time as well he  had some interesting projects and proposals for us.    We didn't go empty-handed either. We had a number of  interesting projects with us. We want to build a large milling  combine, a high-rise complex, and a power plant to supply  electricity to both sides. We are planning a joint shipbuilding  project based in Batumi's Shipbuilding Plant, to build  river-maritime ships. I think this will strengthen and improve  the quality of Georgia's maritime shipping.    During our visit, they asked me to stay in Turkey a few days  and see with my own eyes the plants which we have agreements  with firms there to build. Plans call for building and starting  up joint garment and wood processing enterprises.    We will probably know in the first quarter of this year how  practical the implementation of these agreements is.    [Chelidze] For decades we waited for things to be brought to  us on a platter. Maybe that has made us what we are  today--inert, apathetic, lacking initiative and so on and so  forth.    [Abashidze] You are right. That's the way it was, but not  any  longer. The economic and cultural cooperation package that was  signed during our official visit to Turkey opens up the way. Now  it is up to our businessmen and business circles to see how  skillfully we take advantage of these opportunities for our  country's sake, how well we prepare new projects and carry them  out. Hence, every ministry, firm, and organization will have to  get busy and design projects which will serve our country's as  well as the departments' interests.    Preparing projects is no easy matter, however. It has to be  preceded by considerable preparation. We need experienced and  knowledgeable specialists, but, sad to say, we have very few. So  we will have to import them from other countries, making use of  our head of state's enormous prestige to do so. No one will  refuse him, and we can always trust and rely on specialists he  invites in.    I would like to emphasize one thing. In Turkey, both the  head  of state and I had opportunities to meet with Turkish  businessmen. They offered the kinds of projects and proposals to  us which we are sending our own specialists to other countries  for.    This means that we lack information, we don't know what's  going on in the civilized world in certain sectors.    [Chelidze] When you came home from England and Europe last  summer, you cancelled several of your decisions.    [Abashidze] You just have to do that when you find that a  contract is disadvantageous. We must admit that we are not yet  well versed in the details and nuances of the market economy, so  we have to do everything necessary to train knowledgeable cadres  as soon as possible.    I don't know about other people, but when I talk to foreign  businessmen now I can't help feeling cautious, because I know  that a real professional tries to turn negotiations to his own  advantage. If you are incompetent and don't have up-to-date  information, well....    Right now, most of our businessmen don't even know how to  talk to foreigners in order to make the right deal. So we will  have problems until we have gone through the labyrinth of the  market economy.    [Chelidze] Any trip or official visit, of course, not only  includes diplomatic meetings but also events that are pleasant  just to reminisce about later on.    [Abashidze] Of course. Let me start with this pleasant  recollection. During one reception, I found myself between  Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and the wife of President  Demirel. What better chance could a man wish for? For several  hours I laid out for the Prime Minister all the problems we are  trying to solve. I talked about future projects and proposals.  Ms Ciller was so interested that she immediately summoned her  apparatus's officials and ministries to the banquet table and  gave them specific instructions, according to which our  specialists and their Turkish colleagues will collaborate on  projects and proposals which the prime minister submits to them.  Ms Ciller also promised to study these projects herself, and she  will come to Georgia this spring and also visit Ajaria. That is  her desire. She has very warm feelings for Georgia, as do the  president and his wife.    As for strange episodes, they started when I set my watch on  Turkish time as we arrived, and was therefore an hour late.  Batoni Eduard was waiting for me at the Residence. As a result,  the signing ceremony was delayed. I was horrified. I realized,  of course, what had happened, but what could I do. That was one.  For some reason, Batoni Eduard was always looking for me. I kept  hearing him say, "Where is Aslan, where is Aslan?"    I don't know; anyone who knows me knows I have no trouble  walking or running. But our head of state goes so fast I  couldn't keep up with him and often fell behind. I noticed how  fast our head of state walks back in our own country, in  mountainous Khulo. He sprained his foot there, but I still  couldn't keep up. I thought to myself, maybe in these carpeted  halls he'll walk a little slower, but I swear....    "Where is Aslan?", Batoni Eduard would say, and delegation  members and guards, who sometimes broke the protocol rules  themselves, would make a path for me so I could catch up. Even  when I was late or got behind, he always greeted me with a smile.    He never said a word of reproach, but I would have preferred  that, because at such times a smile seems like more of a  punishment.    The visit ended, and we happily left Turkey's hospitable  land, taking with us the hope and belief that Georgia and Turkey  really will begin a new stage, a breakthrough, a stage of  brotherhood which will benefit our peoples and Georgia.</p>

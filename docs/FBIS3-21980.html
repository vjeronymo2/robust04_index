			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "special correspondent" Humberto Saccomandi in </F> Rome]    [Excerpt] Antonio Carlos Amorim, the Rio de Janeiro Court  of Justice president, on 10 March recanted the charges he had  made previously on illegal foreign financing for a Brazilian  political party. He emphasized that he does not have any  evidence but only a report from a "respectable" person.    Nevertheless, Amorim believes money actually is entering  Brazil illegally and being used to finance politicians.  Reportedly, the financing mainly comes from Italy, but also from  France, Germany, and even Poland. He noted that he is not aware  of the party that reportedly benefited from this financing. If I  were aware, Amorim said, "I would not have to ask the Italian  courts for help." On 8 March, Amorim hinted he actually was  aware of the party involved. He said: "It is a party that might  gain power in October."    The judge denied that he had stressed that the money came  from Mafia criminal activities or from drug trafficking  activities. In remarks to Brazilian journalists at the Vitorio  Mele attorney general's hall in Rome, Amorim on 10 March said:  "I never said that." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F> domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in  Manila -- live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the Korean summit, you're  familiar with the developments? The two heads of state  concerned, the president of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea and the Republic of Korea -- President Kim Il-song and  President Kim Yong-sam, respectively -- have agreed to meet in  Pyongyang late July after some preliminary conferences by  subordinate officials. And I would like to see this as opening  up a new era of regional stability in the Asia-Pacific region.  I therefore convey our admiration for the two Korean leaders  for showing statesmanship in pursuing the path of peace rather  than the path of belligerent confrontation. You will recall that  this has been our consistent policy at the height of the nuclear  confrontation in the Korean peninsula, and even before.    Questions so far?    I also would like to inform everyone that I am satisfied  with  the conclusion of the first round of negotiations between the  Philippines and Indonesia on the delimiting, or the  identification, of our maritime boundary. And I would like to  point out that this opens up some opportunities for us to have,  perhaps, a fishing agreement and thereby eliminate previous  difficulties and confrontations which have taken place in the  absence of such agreements.

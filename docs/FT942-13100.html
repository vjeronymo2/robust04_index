			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / France takes the offence out of D-Day France yesterday unveiled its secret weapon to win its diplomatic battle to mark the 50th anniversary of the allied landings on the beaches of Normandy without offending Germany, its erstwhile enemy but bosom buddy of today. It is a 700-tonne 'memory machine', or metal pyramid, that will form the stage for 2,400 young actors to enact an allegory of war, peace and reconciliation in the Norman city of Caen on the night of June 6. Unveiling plans for the spectacle yesterday, Caen's mayor, Senator Jean-Marie Girault, said he hoped that it would send out 'a message of peace and hope', and that even young Germans would take part in it. Some German members of an international school in Berlin had already volunteered to do so, said Mr Girault, whose earlier plan to have Chancellor Helmut Kohl join allied leaders in Caen failed to win government endorsement. Outlining plans for his FFr30m (Pounds 3.5m) spectacular - a far cry from the 'spam-frittering' activities in Hyde Park originally envisaged as Britain's cultural contribution to the D-Day commemoration - Mr Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, the 36-year-old organiser, said the pyramid would initially be covered in green-for-peace verdure that, as the 60,000 spectators took their seats around it, would be stripped off gradually to mark the approach of war. Symbolising the onset of war, the pyramid would appear to crack up with red-lit fissures which would then sprout flames of lights to mark pockets of resistance as well as landing strips for allied aircraft. As for D-Day itself, the young actors pouring out of the top of the 16-metre high pyramid will represent paratroopers; those approaching its base the beach invaders. Having transformed itself into a cross-studded cemetery for the dead of all sides, the pyramid extravaganza will end with the rather more predictable release of white balloons. French television has complained that the spectacle is too difficult and too late in the evening to broadcast direct, but Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture minister, was yesterday confident of wide TV coverage. He added that among other events he was organising was a round-table discussion on the wartime allies' influence on Europe - a subject on which he is evidently ambivalent. Next week, Mr Toubon will be presenting the national assembly with his bill to promote the use of French, and restrict that of English, in French public life.</p>

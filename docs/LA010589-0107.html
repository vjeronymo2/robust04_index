			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TIES 1991 TALKS TO SOVIET RIGHTS PROGRESS;  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE SEES CONFERENCE OK AS A MOVE TO KEEP KREMLIN ON COURSE  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration said Wednesday that the participation of the United  States in a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991 will depend on continued  Soviet movement toward international human rights standards.  </P> <P> Formally announcing President Reagan's decision to approve participation in the  meeting, along with U.S. representation at human rights conferences this year  in Paris and next year in Copenhagen, a White House spokesman said that the  decision is seen as a means of encouraging the Soviet Union to continue on the  course it has chosen over the last three years. In that time, emigration has  been allowed to increase significantly and the jamming of Western radio  broadcasts to the Soviet Union has ceased.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union now has a unique opportunity to take further action to  demonstrate its continuing and irreversible commitment to achieve commonly  accepted human rights standards," said Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman  Popadiuk.  </P> <P> The decision, perhaps one of the last major ones regarding the Soviet Union  that Reagan will make during his presidency, reflects the distance the  President has traveled in his view of the Soviets, as well as the underlying  suspicion with which he continues to regard them.  </P> <P> Reagan, who took office eight years ago viewing the Soviet Union as an "evil  empire," remains skeptical of Soviet intentions. He said three weeks ago that,  despite the "heady, inspiring" progress made, "we've got to proceed by watching  whether deeds match the words."  </P> <P> But by announcing that U.S. representatives would take part in a human rights  conference in Moscow, clearly a potential public relations victory for the  Soviet Union, the President was giving a diplomatic pat on the back to the  Kremlin leadership, although his decision could be reversed at any time during  the next two years by the incoming Administration of President-elect George  Bush.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reviewed Decision  </P> <P> A Bush spokesman said in Washington that "we were consulted and aware of this  announcement." He added that before the decision was made, the Reagan  Administration reviewed it with the President-elect, his secretary of  state-designate, James A. Baker III, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's choice for  national security adviser.  </P> <P> The human rights conferences would bring together representatives of the  members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. The  meetings would be part of the continuing Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe, which began in Helsinki, Finland, in 1975.  </P> <P> Speaking with reporters in Beverly Hills while Reagan wound up a nearly  two-week vacation at his new home in Bel-Air, Popadiuk said that the President  decided to accept the schedule of human rights conferences, beginning in Paris  later this year, "as a means of encouraging continuation of the significant  progress in human rights that has taken place in the Soviet Union over the past  three years."  </P> <P> The spokesman singled out "the release of hundreds of political prisoners and  exit permission for many people long refused the right to emigrate."  </P> <P> U.S. officials have said in Moscow that the United States would accept about  50,000 to 60,000 Soviet emigres this year -- perhaps twice the number who  arrived in the United States in 1988 -- reflecting the upsurge in departures  from the Soviet Union. And, in another human rights issue often cited in the  past by the United States, the jamming of the Voice of America, Radio Liberty  and other Western broadcasts has been halted.  </P> <P> Popadiuk described as "crucial" new laws respecting individual liberties that  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to establish as well as "the  institutionalization of reform."  </P></p>

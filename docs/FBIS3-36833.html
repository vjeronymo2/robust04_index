They Will Go Ahead,  Although the Liberal Democratic Party, the Communist Party, and  the Democratic Party Oppose Them"]    [Text] The State Duma tried to interfere in the  preparations for local elections but failed once again: None of  the three draft resolutions on local elections got the requisite  majority of votes yesterday. All three documents were sent to  be further reworked which, according to deputies' estimates,  will last for at least a week. This means that preparation for  the elections has been left to the local authorities. The  glaring violations already observed in a number of regions will  apparently never be rectified.    In 64 Russian Federation components, local elections have  been set for various dates in March and in another three for  April. Boris Yeltsin's October edict defined merely the "basic  guidelines," leaving the elaboration of the final procedures to  the discretion of regional authorities (in fact the governors).    The greatest public response has been evoked by the  limitations of the franchise in the form of residence and  professional qualifications introduced by Anatoliy Sobchak in  St. Petersburg: Yet now it appears that his example has been  followed by authorities in other regions. Furthermore, Duma  experts say that in many regions the rights of observers have  been limited. In Tula Oblast, the deputy administration chief  has appropriated the right to appoint part of the deputies to  the representative body.    Two draft resolutions out of the three -- submitted by the  Duma's committees on regional policy and local self-government  and the Yabloko bloc -- invited the president "to take measures  to correct the violation of citizens' voting rights." The third  -- from the Liberal Democratic Party -- proposed to cancel the  elections altogether. All three were defeated.    The debate, however, showed a curious distribution of votes.  The idea of holding the elections but with a revised procedure  has been supported by Women of Russia, Yabloko, and the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord [PRES]. The Zhirinovskiy followers,  the communists, and the Travkin party want to call off the  elections, in spite of the fact that forecasts are promising the  "restorationists" success in many regions. As for the  reformers, the Russia's Choice leader in confidential  conversations with journalists was rather pessimistic. PRES  deputy Anatoliy Sliva attributed the communists' and liberal  democrats' mood to their hopes for coming to power in the  capital, riding on the crest of a wave brought about by economic  collapse this coming summer, and therefore they do not consider  it reasonable to change authority at the local level.    It is perfectly clear, however, that local elections will be  held as scheduled, regardless of the mood in the deputy corps.  But, as Yabloko deputy Vyacheslav Igrunov noted, the elections  "could have looked more decent but it seems that we have missed  the chance."</p>

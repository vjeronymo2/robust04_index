			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Food retail shares hit by Sainsbury statement Shares dipped across the food retailing sector yesterday after J Sainsbury, the market leader, revealed a fall in margins and like-for-like sales, expressed caution over its profits and said it was making a Pounds 365m property write-down. The statement took the City by surprise and provided further evidence of a new era in the food retailing industry of slower profits growth and physical expansion amid increasingly fierce price competition. Sainsbury's revealed an increase of only 4.6 per cent in total sales for the 16 weeks to January 15, and, crucially, a 1 per cent fall in like-for-like sales - which exclude new stores - with no sales inflation. That was in spite of Sainsbury's 'Essential for essentials' campaign, launched in October. That involved cutting the price of 300 own-label goods which, Sainsbury's admitted, knocked 0.4 percentage points off its gross margin. Its comment contrasted sharply with competitors such as Tesco, Asda, and Gateway, which have all seen increases in like-for-like sales after cutting prices. Sainsbury's warned its profits would be 'adversely affected' and it expected only a small increase over last year - before accounting changes announced yesterday. Those included a decision to depreciate buildings by 2 per cent a year - following similar moves by Argyll and Tesco - and a revised depreciation policy on fixtures and equipment, resulting in a recurring depreciation charge of Pounds 40m. There will also be a Pounds 365m non-recurring write-down on property, after Sainsbury's admitted many of its sites were no longer worth what it paid for them. Tesco made a similar move last week, but chose to depreciate the cost over 25 years. Sainsbury's had insisted until recently there was no need to revalue its properties, but Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said it had responded to pressure from the City. 'We wanted to clear the decks, to be whiter than white, so that there could be no possible doubt over the quality of our earnings in future,' he said. But Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco, is not cutting back on its expansion programme, and plans to open 20 superstores a year for four years. Beyond that, the pace might slow. The group also plans to accelerate expansion of its other retail chains, Savacentre, Homebase, and Shaws in the US, which turned in stronger performances than the superstore chain. Mr Sainsbury said he believed the group could now hold its gross margin - a claim questioned by analysts - because its 'essentials' campaign made it cheaper than other superstore chains, and had removed the price advantage of discounters such as Aldi and Netto.</p>

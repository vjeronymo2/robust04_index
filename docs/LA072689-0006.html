			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TIME TO GET YOUR NICKEL'S WORTH'  </P> <P> Hooray for writing a terrific editorial on July 13 in support of state Sen.  Gary Hart's (D-Santa Barbara) bill, SB 1221, which will raise the redemption  rate on bottles and cans. Because of your editorial, I have written to my  assemblyman and state senator asking them to support Hart's bill.  </P> <P> I am trying to do my part to help clean up litter.  </P> <P> JENNIFER ROSE OHANIAN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

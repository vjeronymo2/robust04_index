			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (1): Strengths reassert themselves - The state may have started to take its prosperity for granted, says Tony Jackson. In which case, the downturn will have had a salutary effect It has been a tough six years for the state of Massachusetts. Between 1988 and 1992, it suffered more job losses in proportion to its size than any US state since the great depression. For the home of the so-called high-tech Massachusetts Miracle - and the seat of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)  - the blow to morale was profound. Now, however, the state's defenders claim that its native strengths are reasserting themselves: Massachusetts, they say, is climbing back. To appreciate their case, it helps to recall what went wrong in the first place. Mr Wayne Ayers, chief economist of the Bank of Boston, says: 'The years of the so-called Massachusetts Miracle (in the 1980s) were an aberration. It was a confluence of one-off factors.' Chief of those was the build-up of defence spending under President Ronald Reagan. Although Massachusetts' technological base is impressive in breadth as well as depth, by the start of the 1980s the defence industry had come to assume an unhealthy dominance. For decades, MIT's research activities were skewed by government defence funding. Raytheon, the defence giant which makes the Patriot missile, is the state's biggest private-sector employer. When defence spending passed its peak in 1987, trouble was inevitable. It did not help that another integral part of the so-called miracle, Massachusett's computer industry, was in the wrong part of the market. Its biggest companies, Digital Equipment and Wang, were concentrating on the mini-computer just as the personal computer revolution was getting under way. While the state was, and remains, a seedbed for small-company innovation in information technology, by the end of the 1980s it was better known for its stumbling giants. The prosperous years had one further malign effect: in a small, compact state like Massachusetts, property prices went through the roof. By 1987 all the warning signs were there: the proportion of the Massachusetts workforce employed in construction, for instance, was among the highest in the country. The result, in 1989, was a property collapse. All this led to a period of serious introspection. Professor Michael Porter, of the Harvard Business School, says: 'There were grave doubts about the future of the Massachusetts economy. We had the lowest credit rating of any state. It was felt there was something deeply wrong in a structural sense, analogous to the loss of the textile industry in the past.' A recent document * bearing the imprint of Massachusetts Governor William Weld - in which Professor Porter also had a hand - develops the point. In the late 18th century, it observes, Massachusetts enjoyed a burst of prosperity through Boston's dominance of American shipping; then, in the early 19th century, it was overhauled by the Port of New York. Again, it gained a commanding lead in a wide range of manufacturing in the late 19th century, only to lose its competitive edge to cheap southern labour by the 1920s. In that context, the loss of momentum in the late 1980s could be seen as deeply serious. The high-tech boom, which had its origins in the start-up companies around Boston's Route 128, represented a third wave of prosperity for Massachusetts. In other words, the normal pattern of recession and recovery may not apply. 'A more relevant consideration,' says the document, 'is whether the high-tech boom has ended in Massachusetts, or merely stumbled badly.' In Prof Porter's own view, the latter is true. 'What is unique about this state is that it's a remarkable engine for new business creation. New companies emerge with enormous frequency, not just in new industries but in textiles and apparels. In fact, this is an economy with enormous strength which has been weighed down by public policy.' This is an important point for advocates of the Massachusetts economy. In effect, they say, the state started to take its prosperity for granted. The downturn has thus had a salutary effect, especially in prompting its various constituencies - business, government, the universities - to co-ordinate a 1990s-style industrial policy. 'This state is a very interesting story which gets repeated around the world,' Prof Porter says. 'It starts from strength: we inherited Harvard and MIT and a pool of capital and financial institutions, and when the high-tech revolution started in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this state was in the right position. But as wealth was created, forces were triggered which started to erode that environment: regulation, taxes, anti-business sentiment.' However, he argues, Massachusetts was paradoxically lucky in being very early into recession. 'Texas came first with the downturn in oil, then us with real estate. A number of dominoes then started falling into place. A lot of the state's political leaders understood that we couldn't deal with our social problems if we weren't making money. So we got a pro-business governor and state legislature; and since this is a small state, we were able to make big headway in a relatively short time.' Much of this has involved the state government's working closely with business leaders. Prof Porter, who chairs a body called the Governor's Council on Economic Growth, says: 'We've gone one by one through industry clusters, saying 'Let's find out what government is doing to make life difficult, and let's change it.'' At the same time, Massachusetts has benefited from cyclical recovery in the US economy, and particularly from a prolonged period of low interest rates. The combined result, says Mr Ayers, of the Bank of Boston, is that the economy is now in better shape than anyone would have thought possible a couple of years ago. In the period 1988-92, Massachusetts lost 600,000 jobs. 'Two years ago, people were saying it would take until the turn of the century to get those jobs back. But just over a third of them have come back already. In percentage terms, Massachusetts is now slightly better than average: unemployment in the country is 6 per cent, and we're below that.' Partly, he admits, that is because many people lost heart in the depths of the downturn and migrated out of the state. 'But still, nobody would have believed two years ago that we'd be close to the national average, let alone below it.' There is still one cloud on the horizon. The healthcare industry employs even more people in the state than the defence industry. Through the late 1980s, this was one sector which remained robust. Now, healthcare spending is under fire throughout the US. Mr Ayers is fairly sanguine about this. 'Healthcare won't be the prop that it was, but it shouldn't be a drag either.' A recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston partly bears him out: granted that the healthcare industry will have to cut costs, it says that represents a saving for local employees and individuals. Above all, Mr Ayers agrees with Prof Porter on the importance of small companies in the Massachusetts economy. 'The concentration of higher education means this place is still an incubator of small high-tech firms. Many of these were growing throughout the downturn, though not by enough to offset the big hits in defence and computers.' Nevertheless, the revival of Massachusetts as a manufacturing centre seems to have been relatively short-lived. 'Virtually all the job growth we've seen here has been in services,' Mr Ayers says. 'These jobs are not flipping hamburgers or taking in each other's laundry. But we have continued to lose jobs in manufacturing since a decade ago.' There are signs that this may be bottoming out, he says. 'But this is still a high-cost place to manufacture. And software and biotech companies tend to be small, cerebral outfits which will never be big manufacturing employers in the way the mini-computer industry was.' Perhaps, though, the last word should go to one of the academics who provide the backbone for Massachusetts' high-tech industry. Professor Merton Flemings, head of materials science and engineering at MIT, says simply: 'Whatever effect the drop in the economy had is long gone in my memory. We see great strength here, and growing strength.' * Choosing To Compete: a statewide strategy for job creation and economic growth (Executive Office of Economic Affairs, Massachusetts).</p>

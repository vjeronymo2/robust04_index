			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Fixed rate changes IN THE WAKE of the cut in the banks' base rate to 8 per cent yesterday, rates on fixed rate mortgages are already starting to fall. Barclays Bank is offering first time buyers a one year capped rate mortgage at 7.99 per cent (APR 8.4 per cent). The borrower can chose the repayment method. A second mortgage offers 8.99 per cent (9.5 per cent APR) fixed for three years for first time buyers and customers moving home. Both involve a Pounds 250 fee. For repayment mortgages, customers must take out life assurance with the bank. Halifax Building Society has been slow to enter the fixed rate mortgage market but this week unveiled an offer fixed until January 31 1995. But having initially set the rate at 8.45 per cent, it yesterday responded to the base rate cut by cutting it to 7.99 per cent (10.2 per cent APR). The maximum loan is 95 per cent of the lower of purchase price or valuation, except for remortgages, where the ceiling is 85 per cent. There is a fee of Pounds 250 and a redemption penalty of three months' interest. Citibank Mortgage revised its fixed rate offers in the wake of the base rate cut. It now offers three year fixed rate mortgages at 8.75 per cent for up to 85 per cent of the value of the property (95 per cent for an extra 0.25 per cent payment). The fee is Pounds 245. The Gold One Year Capped mortgage offers a rate no higher than 7.49 per cent until January 1994. There is a fee of Pounds 145. A two year cap offers a ceiling of 8.49 per cent. Building/contents insurance is compulsory.</p>

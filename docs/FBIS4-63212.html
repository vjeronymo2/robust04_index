			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Foreign Ministers Andrey  Kozyrev and Alain Juppe noted during their Thursday evening  talks here that Russia and France were closely cooperating in  the effort to settle international crises. The negotations  confirmed the desire of both sides to "step up the political  dialogue", which was noted by the French foreign minister during  his interview with ITAR-TASS on the eve of the visit.    A hot line will be opened shortly between the Kremlin and  the  Elysee Palace. It will help the presidents of the two countries  to hold important and urgent consultations whenever necessary.  The two foreign ministers signed a corresponding agreement  after a talk which lasted for two and a half hours. But already  now, the coordination of actions between the sides is very  close, especially when it comes to protecting the interests of  their citizens.    Thus, the Russian Foreign Ministry has highly appreciated  the  French assistance during the evacuation of Russian citizens from  Yemen. Juppe told journalists that Paris was grateful to Moscow  for its role in the liberation of French hostages, captured in  the Bosnian conflict zone.    The talk, Kozyrev said, has confirmed the importance of  permanent contacts at political level. The sides have discussed  several key problems, including the Russia-European Union  agreement, which is now in the making. The sides also touched  on the French proposal to conclude a "stability pact" in  Europe, which will be discussed at a conference in Paris next  week. They also discussed further approaches to the Bosnian  settlement.    The French minister described as "exemplary" the interaction  displayed by Moscow and Paris at present in their approaches to  the situation in former Yugoslavia. Both countries are actively  working on the Bosnian problem. Russia, the United States, and  the European Union were able to adopt a joint document a short  while ago. At present, the French minister believes, the sides  should not relax their pressure. It is necessary to further  exert joint influence on the sides involved in the Bosnian  conflict in order to make them stop the hostilities.    According to Juppe, France attaches great importance to  bilateral cooperation with Russia. It is striving to conduce  Russia's partnership with Europe in various European  institutions. Paris wants Russia to join the Council of Europe.  "We are also glad," the French minister noted, "that the  Atlantic union is ready to grant Russia within the Partnership  for Peace programme a status that would be in keeping with its  specific character."</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Police in Taiwan deported an American and a Canadian, both Taiwanese-born  dissidents advocating the island's independence from China, after the two  allegedly entered the country illegally. About 300 police surrounded Robert  Tsai, of Houston, and Leo Yi Shih, of Toronto, as they were driving to speak at  a seminar in Taipei organized by a private law foundation. Club-wielding police  used tear gas to disperse their supporters and pulled Tsai and Leo out of their  car. The two were taken directly to the airport and put aboard a departing  flight. Taiwan has barred Tsai and Leo from returning, saying they advocated  that Taiwan no longer claim to be part of China.  </P></p>

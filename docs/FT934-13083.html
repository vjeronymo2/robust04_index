			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / EC warns over market access The EC yesterday warned the US and Japan that the offer on market access for industrial products it put forward this week within the Uruguay Round world trade reform talks is conditional on similar offers from them. 'There has to be an equivalent response from our partners,' a senior EC Gatt negotiator said, insisting that the US in particular has much further to move on reducing 'peak tariffs' - or those above 15 per cent - by the 50 per cent agreed at last July's summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations. Another Commission official said the EC offer was 'a genuine attempt to unblock the market negotiations at this very late stage,' as the December 15 deadline for concluding the Round looms. It was not, he said, 'a finger-pointing exercise.' Nevertheless, the senior EC negotiator said the Community had 101 'peak tariffs,' against 663 for the US, 457 for Japan, and 918 for Canada. Although he acknowledged that 'the Americans have very high peaks in some sectors and no tariffs at all in others,' he underlined that in the US, 312 of these tariffs were over 20 per cent (against 11 in the EC), covering Ecu17bn (Pounds 13.19bn) of imports (against Ecu1.8bn in the EC. A senior US official said the US had offered to cut 53 per cent of its peak tariffs.</p>

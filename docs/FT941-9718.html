			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Gardening: The maniacs have taken over at the nursery - A garden centre that thrives on tidiness and teamwork I was under glass in a Midlands field, not far from Wolverhampton, as the rain drove in from the south-west. But who cares about the weather when hardy winter plants are flowering by the 100? Eight years ago, when Weekend FT was started, I went to the Midlands to look for an emerging market which might survive Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of the day. I thought I had found it at Ashwood Nurseries, at Kingswinford, north of Kidderminster, off the A449. They were making a name for their new Lewisias, small hardy plants which carry showers of flower in late spring and vary from the easy to the awkward. The place had quality and the management struck me as something special so I wrote and said so. Mrs Thatcher has now become Lady Thatcher but I still have my Ashwood Lewisias and many readers have turned up at that Midlands nursery with a crumpled page from an old FT. My discovery of garden centres was characteristically welcomed by Arthur Hellyer, the FT's gardening writer for more than 30 years, during the Chelsea flower show nearly two years ago. How I wish Arthur, who died in January last year, could have rediscovered this one with me. Three weeks ago, I was making an anti-clockwise tour of London's first flower show of the season. I was enjoying the specialists' Hellebores and admiring the winter greenery when I hit on the best exhibit of them all. Carpets of pink, white and magenta hardy cyclamen ran beneath winter prunus, witch hazel and a display of Lenten Roses and hybrid forms of Helleborus Orientalis. It seemed to have a height, colour and clearness of leaf which was new. Mid-winter seemed a mirage; even the Royal Horticultural Society judges gave the stand a gold medal. It turned out to be Ashwood Nurseries taking their fifth gold medal in their fifth RHS show. Following them back to base, I found that the news for gardeners was excellent. Since 1986, the nursery has grown 20-fold; it employs 53 people and its new initiatives are the gold-winning cyclamen and hellebores, built up in the last three years. The founder, John Massey, is the son of an engineer and recalls that his best subject at school was Latin. 'I am absolutely hopeless with money,' he assures me. 'I leave the bills entirely to the others; I haven't a clue about business rules, except that businesses which follow the rules seem to go broke.' He does not bother with a computer, and when he thought he had 300 stock plants of hardy cyclamen, Philip Baulk, his breeder-collaborator, had to point out that they already had more than 800. (I should add that Baulk has found no satisfactory system for automatic watering and every single plant is watered by hand.) This archaic enterprise has two irreplaceable assets that has enabled it to progress. It insists absolutely on top quality and immaculate tidiness, and devotional team work, seven days a week, from managers who are still in it for the sake of the plants and the customers, not the share option or the meaningless meeting. For years, hardy cyclamen have had their own expert society and hellebores have had some great breeders: Ashwood's team has now moved into these revered pastures, backed by their skill in Lewisias and the application of cash made from their nursery's general quality stock. Are the heroes of the hellebore rather uneasy, I asked, thinking of the Whites and their recent medals at Blackthorn in Hampshire; the legendary Helen Ballard, queen for years of the rounded flower without spots; and Elizabeth Strangman, author with Graham Rice of the best of the new hellebore books, just published by David &amp; Charles at Pounds 16.99. Ashwood's answer is that they have had no hard feelings. The reigning experts have passed on many of their best plants and are enjoying the results as new crosses extend the base which they have established. On visiting Ashwood, I think they have sensed what everyone does: the place is run by plant maniacs to whom you could not wish ill if you tried. Go and see it: the cyclamen coum and the Lenten hellebores ought to be good for this weekend and next. In late April, the Lewisias are flat out. They are 14-years-old in some cases and the stock has been increased by the owners' fact-finding visit to the plants' native Pacific homes in America. This year, 3,000 Hellebores, newly created from three-year-old crosses, have been sold at Pounds 5.95 each. Next year, the target is 10,000. The cyclamen, meanwhile, are sold through a seed list which is issued in June to those who write in with a stamp. The nursery grows seed for Suttons and sells the rest of it fresh for sowing in September. Its coum strain, supervised by Philip Baulk, is spectacular and completely hardy. If you sow it in September, you should have a thick range of seedlings up and showing by Christmas. The Hellebores are truly exciting. Lesser operations could only sell a few dozen from amateurs' stocks each year, but Ashwood has the staff and scale to go for a huge market. In their private houses, I saw whites, grey-purples, green and cream yellows and exquisite pinks quite apart from the sombre purples and blacks. I hate the doubles and John Massey is not too keen on them either. Spotted forms are charming, although purists have sometimes frowned on them: Ashwood whites with purple blotches promise to have a vigour and charm which was beginning to dwindle from some of the older experts' bloodlines. Outdoors, we can all grow these deep-rooting beauties which like to be left in peace. The old leaves should be cut off in spring when the new ones appear; they will tolerate shade, even in London, but they do not require it. They love to be fed repeatedly in spring and summer. In February they are heavenly, building into clumps which improve yearly, although mice have chewed my latest white's flowers. You can divide them, but divisions will take two or three years to settle in. You can also grow them in pots, where they look very tempting: Ashwood confirmed that you should only water them from the bottom by standing them in a saucer and watering it, not by watering the soil directly from above. I hope the place and its Hellebores break all the rules, except immaculate neatness, and continue to prove my one attempt at sector-analysis to be right. I also recall another Arthur Hellyer rule: great gardening enterprises tend to rely on pairs, each half of which needs the other. At Ashwood, Massey needs Baulk, the master breeder, and both will need Kevin, active with the Hellebores and Philip, who they snatched from a career servicing aircraft. They do not reckon much to horticultural college training: how can you teach a passion for plants? Could they also teach me tidiness? After brief consideration, they regretted that tidiness, too, was brought to the job, not learned on it.</p>

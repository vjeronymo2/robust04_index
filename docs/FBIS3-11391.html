And It Is"] </F>   [Text] Havana -- Gold, that highly coveted mineral which  has cost the life of more than one person, also benefits Cuba  with its presence in at least five of the country's regions, two  of which look like good prospects. The authorities see the new  possibility of gold production opening up for Cuba as a means of  diversifying national production and at the same time as another  source of revenue and another opportunity to trade with foreign  investors.    According to Jose Casa de Valle, technical director of the  Geological-Mining Union of Cuba, the possibilities of producing  the valuable metal in Cuba are excellent because he considers it  to be highly profitable, especially in the Pinar del Rio region  where the mining process has already begun.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official said they  expect to produce 300 kg in 1994 from the Castellanos deposit in  Pinar del Rio, in the western part of the country, and 500 kg  per year is expected in the near future.    He said a sulfometals [sulfometales] plant there was adapted  to obtain gold ingots through mass lixiviation. The final  product is 99.999-percent pure gold.    From that deposit, he added, 1 to 1.5 grams of gold per ton  are extracted, which is the average measure for gold.    He said they are conducting gold exploration and  exploitation  on their own, without foreign investments, at that plant. In the  case of polymetals [polimetales], such as lead, zinc, and other  minerals, however, we are exploring the Pinar del Rio zone with  help from foreign companies, mainly Canadian.    When asked about the participation of foreign companies in  the exploration and exploitation of minerals in the country,  Casa de Valle explained the island is divided into 37 blocks for  geological prospecting and more than 20 contracts have already  been signed with foreign investors, particularly Canadians, for  the random exploration of solid minerals.    That is also the case of Delita on the Isle of Youth; El  Descanso in Villa Clara, in the central part of the country;  Jobabo in eastern Camaguey Province; and Aguas Claras in Holguin.    The executive, with 27 years of experience in the field,  thinks the deposit at Delita is the most promising because,  according to geological studies, it is currently the largest ore  deposit in the country.    Notwithstanding, gold mining there is complicated because  the  mineral is mixed with large quantities of arsenic, an  undesirable element from every point of view.    He said: The exploitation of that deposit is being  negotiated  with foreign companies, and the research was carried out by  Cuban specialists.    He explained: We believe that if those investments are made  within two or three years, Delita will yield between 2.5 to 3  tons of gold per year.    He said the remaining deposits, El Descanso and Melonera, in  Villa Clara, are currently in the research phase. They are  relatively small but they have a high content of the mineral.    He thinks the region is the most promising as far as gold  discovery is concerned. Canadian companies are conducting  explorations at random there, but there is still no final  evaluation.    Casa de Valle reiterated that the prospects in that zone are  vast because conditions are similar to the deposit in Nevada,  United States, and Pueblo Viejo, in the Dominican Republic.    In referring to the Aguas Claras mine in eastern Holguin  Province, the specialist said negotiations are under way with  foreign companies to explore areas around that mine since it is  presumed it contains gold. Until recently, and even prior to  1959, molten gold was taken from that region to Pinar del Rio,  where it was processed. The reserve ran out some time ago,  however, and mining stopped.    Speaking about the island's gold prospects, which is so  useful in the electronic's industry because it is an excellent  electricity conductor and is rustproof, Casa de Valle said  mining and processing were highly profitable in Pinar del Rio  because investments there had been minimal (between $6 million  to $8 million). Delita is also considered profitable despite the  complexity of the zone, given its proximity to the sea. It  requires an investment of between $40 and $50 million but the  gold there could be exploited for at least 20 years. He said  that with these prospects, the country will soon become one of  Latin America's gold producers, led by Chile, Brazil, and Peru,  among other nations.</p>

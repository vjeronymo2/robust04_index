Sources in Beijing said  police and hospital authorities had allowed the 35-year-old  dissident, who has been staying at the 302 Military Hospital  since early last year, more "freedom of movement".    Two other dissidents are expected to be released or granted  medical bail in the coming fortnight in an apparent effort by  Beijing to secure Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status from  Washington. According to the veteran human rights lobbyist,  John Kamm, one of the three will be from outside Beijing. But  officials from the Foreign Ministry and Justice Ministry have  denied knowledge of any planned releases.    Sources in the capital said yesterday that Wang, who had  previously been confined to a well-guarded room, could now walk  freely around the hospital. Moreover, his rights to visits by  family members were now on a par with ordinary patients there.  "Food and medical supplies for Wang have generally improved, and  the relative freedom of movement recently granted him could be a  sign of his impending release," an informed source said in  Beijing.    The source said that when Wang, who was sentenced to 13  years  in 1992 was transferred to the hospital, it was clear he would  not be returning to prison. "It is not too big a step from  letting Wang serve out the rest of his jail term in a hospital  to granting him medical bail on humanitarian grounds," he said.    Another candidate for medical bail is Bao Tong, once the  principal secretary of the ousted party chief, Zhao Ziyang.  Bao, 59, was given a seven-year sentence in 1992 for "counter-  revolutionary instigation and propaganda". But since he was  detained in May 1989, Bao has already served more than half of  his term, which is a ground for magnanimity in the Chinese penal  system.    Dissident sources said the third candidate for early release  might be the student leader, Liu Gang, or the Reverend Pei  Zhongxun. Liu, who is serving the last two years of a six-year  sentence at a prison in Liaoning province, was a prominent  student leader in the 1989 democracy movement. Human rights  organisations say Liu, 32, has been tortured in prison. Like  Wang, Liu's name has appeared in most lists given by foreign  governments to Beijing for consideration for early release.    Pei an ethnic-Korean evangelical minister, was arrested in  1985 and given a 15-year term in a Shanghai prison for allegedly  "spying for Taiwan". Sources in Shanghai said since he was in  his mid-70s, the authorities might grant him medical bail.    Western diplomats said of the three, the release of Wang,  alleged to be a key organiser of the 1989 demonstrations, would  have the most impact on both the American administration and  Congress. In his Seattle "summit" with President Jiang Zemin  last November, President Bill Clinton mentioned Wang when they  discussed human rights. Meanwhile, Mr Kamm said in Hong Kong  yesterday the Chinese authorities had told him earlier this  month "a few tens" of dissidents were under investigation or  awaiting trial.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A new "mass socialist organization" yesterday dared  exiled Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose  Maria Sison [Joma] to issue arrest orders to its leaders and its  10,000 members.    In a statement, the Mapagpalayang Kilusan ng mga Anak Bayan  [Liberal Movement of Children of the Nation] (Makabayan) said  that since they share the same views and principles espoused by  the CPP's "breakaway" faction, they are probably guilty of the  same "crime" Felimon Lagman, alias Carlos Forte, allegedly  committed against Sison.    Sison reportedly issued an order for Lagman's arrest and  trial in a revolutionary people's court where evidence against  him will be presented.    Makabayan described Sison as a "madman from Utrecht" who is  a  "terminal case of revolutionary insanity."    The group called on Joma to cease and desist from his "kind  of deadly game."    "You have lost your sense of principles and revolutionary  morals... And you have lost and bungled the revolution you  yourself started twenty-five years ago," Makabayan said.    The Bukluran ng mga Manggagawa Para sa Pagbabago [Union of  Workers for a Change] (BMP), meanwhile, criticized Sison for  "dragging legitimate people organizations like the BMP and  Sanlakas [Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng Sambayanan --  Foundation of Freedom and Democracy of the People]... into their  planned bloody purges."    The BMP defended Tony Cabardo whom they said "has done  nothing but work for the success of people's struggles."    Cabardo, the BMP said, worked for the P [pesos] 35 workers'  wage campaign last year and the Kilusang [Movement] Rollback  against oil price increase.</p>

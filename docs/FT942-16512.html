			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: More tax-free for travellers - At a Glance International travellers are now free to bring a few more souvenirs into the UK without worrying about incurring import duty: the tax-free limit for goods bought outside the EC has been raised to Pounds 136 from Pounds 36. However, some other concessions have been removed to bring the UK into line with general EC practice. Travellers will no longer be able to use their allowance to reduce tax due on a single item costing more than the limit, and family groups will no longer be able to pool their allowances and apply them to a single expensive item.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Inchcape Pacific, part  of Inchcape, a large international services and marketing group  based in Britain, has stepped up its drive into China with a  series of investments in Nanjing, capital of east China's  Jiangsu Province.    The company has acquired a leading motor distribution and  service company, formed a joint venture to promote sales of  consumer goods in central China, and established a wholly-owned  investment holding company.    Paul M.F. Cheng, chairman of Inchcape Pacific, said  yesterday  at a press conference on the establishment of the three new  enterprises that China is the number one development priority  for the Inchcape Group worldwide, and these latest moves in  Nanjing will help accelerate the growth of the company's  business in China over the next few years.    He noted that Nanjing is an important market in its own  right. It is the capital of Jiangsu Province, which has a  population of 69 million people, bigger than Great Britain or  France. Together with Shanghai and Hangzhou, Nanjing forms a  strategic hub for Inchcape Pacific's further development in the  Chang Jiang River basin and deeper into central China.    The Inchcape Group operates in over 80 countries. It focuses  on three main areas: motors, marketing and services.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / BBC governors to hold private talks over Birt affair GOVERNORS of the BBC are expected to meet privately tonight to try to find a solution to the row over Mr John Birt and his tax affairs before their formal meeting on Thursday. The private dinner in London will be the first time the governors have met collectively since the revelation that Mr Birt was for six years a freelance consultant rather than a BBC staff member - in spite of being deputy director-general - and was paid via his private company, John Birt Productions. The dinner echoes a meeting two years ago when Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman, pushed through the controversial decision not to advertise the post of director-general but to nominate Mr Birt as director-general designate. Mr Stuart Bell, the Labour frontbench spokesman on the City, yesterday called for Mr Birt and Mr Hussey to resign. He said the taxpayer was entitled to 'better standards' from the BBC and Inland Revenue and pledged to raise the matter in the house. 'Why did the Inland Revenue accept such schemes when it was clear that the person who was self-employed had only one employer?' However, support for Mr Birt came yesterday from the BBC board of management and a group of senior correspondents. BBC vice-chairman Lord Barnett last night described criticisms of Mr Birt as a 'grotesque slur on a very fine man'. The director-general, he said, had been given unanimous support from the board of management which had a letter to that effect published in yesterday's Times. Six senior BBC journalists, led by Mr Peter Jay, the economics editor, sent a similar letter of support to the Times. The position of Mr Hussey seems less secure, with some governors extremely angry that they were not told about Mr Birt's employment status. Mr Hussey yesterday returned to Broadcasting House, the BBC's headquarters, after a visit to Australia and Hong Kong, apparently determined to tough out one of the most controversial episodes in the corporation's recent history. Mr Hussey is understood to be prepared to take the resignations of other governors, if necessary, rather than resign himself. Five of the board of governors retire between now and July, including three of the most influential: Mr Keith Oates, the managing director of Marks and Spencer; Mr Bill Jordan, the trade union leader; and PD James, the novelist. Mr Oates has revealed that he knew a month ago how Mr Birt was paid during negotiations on his new contract as director-general, and has expressed opposition to such an arrangement. Tomorrow provides a further opportunity for the governors to assess the situation when they meet the General Advisory Council of the BBC, the 41-member nationwide group whose views are sought on a variety of BBC issues.

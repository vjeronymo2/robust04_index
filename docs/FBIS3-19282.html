			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has stated that  Nevruz will be celebrated freely throughout the country on 21  March but that nobody will be allowed to use it as a tool for  provocation.    Answering reporters' questions in Ankara, Mentese said that  Nevruz celebrations have been held for years and that the state  will take the necessary measures to prevent it from being used  as a tool for other goals.    Asked to comment on the latest resolution passed by the  European Parliament in connection with Turkey, Mentese pointed  out that there is no discrimination between Turks and Kurds in  Turkey. He said that such unfounded allegations are made by  circles that want to divide Turkey. Our Kurdish brothers in  Turkey are not a minority, he said, adding: It seems that the  European Parliament does not know Turkey. They must come and  see for themselves how the Kurds benefit from all rights.    The interior minister also said that the necessary measures  are being taken to ensure that the local elections are held in  security.</p>

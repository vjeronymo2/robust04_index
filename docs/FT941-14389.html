			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Threat to friendship of convenience - MIM's network of investments and commercial ties needs and overhaul If the Metallgesellschaft rescue plan, agreed last weekend, resolved the immediate future of the German metals group, it did nothing to erase question marks hanging over Brisbane-based MIM Holdings. The two companies have been bound together for over a decade, by share stakes in each other and a number of jointly-held commercial interests. From MIM's point of view, the relationship has formed part of a broader network of cross-holdings. The aim was partly defensive, as protection against corporate raiders, and partly commercial, to foster its 'international development'. For example, via its relationship with Metallgesellschaft and with the Germans' Metall Mining subsidiary in Canada, MIM acquired an interest in Cominco, the Canadian natural resources group. Today, MIM's directly-owned stake in Cominco stands at 8.7 per cent. It is also an equal partner with Canada's Teck Corporation in an investment company, called Nunachiaq, which owns another 27.7 per cent. The problem is that this 'investment' strategy, debatable from the outset, has looked increasingly mis-directed. Sizeable sums - over ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 975m) at the last balance sheet date - have been tied up in such holdings, but returns have been paltry. In 1992/3, for example, investment interests contributed just ADollars 32m to net profits; in the previous year, under ADollars 44m. Such lack of performance has come to matter more, as MIM's core base metals business has struggled in the face of depressed prices and recessionary conditions. In 1992/3, the group's net profit slipped by 30 per cent to ADollars 74m, and yesterday's results showed a further loss of ADollars 18.5m. Admittedly, the latest deficit was largely due to a ADollars 17.8m abnormal item, and MIM did note a tentative recovery in metal prices late in the quarter. Even so, at the pre-tax level, profit was ADollars 31.6m, less than one-third of last time's ADollars 97.2m. Debt, by contrast, has been rising; long-term loans topped ADollars 1.8bn at end-June. MIM's credit ratings are only within the investment grade range; Standard &amp; Poor's gives a 'BBB' assessment. So when financial pressures forced Metallgesellschaft to place the bulk of its 13.9 per cent stake in MIM last month, the spotlight turned on MIM's general investment strategy. Stockbrokers ANZ McCaughan said: 'Unless MIM can increase the return . . . in the near future, the investments should be sold.' In response, MIM has given every signal that it recognises the problem, and would like to do something about it. At the November annual meeting, the company told shareholders 'quite simply, we must make your money work better'. Norm Fussell, MIM's chief executive, added that all assets were under review, a line which the company has continued to repeat. Even before Metallgesellschaft's upheavals, MIM had started to disentangle some of the German commercial ties. A restructuring scheme for the jointly-held zinc smelting interests was devised, so that both companies would end up with full ownership of specific assets. Some smaller financial investments have also been sold, including a 12.4 per cent interest in Evans Deakin, an Australian engineering business, and a 2.4 per cent holding in Renison Goldfields. But, in dollar terms, these interests were never the main ones. Of the ADollars 1.4bn 'investment' portfolio at end-June, the Asarco, Cominco/Nunachiaq, Metallgesellschaft holdings accounted for over half. MIM's 35 per cent interest in Norddeutsche Affinerie, the Hamburg-based copper group in which Metallgesellschaft holds a similar stake, was valued at another ADollars 139.9m. The problem for MIM is that the uncertainties that now surround Metallgesellschaft, coupled with the depressed metal industry conditions which have led both Cominco and Asarco into losses for the first nine months of 1993, make action on these interests a lot more difficult in the short-run. The Cominco share price, for example, has tumbled from around ADollars 35 at end-1989 to some ADollars 20 at present. Asarco is little better, having dropped from around ADollars 45 to about ADollars 27 over the same period. There are even some suggestions that the workout at Metallgesellschaft could lead to a sale of Metall-owned assets - which, in turn, might muddy any Cominco share disposal situation for MIM. MIM says only that it is too early for any comment. And, in the meantime, the Australian group remains vague about whether - or when - interests, such as the 3.5 per cent Metallgesellschaft holding, might be need to be revalued. This would be a matter for directors, says the company; its 'normal' practice is to review holdings on a three-year basis. However, the Queensland group does add that it sees 'no reason to suppose that exchange of German smelting interests will not go ahead'.</p>

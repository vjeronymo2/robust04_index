			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Two senior leaders of  non- governmental organizations of the Chinese mainland and  Taiwan reached three points of common understanding here today  on a boat-fire accident on Qiandao Lake in east China's Zhejiang  Province on March 31, which resulted in the death of 24  Taiwanese and eight mainlanders.    Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), based in the  mainland, met here this afternoon with Shih Chi-ping, deputy  secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) based  in Taiwan.    After the meeting, Tang told reporters that they had reached  the following three points of common understanding:    First, both held that it is necessary to make all efforts to  step up the investigation of the accident and carry it through  to the end to find out the truth of the accident and make it  public by suitable means.    Second, it is agreed in principle that the two organizations  should as soon as possible exchange opinions on incidents  involving the lives and damage to property of compatriots on the  mainland and Taiwan. Only after necessary preparations are made  can it be decided when and where such a meeting is to be held.    Third, both held that it is necessary for both organisations  to do all they can to clear up the negative effects of the  boat-fire accident on exchanges between the two sides of the  straits.    Tang Shubei said that after the facts of the accident have  been established, ARATS will inform SEF.    As to the proposal of Secretary-General Shih Chi-ping that  the two organizations should exchange within ten days at a third  place their opinions on the incidents involving the lives and  the damages to property of compatriots on both sides of the  straits, Tang Shubei said that the ARATS will give an official  answer after studying the proposal.    Tang Shubei stressed that the boat fire was merely a sudden  accident and therefore could not and should not impede the  development of the relations between the two sides of the  straits.    He noted that the exchanges across the straits benefit the  people on both sides, stressing that anybody trying to use an  accident as an excuse to impede these exchanges would be going  against the interests of the people on both sides of the straits.    As a matter of fact, Tang pointed out, leaders of the  Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State  Council have paid close attention to the accident.    They ordered the leaders of Zhejiang Provincial Committee of  the CPC and Zhejiang provincial government to deal with the  aftermath of the accident properly and to go all out to  investigate the accident together with the Ministry of Public  Security.    Meanwhile, Tang said, many other relevant departments went  into action immediately after the accident and have done a lot  of work. They have tried to respect the will of the family  members of the victims and provided them with help.    However, Tang pointed out, since the two sides of the  straits  have been isolated from each other for over four decades, they  have now different regulations and habits in dealing with the  aftermath of accidents.    As a result, the compatriots from Taiwan may not accept  completely the ways of dealing with the aftermath of the  accident on the mainland and the mainland side may not  understand completely the will of the family members of the  victims.    Therefore, it is hard to avoid that the family members of  some victims from Taiwan have complaints against the departments  concerned on the mainland in dealing with the aftermath of the  accident.    Tang reaffirmed that the lives and property of compatriots  from Taiwan are safeguarded on the mainland just as those of the  mainlanders and no discrimination is allowed, according to the  law of China.    Of course, Tang admitted, the mainland should further  improve  the environment of tourism and better guarantee the safety of  the lives and property of tourists from Taiwan.    He pointed out that if anybody, using guesswork, makes  irresponsible or even insulting speeches, he could only enhance  the sense of non-confidence among the compatriots on both sides  of the straits.    This not only could not lead to the solution of the problem,  but might also deteriorate the relations already established  between the two sides of the straits, Tang said.</p>

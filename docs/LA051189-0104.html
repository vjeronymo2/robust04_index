			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 FINALISTS FOR PRESIDENT'S POST SHARE VISION OF CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS  </P> <P> After two years under interim leadership, a new president for Cal State  Dominguez Hills will be selected from five finalists next month at a meeting of  university trustees in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The candidates, in interviews last week, said they share with university  officials a vision of the Carson campus as a model of what most California  institutions of higher learning will become in the 1990s as the state's  population and culture become increasingly diverse.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills, which was built in the postwar years to serve a largely white  population explosion in the southern part of the county, now has a 58% minority  enrollment.  </P> <P> The five male finalists, selected from 134 applicants in a two-year search,  will visit the campus on separate days this week. The board of trustees of the  statewide university system will interview the candidates May 16 and announce  their choice, a spokesman for the chancellor's office said.  </P> <P> The winner will succeed Richard Butwell, who suffered a fatal heart attack in  February, 1987, during a period of campus turmoil. John Brownell, who will  retire later this year, has served as interim president during the search for  Butwell's permanent replacement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 Finalists  </P> <P> The five finalists are Allan H. Clark, 53, executive director of Educational  Consulting Services in Indianapolis and former president of Clarkson University  in Potsdam, N.Y.; Robert C. Detweiler, 50, vice president for academic affairs  at Cal State San Bernardino; John E. Kerrigan, 53, vice president for academic  affairs at the downtown branch of the University of Houston; Herman Lujan, 53,  vice provost for instruction of the University of Washington in Seattle, and  William Earl Moore, 47, chemistry professor and former vice president for  academic affairs at Texas Southern University in Houston.  </P> <P> "We are looking for a president who understands the multicultural dimensions  and opportunities at Dominguez Hills," said Trustee Claudia Hampton, who  chaired the 10-member selection committee. "We want a leader with lots of  energy, lots of optimism . . . who sees Dominguez Hills as a microcosm of  California's higher education in the next decade."  </P> <P> The committee was composed of three trustees, three faculty members, an  administrator, a student, an alumnus and a member representing the community.  </P> <P> Hampton said the committee gave special attention to minority and female  applicants, but though minorities were well represented among the applicants,  only 10 women sought the position. She speculated that many women who might  qualify already have good jobs that they would be reluctant to leave. The  current salary for the Dominguez Hills post is $95,500.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Affirmative Action  </P> <P> "Affirmative action was not the determining factor," Hampton said. "We felt we  would know the individual who was right for Dominguez Hills, no matter what the  sex or color."  </P> <P> Three of the finalists are white, one is black and one is of Hawaiian and  Latino descent.  </P> <P> Don Hata, a history professor who served on the selection committee, said the  group was "looking for someone who would strip off his shirt and reveal a big  "S" on his chest -- in short, we need a super-person for this job. We've been  in a maintenance mode for two years and now we need someone who can inspire the  entire campus community to take a great leap forward."  </P> <P> Hata, Hampton and others credited Brownell, the interim president, with  bringing stability to the 8,200-student university after several years of  declining enrollment and faculty unrest. Under Brownell's leadership, they  said, enrollment has climbed by about 1,000 students, bringing it close to the  high mark in the early 1980s. An additional 2,100 students are enrolled in a  new nursing program.  </P> <P> In interviews, the finalists said they thought they were selected because their  experience and interest in multicultural education fit the leadership needs at  Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cultural Diversity  </P> <P> "Developing programs for urban universities has been a driving force in my life  for 10 years," said Moore, of Texas Southern. "I believe Dominguez Hills can  become a model institution that demonstrates that cultural diversity and  excellence can coexist on the same campus."  </P> <P> Moore, who is black, also was vice president for academic affairs at Prairie  View A &amp; M University, a branch of Texas A &amp; M in Prairie View, Tex.  </P> <P> Detweiler, of San Bernardino, noted that "higher education in California has a  long way to go before it really reflects the diversity of the state's  population. Dominguez Hills is an ideal setting for developing the kind of  programs that attract more students from the minority communities and help them  achieve their highest goals."  </P> <P> Detweiler, who has written papers on racism in the Americas, taught history at  San Diego State University, where he also served as dean of the College of Arts  and Letters.  </P> <P> Lujan, of Seattle, was vice president for minority affairs at the University of  Washington before becoming vice provost. Earlier, he was director of social and  environmental studies at the University of Kansas and held a number of teaching  posts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demand for Scientists  </P> <P> Lujan, a native of Hawaii, said Dominguez Hills can become an important part of  a national effort to bring greater numbers of minority students into the  mainstream of education. In the next decade, he said, there will be a demand  for scientists and other specialists that can "only be met by people of color  and women. They are the largest single group available to move in as older  people retire."  </P> <P> Kerrigan, of the University of Houston, said the ethnic makeup of Dominguez  Hills is similar to that at the Texas campus where he has been academic vice  president for four years. A specialist in public administration and urban  affairs, his experience includes administrative and teaching posts at the  University of Nebraska and the University of Oregon, a stint with the Ford  Foundation in Beirut and Jordan, and he has held the position of city manager  of Aspen, Colo.  </P> <P> That background, Kerrigan said, would be useful to a Dominguez Hills president  in building closer relations with people, industries and institutions in the  Carson area.  </P> <P> Clark, of Indianapolis, was president of Clarkson University until 1987, when  he helped found the private consulting firm. A graduate of Princeton, he taught  at Brown University, where he was chairman of the math department, and then at  Purdue University, where he was dean of the school of science for 10 years.  </P> <P> Like other candidates, Clark said the Dominguez Hills presidency would offer an  unusual opportunity for an administrator to work in the forefront of a new  trend in education.  </P> <P> "Dominguez Hills reflects the future of many other universities, where students  are becoming a majority of minorities," he said. "It can set the pace on how  such institutions should develop."  </P></p>

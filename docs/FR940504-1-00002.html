Kessel, (202) 720&hyph;5676. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs 21 and 22 of Annex 703.2 of Chapter 7 of the NAFTA relate to the trade of sugar and sugar containing products which receive benefits under re-export programs. Paragraph 21 requires that the United States notify Mexico, in writing, of any export to Mexico is not obligated to grant NAFTA duty preferences for such products. However, paragraph 22(b) provides that Mexico shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of (i) U.S. raw sugar that will be refined in Mexico and re-exported to the United States, and (ii) refined sugar that has been refined in the United States from Mexican raw sugar. Moreover, imports qualifying for duty-free treatment pursuant to paragraph 22(b) will not be subject to, or counted under, any tariff rate quota. Comments with respect to implementation of these provisions will be considered in drafting proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are encouraged to consider the rules relating to the maximum license sizes (7 CFR 1530.102(c) and 1530.202(c)) and provide comments supporting any change. FAS is considering having all programs conform to the metric system. This change would revise the maximum license sizes from short tons to metric tons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another rule change being considered relates to changes in the notice of transfer submission to the Licensing Authority. The provisions at 7 CFR 1530.106(c) and 1530.204(c) relating to the original notice of transfer being submitted to the Licensing Authority within 10 days of the transfer date will be reviewed for possible changes. The agency is considering having the refiner licensee transmit to FAS the original notice of transfer within X days of the shipment date and then simply receive and store confirmations from the manufacturer licensees. Information concerning numerous transfers within an X-day period could be submitted to the Licensing Authority, either by mail or by electronic means. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAS is also considering modifying the rule concerning licensee certifications in 7 CFR 1530.105(b). The additional requirement the agency is considering is having the licensee provide certification to the Licensing Authority within 95 days of the date of export or last certification which ever comes first. An alternative could be to have periodic reports (e.g., weekly, monthly, or quarterly depending on the volume of license activity). This change would allow the Licensing Authority to establish greater compliance safeguards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Licensees in the Refined Sugar Re-export program have been informed by FAS that during the time domestic marketing allotments are in effect, licensees' sugar export shipments could not be certified to the Licensing Authority as being eligible for license credit except when any domestic sugar can be verified as being counted against marketing allotment allocations. FAS is interested in developing appropriate rules that would incorporate this limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAS also is interested in comments addressing the creation of a program to provide for imports of raw cane sugar exempt from the tariff-rate quota on condition that an equivalent quantity of raw sugar is exported. Currently, subheading 1701.11.02 and additional U.S. note 3(c) to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) authorizes the sugar licensing programs but provides only for imports of raw sugar ``to be used for the production (other than by distillation) of polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute for sugar in human food consumption, or to be refined and re-exported in refined form or in sugar-containing products.'' This provision would need to be amended to permit a raw sugar swap program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAS is interested in comments relating to the implementation of an automated data system linking licensees with the Licensing Authority. Automated data processing procedures relating to the use of standardized forms for notices of transfer and certifications for export credit are of particular interest. Rule change suggestions for providing a structured data reporting format to enhance program administration and assist in verifying program compliance are also requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAS will give major consideration to the suggestions of manufacturer licensees in the sugar to be re-exported in sugar containing products program with respect to contractual manufacturing arrangements with co-packers. Comments should center on the control of quota-exempt sugar to prevent diversion onto the domestic market and the means by which manufacturer licensees would establish eligibility to receive credit for sugar containing product exports for products manufactured and exported by a co-packer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAS is also considering changing the licenses used under the Sugar for the Production of Polyhydric Alcohol program from a license to import raw sugar to a license to receive transfers of refined sugar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this will be the best opportunity to modify program regulations, program participants should address any other issues that they deem appropriate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, DC on March 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard B.

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY FINALS GIVE DE JOHN LAST CHANCE TO TAKE A BOW  </P> <P> Dare the City Section wrestling championships script a play this corny? This  bold?  </P> <P> Probably not. It would be too far-fetched. Too perfect. Too Hollywood. Too . .  . . Sam De John.  </P> <P> For De John, the man most often credited with bringing wrestling to the City  Section some 17 years ago, a San Fernando High title this morning in his team's  own gym is almost too much to expect.  </P> <P> He's had his City championships -- six in all. He's had his individual  champions -- 46 at last count.  </P> <P> But today, on the eve of his retirement, De John will take a shot at one last  shining moment.  </P> <P> And he issues one final warning.  </P> <P> "You can never count San Fernando out," De John promised.  </P> <P> Indeed. After a disappointing dual-meet season in which San Fernando won only  one of five Valley League matches, the Tigers roared back for a second-place  finish in last weekend's Valley League finals.  </P> <P> "I concentrate on what happens at the end of the year," De John said. "So I  have to swallow my pride and take my lumps during the year."  </P> <P> And then dish it out at the close.  </P> <P> The task today, however, appears formidable. El Camino Real, the defending City  and Valley League champion, is strong. The Conquistadores won the league  tournament handily and are heavy favorites today. Wilson, the champion from the  Central League, also rates as a top contender.  </P> <P> "Everything has to come together and we have to have all the breaks," De John  said. "We just can't compete against El Camino's depth. We never give up, but  we're a long-shot."  </P> <P> The odds are long but not impossible. Ten San Fernando wrestlers advanced to  the City finals.  </P> <P> "The problem is, we don't go head-up with El Camino where we're tough and  they're tough," De John said. "They are strongest in the heavy classes, and we  are in the light classes."  </P> <P> But in what will be De John's final curtain call, he figures to go out a winner  in at least one respect.  </P> <P> "I think we put on the best show in town," he said.  </P> <P> Westlake, Newbury Park and Channel Islands each qualified two wrestlers for  this morning's Southern Section Masters Meet at Fountain Valley High.  </P> <P> T. R. Merickel of Channel Islands and Chris Kilbane won their respective weight  classes at 126 and 154 pounds, and Westlake's Neil Mason (145) and Billy Hunter  (175) finished second in last weekend's 4-A Division championships.  </P> <P> Westlake, the Marmonte League champion, placed fifth in the team standings, the  highest finish in school history. Newbury Park, which also qualified  third-place heavyweight Jeff Jay, was eighth in the 4-A.  </P> <P> Valo Barajas (98) of Channel Islands and Bryan Ha (138) of Simi Valley each  placed third and will also compete.  </P> <P> Rio Mesa will send three wrestlers who reached the 3-A Division finals to the  Masters. They are Tony Flores (191), Robby Cook (132) and Wyatt Anderson (145).  </P> <P> The top six wrestlers in each weight class at today's meet will qualify for the  state championships March 4 at University of Pacific in Stockton.  </P></p>

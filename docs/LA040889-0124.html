			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREPARING YOUR HOME FOR AN EARTHQUAKE  </P> <P> Keep survival items, including: a portable radio, flashlights, extra batteries,  a first-aid kit and medicines, an adjustable wrench for turning off water and  gas lines, a few gallons of bottled water for each family member, chlorine  bleach to disinfect water (eight to 16 drops per gallon), a week's supply of  canned and dried foods, a portable stove, matches, extra blankets or sleeping  bags, and phone numbers for local police and fire departments and your doctor.  </P> <P> Check your home for earthquake hazards. Bolt down or provide strong support for  water heaters and other gas appliances. Place large or heavy objects on lower  shelves. Brace or anchor tall or top-heavy items. Securely fasten shelves to  walls.  </P> <P> Conduct occasional drills to help family members avoid injury and panic during  quakes. Teach family members first aid and how to turn off gas, electricity and  water.  </P> <P> Have a plan to reunite your family if travel is difficult or restricted.  </P> <P> DURING AN EARTHQUAKE  </P> <P> Remain calm. Reassure others.  </P> <P> If indoors, watch for falling plaster, bricks, light fixtures and other  objects. If you are in danger, get under a table, desk or bed. Stay away from  windows, mirrors and chimneys.  </P> <P> If outside, avoid walls, power poles and other objects that could fall. Move to  an open area if possible.  </P> <P> AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE  </P> <P> Provide first aid to injured people, but do not move them unless they are in  immediate danger of further injury.  </P> <P> Check for fires or fire hazards. Check utilities and appliances for damage. If  you smell gas, shut off the main valve, open windows, leave the house and  notify your utility. Do not use matches, electrical switches or open flame  appliances unless you are sure there is no leak. Shut off electric power if  household wiring is damaged, but only if no gas leak is suspected.  </P> <P> Wear shoes if there is broken glass or other debris.  </P> <P> Do not touch downed power lines or objects they may touch.  </P> <P> If water is off, get emergency water from water heaters, toilet tanks, melted  ice cubes or canned foods. Avoid eating or drinking anything from open  containers near shattered glass.  </P> <P> Don't go sightseeing in damaged areas or on beaches where tidal waves may  strike.  </P> <P> Be prepared for aftershocks.  </P> <P> Monitor emergency broadcasts on your television or portable radio.  </P> <P> Check your chimney for cracks or damage, but approach cautiously. Do not use  your phone except to report fire, gas, medical or violent-crime emergencies.  </P> <P> PREPARING YOUR OFFICE FOR AN EARTHQUAKE  </P> <P> Look for books, potted plants and heavy objects that could fall and injure  someone during an earthquake. Move or secure them.  </P> <P> Heavy objects, such as computer terminals and top-heavy furniture, may be a  threat. If they aren't secured, be ready to move away from them in an  earthquake.  </P> <P> Be ready to move away from windows and glass partitions that can break in an  earthquake.  </P> <P> Store emergency supplies. In a desk drawer keep:  </P> <P>  -- A portable radio for information after a disaster;  </P> <P>  -- A flashlight in the event power fails;  </P> <P>  -- Tennis shoes for ease of movement;  </P> <P>  -- Food, such as trail mix;  </P> <P>  -- Bottled water in the event water lines break;  </P> <P>  -- Medicines and first-aid items;  </P> <P>  -- Emergency literature that gives information on actions to take in a crisis.  </P> <P> Know emergency procedures, including the locations of:  </P> <P>  -- Emergency exits;  </P> <P>  -- Fire alarms;  </P> <P>  -- Fire extinguishers.  </P> <P> Source: Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project  </P></p>

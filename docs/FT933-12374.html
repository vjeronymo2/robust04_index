			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Danger of the soft option Sir, Over the last 10 to 15 years, like many of my colleagues I have had to come to grips with zero defects, quality circles, Just-in-Time, 'The Lean Machine', etc. Both as a manager and as a consultant I have tried to lead companies down this path because I have seen the benefits it can bring, not only in Japan. Needless to say, you must be prepared to invest a lot of hard work and re-education at all levels. Now I learn from your review of the Industrial Relations Services report ('Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices', July 19) that all this was apparently in vain. As the recovery continues, 'pent-up resentment from British workers . . . could have a devastating effect' and 'increase British industry's vulnerability'. Are we really so stupid, as a nation, to throw away hard-won improvements by taking the soft option? It would be interesting to hear the views of the motor industry.

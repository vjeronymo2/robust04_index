			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING CHANGE: FOR MONEY, GUNS, GOVERNORS, AND GROWTH POLICY;  </P> <P> STOCKTON MURDERS AND SACRAMENTO STALEMATES  </P> <P> The tragic murder of five children on a Stockton schoolyard, by a criminal  wielding an assault rifle, prompts renewed pleas to the Legislature for the  rapid outlawing of such weapons.  </P> <P> The competing sides of this issue are personified by two antagonists, State  Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti and retired state Sen. H.L.  Richardson, a director of the National Rifle Assn. Roberti has urged that  citizens "write, talk, call on talk radio, call on legislators, demand, scream,  pressure, intimidate -- they should do all of that," in support of a ban.  Richardson, by contrast, has focused on the deceased killer, Patrick Edward  Purdy: "The real question is how a nut like that, with his record, can walk  around on the streets?"  </P> <P> In my ninth year as a legislator, I can tell you that argument on the control  of guns is one of the most shrill and illogical debates to which a legislator  can listen. It has much of the high emotional content of the debate over  abortion, frequently fraught with the same feelings, emotionalism and sentiment  that totally obscure practical and logical aspects of the problem. During all  of my time as a public official there has been a highly militant pressure group  that would ban any and all personal possession of firearms. They are offset by  groups that fight for the right to possess any and all firearms. These two  polarized factions have thus far been incapable of rational communication.  </P> <P> I have lived on both sides of the fence separating these two camps. As an  occasional hunter, I have owned weapons designed for effective hunting. As a  private citizen, I have owned handguns useful in defending my family from  dangerous predatory human beings. I will not docilely tolerate any person or  government interfering with my right to engage in lawful hunting or the lawful  protection of my family. I have, on the other hand, spent 37 years with the Los  Angeles Police Department watching all of the damage done by irresponsible  people with guns and all of the carnage done by criminals in possession of  guns.  </P> <P> The idea of a total ban on firearms or all handguns is abhorrent to me. We have  too many defenseless citizens and seniors who are robbed at their places of  business, on the streets and in their own homes. Until we provide our police  forces and courts with more funds to reform our criminal justice system and  take these mad dogs out of the community, I'm going to maintain a firearm and I  think every other law-abiding citizen should have that right.  </P> <P> I find the "all or nothing" approach of opposing advocates on this issue  personally disgusting. I don't want people screaming at me on this issue or  attempting to intimidate me; I want cold, logical arguments on the facts.  Without rushing, but with all deliberate speed, the Legislature should, once  all the facts are known, confront this problem by evaluating the type of weapon  in question and the type of individual who commits such murders.  </P> <P> Does an AK-47 have any legitimate hunting or sporting use, or is it so easily  converted into a full machine gun type of weapon that it should be banned, the  way we banned the sawed-off shotgun and the machine gun? I don't yet know the  answer, but I intend to listen, dispassionately, as both sides present their  cases.  </P> <P> If we decide to restrict or ban such weapons, it should be done not by broad  language, such as "semiautomatic military weapons," but by a discrete  identification of the AK-47 or other specific weapons we wish to restrict.  </P> <P> I will intently listen to police professionals on this issue as well as to  abolitionists and gun lobby spokesmen. My years of Sacramento experience in  listening has, however, convinced me that all three groups are equally  uncompromising in their positions.  </P> <P> Most significant legislation comes about when proponents and opponents of  conflicting ideas resolve enough of their differences to discover a synergistic  approach that is better for everyone. This happens too infrequently, and we  have too many logjams where powerful competitive interests stymie any  constructive legislative action and exacerbate already difficult situations.  </P> <P> All too often the public falls prey to legislative impotence rather than  reform. A particularly compelling and repugnant example of a special-interest  stalemate was brought into our living rooms during the recent initiative battle  between our insurance and legal behemoths.  </P> <P> Another painful example involves the issue of workers' compensation laws.  Competing special interests assure that injured workers are inadequately  compensated with increased frequency; employers pay increasingly high costs for  workers' compensation insurance, and too many medical and legal practitioners  prosper from the process.  </P> <P> I do not damn the pressure groups, such as lawyers, trade unions, professional  organizations and business organizations. They are absolutely healthy to good  government; without them we as individuals would be ineffective in having our  voices heard in the far-off legislative bodies of Sacramento and Washington.  The only evil is when these groups abuse their power by sitting like pigs in  the middle of the road of progress to prevent any solution.  </P> <P> Let us break with this poor tradition so that logical and reasonable  compromises may be achieved. We must urge the 1989 Legislature to realize that  if everyone gives a little, solutions can be reached that protect all of our  basic rights while dealing effectively with these issues. Most important, let  us do everything in our power to ensure that we minimize the possibility of  another Stockton schoolyard massacre. Can we afford to do less?  </P></p>

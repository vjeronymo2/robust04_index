			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HAVEN FOR GAY TEENS  </P> <P> I am glad to see that youth troubled with their sexuality are being given help  in today's school system. The recent Report of the Secretary's Task Force on  Youth Suicide clearly pointed out that gay and lesbian youth are two to three  times more likely to commit suicide.  </P> <P> The fact that Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan and George  Bush chose to ignore these statistics is appalling. In a memo to William  Dannemeyer (R-Calif.) on Sept. 7, Sullivan said any attention to the problem  would run contrary to strengthening the institution of the family.  </P> <P> In my opinion, anything that keeps children from committing suicide sides with  family values. For an Administration that wants to uphold the sanctity of life,  this response was uncaring and sadly ironic.  </P> <P> DALE GRINER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

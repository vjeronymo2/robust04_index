			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Russia sees itself as sole CIS N-power MR Andrei Kokoshin, recently appointed Russian deputy defence minister, yesterday warned Ukraine that Russia saw itself as the successor to the Soviet Union in the observance and signature of nuclear weapons treaties. It would also become the only possessor of nuclear weapons among the former Soviet states. Only Russia, he said, could negotiate further reductions of nuclear weapons with the US and other nuclear states. Asked if he thought the US shared this view, Mr Kokoshin, the first civilian in such a senior post, said: 'I hope so.' The issue has been complicated by the statement by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukrainian president, that the US was willing for all four former Soviet states with nuclear weapons on their territory - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan - to sign the Start treaty on strategic arms reduction. Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russian foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday that he was 'unaware' of such an agreement. The dispute among the former Soviet states is delaying signature of the Start treaty and the beginning of talks on a Start II agreement, which Mr Kokoshin said he was anxious to get under way. 'The participation of Ukraine in the Start process would mean that (it) would be regarded as a nuclear state - and that violates the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, which it says it wishes to sign,' he said. A Start II treaty should see much bigger cuts agreed between Russia and the US, he said - as well as between Russia and other nuclear-armed states, such as France and the UK. Mr Kokoshin said the principles of a defence doctrine would be ready in a matter of weeks. He said that a future army of the Commonwealth of Independent States would be 'mixed' in composition. 'There will be a Russian army in Russia; there may be Russian troops in other CIS republics; there will be agreements with other CIS armies. We will probably have a basic framework of security, and within that we will have bilateral and trilateral agreements on such matters as bases, stockpiles and training.' He says states which wished nuclear cover could have it provided by Russia - 'though they might have agreements with other nuclear states as well'.</p>

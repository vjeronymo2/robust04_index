			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Pepsi-Cola may face boycott Pepsi-Cola faces a threat of a boycott from consumers in the Philippines' main sugar-producing island of Negros because it is using imported sugar for its production of soft drinks, writes Jose Galang in Manila. The boycott is being instigated by Negros-based Confederation of Sugar Producers Associations and National Federation of Sugar Planters, and has gained support from Negros representatives in the Philippine Congress. The dispute stems from the import of 15,000 tonnes of refined sugar worth Dollars 1.9m made by Macondray, an affiliate of Pepsi. Macondray imported the sugar due to a reported shortage of the commodity in the local market. However, sugar growers in Negros insisted that the 13 sugar mills on the island were holding sugar stocks of some 240,000 tonnes. The local sugar industry directly employs some 500,000 people.</p>

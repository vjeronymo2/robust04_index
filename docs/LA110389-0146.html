			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO KEEPS FOCUS IN VICTORY  </P> <P> The timing seemed perfect for San Clemente High School's football team Thursday  night against El Toro.  </P> <P> El Toro, the No. 1 ranked team in Orange County, defeated Mission Viejo last  week. Next Friday, the Chargers take on No. 2 Capistrano Valley, in a game that  likely will decide the South Coast League championship.  </P> <P> So the Chargers could have been excused for looking at Thursday night's game  against San Clemente, winless in league play, as a respite.  </P> <P> But not this time. Showing no signs of looking ahead, El Toro (9-0 overall, 4-0  in league) took a 28-0 lead at the half and held on to win, 34-7, at Mission  Viejo High School.  </P> <P> El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said his team realized that despite the last-place  standing of San Clemente (3-6, 0-4), it wasn't a team to be overlooked. Johnson  admitted, however, that his players probably had some thoughts about next  week's game.  </P> <P> "It had to be in the back of their minds," Johnson said. "I'm just glad that's  where it stayed."  </P> <P> El Toro quarterback Steve Stenstrom was steady as always, completing eight of  10 passes for 116 yards and two touchdowns before leaving the game late in the  second quarter. By that time the Chargers were ahead, 21-0, and Stenstrom's  replacement at quarterback, Rob Johnson, had caught six passes for 91 yards and  a touchdown. The Chargers soon made it 28-0 on a 36-yard touchdown run by  Jerome Oakman, who finished with 108 yards in 10 carries and also scored on a  20-yard run on the third play of the game.  </P> <P> San Clemente gained a semblance of respect in the second half by outscoring the  Chargers, 7-6. The Tritons, who only had 29 yards in total offense and two  first downs in the first half, moved the ball much better in the second. Juan  Maldonado broke through the El Toro line and scored on a 61-yard run in the  third quarter.  </P></p>

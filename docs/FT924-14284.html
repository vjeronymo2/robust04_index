			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Thames in row over TV film rights A ROW over television film rights might lead to litigation between Thames Television and Carlton Communications, which won in the tender for the London weekday franchise. Thames says Carlton has not offered enough for the rights to show several hundred feature films in the London region. Thames, which loses the London weekday franchise at the end of the year, intends to keep the rights and show the films on Channel 5 if the new channel gets the go-ahead. Thames leads the only consortium bidding for the Channel 5 licence, and the Independent Television Commission will decide next month whether to award it. If Carlton does not obtain the rights, it may be unable to show films being carried by the rest of the ITV network. Thames wants Pounds 20m for its share of the rights, which are bought collectively on behalf of ITV. It is believed that the Carlton bid is around Pounds 8m. Carlton said yesterday: 'The films in question can only be played on Channel 3. There is no question of their being available for transmission on Channel 5 even if it is licensed by the ITC.'</p>

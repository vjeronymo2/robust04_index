			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo requests urgent trade talks meeting JAPAN has requested an urgent meeting to modify the draft agreement for the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), a senior government official said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'I know this would reopen negotiations and might unravel them . . . but otherwise there will be major confusion, because not only Japan but others do not agree with the draft,' said Mr Jiro Shiwaku, vice-minister for international affairs at the Agriculture Ministry. Negotiators are expected to present their country's reply to the market access parts of the draft by March 1. However, Mr Shiwaku said that Japan could not make its reply based on the draft because it was unfair. 'If the draft were implemented export subsidies would remain legal while import controls would become illegal,' Mr Shiwaku said. Under current Gatt rules, Japan controls dairy products imports. Japan also opposes the tariffication system - converting non-tariff farm import barriers into tariffs - because it fears that if its rice market were open, it would not be able to maintain self-sufficiency in what is its staple food. Mr Shiwaku declined to say if Japan would refuse to reply to Gatt on March 1 over farm products to be imported under tariffs.</p>

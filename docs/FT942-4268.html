			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Optimistic Pilkington strongly ahead The beginning of recovery in its markets, cost cutting and strong cash flow lifted pre-tax profits at Pilkington by 57.4 per cent to Pounds 72.4m in the year to March 31 before an exceptional profit on disposals of Pounds 25.4m. Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said there was now 'cause for some optimism for the future' at the glass group. The total dividend was unchanged at 4p, with a 2.5p second interim payment, although earnings per share excluding exceptionals were 2p (losses 1.9p). He also announced the postponement of the flotation of 49 per cent of the group's Australian operations because of indigestion in the new issue market there. The group will look at the situation again in the autumn. Mr Roger Leverton, chief executive, said the emphasis was now changing from cost cutting and cash conservation to improving margins. He hoped margins could be increased to around 10 per cent, although this would take two or three years. The restructuring of the group was largely complete, he said, following a number of disposals. Pilkington, which had recorded annual profits above Pounds 300m before the recession, has cut costs by Pounds 200m a year over the last three years, Mr Leverton said. Another Pounds 70m or Pounds 80m of costs would go in the current year. The group's base business workforce had been cut by 20 per cent over the last three years. During 1993-94 1,700 jobs went and a further 1,300 were planned to go in the current year. Gearing was close to reaching the 50 per cent target for the end of the current year. It fell from 79 to 63 per cent during 1993-94 and was now 55 per cent after the Pounds 80m sale of the insulation business. Profits from building glass continued to fall, from Pounds 56.6m to Pounds 50.8m at the operating level, as prices in continental Europe declined again. In the UK, sales rose by a quarter and market share increased to 52 per cent - thanks to the purchase of Heywood Williams distribution business at the start of the year. A 5 per cent price rise in February was holding. Profits were substantially better in North America, and South America and Australia were also good. Automotive glass profits rose sharply, from Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 58.9m driven by higher volumes in America. Group sales rose 6.4 per cent to Pounds 2.74bn, with continuing operations up 9.3 per cent to Pounds 2.52bn. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said volume added 6 percentage points and the acquisition 5 points to sales, but lower prices took 2 points off. Operating profits from continuing businesses were up 19.2 per cent to Pounds 91.2m, with total profits at Pounds 104.2m (Pounds 88m). Investment income rose from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 22.5m. Associates contributed Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 19.9m) and interest took Pounds 75.6m (Pounds 75.7m). Mr Robb said the group was beginning to use tax losses in various territories which had enabled the tax charge to fall from Pounds 46m to Pounds 32.6m and the rate would continue to decline.

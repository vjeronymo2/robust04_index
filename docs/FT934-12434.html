			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Calls for early end to trade talks SUPPORT for a swift and successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks came yesterday from consumer organisations and the Czech Republic, amid rising anxiety in Geneva over slippage in the negotiating timetable. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, has called a meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee for November 1, where he is likely to urge renewed efforts to thrash out a tariff-cutting deal. This month's failure by the US, EC, Japan and Canada to agree on lower trade barriers for farm and industrial goods means a comprehensive market access package for all 116 participants cannot be completed by November 15 as had been hoped. But Mr Sutherland is still pressing for most of the package to be settled by then, minimising the number of unresolved issues for the 'end-game' in the final month before the Round's December 15 deadline. The International Organisation of Consumers Unions yesterday told Mr Sutherland that while the package on the table was not perfect, it promised a big improvement, and was 'incomparably better' than the chaos that would follow a breakdown in the talks. IOCU, which represents 180 consumer organisations in 70 countries, urged Round negotiators to ignore the calls of protectionists and put the interests of consumers first. Mr James Firebrace, IOCU director-general, said all consumers suffered because of protectionism. Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, trade minister of the Czech Republic, who also saw Mr Sutherland yesterday, said a successful Uruguay Round conclusion was essential to combat protectionist pressures and provide the increased access to foreign markets his country needed for future growth. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia shared this view, he added. The casualties of a Uruguay Round failure would be, in the short term, trade, in the medium term, world economic growth, and long term, perhaps global political stability. If strong regionalism and protectionist barriers were allowed to flourish, 'you could end up with a war, after a decade, in different parts of the world'.</p>

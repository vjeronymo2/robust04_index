			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of Supreme Council of </F> the Bulgarian Socialist Party, BSP, by Ivan Petrov; place and  date not given: "BSP Supports a United, Well-Trained Army That  Is Ready To Fight"]    [Excerpts] [Petrov] Mr. Videnov, after the meeting of the  Consultative Council on National Security, DUMA wrote that  perhaps "the Army may threaten to rebel because of a purge." Is  this true?    [Videnov] I would not say so. During these last four years  of change the Bulgarian officers corps has displayed a high  degree of statesman-like thinking and is not threatening any  revolt. However, now certain circles that aim to provoke the  officers corps to extreme acts and bring it into confrontation  with the institutions of state are yet again undertaking  ill-considered, chaotic, and perhaps even premeditated acts. We  must not allow them to get away with this!    [Petrov] Nonetheless, tension is rising among the  servicemen.    [Videnov] I completely share their anxiety about the planned  mass dismissals based on length of service and the PSSD  [Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy] will do everything  possible to prevent such a dangerous step, especially as it is  not difficult to see the political motive behind this, namely to  remove the so-called military cadres with a communist past by  causing confrontation between young and "old" officers. If we  allow this to happen, we may provoke a similar situation in the  army to that which existed in the twenties, in 1934, and in  1944. However, I will reiterate that I am firmly convinced that  "repetitions" will not be permitted and there will be no  "revolts."    [Petrov] Nevertheless, redundancies in the army appear to be  unavoidable.    [Videnov] No one is against them, but they must be made in a  well-planned manner, within the framework of a process of  reorganizing the army, not in the form of a "slaughter to the  last man" under the pretext of lack of money. [passage omitted]    [Petrov] However, the ratio between the numbers of command  staff and the rank and file does make an impression.    [Videnov] To the uninformed and prejudiced reader or  listener, it would seem so. It is not difficult to mislead the  uninformed citizen. It is true that the numbers of the command  staff and the rank and file are approximately equal, but this is  not due to us having too many officers, but because the numbers  of conscripts are insufficient even to supplement the army's  peacetime strength of enlisted men. Given that we have decided  to have a small but high- quality army in peacetime, the second  condition for guaranteeing our security is to have an adequate  command staff that can ensure their deployment in time of war  (if necessary) and provide a competent administration to form  the basis of a professional army. Everything else is populism  or pure lies -- I am thinking of the claims made by General  Lyutskanov of the Reserve that the Turkish General Staff  consists of barely 500 officers. [passage omitted]    [Petrov] Defense Minister Aleksandrov plans not to pay  monetary compensation to redundant officers, but to give them  securities instead.    [Videnov] First, this is illegal, because they are being  compulsorily retired, and second, this compensation is granted  to the officers to meet their essential needs and help them to  adapt to civilian life. I hope that even Valentin Aleksandrov  has managed to dispel his illusions of "military caps filled  with cash." [passage omitted]    [Petrov] What, then, is the solution to the present  situation in the army?    [Videnov] We consider the following is necessary. First,  parliament should pass the law on defense and the armed forces  as soon as possible. Second, parliament -- perhaps through the  National Security Commission or the Consultative Council on  National Security -- should hear what the Defense Ministry and  the General Staff have to say on the course of the army reform  and should approve redundancies only within the framework of the  reorganization of the armed services and after guaranteeing the  social welfare of the officer corps. Otherwise, we may find  ourselves in the paradoxical situation of having no senior  officers in the headquarters at corps level and above and also  having a shortage of young officers to command the platoons and  companies. This is a reality, because we will dismiss between  2,000 and 4,000 men annually, while only 600-800 men will  graduate from the military schools. [passage omitted]</p>

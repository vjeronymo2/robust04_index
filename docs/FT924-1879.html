			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Crisis-ridden Kenya limps to the ballot box: An economy battered by corruption and mismanagement is key issue KENYA'S first multi-party election campaign enters its final fortnight amid allegations of state-sponsored violence, intimidation and manipulation of the nomination process. The allegations have overshadowed what will nonetheless be a key issue when voters go to polls on December 29 - the state of the country's economy, battered by corruption and mismanagement. Opposition parties are focusing on the government's poor economic record, alleging continued corruption and lack of commitment to reform. Across the country opposition politicians are telling farmers, workers and the growing millions of unemployed that the government of President Daniel arap Moi has failed to realise Kenya's potential. 'This election is make or break for the economy,' said Mr Robert Shaw, economic adviser to the main opposition grouping Ford-Kenya. 'Only the opposition have the will to put the economy back on track and raise living standards for ordinary Kenyans.' International donors, who last November suspended about Dollars 300m a year of aid to Kenya until the government re-introduced democracy and beefed up its economic reform efforts, also view the election as critical for Kenya's economic future. Many have come to see an opposition victory, on a well-thought-out programme of emergency economic measures, as the only way out of a gathering crisis. An International Monetary Fund team which visited Kenya in September to asses a shadow reform programme gave the country what one donor called 'a C-minus grade'. Real per capita income growth is set to decline for a second year, inflation has rocketed to 37 per cent, money supply creation is well over the limits set in the budget, and the government has accumulated large arrears on its Dollars 6.8bn external debt, raising the prospect of having to negotiate its first debt rescheduling agreement. The agricultural sector, which contracted by 1.1 per cent in 1991, is set for further problems as a result of continued political intervention by government institutions. Politically sponsored corrupt deals this year, most notably in sugar imports, and mounting evidence of government using the banking system to fund its political campaign, have pushed the economic reform programme further off track. Donors say the government has made little progress on the three economic issues that led to suspension of aid: corruption, a burgeoning budget deficit and parastatal reform. A document issued by the US embassy in Nairobi is typical of donor discontent. It says Kenya has fallen on hard times due to 'simple, if all pervasive, government mismanagement'. The report notes the increased exposure of 'scandals highlighting the illegal diversion of massive resources' and says: 'The government has failed to respond to the crisis, instead it has avoided undertaking needed reforms and continues to perpetuate large budgets, inefficient government-dominated production and a selective award system to privileged groups.' The task set by donors last November - carrying out austere reforms in conjunction with political liberalisation - was always going to be difficult for the government. During the past year some progress has been made in foreign exchange liberalisation by the provision of foreign exchange export retention accounts and in further price liberalisation. A senior western economist in Nairobi says the money supply has expanded by 35 per cent this year on an annualised basis against an IMF target of 10 per cent. Much of this money creation is going to swell the campaign war-chest of the ruling party Kanu. The central bank is pumping in liquidity via the 'political banks' - those with political connections - through misuse of the export pre-shipment finance scheme, which grew by Ksh10bn (Pounds 180m) this year. Donors are also angered by the government's recent decision to abolish its programme of liberalising maize marketing, supported by millions of dollars from the EC, US and World Bank. The government recentlybanned the free movement of maize and made the inefficient and corrupt National Cereals Produce Board the monopoly purchaser of maize. According to western economists this move was politically motivated because it gave the government control over which areas would receive maize in the run-up to elections. 'If you don't support Kanu you won't get maize,' said one diplomat. Liberalisation of maize marketing has been a critical part of the donor-funded agricultural reform drive since 1986, which, according to one donor, is 'now back to square one'. In response to the government's move the World Bank is considering cancelling its loan to the sector worth USDollars 35m. The EC has also suspended a Dollars 13m loan from its Stabex Fund as a contribution to this year's crop purchase by the NCPB. Another World Bank loan for export promotion worth Dollars 160m is also being held back pending better macro-economic performance. Furthermore, donors say that corruption has been on the increase. Throughout the year the government awarded contracts to politically connected businessmen to import at least 80,000 tonnes of sugar free of duty and taxes. Huge profits were made as artificial shortages were created to push up consumer prices for imported sugar which, unlike domestically produced sugar, is not price controlled. Imported sugar has sold throughout the year at four times the price when landed at Mombasa. In his annual report Kenya's Auditor-General revealed a number of serious irregularities in state affairs, including financial deals involving the Treasury and the ministry of lands and housing. The government has taken no action on the report's findings. Similar corrupt practices have been exposed in Kanu's political campaign finances. In September, for example, the National Social Security Fund, the state pension and social security body, paid Ksh1.2bn for two plots of land worth only Ksh66m. The land was owned by Mr Cyrus Jirongo, the chairman of Youth for Kanu 92, the organisation spearheading Kanu's electoral campaign.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER 'SHUDDERS' AT THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO STABBING SCENE  </P> <P> Olive Vista Junior High School teacher Cynthia Edwards said Monday that she  "shudders" thinking about returning to the classroom where she was stabbed a  week ago by one of her students.  </P> <P> "I want to cry a lot," said Edwards, 37, in a telephone interview. "I keep  asking myself, 'Why? What did I do except try to teach?' "  </P> <P> Edwards, who is recovering at home after being released from the hospital  Friday, said she was reviewing Homer's "The Odyssey" shortly after lunch March  6 when she was attacked by a 15-year-old boy who had been a disciplinary  problem since transferring into her English class in February.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boy Charged With Assault  </P> <P> The boy, whose name is being withheld because of his age, has been charged with  assault with a deadly weapon. At a hearing Thursday, a Juvenile Court judge  said the boy had shown several students a knife and told them he was going to  attack Edwards. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> "He was having a disagreement with another young fellow, using a lot of  profanity," said Edwards, who taught in two East Los Angeles junior high  schools for 10 years before transferring to the Sylmar school in September.  </P> <P> The day before, the boy had been assigned to write "I will be quiet in Period 5  classes" 125 times as a punishment for repeatedly speaking out of turn, Edwards  said.  </P> <P> "The class was working, but he kept interrupting," Edwards said. "One student  doesn't have the right to interrupt the whole class, so I attempted to get rid  of him as quickly as possible, but evidently I didn't work quick enough."  </P> <P> Edwards said she began writing a referral on the boy that included a request to  speak with his parents when she noticed him approaching her desk.  </P> <P> "I felt a pain in my shoulder, and I assumed that he hit me," Edwards said. "He  looked around at the classroom and then ran out. . . . One of my students came  up and said, 'You have a knife in your back.' "  </P> <P> Edwards said the attack shows how teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School  District need more security such as emergency telephones in classrooms.  </P> <P> "If I had a phone, I could have called security to get the student out of the  classroom without having to take the five or six minutes to write the referral  and let him hurt me," she said.  </P> <P> About half of the district's 600 or so schools, including Olive Vista, have  some type of intercom system that link classrooms to the main office, district  officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Emergency Telephones  </P> <P> But no more than 25 schools have emergency telephones that can be programmed to  signal an emergency immediately to school officials, said Rod Macdonell, the  district's electrical supervisor.  </P> <P> Edwards, who had an emergency telephone in her classroom last year while  teaching at Stevenson Junior High School in East Los Angeles, said the Olive  Vista intercom system is too cumbersome to use in emergencies. Teachers there  must push a button and wait for an office secretary to notice a flashing light  and then go to another room to answer the call using a special telephone,  school officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee gains consolidated - Market Report COFFEE traders had a more subdued day than of late, as markets on both sides of the Atlantic consolidated recent gains. Futures prices opened firm, boosted by Friday's strong close in New York, and then light trade and fund buying pushed a thin morning market up Dollars 58 to a high at Dollars 1,848 a tonne for three months metal. But New York's failure to break 105 cents a pound prompted scattered profit-taking and the London price eased to Dollars 1,812 at the close, up Dollars 22 on the day. The London COCOA market had a positive morning but trading remained technical and lacked the underpinning of solid industry buying. The July delivery position at the London Commodity Exchange closed at Pounds 933 a tonne, up Pounds 4. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM capitalised on copper's strength (see story above), working back above the Dollars 1,330 a tonne level for three months delivery, and setting itself up for another test of the resistance in the mid-Dollars 1,330s. PRECIOUS METALS retained most of their weekend gains after New York opened modestly lower in line with expectations. The GOLD price closed in London at Dollars 381.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 5.95 from Friday's close, while SILVER ended with a 21 cents gain at Dollars 5.41 1/2 an ounce. PLATINUM was up Dollars 7.65 at Dollars 397.15 an ounce. Dealers said there was some follow-through buying in New York by the investment that had sparked the late rally on Friday. Some dealers had been concerned that New York might sell-off if it opened at more or less unchanged levels. Compiled from Reuter</p>

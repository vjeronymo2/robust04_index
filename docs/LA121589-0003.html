			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SEA WORLD WHALE FIGHTS DEADLY ILLNESS  </P> <P> One of Sea World's two adult killer whales has developed a rare fungal  infection that is usually fatal, but veterinarians at the marine park  cautiously expressed hope Thursday that an experimental drug will save its  life.  </P> <P> This week, park doctors say, Knootka, an 8,500-pound killer whale in her late  20s, has become the first whale to receive itraconazole, an experimental drug  that is approved for human use in Europe. Sea World has received special  permission from the federal Food and Drug Administration to administer the  drug, which park doctors believe is the most effective of its kind.  </P> <P> "Historically, systemic fungal infections have been fatal. That's what we're up  against," said Sea World veterinarian Jim McBain. "But historically, there  hasn't been a drug like this. Maybe we're entering a new era, or maybe we  aren't. We're trying to be optimistic."  </P> <P> Dan LeBlanc, the Sea World spokesman, concurred. "She could live an hour, she  could live five more years," he said. "We just don't know."  </P> <P> If Knootka were to die, she would be the third killer whale to die at Sea World  since Baby Shamu was born last year. In August, 1988, just three days after the  birth, the baby's father, Orky, died of natural causes brought on by old age,  the park said. At about 30, Orky was the oldest killer whale in captivity at  the time.  </P> <P> Then, last August, Baby Shamu's mother, 14-year-old Kandu, died in a freak  injury caused when she attempted to dominate another female whale, Corky,  during a performance. Since then, Corky has become a surrogate mother to Baby  Shamu, also known as Orkid.  </P> <P> Last month, keepers noticed that Knootka was lethargic and was shunning food.  When blood samples revealed a high level of white blood cells, indicating  infection, park doctors began to administer antibiotics.  </P> <P> Last week, when Knootka had not improved, McBain sent another blood sample to a  laboratory in Oklahoma that specializes in the study of mycosis, or diseases  caused by parasitic fungi. No sooner had that test come back positive than  marine keepers noticed a small growth on Knootka's tongue. Technicians tested  the growth and found it to be fungus.  </P> <P> "It appears to be confirming our worst dreams," said McBain, adding that he  believes the systemic fungal infection took hold because Knootka's immune  system is weakening with age. According to McBain, female killer whales can  live up to 40 years, while males generally live until age 30.  </P> <P> Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a marine mammal  conservation group, disagreed with McBain's life-expectancy estimates and said  he believes Knootka's captivity, not her age, caused the problem.  </P> <P> "The killer whale in the wild can live 60 or 70 years -- very comparable to a  human. This one is not old," he said. "Life span in captivity is severely  reduced because of the capture, the stress of living in a confined space, the  unsanitary conditions. If you go through the statistics of the whales or  dolphins that have died in captivity, most are due to infections."  </P> <P> Other whale experts disputed Watson's views.  </P> <P> "That's pure speculation on their part," said Dennis Kelly, a marine biology  professor at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, who said the "age-question  controversy" is being hotly debated. "Marine parks are a necessity. We are so  ignorant of marine mammals that their only hope is that people will go to parks  and become highly motivated to work for conservation of marine habitats."  </P> <P> Dr. Laurie Gage, the veterinarian at Marine World Africa USA in Vallejo and at  the California Marine Mammal Center, a rehabilitation and release center for  recovered animals, said, "People are ready to attack animals in captivity, but  I'm sure animals in the wild have this same problem, and they don't get any  care."  </P> <P> In fact, McBain said, fungal infections of the type Knootka has contracted have  been reported in the wild. He said they may be more common in marine parks  because, in the wild, a sickly animal would die of a bacterial infection before  it could develop the slower-acting fungal infection.  </P> <P> For now, Knootka is convalescing in a pool of her own, while Corky and Orkid  swim in another pool nearby. Doctors say the internal infection poses no danger  to the other whales, but Knootka has been kept separate from the thriving  1,100-pound baby because she has no experience caring for young whales.  </P> <P> Twice a day, Knootka ingests 100 pink and blue capsules of itraconazole, which  keepers craftily hide inside herring. Even with 50 times the daily human dose  of the drug, McBain said, progress is likely to be slow.  </P> <P> "Realistically, we won't know how we're doing until we're done," he said.  "There are not enough of these cases around to compare."  </P> <P> As much as possible, McBain said, keepers are preserving Knootka's normal daily  routine. Up to eight times a day, they conduct regular training sessions,  playing with her fins and blowing bubbles in the water. Never a consistent part  of Sea World's twice-daily whale performances, Knootka has recently dropped out  of the shows altogether. But, if she indicates she wants to perform in Shamu  Stadium, McBain said, keepers will allow it.  </P> <P> "I think it would be a good sign," he said. "She needs to have a reason to feel  better, and that kind of activity might be it."  </P> <P> McBain added that, once word of Knootka's illness gets out, he is expecting the  usual helpful get-well hints from animal lovers.  </P> <P> "We're going to have a thousand phone calls about giving yogurt to the whale,  or vinegar and water," he said, laughing. "They're well-meaning, but we'd like  to assure them we've got the best treatment going."  </P> <P> Still, officials at the marine park have braced for the possibility of  Knootka's death. One of the 12 killer whales in Sea World's three other parks  might be moved to San Diego to replace Knootka if needed, they said. And so  far, they have only purchased enough of the Belgian-made anti-fungal drug to  last 30 days -- about $6,000 worth.  </P> <P> "If we still have Knootka in two weeks, we'll continue to get more," McBain  said. "Even under the best of circumstances, there are no guarantees."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Political commentary: "An Address to the U.S. Secretary of </F> State"]    [Text] While attending the COCOM [Coordinating Committee  for Multilateral Export Controls] session in The Hague to  discuss changing the system for controlling military exports,  U.S. Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security  Affairs Lynn Davis said Iran had disrupted world security.    She said: In view of the collapse of the Eastern communist  blocs, the United States and its Western allies must pay greater  attention to the regulations controlling exports of military and  other advanced equipment to "rebellious" countries including  Iran!    Who is disrupting world security? Which are the "rebellious"  countries? These are the questions which plague the minds of  people around the world.    The answer is clear. The United States and the domineering  powers of the world have drawn specific boundaries for the  purpose of pillaging the countries of the world. Then they  declare that whoever does not officially recognize these  boundaries is disrupting world security and is an rebel!    Following the demise of the Soviet Union, with the changed  political geography, these people congregated at the COCOM  session in order to identify the rebels and those who disrupt  world security!    It is natural for those who have been constantly seeking to  gorge themselves for the past century to introduce distinctive  terminology into the political lexicon. They think that  whatever they believe in will be officially recognized by all  the people of the world.    The people of the world wish to know: Fifty years ago, a  handful of terrorists came to what is now occupied Palestine,  killed the people, made them homeless, and established a  black-hearted dictatorial government. If they were not rebels,  what were they?!    The people of the world ask: In an African country such as  Algeria, when a democratic government based on the will of the  people is formed, why does a sinister coup d'etat have the  support of international despots, while the leaders of the  people are thrown into dungeons?    The people of the world ask: When Muslims are victorious in  Turkish municipal elections, why is a crisis desk set up in  Washington?    The people of the world ask: Why do we see in the heartland  of Europe the most shameful violations of human rights? And the  Serbs are still continuing their aggression under the auspices  of the Western powers, so why does no one label them as rebels  or say they are disrupting world security?    The people of the world want to know: When a number of  oppressed people are offering their morning prayers in the  auspicious month of Ramadan in the al-Khalil mosque and they are  gunned down with impunity, who is the rebel and who is  disrupting world security?    If, according to the U.S. under secretary for arms control  and international security affairs, the volume of advanced  military equipment is the criterion, and its production and  exports should be controlled, then the United States, Britain,  France, and others who have the largest nuclear arsenals should  be declared the greatest threat to world security and the most  notorious of international rebels.</p>

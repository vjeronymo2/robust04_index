			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO'S FANS COME OUT CHEERING;  </P> <P> DAVIS CUP: SMALL CONTINGENT DROWNS OUT THE THOUSANDS OF U.S. ROOTERS.  </P> <P> Alfonso Aldrete got off work Thursday afternoon in his hometown of Hermosillo,  Mexico, drove all night, and arrived here Friday just in time for the opening  of the Davis Cup matches between the U.S. and Mexico.  </P> <P> Oh sure, he knew long before his nine-hour drive that Mexico had practically no  chance of knocking off the U.S. team but his countrymen needed his support,  didn't they?  </P> <P> So there he was Friday, along with what he estimated to be about 100 or so  other fans from Baja California, cheering and screaming so loudly that they  were drowning out the thousands of U.S. fans at the La Costa Resort Hotel and  Spa.  </P> <P> "This is not like the Super Bowl or soccer, no," Aldrete said. "But in our  country, it is very, very big."  </P> <P> But, alas, their moral support did little good. Mexico lost both of Friday's  singles matches in the first round, which means that the doubles team of Rick  Leach and Jim Pugh can clinch a second-round berth for the U.S. with a victory  today.  </P> <P> "It's tough to believe in miracles," Aldrete said, shaking his head. "I'm  afraid we don't have a very good team right now."  </P> <P> Oh, well, you can't blame Aldrete and the Mexican fans for having had a glimmer  of hope. Things looked promising for them when Jorge Lozano took the first set  from Jay Berger in the opening singles match, and was leading 4-1 in the second  set.  </P> <P> You should have seen them.  </P> <P> There was Salvador Villanueva running laps around the stadium, carrying a  Mexican flag. Juan Manuel Moncillas, also from Hermosillo, was yelling,  "Arribe! Arribe!" after each point won by Lozano. And all of a sudden, U.S.  fans were feeling quite uncomfortable.  </P> <P> Of course, those rooting for the U.S. might have been feeling that way even if  Berger had not lost a point, considering the architectural gaffe of La Costa's  stands that leaves precious few seats with unobstructed views.  </P> <P> "This is absolutely ridiculous," said Gail Forbes of La Jolla. "I can't believe  I paid $40 apiece for these, and I can't see half of the court. I've moved  around a few times, and the way I figure it, there's about $78,000 worth of  seats that aren't worth a dime."  </P> <P> Aldrete and his buddies solved part of that problem by standing throughout the  matches, but as the U.S. slowly began to dominate, there was less and less that  the Mexican fans wanted to see.  </P> <P> "If we won, we were going to go crazy," Aldrete said. "But if we lost, we said  we'd drink a lot."  </P> <P> "That's why I feel so bad that I lost," said Lozano, 26, a three-time  All-American at USC. "It means a lot to my country. The Davis Cup is very  important to us.  </P> <P> "It was a good match. But I didn't come here to play a good match. I came here  to win.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it was a letdown for everybody that was pulling for Mexico."  </P> <P> Yes, there might not have been a lot of Mexican fans, but, oh, how they were  heard.  </P> <P> Said Berger: "The Latin attitude is a very happy attitude. Let's scream. Let's  dance. Let's shout. That's the way it is. That's the way they were brought up."  </P> <P> That's not exactly the kind of comment that will land Berger a job in foreign  relations, but you can just imagine his appreciation for not experiencing the  kind of atmosphere had he lost.  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Russian offer to ex-Soviet states on debt RUSSIA is pressing other republics to give up claims on assets of the former Soviet Union in return for its full responsibility for a Dollars 70bn foreign debt which it hopes to reschedule later this month. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for foreign economic relations, said Belarus, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan already agreed to give up claims in bilateral agreements with Russia. Mr Shokhin said that after the failure of the December agreement to assume joint and several responsibility for the debt, Russia, which had so far been carrying the debt burden alone, could only afford Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn a year in debt repayments. The assets include embassies and gold reserves but Mr Shokhin said that republics mistakenly believed that they were worth more than the former Soviet Union's liabilities. Debt repayments due before any of the debt deferrals which have already been agreed, or any rescheduling which may be clinched in future, came to Dollars 20.5bn in 1992 and would be Dollars 16.5bn next year, according to a study by a western banks advising the government. Mr Shokhin, who will be discussing the debt issue with western finance ministers at next week's annual session of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said he hoped a rescheduling would be agreed by Paris Club creditors when they meet in the French capital later this month. He also charged that negligence by the central bank was partly responsible for the recent sharp fall in the rouble. A group of western and Russian experts funded by a Dollars 3.5m grant from the World Bank is to help prepare textbooks and a programme of training in market skills needed to operate a market economy in Russia, writes Dmitry Volkov in Moscow. Professor Richard Layard, who also advises the Russian government, said 'millions have to be trained in commercial skills' such as accounting and banking. The programme is aimed at giving short professional training courses of six to seven months to Russian professionals who lose their jobs as a result of the switch to a market economy, as well as to school leavers, and men who retire early from the army.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent loses ground in late trading BOURSES mostly opened higher on Wall Street's overnight gains and a higher dollar, but German stocks were an exception and the rest lost ground later in the day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT extended Monday's post bourse losses, the DAX index dropping 15.67 to 2,058.72 on the session and the Ibis-indicated Dax losing another 9.98 to 2,048.74 by the end of the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM8.4bn to DM8.8bn. National inflation figures were mixed and the bond market was a little disappointed. Broadly-based profit-taking was seen in financials, where falls of 1 per cent were commonplace and Bayernhypo dropped DM10.50 to DM477. However, Deutsche Pfandbrief-und Hypothekenbank (DePfa) climbed DM21 to DM831 after the bank reported a 29 per cent profit rise in the first nine months of this year. Some of the second line cyclicals posted gains. In the automotive sector, Continental and Varta, tyre and battery makers respectively, rose DM5 to DM243 and DM8 to DM326, while Porsche put on another DM19 to DM794. The apparent rationale for these upgrades, in a rising US dollar and prospectively better profit margins, was not applied to front-line cyclicals like BMW, which fell DM6.50 on the session to DM624.50, and Daimler, DM5.50 lower at DM749.50. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that the gains lower down the size scale were dealer-inspired. Trading in PARIS was suspended twice during the session because of technical problems, following a similar difficulty on Monday. The CAC-40 index finished down 17.36 or 0.8 per cent at 2,210.37. Thomson-CSF lost FFr3.50 to FFr164.50 as some negative brokers' comments on the stock surfaced. One of them, from James Capel, forecast that 1993 profits were expected to fall to their lowest level since 1984, and would continue to remain under pressure in 1994 and 1995. Outside the CAC-40, Synthelabo, which on Monday shed 7.4 per cent, eased a further FFr6.60 to FFr221.50 following the withdrawal by the French regulator of the licence for its anti-anxiety drug. Mr Mark Tracey at Goldman Sachs commented that this action confirmed his view of the company's weak product mix and saw the shares continuing to underperform the market. L'Oreal, the parent group, shed FFr19 to FFr1,195. ZURICH forgot about following Frankfurt, and rebounded in active trading on the firm dollar and lower interest rates. While it closed off its peaks, as both the dollar and Wall Street weakened, the SMI index rose 15.3 to 2,700.2. Selected insurance and chemical stocks led the advance, with strong interest also seen in dollar-sensitive shares such as Surveillance and Nestle. Among chemicals, Sandoz bearers rose SFr60 to SFr3,780; in the insurance sector, Winterthur rose SFr14 to SFr794 and Swiss Re by SFr40 to SFr3,940, although Zurich Insurance fell SFr13 to SFr1,340. AMSTERDAM lost pace towards the close as the dollar softened and the CBS Tendency index slipped 0.7 to 135.8, having seen a day's high of 137.6. Unilever added just 10 cents to Fl 213.80, down from a day's high of Fl 216.40. James Capel has upgraded the stock to a buy partly on the basis that the group is well placed to benefit from economic recovery and forecasts earnings growth of up to 11 per cent over the next three years. Philips, after hitting a new year's high at midsession of Fl 40.00, eased back to close off 10 cents at Fl 39.20. MILAN weakened on a late round of selling. The Comit index lost 6.68 to 585.53. Pressure was seen continuing in Fiat shares which ended off L144 or 3.8 per cent at L3,706. The telecommunications sector also weakened with Stet down L113 at L4,058 and Sip down L94 at L3,529. Stet yesterday announced the sale of its 20 per cent stake in a Dutch group. ATHENS added weakness in construction stocks to the pressure on bank shares which drove the market down on Monday, and the general index closed another 9.22, or 1.1 per cent down at 836.75. The building sector declined on news that the Greek construction company, AEGEK, would be introduced to the exchange in November.

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: The year of the shaggy dog - Cannes Film Festival A 40-foot Arnold Schwarzenegger threatens visitors to the 46th Cannes Film Festival. Anchored to a barge in the bay, the inflatable Arnie points an inflatable gun - wobbling a bit in the wind - towards the Croisette. 'Hasta la vista, baby]', he seems to be saying to anyone complaining that the Hollywood presence at Cannes '93 is not large enough. For that is the festival grouch to date. No-shows from such as Spielberg, Scorsese and Woody Allen, whose new films had all been tipped for Cannes, fuel the murmurings of America's growing disdain for Europe's major movie spree. Hollywood has sent its B team instead, with Abel Ferrara (Body Snatchers), Steven Soderbergh (King Of The Hill) and Joel Schumacher (Falling Down) waving a tattered US flag while the major studios save their blockbusters for the American summer. That half the 28 official Cannes entries are still in English tells us how virulent that language has become in the age of the co-production; and points to the presence of five British films in the official event, an all-time record. One of these is Mike Leigh's Naked, competition co-favourite to date with Jane Campion's extraordinary The Piano from New Zealand. Campion, who promised greatness in Sweetie and An Angel At My Table, achieves it with this dazzling tale of passion and punishment in the 19th century Antipodean bush. Holly Hunter is the young Scots widow whose father pitches her into an arranged marriage with colonialist Sam Neill. But a piano, a Scots-Maori neighbour (Harvey Keitel) and Hunter's little daughter all play parts in the waiting cataclysm of sex, jealousy and violent retribution. The film is shot like a Victorian engraving come to life. Early on: the buttoned-up, near-monochrome tableaux of cinephotographer Stuart Dryburgh (Vigil) as he probes the misty shores and forests prowled by incongruous shawls and black hooped skirts. Later: the thrilling fluency of camerawork and feeling as love unpicks the characters' straight-lacing and opens up their souls. The movie never stumbles into melodrama, nevers substitutes reach-me-down cliche for hard-earned revelation. In the power of its imagery and command of its emotions The Piano may well be - let us risk a sexist superlative - the greatest film yet directed by a woman. Some male chauvinist Europeans went madder for Naked: Mike Leigh's gloom-laden tale of a group of London down-and-outs catalysed by the surly wit of a visiting Mancunian (David Thewlis). Thewlis is obsessed with the end of the world and with exorcising - or merely exercising - his own chattery, epigrammatic despair. He first wreaks sexual havoc in an ex-girlfriend's flat, then tramps the nocturnal streets meeting Odd Characters of the kind we only find chez Leigh. A philosophical security guard, a pair of screwloose Scots youngsters, a nymphomaniac . . . Finally the tale comes full circle and Mr T hoofs off home again: but not before he has laid waste parts of London's soul not even the recession had reached. Newcomers to Leigh's cinema liked the film more than longtime loyalists. From the maker of High Hopes and Life Is Sweet, where statements about life and death are made through a prismatic miniaturism, Naked seemed to me full of apocalyptic self-consciousness and cackhanded class comedy. One character is a toff called Sebastian, whose sole function is to go through the movie drawling upper-crust one-liners and treating women to some seigneurial S-and-M. Elsewhere a nomadic, smash-and-grab pessimism is preferred to the distilled comic power of Leigh's best work. Leigh's film points, though, to a conspicuous trend at this year's festival. It is the Year of the Shaggy Dog. Many competition movies, even those that start out brisk and well-clipped, have ended up hairy, dazed and wandering all over the place. In Akira Kurosawa's Madadayo the initially touching tale of a retired schoolmaster's decade-spanning friendship with former pupils - sort of a Sayonara, Mr Chips - ends up going round and round like a scratchy record. In Jim McBride's road movie The Wrong Man, 'picaresque' becomes a criminal offence as Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Anderson and John Lithgow (husband, wife and the murder-suspect sailor they pick up) zigzag all over Mexico, burning the tarmac from one overacted amorous flare-up to another. And the Taviani brothers' Fiorile is a dynastic epic about gold, love and Tuscan folklore that pounds the centuries promising revelation but providing only reiterated lectures about the corruption of money and redemptive virtues of love. The best of that endangered Cannes species, the foreign-language film, came from another pair of Italian siblings. Pupi Avati's Magnificat, produced and co-conceived by brother Antonio, hews half-a-dozen stories from the rock of Mediaeval social history. The carving is brilliantly skilful: here a young girl's convent initiation or the birth agonies of a royal courtesan, there the grim glimpse of an executioner's trade or a dying nobleman's search for grace in a funeral pavilion by a river. Avati dovetails all these 10th century vignettes into a movie that begins by presenting the past as a 'foreign country' but ends by irradiating it with understanding and insight. The Cannes festival paints with a broad brush and there have been plenty of artworks boasting louder, more lurid merits. In the Market, movies with titles like Man With The Screaming Brain and Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy. And in the Competition itself, my favourite popcorn-and-escapism movie so far: Abel Ferrara's Body Snatchers. Yes, this is another remake of the romp first put on screen in 1956 by Don Siegel about space-spawned clone people taking over the world; and yes, my colleagues thought the film vulgar, brash, pyrotechnic and unsubtle. But then so did I. That is why, in a festival with more than its share of unfocused and underplotted movies rotating in ever diminishing circles, I liked it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Brendon Seery, military correspondent for the </F> Natal-based SUNDAY TRIBUNE]    [Text] Natal's daily death toll is comparable to that of  Bosnia -- a telling reminder that despite the differences in  terrain, culture and climate, both have the potential to become  bloody military morasses. In the hills of the former Yugoslavia  during World War 2, the partisans of Tito and other leaders tied  up tens of thousands of Hitler's finest troops, who were backed  up by sophisticated artillery and aircraft.    NATO's commanders, who today are equipped with airborne  computer- guided weapons of destruction aboard American F-16  warplanes, know that a ground war against the Serbs would be  costly and all but unwinnable.    Like the Wehrmacht and NATO, the SADF [South African Defence  Force] has deployed its iron fist in the hills and valleys of  Zululand. Its men on the ground are backed by the SAAF's [South  African Air Force] Dakota transport planes, Cessna 185 spotter  aircraft and Puma and Alouette helicopters. The air force says  that although no jet strike aircraft -- Impalas or Mirages --  are on specific standby for Natal, they are available.    Against them is ranged a motley assortment of impis  [warriors] armed with anything from AK-47s, shotguns, G-3s,  pistols and revolvers (including homemade items) to spears and  knobkerries.    On paper the SADF should win a battle against them without  so  much as working up a sweat. However, the fighting -- if the  current violence escalates into that -- will not be on a piece  of paper on some desk in a staff college.    An acknowledgement of the seriousness of the situation, in  military terms, came last week with the report (so far not  denied) that the SADF was considering deploying one of the  navy's replenishment ships -- probably the former Russian  icebreaker SAS Outeniqua -- to Richards Bay to act as a floating  hospital.    The SADF has downplayed the story, but the thinking behind  the move is illuminating. For one, the ship could be staffed by  trained medics and doctors of the SA Medical Services, closer to  the action than hospitals in Durban or elsewhere. A hospital  ship would also have adequate stocks of "clean" blood.    These are important considerations for the morale of men in  the field if what is essentially a policing exercise turns into  a war.    Richards Bay harbour is also more secure than many other  centres in Zululand are likely to be if the Inkatha Freedom  Party's supporters turn to guerilla-type warfare.    This is of particular concern when considering use of 10-ton  Puma helicopters, which will be the primary means of rapid troop  deployment. They can operate fully loaded for less than three  hours. If refuelling depots cannot be secured adequately, the  helicopters will lose their effectiveness, and it will take  longer to deploy ground troops.    Ships like the SAS Drakensberg and Outeniqua -- both around  20,000 tons displacement -- can carry tens of thousands of  litres of fuel for helicopters. Both have flight decks that  will accommodate Pumas as well as Alouettes.    Security of the Pumas must be one of the prime areas of  concern for the SADF planners, particularly in the light of the  incident in Tembisa last week in which a single 9mm bullet  downed a civilian helicopter. The SAAF has said only that  precautions are being taken to protect the aircraft and crews,  and has not gone into details.    These precautions are likely to include measures to diffuse  the heat of jet turbine engines to reduce the infrared  "signatures" of aircraft. There have been no indications that  weapons like the shoulder-launch, head-seeking SAM-7 are common  in Natal, but police have picked up at least one during  operations to find illegal weapons along the Mozambique and  Swaziland borders.    Many of the helicopter pilots, from 15 Squadron in Durban  and  elsewhere, have years of experience, learning a few tricks about  avoiding fire during the bush war in Namibia and Angola. But  sometimes not even experience is enough to cope with weapons  like the SAM-7 or the RPG-7 grenade launcher. Also a  shoulder-launch weapon, the RPC-7 is easy to use and extremely  accurate, even in the hands of a comparative novice. That much  the U.S. military learnt in Somalia, where the weapons downed a  number of U.S. Marine Sikorksy Blackhawk helicopters.    If the shooting gets serious in Natal, it will be whole new  ball game, even for veterans of Angola and Namibia. The enemy  will be ill-defined -- hiding out in crowds of demonstrators,  slipping down narrow alleys between township houses, moving  through valleys in the dead of night -- and the "rules of  engagement" will be far more strictly defined than they were in  Angola.    "Collateral damage" -- the euphemism for the deaths of  innocent civilians -- is something the peacekeeping SADF will  have to avoid at all costs.    In places like the crowded townships of kwaZulu, Inanda and  Mbumbulu, near Durban, the heavy 90mm guns mounted on the Ratel  and Eland armoured cars will be next to useless because of the  indiscriminate destruction they wreak. Heavy-calibre 0.50 or  12.7mm machine-guns would also cause heavy destruction if  levelled against township houses and shanties or hillside huts.    Ratels and Elands, despite their fearsome appearance, are  vulnerable to RPG fire, as such grenades can penetrate armour up  to 20mm thick.    The SADF troops first deployed in the townships of the East  Rand proved highly effective, not least because they were  treated with great respect by ANC-aligned self-defence units,  which discovered that the "brown jobs" would counter-attack  aggressively, unlike SAP [South African Police] units.    Less respectful of the troops have been hostel residents,  although few have dared to really "mix it" with the soldiers.  However, the IFP's "R-5 Brigade" made up largely of unemployed  rural kwaZulu men and imbued with the fighting spirit and  history of the Zulus, might be a tougher nut to crack.    Believing in the divine purpose of their mission to defend  their kingdom and backed up on occasion by protection from the  spirits against bullets, the warriors and their Kamikaze  approach will be difficult to deal with.    They will also have the invaluable benefit of being on their  own turf, knowing their hills and valleys for better than the  SADF. Indeed, security force members with the most experience in  the area are to be found in the kwaZulu and SA police forces.  The kwaZulu Police look set to remain loyal to King Goodwill  Zwelithini and the kwaZulu government.    Despite the markedly better training of the SADF, the  advantage in bushcraft terms will be even more marked for the  SADF's adversaries when they are compared with black soldiers  conscripted from other areas or with white troops doing call-ups.    White conscriptions is probably going to provide the biggest  headache for the SADF in dealing with the Natal problem. After  April 27, very few white Citizen Force soldiers will be willing  to give up their time -- and very possibly their lives -- to  fight in what is in may ways regarded as a black man's war. And  these white part-time soldiers will definitely be needed to help  the SADF cope.    Military expert Helmoed Romer-Heitman has said that if the  Natal situation does degenerate into guerilla warfare, the SADF  will need about 20,000 troops to contain it. These troops are  simply not available in the regular ranks.    The SADF has fewer than 40,000 regular members, about 13,000  of whom have already been deployed to help stabilise the  homelands. About 3,000 troops are in Natal, and more will be on  their way there after units in the East Rand are freed by  deployment of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. The NPKF  is generally regarded as inadequate for deployment in really  "hot" areas, and -- for now, at least -- will be put into only  those areas already stabilised by the SADF.</p>

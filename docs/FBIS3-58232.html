"A statement by President Clinton is not enough...we must  wait and see what resolutions are adopted in Brussels and on  that basis which decisions will be adopted by the Security  Council," he told a news conference here.    Stressing that the Security Council had the power to order  action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Butrus-Ghali  said the it was up to the Security Council "to give a mandate to  NATO or withhold it," he said.    "As long as the (member) states do not want to use force,  and  the states do not want to, we only have negotiation as a  solution and a mediating action that must continue," he went on.  [passage omitted]    Butrus-Ghali, who was speaking after appearing before the  French parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, repeated that it  was not up to UN field commanders to ask for authorisation for  air strikes against bases around Sarajevo.    On Friday, the secretary general's spokesman said that  Butrus-Ghali had refused a request from French General Jean Cot,  the head of peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia, for  the decision on air strikes to be delegated to him.    Butrus-Ghali said that it was up to his special envoy  responsible for military and humanitarian operations, and also  depended on Geneva negotiations set to resume on January 18.</p>

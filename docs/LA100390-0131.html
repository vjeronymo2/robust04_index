			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MURDOCH MERGES 4 NEWSPAPERS INTO 2 IN RESCUE EFFORT;  </P> <P> AUSTRALIA: FIRM'S STOCK TUMBLES 40% IN A MONTH AMID CONCERN OVER ITS MASSIVE  $8.7-BILLION DEBT.  </P> <P> Rupert Murdoch's debt-laden News Corp. said today it will merge its four Sydney  and Melbourne newspapers into two 24-hour publications to avoid shutting down  its struggling afternoon dailies.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said the move, effective Monday, will likely ease pressure on  News Corp., whose stock price has tumbled about 40% in the last month on  investor concern about its massive $8.7-billion debt.  </P> <P> The merger of Australia's best-selling newspaper, the Melbourne Sun, with the  city's struggling afternoon broadsheet the Herald, and Sydney's tabloids, the  morning Daily Telegraph and ailing afternoon Daily Mirror, will mean the loss  of about 180 jobs.  </P> <P> "As an alternative to closing either (afternoon) paper, it will save well over  800, probably 1,000 jobs as well as giving the public continuing afternoon  newspaper service," Murdoch said at a news conference in Melbourne.  </P> <P> "I expect the savings to be quite considerable," he said. "I think it is a  business benefit in that it should improve the overall profit of the company."  </P> <P> Murdoch declined to comment either about the recent plunge in News Corp.'s  stock price, which has wiped about $515 million off its market value, or a  sharp rise in the group's short-term debt.  </P> <P> Murdoch said the changes are linked with News' $830-million investment in  high-technology color printing plants in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and  Adelaide.  </P> <P> Murdoch, now an American citizen who spends little time in his native  Australia, is on an extended visit that will include the company's Oct. 23  annual meeting in Adelaide.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he welcomes the merger. "It will probably mean a  loss of jobs for some people, but as far as the community in general is  concerned, they probably will get a better service," he told reporters in  Canberra.  </P> <P> The merger of the Melbourne Sun and the Herald will create the Herald-Sun with  circulation estimated to reach 600,000, he said. Currently, the Herald sells  175,634 copies a day and the morning Sun 560,444.  </P></p>

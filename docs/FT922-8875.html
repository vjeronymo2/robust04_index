			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Coming in the 1990s: capital famine DR HENRY Kaufman's departure from Salomon Brothers ended an era in the US bond markets for both of them. Salomon no longer dominates bond trading as it did, and Dr Doom no longer dominates sentiment. But he is still the same man, and worth close attention on the much rarer occasions when he goes public. His Walter Surrey memorial lecture* in Washington this month was as weighty as ever; but for the first time I can remember, it provokes me to cavil as well as to nod. Kaufman tries to combine two theses: that our capital markets have a bad hangover after the excesses of the 1980s; and that the world demand for capital is so high that real interest rates will be high for the indefinite future. Familiar stuff, you may think; but can both scenarios be true? Can we have austerity and an investment boom at the same time? Hardly. If, as Kaufman argues, the western banking system is far too shaky to finance much-needed development in the emerging Latin American economies and the reconstruction of the ex-communist world, can we meet their demands at all? Or will they conclude, as Stalin did 70 years ago, that it has to be a bootstraps operation, or nothing? Judge these questions for yourself in the light of the Kaufman analysis. On banking he is, as usual, grimly convincing. Deregulation, he says, has left behind 'an amalgam of sophisticated financial processes and badly understood and frequently immeasurable risks'. The measurable risks are those resulting from fee-driven lending follies. We tend to shut our eyes to these horrors; Kaufman's estimate that unpaid interest alone currently amounts to Dollars 25bn gives an idea of their scale. The immeasurable risks are partly in over-valued property, but especially in derivatives. One startling example: he estimates currently outstanding interest rate swaps at Dollars 3,000bn. 'I can think of no area that has the potential for creating greater havoc.' Enough said. The British clearing banks have recent experience of what he calls the 'significant submerged risks' which may be involved in swaps. He also points out an economic cost which is generally overlooked. Borrowers who swap into fixed coupon obligations get no benefit from falling market interest rates. This helps to explain why the economic response to cuts has been so disappointing. And it is an important pointer for equity analysts; company accounts are unhelpful about the terms on which money is owed. Meanwhile, the supervisory authorities are in almost equally bad shape. Kaufman is unmerciful: regulators have habitually missed the point of innovations such as CDs, junk bonds, derivatives, and so been unprepared for the side-effects, some of which they still fail to understand. Generally they have been reactive; too little and too late. They have protected market imperfections, because these make regulation easier, and so encouraged the innovations they do not understand. When provoked to act, they have been too timid; and they have been backed by politicians, who like easy credit. (This suggests a supervisory argument for central bank independence which is surely more powerful than the usual monetarist case.) Most important, potentially, they have yet to set up a system of international responsibility which could handle a future BCCI. Kaufman concludes that there is no more outstanding debt, private and public, than the system can handle. The banks will be highly conservative for years to come; governments will be deflating (preferably through defence cuts); and both investment and debt reduction demand a return to basic reliance on equity financing. Especially for new borrowers. But if you accept this, as I do, can you argue plausibly for a boom, even in developed economies, or even simply in equity markets? It seems more likely that for some time any borrower other than an established giant is going to find it next to impossible to finance even promising projects. Even the credit-worthy will practice what Kaufman call 'capital frugality'; for the rest, it looks more like capital famine. *Text from Kaufman Inc, 65 E 55th St, New York NY 10022.</p>

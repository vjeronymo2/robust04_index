			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Banks on notice Britain's high street banks claim that they compete with each other fiercely to provide a high standard of service on their personal accounts. Yet the customers of banks which deduct money from accounts without warning, which pass on customers' details to insurance subsidiaries without written permission, or which cannot transfer cash across borders quickly and cheaply may question whether competition exists at all. They are not alone. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has warned banks and building societies that he intends to press for higher standards of consumer protection. He says he is very disappointed by the minimum standards that banks have agreed in their revised code of practice. This voluntary code was agreed by banks and societies after an earlier study concluded that the government should bring in a statutory code if banks failed to raise standards. The code has now been reviewed in the light of widespread complaints about banks in the first two years of its existence. Banks are going to have to do a lot better by the time the code is revised again three years hence if they are to banish calls for legislation. Far from treating the code as a set of minimum standards, some have quibbled with the clear intent of parts of the code in an effort to dilute their effect. Despite their rhetoric about competition, banks know that personal customers tend to stick with their accounts even if they grumble. It is troublesome to switch accounts, and few customers believe that other banks will provide significantly better service even if they do so. The code should not be a substitute for competition among banks, nor take on the overtone of legislation. This would be the effect of Sir Bryan's call for the code to be rewritten to include the requirement of the Financial Services Act that those selling life insurance give 'best advice'. Yet banks would be wise to recognise how unpopular they are. Some have raised standards in the past two years, but they are starting from a low base compared with sectors such as retailing and, if anything, are being outstripped by a rise in consumer expectations. Improvements in technology and strengthened capital present banks with an excellent chance to achieve a step change in standards. They must now deliver.</p>

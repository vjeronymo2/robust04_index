			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Local poll in Romania will test NSF TOMORROW'S first democratic local government elections in Romania for over five decades are expected to show if the ruling National Salvation Front (NSF) will retain its majority in the forthcoming parliamentary elections, writes Judy Dempsey. The NSF government was catapulted into power following the violent overthrow of the Ceausescus in December 1989. Despite winning a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections in June 1990, the NSF is no longer confident it can retain control over local government which serves as one of its main power bases. Not only is the NSF divided between conservatives/former communists, and social democrats anxious to speed up reform; it also faces what appears to be the beginnings of a united opposition movement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croats  opened to the strains of the Lijepa Nasa [Our Lovely Land]  anthem, [Croatia's national anthem], following which it paid  tribute to the people killed in yesterday's massacre. The  assembly was then addressed by Tvrtko Mevkestoc, president of  the Croat Coordination Council. The assembly's main task is to  define the general social position of Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, to chart the course of future social trends,  and to articulate the Croats' national aims.    An undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina is in the vital interests of  the Croatian people, Nevjestic stressed. The participants in  the assembly were also addressed by Zvonimir Separovic on behalf  of the World Victimology Society. Speaking about the conflict  between the Croats and Muslims, Separovic pointed out that this  had only helped the aggressor and that the conflict ought to be  brought to an immediate end. He also read out a joint statement  by the Academies of Sciences of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In it, the members of the academies demand an immediate end to  hostilities, peace, freedom of movement, and the return of  refugees to their homes.    The Assembly of Croats is a historic event as it is  beneficial to Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as to its citizens,  Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency said in  his address. The assembly's decisions are of decisive  importance as life in the future Bosnia-Herzegovina will depend  on them, Miro Lazovic, president [speaker] of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly says. [passage omitted]    The former allies have clashed and have started hating each  other, thus enabling the aggressors to do whatever they want.  The Croatian people's interests lie in coexistence with others.  At the moment, a defensive and just war is being waged in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ivo Komsic [member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  presidency] said.    [Begin Komsic recording] We certainly know that one war was  imposed on us whereas some of our people [Croats] should also  take the blame for our being drawn into the second war. We  demonstrated that we can organize defense by defending ourselves  from Serbian aggression. In many areas Croatian fighters should  take credit for the fact that the Serbian aggressor has not  crushed the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina and completed its  conquest. [end recording]    Following the debate, during the course of which a large  number of those present voiced their views, the assembly passed  a declaration demanding an immediate end to the war since an  undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only Bosnia-Herzegovina that  the Croats desire. Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croats regard  territorial conquest and its legalization by any side as  unacceptable and impermissible. This is why the participants in  the assembly demand that the plan for the partition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina must not be signed. Even if it is signed the  Croats will regard it as null and void, as stated in the  declaration adopted at today's Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina's  Croats.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / 3 percent rise in basic wage rates Most pay deals so far this autumn have involved rises of 3 per cent or more in basic wage rates, ahead of the annual rate of inflation, the independent Incomes Data Services says today, Robert Taylor writes. The report covers 97 pay agreements made during the third quarter of the year from July to September. As many as 48 per cent of them produced basic pay rises of between 2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, with only 11 per cent receiving rises of 4 per cent. The proportion of pay deals being settled at or below 2 per cent has diminished over recent months and there are signs that the autumn levels of settlements 'may be moving slightly higher'. These recent higher pay settlements include a 4.5 per cent increase at Gillette for the company's manual workers, a 4.8 per cent award based on merit at Guardian Royal Exchange, and 3 per cent at John Brown Engineering. However the latest pay bulletin from the Engineering Employers Federation, also published today, suggests that while only 8 per cent of reported settlements in the last quarter involved pay freezes there is no clear sign yet of any upward pressure on the level of basic pay settlements. But increasing overtime work and improved shift rates are believed to have pushed the overall level of rises upwards in recent weeks. The average level of pay increases inside the engineering industry was 2.65 per cent from July to September, only slightly up on the figure for the previous quarter. There were 227 pay deals reached in the period.

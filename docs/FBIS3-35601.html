It Will Not Be  Easy To Secure Democratic Majority"]    [Text] The "personnel fluidity" that had worried leaders  of the Russia's Choice Duma faction even before the new  parliament went to work seems to have reached critical mass.  Reconciling themselves to the inevitability of a micro-split,  Russia's Choice leaders decided to speed up the process  artificially -- as the Duma resumes its sessions, the faction is  establishing a "rigid membership," i.e., a ban on crossing over  to other parliamentary associations. Potential defectors have  been ordered to make up their mind as to their "propiska" [party  affiliation] before 1 February. According to Russia's Choice  functionaries, the current strength of the faction (78 persons)  is quite sufficient to take care of two or three groups. Most  probably, the majority of those who leave Russia's Choice will  follow the example of Andrey Makarov and Boris Fedorov, and  settle down in the Union of 12 December group.    Despite the Russia's Choice statements, they so far are not  managing to have peaceable relations with the Union of 12  December. Russia's Choice has hard feelings against the Union  of 12 December because the latter willingly grants "political  asylum" to victims of intrigues inside the faction, or simply  deputies disaffected with some of the leaders. The Union of 12  December has hard feelings against Russia's Choice because the  latter supported the "package" agreement on the election of Duma  leaders and committees whereby it denied the nascent group any  posts in the parliament.    There is also a chance of an organized split, engineered by  the leaders of Russia's Choice. One more faction would get them  one more vote in the Duma Council.    At any rate, the parent faction is in for a "toughening of  discipline." Not so long ago the Russia's Choice leaders  declared: "An identity of opinion is not a must with us; the  more stances there are, the better." In actual fact it appears  to be worse. In the future, in the idea of the "rigid  membership" organizers, the roll-call voting list of Russia's  Choice will consist, like those of the Communists, Agrarians,  and Liberal Democrats, of the uniform "for" and "against" column.    "We hope for cooperation with the other democratic factions  and democratic groups of the Duma including the Union of 12  December, and expect that we will vote in the same manner on  questions of principle," Kirill Ignatyev, Russia's Choice press  secretary, told INTERFAX.    Russia's Choice members who maintain that they will always  be  able to cooperate with "union factions" and secure the required  one- third of all votes to back the president's veto on any law  passed by the Duma, may be disappointed. The main danger lying  in wait for Russia's Choice leaders on the "tough discipline"  road is the obstinacy of those who would opt for a "St. George's  Day" ["Yuryev Den" -- in old Russia a day on which serfs were  free to change masters] and refuse to pay for their upkeep. New  deputy groups forming in place of Russia's Choice may also not  back it on some votes. Which would further worsen the situation  in the none too unified "democratic bloc."    For example, a clause-by-clause discussion of the budget may  result in serious disagreements among the democratic factions  and groups. Such a question as no-confidence in the government,  with which Russia's Choice could threaten the premier as long as  the present cabinet of ministers lasts, may not especially  enthuse some Democrats.    There is also no telling what would be the reaction from the  unpredictable president, already thought to be unable to engage  in conflicts with the parliament, to laws passed by the Duma  majority -- the right of veto may remain uncalled-for. In this  event attempts to secure the necessary votes to block the work  of parliament would prove absolutely senseless. The "stagnation  of reforms," Yegor Gaydar's phrase to describe the present  situation, would fundamentally be replaced by finally rolling  them back.    In the Duma, one would see Russia's Choice trampled upon by  the Communist majority which would no longer want compromises  like the "package" handing out of parliamentary positions. Such  are the disciplined remnants of the former, already now quite  modest, greatness.</p>

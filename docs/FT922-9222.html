			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Theory on workforces is challenged ONLY 10 per cent of employers view their workforce as composed of a core of highly skilled, permanently employed workers and a periphery of less skilled, less secure ones, according to a Department of Employment survey. Such a view of workforces  - known as the 'core-periphery' model  - has been popular with labour market theorists since the early 1980s. But the survey, published in the government's Employment Gazette, suggests that far fewer employers hold that perception of their workforces than had been thought. The survey found only a third of employers guided by any strategic thinking in their deployment of non-standard or peripheral labour. Direct costs were not significant in distinguishing between full-time and other forms of labour. The hourly rates for full-timers, part-timers and temporary workers doing similar jobs were the same for nearly 90 per cent of employees. Coverage of the most important non-pay benefits  - sick pay and pensions  - was, however, significantly lower for part-timers compared with full-timers, and for temporary workers relative to part-timers. Working days lost through strikes last year, at 800,000, were the fewest since records began 100 years ago, according to another Employment Gazette study. There were 369 stoppages last year, compared with 630 in 1990. An initiative to train disabled people in information technology so that they can find employment by working from home was launched yesterday by Leeds Training and Enterprise Council. Housebound trainees will learn computer literacy, spreadsheet modelling, word processing, desktop publishing and databases during a six-month course.</p>

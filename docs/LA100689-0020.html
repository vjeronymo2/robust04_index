			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MAKAROV GETS A GOAL, 2 ASSISTS IN CALGARY WIN  </P> <P> Soviet star Sergei Makarov got a goal in his National Hockey League debut, and  Jiri Hrdina and Joe Nieuwendyk each scored twice as the Calgary Flames opened  the season with a 10-7 victory over the Detroit Red Wings Thursday night at  Calgary, Canada.  </P> <P> Makarov, part of the first influx of Soviet players into the NHL, also had two  assists for the Flames, who won the Stanley Cup last spring.  </P> <P> Nieuwendyk, Gary Roberts and rookie Paul Ranheim scored in a 3:12 span midway  through the first period as the Flames jumped out to a 3-0 lead before rookie  Dean Morton scored for Detroit. Makarov got his first NHL point when he set up  Roberts' goal.  </P> <P> The Red Wings closed within 7-6 and 8-7 of the Flames in the third period, but  goals by Al MacInnis and Joel Otto kept Calgary ahead.  </P> <P> Buffalo 4, Quebec 3 -- Left wing Mike Hartman scored twice at Buffalo, and the  Sabres spoiled Guy Lafleur's debut as a Nordique.  </P> <P> The game also marked the NHL debut of Soviet defector Alexander Mogilny, who  scored the Sabres' first goal off a pass from rookie Dave Snuggerud 20 seconds  into the game.  </P> <P> Lafleur scored seven minutes later, after a poor clearing pass by Sabre goalie  Daren Puppa.  </P> <P> Boston 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- Cam Neely scored two goals as the Bruins held off the  Penguins at Boston.  </P> <P> The Bruins outshot the Penguins, 43-25, and capitalized on five of nine  manpower advantages. Peter Douris, Ray Bourque and Bob Sweeney all scored  power-play goals for the Bruins, who are 10-4-1 in their last 15 season  openers, all at Boston Garden.  </P> <P> Mario Lemieux, the NHL scoring scoring champion the last two years, managed two  assists on his 24th birthday.  </P> <P> Montreal 4, Hartford 1 -- Goaltender Patrick Roy stopped 30 of 31 shots as the  Canadiens won their opener at Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> Brian Skrudland, Guy Carbonneau, Stephane Richer and Bobby Smith scored for  Montreal.  </P> <P> New Jersey 6, Philadelphia 2 -- Sylvain Turgeon scored three goals at  Philadelphia in his first game with the Devils, and goaltender Chris Terreri  got his first victory.  </P> <P> Terreri, playing because starter Sean Burke is still slowed by knee surgery,  made 38 saves for his first win in nine NHL decisions.  </P> <P> Turgeon, acquired from Hartford during the off-season, was credited with New  Jersey's first goal when Viacheslav Fetisov's slap shot bounced off his  midsection and past goalie Ken Wregget on a power play at 1:09 of the first  period.  </P> <P> The assist was the only point for either of the Devils' two Soviet players.  Both Fetisov and Sergei Starikov took minor penalties in their first NHL game.  </P> <P> Minnesota 6, New York Islanders 5 -- Brian Bellows scored twice and assisted on  two goals at Bloomington, Minn., as the North Stars recovered from a 1-8-1  exhibition sason to win their first opener in seven years.  </P> <P> David Chyzowski, who signed a four-year, $800,000 contract with the Islanders  earlier in theday, assisted on a Doug Crossman goal.  </P> <P> Chyzowski, an 18-year-old left wing and the second overall pick in the 1989  draft, is the league's youngest player.  </P> <P> St. Louis 8, Chicago 3 -- Brett Hull scored twice, and goalie Greg Millen  continued to dominate the Blackhawks at Chicago.  </P> <P> Millen, 6-1-1 against Chicago last season, stopped 21 shots in the first two  periods.  </P> <P> Edmonton 4, Vancouver 1 -- Jimmy Carson, Kelly Buchberger, Glenn Anderson and  Mark Messier scored for the Oilers to put a damper on the debut of three Soviet  stars for the Canucks at Vancouver, Canada.  </P> <P> The Oilers, despite the first-time appearances of Igor Larionov and Vladimir  Krutov, blanked the Canucks on eight power-play attempts.  </P></p>

Karadzic had two-hour talks with special Russian envoy for  former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin in Pale today. Following the  talks, Churkin told journalists that in Belgrade today, before  leaving for Pale, he received a letter from President Boris  Yeltsin addressed to Milosevic and Karadzic; that is, the  Serbian leaders and the Serbian people.    He said the letter presents Russia's stands, which are "in  the interest of stopping the bloodshed."    "The Serbian side will have to remove all heavy artillery  around Sarajevo," Churkin said and announced that the Russian  Federation would prepare fresh troops to be dispatched to the  Sarajevo area to take part in the peacekeeping operation.    This refers to 400 Russian soldiers who will be transfered  to  the Sarajevo area from within the Russian battalion currently  deployed in the UN protected areas [in Croatia].</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / CBS to open up Black Rock: Alan Friedman reports on new tenants for a New York landmark WOULD William Paley, the founder of CBS Television, turn in his grave? That is the question being whispered around the elegant, black granite Manhattan headquarters of CBS, known affectionately as Black Rock. CBS, which has been cutting costs under the stewardship of Mr Laurence Tisch, the billionaire investor who controls the network, has decided to let a piece of the rock to outside tenants. Black Rock, set back from Sixth Avenue and distinctive for its Canadian black granite exterior, is not merely the CBS headquarters. It is a New York architectural landmark and is known fondly as The House That Paley Built. The 35-storey building, which began housing CBS staff in 1964, was designed by Eero Saarinen, the same architect who fathered both the Vivian Beaumont theatre at New York's Lincoln Center and the unusually shaped TWA terminal at Kennedy International Airport. In 1988, when CBS sold its records division to Sony of Japan, the lower floors of the building were taken over by what is now known as Sony Music. But Sony is moving its staff to another location and eight months ago Mr Tisch agreed to let up to 16 floors to the blue-chip Manhattan commercial real estate firm of Edward S. Gordon. Mr Stephen Siegel, chief executive of Gordon, said yesterday that the architects hired to refurbish the lobby had strict instructions to do nothing that would alter Black Rock's character. He also noted with pride that six floors of Black Rock have already been let to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, one of New York's leading corporate law firms. And there is interest from MasterCard, the credit card company. Still untouched, however, is the grand wood-panelled 35th-floor office suite that was once occupied by Mr Paley himself. A CBS spokeswoman, asked whether Mr Paley would turn in his grave at the thought of outsiders coming into Black Rock, declined to answer, describing the inquiry as 'tacky'. But the more commercially minded Mr Siegel had no qualms responding: 'I really don't think so. I honestly believe Paley would realise the prudence of this. The business has changed. CBS has less personnel and less need of space. I think this is a good business decision.'</p>

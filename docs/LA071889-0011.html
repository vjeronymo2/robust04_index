			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski asked Congress to create a  commission to conduct the first review of veterans health care in 25 years and  make a "take-it-or-leave-it" recommendation. Derwinski carefully excluded the  possibility of hospital closings, talking only of "changing missions" and the  like. The commission would be modeled after the one appointed last year that  recommended the closing of 86 military installations -- meaning its report  would have to be considered by the secretary and Congress as a package. If  established by Congress, the commission would examine all 172 Department of  Veterans Affairs hospitals plus hundreds of clinics and other treatment units  and would return a proposal by Jan. 1, 1991.  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher overhang concern The stories circulating around Kingfisher refused to die down yesterday as the market continued to fret over the potential impact of an acute stock overhang. More than 20m shares, used as part payment to Darty shareholders a year ago when Kingfisher bought the French electrical retailer, can now be sold under terms of the deal. The French shareholders, a mixture of institutions, family interests and Darty management, are thought to have been approached by a number of UK brokers, keen to handle such a potentially large order. According to market rumours, one international securities house which has succeeded in purchasing a large tranche of Kingfisher shares - some say around 5m - has already bought up all the stock lending facilities in Kingfisher stock for the next month. If true, and the share price were to rise, this could have the effect of driving up the Kingfisher share price higher as other brokers were forced to buy shares in the open market to cover positions instead of turning to stock lending institutions - and give the original broker a handsome profit on the price paid for the shares. Upset by the Darty speculation and undermined by a cautious agm statement on Tuesday, Kingfisher shares finished a miserable week a net 33 down, but a penny better yesterday at 516p.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Sharp rise in National Savings NATIONAL SAVINGS con-tributed Pounds 4.36bn to government funding in the 1992-93 financial year, an increase of 39 per cent on the previous year. The controversial fixed-rate First Option Bond, launched in July to increase National Savings' intake, raised Pounds 880m in the year even though it was on sale for only four months. The best-selling National Savings category was fixed-interest certificates, accounting for a net addition of Pounds 1.35bn. Index-linked savings certificates were the next most popular category with a net addition of Pounds 1.1bn. Premium Bonds made a net contribution of Pounds 229m - more than double the previous year's figure of Pounds 104m. Sales of Pounds 382m were the highest for any financial year since they were launched. Capital Bonds made a net contribution of Pounds 582m. National Savings said the amount contributed to government funding for the year was 'in line with expectations' against a background of 'falling interest rates and strong competition'. Net receipts for March amounted to only Pounds 87m. Total gross sales were Pounds 627m but National Savings made repayments of Pounds 540m. The contribution to government funding in March, including accrued interest, was Pounds 198m, with fixed-interest savings certificates making the highest contribution. The total amount invested in National Savings at the end of March was Pounds 44.1bn.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major hints at blaming Thatcher MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday said that he had disagreed with a central component of government economic thinking under his predecessor Lady Thatcher - that service industries mattered more than manufacturing. The prime minister said that his belief in the importance of manufacturing had been 'a minority view' in the 1980s - even though he was a Treasury minister during the Thatcher years and was favoured by the former prime minister as her successor. His comments appeared to suggest that he believes some of the blame for the current economic recession should lie with his Lady Thatcher. Mr Major added: 'I am not a minority view now and, anyway, I am in a better position to expound my views.' The remarks, in an interview with The Independent newspaper, mark a further substantial distancing by the prime minister from his predecessor's economic policies. Under Mrs Thatcher the Treasury put the greatest emphasis on the service industry as the engine of economic growth, while manufacturing production declined in relative importance. But asked in his interview whether he believed the argument that the service sector should be emphasised, Mr Major said: 'I don't agree with it. I didn't agree with it in the 80s.' The prime minister said that a 'different attitude' was needed to industry and commerce and that Britain undervalued engineering skills. If Britain did not remain at the leading edge of technology 'we will not grow and thrive throughout the 90s. So we have to change our attitudes.'</p>

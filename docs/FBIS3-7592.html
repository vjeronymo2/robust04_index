			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted  former Kajima Corp. Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama on Tuesday  [29 March] on a charge of bribing a former Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) legislator to seek his influence in pressuring the  Fair Trade Commission [FTC] over a bid-rigging case involving  Kajima. The indictment said Kiyoyama handed over a 10 million  yen bribe to former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on  January 13, 1992, asking him to pressure then FTC Chairman  Setsuo Umezawa not to file a criminal accusation against a  now-disbanded, 66-company "bid-rigging consultation" group in  Saitama Prefecture, of which Kajima was a key member.    Nakamura, 44, was an acting chairman of the LDP's lobby of  legislators concerning the Antimonopoly Law at the time he  allegedly complied with Kiyoyama's request, it said.    Kiyoyama, 68, is currently standing trial on a separate  charge of bribing Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of Ibaraki  Prefecture, to secure his political influence in pressuring the  local government to award a public works project to Kajima.    Kiyoyama's indictment over the FTC affair followed a  decision  earlier in the day by the nation's top prosecutors to indict  both Nakamura and Kiyoyama on bribery charges, investigative  sources said. However, the prosecutors decided to defer  Nakamura's indictment until Friday, when his court-authorized  20-day detention runs out, the sources said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> POSTERS: The latest news in AIDS education is an unusual high school poster  contest sponsored by the Red Cross and Cal State Fullerton. . . . Promos take a  jovial tone, featuring a smiling cartoon of "Andi-Body," who combats the AIDS  virus. . . . But the purpose couldn't be more serious. Contestants must  research "How Do We Stop AIDS?" -- which by last month had killed 719 people in  the county. Because the topic is a sexually transmitted disease, students need  parental permission to enter. . . . The contest deadline is today. Rick  VanderKnyff and Lanie Jones  </P></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Directors fifth in pay league DIRECTORS' basic pay net of inflation in the UK was the fifth-highest in a European league for the year to July, according to a survey by Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration advisers. The survey covered 1,350 multinational companies in 16 European countries including the UK and was based on a standard company director post in subsidiary organisations with annual turnovers of about Pounds 30m. UK directors' pay increases, at 7.9 per cent for the year to July this year, were at the upper end of the European league compared with equivalent posts in multinational subsidiaries across Europe. The highest basic salary rises recorded were in Portugal, where they averaged 19.1 per cent, and the lowest in France at 5.8 per cent. Adjustment for average levels of inflation in each country kept Portuguese directors at the head of the league with UK increases at 3.6 per cent net of inflation. The move towards homogeneity of pay, incentives and benefits among the senior managements of European international companies was seen to be gathering pace. Management Renumeration in Europe.

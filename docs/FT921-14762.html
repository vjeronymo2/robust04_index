			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Technology: Service to say 'Wow]' about - Technically Speaking Bob Galvin, president of the US electronics company Motorola, has an approach to 'service' which owes more to evangelism than the dictionary. Asked to define the term he says: 'When someone received it, they always said 'Wow]'' Few would disagree; the problem is quantifying the 'Wow]' factor in a business environment where a 'service culture' is often taken to mean little more than courses in courtesy for surly staff. Service, however, is being increasingly invoked as a source of product differentiation and competitive advantage in the 1990s. A recent survey carried out by Digital Equipment established that more than 90 per cent of 4,000 executives polled worldwide believed that service would become more important over the next five years. The fact remains that just what 'service' is, and how it can be applied to give a company an edge, is frequently misunderstood. It is often confused with quality. OTR, a consultancy based in Brussels and London, started investigating 'service' as a source of competitiveness last year. It defines service as: 'The provision of something to an individual that exceeds expectation and adds value at the same time.' An example is BT's much improved computer-based directory inquiry service which has put an end to delays and mumbled numbers: 'It was so good,' OTR says, 'that people would often call a second time just to see if this impressive improvement in service was real or just an illusion.' OTR was particularly concerned to examine the role of information technology in securing advantage. Its conclusions* are thought provoking. Managing director Colin Jackson reckons that ill-thought out use of IT has played a big part in damaging companies' attempts to improve their competitiveness through service. The study points to car manufacturer BMW's innovation in fixing charges for labour and parts in motor repairs, with bills provided through a computer system. There was, it says, an 'automation trap' in the process. The system assumed each repair was carried out in isolation but when more than one repair was done at the same time, the number of hours billed often exceeded the total time the car was physically present at the garage. Result: a clutch of unhappy customers. And some kinds of service need make no use of IT at all. A motor vehicle designer studied the simple example of a motorist putting petrol into his or her car with a view to incorporating electronics that would demonstrate that the car was safe and efficient. The options included indicators to show the state of the car with the engine turned off and ones to demonstrate the number of miles' or kilometres' worth of petrol in the tank. A technique for estimating the value of a service, called Service Assessment, which OTR is promoting, showed that a simple petrol cap retainer would be welcomed far more than sophisticated displays. The study also explains why 'sustainable competitive advantage', a buzzword of the 1980s, proved false. Service involves exceeding customer expectations, which evolve over time. 'Wow]' quickly becomes 'Ho-hum'. So competing with service means continually moving on. Advantage has to be reinvented. So do competitive methods. Service may be the touchstone for the next few years, just as quality was for the 1980s, but competition is a great leveller. The winners in the late 1990s will be those who know when to say 'Wow]' next. *How can Information Technology Help when Using Service to Compete?

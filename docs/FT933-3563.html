			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Divisions hazy in OTC derivatives clearing debate THE clearing of over-the-counter derivative products, debated at last week's annual gathering of exchange executives at Burgenstock in Switzerland, is attracting mounting attention, but the industry remains divided by vested interests. OTC instruments are currently settled bilaterally (between two counterparties), while exchange-traded contracts are settled through a clearing house, which assumes the credit exposure. The issue has highlighted the blurring of definitions of exchange-traded and OTC products. Historically, the distinction has been that exchange-traded instruments are highly homogeneous and standardised products, while OTC instruments are individually designed to suit each clients' needs, and therefore unsuitable for central clearing. The reality is that standardisation is relative. For example, parts of the dollar swap market are liquid and actively traded using the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's master agreements. Several exchanges have looked at the possibility of using their own clearing houses to settle OTC products, a potentially lucrative business. OM Stockholm already offers a service known as tailor-made clearing for certain instruments. The most advanced project is to use the Options Clearing Corporation to operate clearing for OTC market participants through Multinet, which is being set up as a New York bank by founding members, which include First National and Chase. There have also been efforts by exchanges to design products which emulate the specially-tailored characteristics of OTC swaps and options. The most successful venture to date has been the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's flex options. Other exchanges, including the American Stock Exchange - which launched its first flex options on stock indices on Friday  -and the Chicago Board of Trade - which plans to launch flex options on treasury futures - are hoping to emulate that success. However a global service offering clearing to the broader OTC market could come from a different source. The Exchange Clearing House - Echo  - will next year offer multilateral foreign exchange contract netting and settlement on a global basis. Its dozen shareholders are all banks, including Barclays, Commerzbank, Rabobank and Banque Nationale de Paris. Mr Graham Duncan, managing director of Echo, says the scope may be extended to include longer-dated, derivative instruments. However, the issue is a complex one. In the foreign exchange market, the main worry is settlement risk: overnight exposure to a credit often for very large amounts of money. In the derivatives market there is not only the initial settlement risk, but credit risk continues throughout the life of the swap. If a clearing house were involved, the clearing house, not another bank or company, would become the counterparty. This solution may not be favourably viewed by the top-rated banks, which currently not only have a competitive advantage, but are able to charge a premium of 5 or 10 basis points to their clients, because of their strong credit ratings. Since most of them are not keen to sacrifice this advantage, the chances of a pan-industry drive for derivative instruments appears slim. There is another more serious argument, which suggests that an OTC clearing house could actually increase, rather than reduce, risk. It goes like this: bank deposit guarantee schemes have proved dangerous because investors take the view that, as long as their money is guaranteed, they should go for the best return regardless of credit. Similarly, in a clearing house agreement, low-rated banks could be given excessively large credit lines by other banks because they know they do not have to worry about credit. However, there are pressures in the other direction too: regulatory and capital pressures may yet drive banks towards multilateral clearing in the OTC market.</p>

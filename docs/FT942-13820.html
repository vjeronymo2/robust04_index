			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium producers hope to broaden cuts scheme Aluminium producing countries already taking part in the international agreement to cut global production hope within two months to find a formula that will enable Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela to be included. This was informally agreed at a meeting here yesterday when trade delegates from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia and the US met to report on progress so far. Delegates said they hoped a way of widening the pact to include the other regions could be worked out by the time of their next meeting in Canberra, tentatively scheduled for June 20. US trade delegates warned, however, that producers would have to tread very warily because they might run into anti-trust problems. Russia yesterday gave details of how it planned to implement its promised annual output cuts of 300,000 tonnes by the end of this month and further cuts of 200,000 tonnes in the following three months. It also undertook to provide next month production statistics to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, the trade organisation that collects figures from most western companies. Delegates estimated that total output cuts in the west would total 1.2m. At a meeting in January the delegates agreed that global cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes a year were needed for two years to bring the aluminium market back into balance.</p>

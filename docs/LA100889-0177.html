			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VAN PELT'S THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES SPARK PITTSBURGH  </P> <P> Alex Van Pelt threw for 181 yards and three touchdowns, and eighth-ranked  Pittsburgh took advantage of six Temple turnovers for a 27-3 victory Saturday  at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Van Pelt threw touchdown passes to Henry Tuten and Reggie Williams in a shaky  first half. Pitt (4-0-1) had three interceptions, two by Robert Bradley, and  three fumble recoveries to spoil Temple's homecoming.  </P> <P> Van Pelt also threw a fourth-down, one-yard touchdown pass to Tom Huebner with  5:27 to play after Huebner recovered a fumbled punt on the Temple 30-yard line.  </P> <P> Temple (0-6) took a 3-0 lead when Bob Wright kicked a 24-yard field goal with  8:05 left in the first quarter. But mistakes ended key opportunities for the  Owls, who have not scored a touchdown in their last five games.  </P> <P> Bradley intercepted a pass by Victor Lay and returned it to the Temple 44 to  set up Pittsburgh's first score. Tuten made a diving catch of Van Pelt's pass  in the end zone for a 7-3 lead with 2:22 left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Van Pelt threw a 38-yard pass to Williams to give the Panthers a 14-3 lead with  10:27 to play in the half.  </P> <P> A 35-yard pass from Van Pelt to Tuten set up a 30-yard field goal by Frazier  and a 17-3 halftime lead as time ran out. Frazier kicked a 32-yarder in the  second half.  </P> <P> Air Force 35, Navy 7 -- Quarterback Dee Dowis threw two touchdown passes to  Steve Senn as the Falcons won their seventh in a row against the Midshipmen at  Annapolis, Md.  </P> <P> Navy (1-4) trailed by only seven late in the first half and had contained the  Air Force running game, ranked No. 1 with a 478 yards per game average. The  Falcons improved to 6-0 overall.  </P> <P> Penn State 17, Rutgers 0 -- The Nittany Lions shut down the Scarlet Knights'  offense at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> The win was the fourth in a row for Penn State (4-1). It's the Lions' longest  winning streak since 1987 and the shutout also was the first since a 41-0  victory over Cincinnati the same year. Rutgers dropped to 2-1-2.  </P> <P> Penn 24, Columbia 21 -- Bryan Keys' scored two touchdowns, including a one-yard  run with 5:22 remaining, to rally the Quakers to a victory at New York.  </P> <P> Lehigh 50, Harvard 28 -- Todd Brunner passed for five touchdowns, including  four in the first eight minutes, as the Engineers won at Cambridge, Mass.  </P> <P> Cornell 24, Lafayette 23 -- Cornerback Paul Tully batted away Frank Baur's  two-point conversion pass attempt with 21 seconds left, and Jim Hodson missed a  36-yard field goal with no time remaining as the Big Red held off the Leopards  at Ithaca, N.Y.  </P> <P> Holy Cross 33, Dartmouth 7 -- Quarterback Tom Ciaccio threw for 350 yards and  four touchdowns to lead the Crusaders to victory at Hanover, N.H.  </P> <P> Princeton 38, Brown 15 -- Judd Garrett rushed for 209 yards and scored three  touchdowns as the Friars handed the Bruins a school-record 13th consecutive  loss.  </P> <P> Yale 36, Colgate 15 -- Quarterback Darin Kehler ran for 92 yards, including a  36-yard touchdown run, to lead the Bulldogs to a win at New Haven, Conn.  </P> <P> Yale, 3-1 overall and 1-0 in the Ivy League, rushed for 273 yards. Colgate  dropped to 3-2.  </P></p>

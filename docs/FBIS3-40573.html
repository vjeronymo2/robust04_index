			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Not Induct OIC"] </F>   [Text] What had begun as a humanitarian mission in  Somalia, by now has turned into a military quagmire seething  with all foreign participants' desperate effort to get out.  Apart from over 10,000 Somalis killed during the UN military  operations, about 70 foreign peacekeepers have died. Amongst the  UN peacekeepers' casualties, 30 are of soldiers from the United  States. Technologically the strongest military machine in the  world as represented by the 9000 servicemen on US ships off the  Somalian coast, has been supporting some 30,000 UN soldiers  drawn from 28 countries.    This did not reassure most of the contributors to the UN  expedition. The American public that has yet to recover from the  Vietnam syndrome, could not stomach the sight of the dead bodies  of US soldiers dragged about in Mogadishu's streets. Elected  representatives of the American people rightly raised two basic  questions. One, what the US servicemen were doing in Somalia in  the first place. Two, which aspect of the US security was  involved in Somalia to provide constitutional justification to  President Clinton to deploy US troops in that remote African  country. Faced with mounting domestic hostility to its military  involvement in the African country, Washington had no option but  to call it a day. Some of the Europeans were smart enough to  jump ship well in time. Especially noteworthy were the Italians  who amongst all westerners knew their Somalia because of their  past colonial role in that country.    Forced by its laws and an increasingly hostile public  opinion  at home, Washington has resorted to the familiar subterfuge of  trying to achieve its objective through proxies. But the  dimensions of the conceptual flaw in the Somalian misadventure  is becoming glaring enough for the United States to wash its  hands off and shift the entire blame to UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali. Left holding the baby, it is Ghali now who is  designated as the conceiver of the Somalian operation.    Transferring the blame elsewhere, the United States is doing  the same to its Somalian military role and in this respect,  Pakistan is willing to carry most of the burden. With 5,000  soldiers, Islamabad already has the largest representation in  the UN Somalian contingent and this is increasing steadily. With  32 of its soldiers dead, Pakistan's loss is the largest amongst  all contributors to the force. Although the life of a Pakistani  is not considered as valuable as that of an American, Islamabad  should ponder over some crucial aspects of its willingness to  shoulder US burden.    It is widely known that wherever Langley House finds its  style cramped by domestic legislative restrictions, it inducts  Saudi or any other intelligence agency which collaborates with  the CIA. But by their very nature, the clandestine operations  remain hidden and have vast room for wriggling out of a tight  corner. But in any military involvement, it is not that easy to  disclaim responsibility. The UN operations around the world by  now are widely perceived as another means of furthering US  objectives. Pakistan needs to guard against emerging eventually  as what the Americans call the fall guy.    If Pakistan believes that it is doing a service to brother  Muslims in Somalia, the correct authority for the Pakistani  contingent's operations in Somalia should be the Organisation of  the Islamic Conference [OIC]. Irrespective of the OIC's  credibility as a forum of all Muslim countries operating  independent of any non- Muslim decisive influence, its  nomenclature demands action on important issues that entail  supreme sacrifice by a Muslim soldier.</p>

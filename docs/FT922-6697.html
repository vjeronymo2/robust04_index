			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fokker set on taking lead in Dasa deal FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker, yesterday insisted that it must remain the 'leading company' in any deal that involves a majority of its shares being sold to Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany and, possibly, to Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. The company, which is engaged in bilateral negotiations with Dasa, said other companies such as Aerospatiale and Alenia would be allowed to join the European consortium only if they refrain from any involvement in the development or production of aircraft which compete with those of Fokker or Dasa. If these terms are accepted, the French and the Italians would be forced to give up their hopes of developing an 80 to 130-seat regional jetliner with Dasa. Fokker is, however, leaving open the possibility that the French, the Italians and other companies such as British Aerospace would take part in a European regional jet project in which Fokker would form the nucleus. The Dutch company said that it and Dasa were in agreement that Fokker would be the 'leading company, now and in the future, in the development, building, selling and servicing of regional aircraft in the 65-130 seat range'. Fokker has always insisted it would be faster and cheaper to develop a regional jet on the basis of its existing 100-seater Fokker 100 rather than designing an entirely new aircraft. Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, chairman, yesterday emphasised that the company was holding two sets of parallel talks with Dasa and with the Dutch government, which owns 32 per cent of Fokker's shares. Earlier this week, Aerospatiale said that the Fokker talks were focused on Dasa taking a 26 per cent share, with the French and Italians to get 12.5 per cent each, giving the European 'Regioliner' consortium majority control.</p>

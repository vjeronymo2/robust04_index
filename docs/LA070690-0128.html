			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> 7,400 NAMES HANDED IN ON COUNCIL TERMS  </P> <P> About 7,400 signatures were submitted to the county registrar of voters this  week by a group of Newport Beach residents hoping to limit City Council members  to two terms.  </P> <P> The valid signatures of 6,500 registered voters are needed for the charter  amendment to qualify for the November ballot.  </P> <P> Janine Gault, a spokeswoman for the residents, said that she found a lot of  voter interest in the measure on both sides of the issue.  </P> <P> "There was very little apathy," she said. "Even if they don't agree with the  measure, people have strong feelings."  </P> <P> Although the registrar's office has 30 days in which to verify the signatures,  officials there said they are going to try to check each signature in the next  two weeks so that the City Council will know by its July 23 meeting whether the  amendment will qualify for the ballot, according to City Clerk Wanda Raggio.  </P> <P> Should the amendment make the ballot, the council will examine the possibility  of adopting an alternative measure, with wording that would allow for current  City Council members to retain their offices even if the amendment passes.  During earlier meetings, council members have said that to spend the money to  run for office and then to be removed if the amendment passes would be risky  and unfair. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

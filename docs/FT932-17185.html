			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / S African forces ring pro-ANC homeland SOUTH African troops and police ringed a pro-ANC black homeland yesterday in a show of force before South Africa's second attempt to launch multi-party talks on a transition from white rule to democracy, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Mr Craig Kotze, a police spokesman, said more than 1,000 police and an undisclosed number of soldiers threw a cordon around the south-coast Transkei homeland. 'We have to stop attacks on civilians by APLA (Azanian People's Liberation Army) members from Transkei,' he said. APLA is the military wing of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), one of 26 groups scheduled to meet the government in Johannesburg today and tomorrow for the first substantive democracy talks in more than 10 months. A PAC spokesman said APLA would continue its armed struggle. The government has accused Transkei of harbouring APLA guerrillas, which it blames for a series of recent attacks on whites. Mr Romero Daniels, APLA political commissar, denied the group was attacking white civilians but said it regarded police and security forces as legitimate targets. Major-General Bantu Holomisa, the Transkei's military ruler who has accused white military and political chiefs of planning coups and assassinations against homeland leaders, said he would meet President F W de Klerk today to discuss the crisis. Government and ANC officials expected a stormy start to the second attempt for a political settlement but added that both sides were committed to success. 'We cannot afford to have these talks break down. We have to go for broke this time,' said one government official. Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, conservative leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, was expected to make a strong pitch for an immediate commitment to federalism. The PAC and Mr Nelson Mandela's ANC said control of the army would top the agenda at the opening session. Government officials said they wanted to talk first about violence, including the murder of 10 whites, two of them children, since December and dismantling guerrilla armies. The peace process stalled last May in a dispute about regional powers and the state's role in black township violence.</p>

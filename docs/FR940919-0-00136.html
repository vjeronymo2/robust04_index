			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 18, 1992, the Service attended a public meeting held at the Red Bluff Community Center in Red Bluff, Tehama County, California. Six people presented oral and written comments to the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the comment periods, the Service received 117 comments (letters and oral testimony). Several people submitted more than one comment to the Service. The Service received two petitions containing 63 signatures of people supporting the listing and one petition containing 190 signatures of people opposed to the listing. The California Department of Parks and Recreation supported a listing of threatened for the four fairy shrimp but did not state a position on the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. The California Department of Fish and Game expressed concern for the fairy shrimp and also did not state a position on the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Comments supporting the listing were received from 41 private parties, including the Riverside County Planning Department, and nine professional biologists from several institutions, including the Stanford University Center for Conservation Biology, University of California, University of San Diego, and San Diego Museum of Natural History. Comments opposing the listing were received from 34 private parties, organizations, and agencies including seven mosquito abatement districts. Opposition to the listing also was expressed by Congressman Wally Herger and Congressman Vic Fazio. Four commenters did not express an opinion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, after the comment period closed, six parties, including the California Department of Fish and Game, requested that the Service extend the date of the final determination for the five species by six months pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(6). The Act provides for a six-month extension if the Secretary finds that ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination *&blank;*&blank;* for the purposes of soliciting additional data.'' One of these commenters submitted a report that summarized collection records and field work conducted in 1993 (Sugnet and Associates 1993b). The California Department of Fish and Game supported the extension but stated that they had no additional information. The California Native Plant Society opposed the six-month extension and urged the Service to immediately list the five species under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has reviewed all of the written and oral comments described above. Comments updating the data presented in the ``Background'' or ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' are incorporated in those sections of this final rule. Opposing comments and other comments concerning the rule have been organized into specific issues. These issues and the Service's response to each are summarized as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters stated that a single public hearing was inadequate to obtain full public input on the proposal. They requested that public hearings be held in all of the towns and counties that contain vernal pools and swales inhabited by the five species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is obligated to hold one public hearing on a listing proposal if requested to do so within 45 days of publication of the proposal (16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(5)(E)). In addition to the public hearing held on August 31, 1992, the Service attended a public meeting organized by Congressman Vic Fazio in Red Bluff, on September 18, 1992. The public comment period was extended to September 8, 1992, to allow all interested parties to provide written comments. In making a decision on a listing proposal, written comments are given the same weight as oral comments presented at hearings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several respondents stated that the Service's notification of the public on this proposal was inadequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service went through an extensive notification process to make the public aware of this proposal; this process satisfied the requirements of the Act and is described at the beginning of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many respondents concluded that listing the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp would result in adverse economic impacts to thousands of hectares of land and questioned the value of these animals to society. Two commenters requested that an analysis of the economic impact of listing these species be completed. Two commenters noted that these species are restricted to vernal pools but stated that listing would result in adverse economic impacts by eliminating future residential or commercial development in areas containing this habitat. Five commenters claimed the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are ``insignificant'' species and that listing would interfere with the natural evolutionary process of extinction. On the other hand, a number of respondents asserted that opposition to the listing of the species was based solely on economic interests. They cited the ecological and educational value of vernal pool plants and animals. Four crustacean biologists noted the species can be considered ``living fossils'' and are of great scientific value to the study of biological evolution, systematics, and ecology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, a listing determination must be based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available. The legislative history of this provision clearly states the intent of Congress to ``ensure'' that listing decisions are ``based solely on biological criteria and to prevent non-biological criteria from effecting such decisions'' H.R. Rep. No. 97&hyph;835, 97th Cong. 2d Sess. 19 (1982). As further stated in the legislative history, ``economic considerations have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species.'' Because the Service is specifically precluded from considering economic impacts in a final decision on a proposed listing, the Service has not considered possible economic consequences of listing the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. There may be many opinions as to a particular species' contribution to society, including their aesthetic, scientific, or other significance, however, this contribution is not among the five factors upon which a listing determination is based. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Communique" issued by the National Assembly Standing </F> Committee in Hanoi; date not given]    [Text] The National Assembly [NA] Standing Committee met  from 11-19 May 1994 under the chairmanship of National Assembly  Chairman Nong Duc Manh. Attending the meeting was Vice  President Nguyen Thi Binh.    1. The committee reviewed the preparations for the fifth  session of the Ninth National Assembly scheduled to open on 26  May 1994. The committee commended the government, National  Assembly agencies and other organs concerned, National Assemly  delegations, and National Assembly deputies for having made  adequate preparations to guarantee success for the session. The  committee highly appreciated the positive efforts of people of  all walks of life, sectors, and echelons in contributing views  on a number of bills. The committee studied and contributed  suggestions to a number of bills that had been reviewed based on  the views contributed by the people. The committee requested  the various compiling committees and other National Assembly  committees concerned to continue perfecting those draft  documents so that they can be presented to the National Assembly  at an early date.    The committee also gave its opinions about key issues and  fundamental contents of the draft civil code and requested the  compiling committee and the National Assembly Judiciary  Committee to continue perfecting this draft document before  soliciting the views of National Assembly deputies.    The committee studied the government reports on the  implementation of the National Assembly's resolution on a number  of tasks for 1994 and other National Assembly's resolutions on  other tasks for the first six months of the year, especially the  results of budget allocations and fulfillment of the 1994 state  budget; the development of the movement for thrift and against  wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling; and diplomatic  achievements.    The committee commended the government for having taken  quick  steps to implement the National Assembly's resolutions from the  very beginning of 1994 and for having worked out policies and  measures to direct all sectors and echelons in motivating people  throughout the country to effect positive changes and overcome  difficulties step by step, thus successfully materializing the  objectives set by the National Assembly's resolutions.    The committee took into account the fact that our state's  diplomatic activities in early 1994 had contributed to  strengthening our ties with regional countries and to broadening  our relations with friendly countries worldwide.    The committee highly valued the fine results of the recent  official friendship visits to the Republic of Indonesia and the  Islamic Republic of Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to the  Republic of India by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh,  and to the Union of Myanmar [Burma] by Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet. All those visits have contributed to strengthening the  friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and the  aforementioned countries. They have also enhanced our country's  prestige and position in the world and served the cause of  national defense and construction. The committee requested the  Government to continue to perfect reports before they can be  presented to the upcoming session of the National Assembly.    2. The National Assembly Standing Committee approved the  following three bills:    -- The bill on protecting national defense projects and  military areas. This bill is aimed at strengthening state  management; enhancing responsibility of state agencies, armed  units, socioeconomic organizations, and citizens in preserving  and protecting national defense projects and military areas,  thereby ensuring the capabilities in national defense and in  serving the cause of national construction and defense.    -- The revised bill on income tax levied on high-income  earners. This bill is aimed at ensuring social justice and  mobilizing more revenue for the state budget.    -- The revised bill on amending and supplementing some  articles of the law on land and house taxation to strengthen the  law on land and the law on agricultural land use.    Also at this conference, the National Assembly Standing  Committee reviewed the draft bill on rights and obligations of  organizations at home which have been allocated and leased with  land; and the draft bill on rights and obligations of foreign  organizations and individuals who lease land in Vietnam for  submission to the National Assembly at the upcoming session.  The National Assembly will also consider the bill on tax levied  on the transfer of rights on using land. This will serve as a  basis for the National Assembly Standing Committee to consider  and adopt relevant draft bills at its next meetings.    3. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report  on  the results of its investigation team led by National Assembly  Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy on its inspection tour to Lam Dong  Province to ensure national defense and security to comply with  the spirit of the Ninth National Assembly's fourth session  resolution.    The National Assembly Standing Committee approved the team's  report and asked the government and agencies concerned and  localities to study and implement the team's proposals.    The National Assembly Standing Committee welcomed the Lam  Dong people and combatants' efforts in developing socioeconomic  situation, maintaining national defense and security, improving  the people's daily life. It urged the province to strive to  consolidate and strengthen the all-people unity, improve  socioeconomic development, and maintain national defense and  security while resolving pressing issues as raised by the  inspection team.    4. The National Assembly Standing Committee made a decision  on the number of chief judges and judges of appeal of the  Supreme People's Court, on the table of organization of the  Supreme People's Court and of the central military court for  1994, and approved the assistant machinery of the Supreme  People's Court.    The National Assembly Standing Committee also decided on the  change of members of the Council for Selection of Judges of  Provincial and City People's Courts under the direct management  of the central government, judges of military regional courts  and courts at corresponding level, and judges of regional  martial courts.</p>

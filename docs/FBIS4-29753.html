			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  parties decided Tuesday [21 June] to reject a summons on former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to the Diet to testify on his  alleged financial irregularities, coalition sources said.    The House of Representatives Budget Committee was scheduled  to summon Hosokawa as a sworn witness for proceedings beginning  at 1 P.M.    The coalition camp will attend the committee to demand  another vote on the resolution to summon the former prime  minister, the sources said.    The coalition claimed the committee's decision to summon  Hosokawa is "invalid" because of improper parliamentary  procedures, they said.    Hosokawa will hold a news conference at 12:30 P.M. to  explain  the reason why he will not testify, they said.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (13): Eye on niche markets - Food manufacturing / An entrepreneurial case study FOOD manufacturing is one of the sectors in which Wales would like to expand, so, when one of the European industry giants, Nestle, decided to dispose of its Holgates subsidiary on the mid-Wales coast, the disappointment was palpable. At stake was a small but important stake in the manufacture of health food bars for own-label clients in the UK, Germany and elsewhere, and a total of 75 jobs - small by industry standards but crucial to tiny Tywyn. What was proving to be little more than a distraction for the Swiss group, however, was an opportunity for a management buy-out (or more accurately a 'previous owner buy-back') for managing director, Peter Saunders. Now aged 41, and a chemical engineer by training, Saunders had started his career at BP Llandarcy, after graduating from the University of Wales, moving to Holgates (then a honey farm) as production manager in 1975 before acquiring it from the owner in 1976. Nestle's involvement came about more by chance than strategic planning. Rowntree Mackintosh had come across the company in the early 1980s, by which time it had branched out into honey-based confectionery items, and was impressed with the speed with which such a tiny operation could get interesting new products to market - 'as a large business they were interested in the way a small concern operated. They realised it was all too easy for big companies to stifle initiative. While we could get a product on the shelves in six months it could take them years because it was too expensive for them to make a mistake. Our operation is much lower cost so we can afford to get things wrong,' says Peter Saunders. The fit with Nestle after its acquisition of Rowntree in 1988 at first seemed just as good. Holgates' principal products had now developed into a range of cereal and nut-based nutritional bars sold by major groups, such as Boots the Chemist, to slimmers as meal replacements, and to sportsmen seeking high carbohydrate or protein intake. Following the take-over, Nestle continued to invest heavily in the company, which currently has a capacity to produce 75m bars of 'nutritional', 'virtuous', and 'indulgent' confectionery annually at its modern plant. Eventually, it became clear, however, that a company the size of Holgates did not have a future as part of a group focusing increasingly on the development of big international food brands, and in any case was not well-suited to Nestle's corporate style. WITHIN Nestle, research tended to be concentrated in centres of excellence - and product development at the Tywyn site was run down. Sales and marketing, too, were seen as group activities. Yet, for a small company serving niche markets, the ability to carry on an active product development policy and to search vigorously for its own customers was essential. Last September, as part of the post-takeover integration of its UK operations, Nestle announced that it wished to sell Holgates, which by that time had slipped into losses, but that if a buyer did not emerge in nine months it would be closed. In the event, the food group, which had already sold Holgates' cakes-to-preserves tourist products subsidiary, the Welsh Pantry, to Peter Saunders, quickly agreed to sell the main business as well. The terms have been kept confidential but are known to be less than Pounds 1m, reflecting the losses of Pounds 0.3m made on a turnover of Pounds 2.5m in the last full financial year under Nestle ownership. The deal was put together with grant aid from Mid Wales Development, following a feasibility study by accountants Touche Ross. Loan finance was made available by the Midland Bank in Newtown. Further losses are expected this year, but profits are forecast for next, even on a pessimistic reading of the recession. With the business fully back under his control as sole shareholder, Peter Saunders intends to run it again in the way he believes right for a small entrepreneurial company serving niche markets - 'I was sure the business could work, because I could see market opportunities we were not able to tackle when we were in big company ownership,' he says. There has been some staff reductions, but an increase in the product development team. A senior sales appointment is also to be made. The main focus will continue to be own-label confectionery, and attempts are being made to win other major retailers as customers. A recent new client is Eurodisney. The company is also a big supplier of ingredients to other food companies, in particular the flavoured ingredients used in the ever-widening range of ice creams. According to Peter Saunders, however, the company's strength is that it has established itself in niches where the market is small and the competition is limited. Fortunately, too, there does not seem any very strong likelihood that interest in healthy eating - the basis on which its bar business is built - will diminish over the years ahead.</p>

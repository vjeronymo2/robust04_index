			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / MP files Tyne Tees complaint MS ANN CLWYD, the shadow heritage secretary, yesterday made a formal complaint to the Independent Television Commission alleging that Tyne Tees Television had breached pledges made when it bid for its broadcast franchise. The Labour MP has sent a report on the performance of Tyne Tees, now part of Yorkshire Tyne Tees, to Sir George Russell, chairman of the commission and to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary. Ms Clwyd argues that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire Tyne Tees plans effectively to run down the north-east as a separate broadcasting region. The commission said yesterday Ms Clwyd's complaint would be fully investigated. The investigation is expected to focus on whether there has been any breach of the obligations in the company's broadcasting licence, rather than in its franchise bid document. Ms Clwyd argues that apart from announcing more than 360 redundancies, designed to cut costs, Tyne Tees Television is now effectively controlled from Leeds and many of the north-east regional programmes promised in the franchise bid are not in its schedules. Ms Clwyd says Tyne Tees is a test case for the commission. 'The destruction of Tyne Tees as an autonomous and independent broadcaster, which is unfolding before our eyes, demands an urgent and decisive response from the ITC,' says Ms Clwyd. Earlier this year Ms Clwyd made a similar formal complaint to the commission concerning Granada Television. The commission found that Granada was not in breach of its obligations. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television. Tyne Tees Television last night reaffirmed its commitment to the terms of its licence application, and said editorial and management control would remain the responsibility of the managing director of Tyne Tees as it always has been. The company's administrative centre would remain on Tyneside.</p>

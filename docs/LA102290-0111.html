			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> Foreign companies are leaving South Korea to escape rising wages, which have  weakened the country's competitive edge, the nation's central bank says.  </P> <P> After rapid economic growth between 1986 and 1988, the economy has been hit  hard by labor strife.  </P> <P> Strikes have mushroomed since 1987, when democratic reforms began allowing  labor activism. As a result, wages have risen more than 60%.  </P> <P> "Foreigners are now seeking cheaper laborers in Asian countries like Thailand,"  said Im Jae-ho of the Bank of Korea.  </P> <P> The central bank said 111 foreign companies left in the first nine months of  this year, compared to 27 in the same period of 1989. Meanwhile, only 177  opened new offices the first nine months -- against 254 a year earlier.  </P> <P> "Companies dealing in low value-added goods like garments and shoes seem to  want to switch to other Asian countries," Im said.  </P></p>

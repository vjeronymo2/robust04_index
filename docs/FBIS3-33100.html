			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alfredo Diaz Urbay, director of the Labor Research  Institute, said that, up until 31 January, a total of 141,637  people were self-employed. Self-employment is based on Decree  Law No. 141, which permits the practice of 136 different types  of jobs. According to Diaz, more that 70 percent of the people  authorized for self-employment fill less than 20 percent of the  activities permitted, of which the most common are wagon worker  [cochero], carpenter, hair dresser, pushcart worker  [carretonero], and manicurist.    As you know, Decree Law No. 141 states that the regulations  are dictated by two state committees: the State Committee for  Labor and Social Security, and the State Committee of Finances.  The first grants permission for self-employment and the second  deals with collection, since authorized persons must purchase a  license. This money is income for the state budget.    The State Committee of Finances has announced that the  implementation of an overall tax system is being considered,  which, if approved, would include people who are self-employed.</p>

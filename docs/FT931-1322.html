			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Poll shows Lamont's record unpopularity THE public has issued a resounding rejection of the Budget, and Mr Norman Lamont is the most unpopular chancellor since the second world war, a poll shows, Ivo Dawnay writes. According to the findings of a Gallup survey for The Daily Telegraph, the so-called 'feel good' factor has plummeted from minus 14 per cent before the budget to minus 44 per cent, the worst figure ever recorded by the polling organisation. Mr Lamont's ratings now show that only 18 per cent of a weighted sample of 1,007 voters across Britain think he is doing ' a good job,' the lowest rating for a chancellor since the question was first put in 1949. Some 70 per cent think he is not performing well.</p>

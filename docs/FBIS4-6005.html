			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- The General Federation  of Trade Unions of Korea [GFTUKK] and the World Federation of  Trade Unions [WFTU] published a joint statement here on April 17.    According to it, a delegation of the WFTU consisting of its  Secretary General Alexandr Jarikov and Secretary Debkumar  Ganguli paid a visit to the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea from April 12, 1994, at the invitation of the GFTUK.    The secretary general of the WFTU, in the name of the  delegation, congratulated Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader  of the Korean people and president of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, on his birthday and sincerely wished him good  health and a long life.    The GFTUK noted with high estimation that the WFTU has made  a  great contribution to the people's struggle against imperialist  and neo-colonialist aggression and for freedom and sovereignty  under the current international situation marked by a manifold  crisis.    The GFTUK also expressed satisfaction with the consistent  efforts of the Asian and Pacific regional office of the WFTU to  tighten the relations of friendship and cooperation among the  trade unions in the Asian and Pacific region on the basis of  independence.    The WFTU delegation got deep impressions everywhere it went,  witnessing Korean working people under the guidance of the  Workers' Party of Korea and its leaders making strenuous efforts  to further consolidate socialism, a society free from domination  and subjugation, exploitation and oppression, poverty and  unemployment, the age-old desire of mankind, fighting against  the U.S. imperialists maneuvers.    The WFTU delegation resolutely denounced the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea, demanded that the U.S.  authorities give up their intrigues, and urged the United  Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency not to allow  their names and authority to be abused.    The WFTU delegation reaffirmed its unflinching support to  the  stand of the DPRK to turn the Korean peninsula into a  nuclear-free, peace zone and achieve an independent and peaceful  reunification of the country by founding the Democratic  Confederal Republic of Koryo.    The GFTUK and WFTU manifested their common stand that all  the  peace- and justice-loving anti-imperialist forces should firmly  unite on the joint front against the ever-increasing imperialist  and neo-colonialist aggressive policies in order to realize  democratization of the international community and establish an  equitable new international economic order.    Both sides called upon the world's working class, the most  active defender of justice and truth and the very one  immediately responsible for the independent rights and demands  of the laboring masses, to take the lead in this struggle.    Both sides expressed sympathy with the view that the 13th  WFTU congress would occasion a new turn in developing the WFTU  into an organization capable of facing up to challenges of the  changed situation.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil fails to secure more Securiguard Rentokil, the property and environmental services company, has again extended its offer for Securiguard until June 25. By the second closing date yesterday, Rentokil had received acceptances representing about 1.35 per cent of Securiguard's shares, unchanged on a week ago. Securiguard has urged shareholders to continue to reject the offer, which it described as 'ridiculously low'.</p>

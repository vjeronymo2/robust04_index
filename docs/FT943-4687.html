			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar, bond weakness take bourses down again The prevailing theme of this year's sickly but still expensive European equity markets reasserted itself yesterday as the dollar and bond markets weakened again, and bourses shuddered in their wake, writes Our Markets Staff. Professionals had been expecting a shift in transmission, from interest rates to fundamentally driven markets, said a senior trader in Frankfurt yesterday. But while some company results, such as those of Daimler and the Big Three chemicals, had been adequate, the German corporate sector was still stuck with weak profits performance from its financials, and the ongoing weakness in bonds was not making the latter any more attractive. FRANKFURT's moments of truth came in the last hour of Ibis trading. The DAX index fell only 8.62 to 2,165.90 on the session, and held that general level for a good part of the afternoon. However, dealers were watching the September bund future in the last half-hour of Ibis trading, as it broke through 90 on the downside to hit 89.99, recovered to 90 flat and then subsided again to around 69.95 at the end of the equity day. The Ibis-indicated post bourse close of 2,158.07 betrayed no obvious sense of panic. But dealers were wary as turnover came out at DM4.9bn, against DM4.7bn on Monday. Mr Detlev Klug at B Metzler in Frankfurt said German fund managers would be more interested in equities at 2,200 than they were at the present level; in the interim, he said, cash market volume was very low and derivatives trading could have an undue effect on share prices. Against this background, positive news from Volkswagen on car sales did nothing for the shares, down DM2.50 at DM484.50, while Metallgesellschaft's need for more capital, seen as a major sell signal by Mr Hans Peter Wodniok of Robert Fleming late on Monday, left the MG shares DM16, or 8 per cent, lower at DM184. PARIS was more sensitive than Frankfurt to the drop in German bonds, but it lost further ground towards the close on news that the chairman of St Gobain, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, was being questioned by an investigating judge. The CAC-40 index fell 36.75, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,961.45 in turnover of FFr2.7bn. St Gobain was the most heavily traded stock as it fell FFr28, or 4.2 per cent, to FFr638. Axa was involved in corporate deals in Belgium and Hong Kong, but analysts said its fall of FFr9.70, or 3.8 per cent, to FFr243.30 was simply a reflection of bond market weakness and its effect on financials. Among other big losers, Dior fell FFr11.80 to FFr434 on talk of an upcoming equity issue and its parent, Bon Marche, suffered even more with a drop of FFr35 to FFr755. ZURICH paused after its strong run and the SMI index, which had risen by 5.7 per cent over the last fortnight, gave up 22.1 to 2,652.4. Trading was thin in the absence of foreign demand, which had given support in recent days. Roche certificates remained at the centre of attention, easing SFr60 to SFr6,295. Among the chemicals majors only Sandoz bearers were firmer, adding SFr1 at SFr714; but in the second tier, Ems continued its recent run, climbing SFr20 to SFr4,230. BBC bearers eased SFr16 to SFr1,181 as analysts said that a presentation on Monday by the ABB chief executive Mr Percy Barnevik had provided no fresh information. MILAN trimmed early losses as some buying developed at the end of a session weighed upon by fears of a renewed row between the government and the judiciary, and still waiting for action on budget deficit cuts. The Comit index finished 10.25, or 1.5 per cent, lower at 662.99 after a government spokesman said that a magistrates' plan to speed corruption investigations was unacceptable; but Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, gave it a cautious welcome later. Blue chips were out of favour with foreign investors, while some domestic selling was seen during the session. Among the heaviest losers, Credito Italiano dropped L60, or 2.8 per cent, to L2,095, while Pirelli was L90, or 2 per cent, off at L4,400. BCI, under pressure in recent days, managed a L20 gain to L3,570 as its L2,360bn capital increase continued. AMSTERDAM fell sharply at the close as local investors and options dealers sold heavily, following losses in bonds and other stock markets. The AEX index shed 3.69 to 414.28. Financials were all weaker, with Ing down Fl 1.80 at Fl 78.40, ABN-Amro by 70 cents at Fl 59.30 and Fortis Amev by 80 cents at Fl 74.00. Ahold, the food retailer, jumped Fl 1.10 to Fl 48.40 in the wake of its higher second-quarter net profit figures and a forecast of higher full-year profits. Another food company, Nutricia, picked up Fl 2.40 to Fl 89.00 as takeover rumours revived. Boskalis, the dredging and engineering group, finished 70 cents down at Fl 41.20 after an announcement that its trust group had sold 4.6m ordinary Boskalis shares to ABN-Amro Holding, at Fl 40.80. The publishers VNU and Wolters Kluwer were both lower, at Fl 193.00, down Fl 4.20, and Fl 119.20, off Fl 2.10, respectively. VNU's loss was attributed to profit-taking. MADRID added a generalised sense of instability in the financial system to its interest rate fears and the general index fell 4.42, or 1.5 per cent, to 295.08 in turnover of Pta23.9bn. The obvious targets, interest rate-sensitives such as utilities and banks, were selectively savaged, with Fecsa, Iberdrola and Endesa down by Pta25 to Pta800, Pta30 to Pta823 and Pta150 to Pta5,300, and Bankinter and Popular off Pta400 and Pta390 respectively to Pta11,300 and Pta14,350. WARSAW, where the Wig index was above 20,000 in March, fell below the 10,000 level, the key index losing 851.8, or 8.2 per cent, at 9,565.4 following more evidence of hostilities between Poland's finance minister, Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, and its central bank president, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz.

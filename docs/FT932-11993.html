			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plan focuses on skills training PLANS FOR a Labour economic strategy emphasising greater investment in skills training - and aiming the party away from engaging too heavily in debate with Tories on taxation - will be unveiled this weekend. The document drawn up by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, forms part of Labour's rolling policy review and will be presented next week to its elected National Policy Forum, which represents all sections of the party. are Papers on Europe policy and on constitutional reform, excluding proportional representation, are also to be submitted to the forum. Mr Brown argues that over the next decade the competitive advantages of industrialised nations will stem increasingly from the quality of their workforce, rather than in-digenous resources. He attempts to shift the debate in the Labour party away from taxation and public borrowing - traditionally weak areas for the party in elections - and towards how the state, possibly in conjunction with the private sector, can improve education, training and infrastructure. The focus on workforce skills fits with calls by Mr John Smith, Labour leader, for the party to put an increasing emphasis on fostering the aspirations of individuals. Mr Brown's paper, presented as a fundamental assesment of Britain's economic prospects into the next century, argues for a system of managed exchange rates, perhaps based on a reformed European exchange rate mechanism. It calls for a greater emphasis on measures aimed at tackling unemployment. The paper is expected to be discussed at Labour's annual conference in October.</p>

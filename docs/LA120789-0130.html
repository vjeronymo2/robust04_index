			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE CLAIMS BIAS, HAS JUDGE TAKEN OFF 3RD CASE AGAINST MOBIL  </P> <P> Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord, who has seen two cases he filed against  Mobil Oil Corp. thrown out by Municipal Court Judge Thomas P. Allen Jr., has  forced the judge off a third case against the oil company.  </P> <P> Lord alleged in a motion he filed Monday that Allen is prejudiced and cannot be  impartial in the case. Such motions cannot be opposed and are routinely  granted.  </P> <P> Allen was out of town and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "I gave Allen his walking papers," Lord said. "This is the first time this  office has done it in the five years I have been here."  </P> <P> Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said: "I was surprised."  </P> <P> In the case, Mobil was cited for 170 misdemeanor counts of violating the state  safety code. The alleged violations were uncovered during an intensive safety  audit of the refinery in 1988 performed by the federal Occupational Safety and  Health Administration. Lord based his case on the federal investigation.  </P> <P> In an interview Tuesday, Lord pointed to the most recently dismissed case  against Mobil. He said the judge had already made up his mind about misdemeanor  cases stemming from an OSHA investigation.  </P> <P> Last week, Allen dismissed a case against Mobil and one of its contractors on  the grounds that the case stemmed from an OSHA investigation. A worker was  burned over 40% of his body and another was injured when flammable hydrocarbon  liquids spilled onto hot pipes Aug. 5, 1988.  </P> <P> Explaining his decision at the time, Allen said that "once OSHA has  jurisdiction, that's it. Nobody else has jurisdiction."  </P> <P> Referring to Allen's dismissal, Lord said: "Mobil's lawyers made a good  presentation in court. They talk very eloquently and they sound good. They have  the top lawyers in the state.  </P> <P> "To some small degree, (Allen) may have been assuming that what they were  saying . . . should be given more credence than what I say. Allen was persuaded  to their position even though, I think, the law is clear.  </P> <P> "Rather than going back to Allen, I figured it would be better to put it before  a judge who doesn't already have a preconceived notion of what the decision  should be."  </P> <P> Lord said he will appeal Allen's decision involving the August, 1988, accident,  adding that legal decisions favor the position that a federal safety  investigation does not preempt state misdemeanor charges.  </P> <P> "If there is a misdemeanor in the city of Torrance, I have authority and  jurisdiction to prosecute it," Lord said. "This is the first time someone has  come into court and advanced a serious argument that I don't."  </P> <P> David Guthman, chief of the environmental crimes unit of the Los Angeles County  district attorney's office, agreed with Lord's assessment.  </P> <P> Guthman's office has filed an appeal in the other case against Mobil that Allen  dismissed.  </P> <P> Originally brought by Lord, the case named Mobil, refinery manager Wyman Robb  and then second-in-command Tom Gregory as well as three officials of Cal Cat  Chemical Co., a Mobil contractor based in Benicia.  </P> <P> The case concerned an explosion July 15, 1988, that killed a man and injured  two others. The three were part of a Cal Cat Chemical crew cleaning sludge from  storage tanks.  </P> <P> Shortly after Lord filed the case July 15, the district attorney took it over  to pursue the possibility that felony manslaughter charges would be filed. The  city prosecutor's office handles only misdemeanor charges.  </P> <P> Allen dismissed that case Oct. 30, saying the state law applied only to the  employer of the dead or injured employees -- Cal Cat Chemical -- and not to  Mobil.  </P> <P> PIPELINE PROJECT: Replacement plan opposed.

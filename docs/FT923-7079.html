			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Letter: New law not necessary to achieve board accountability Sir, Dr Maurice Gillibrand (Letters, August 11) is wrong in his premises and his conclusion that further legislation is needed to make company boards accountable. First, he is wrong to believe the CBI opposes the Cadbury Committee's recommendations. Rather, the CBI finds many positive features in the code at the centre of the Cadbury committee's draft report. Much of it represents what CBI members consider best practice. But we reject Cadbury's proposal that a statement of compliance with the code in the annual report and accounts be made a Stock Exchange listing obligation. Disclosure in this form will be bureaucratic because a statement which is both a listing obligation and subject to review by auditors will have to pass muster with a company's lawyers. Ques-tions of interpretation will inevitably be raised, and explanatory notes and more detailed rules will surely follow. The proposal is also unnecessary because it ignores how compliance will be achieved in practice. The code is, in effect, a checklist against which boards can measure themselves. It is also a tool which institutional investors can use; it is they who can effectively urge reform on boards which are failing to perform. They do not need the mechanism of a listing obligation. Dr Gillibrand asserts that boards have become self-perpetuating. This scarcely squares with the evidence of changes in the leadership of companies where shareholders have become dissatis-fied. For accountability to achieve its purpose, it needs to be exercised by regular process rather than dramatic intervention. Annual general meetings can be part of that process; and active participation by shareholders should be encouraged. We have urged that the responsibilities of shareholders (especially the institutions), as owners of the business, be spelt out in the Cadbury code. Institutional shareholders should, whenever possible, use their voting rights and declare to companies in which they have invested how they intend to exercise them Finally, Dr Gillibrand is wrong to conclude that more company legislation is needed and that two-tier boards should be part of reform. Matters in the code such as the calibre and independence of non-executive directors cannot be legislated. It is an error to suppose that the supervisory board can be transplanted from a country in which it has deep roots (back to the 1920s in Germany) and be fruitful in quite another tradition. Cadbury has already prompted many companies to review their board structures and procedures. The CBI looks forward to carrying the debate forward at its national conference in Harrogate in November at which Sir Adrian Cadbury will be presenting his recommendations.

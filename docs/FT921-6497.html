			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Kohl sidesteps Sudeten Germans row GERMANY'S treaty of friendship and good neighbourliness with Czechoslovakia will be signed today in Prague by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Vaclav Havel, to the considerable relief of both parties. In spite of the desire of the two governments to lay the basis for close co-operation, the treaty has reopened deep historical wounds, and caused political ructions in both countries: from the left in Czechoslovakia, and from the right in Germany. On the positive side, the treaty recognises the inviolability of their border, thus providing some reassurance for Czechoslovak sensibilities. And it underpins Germany's considerable investment - at least two-thirds of the estimated Dollars 850m in foreign capital which has flowed into the country over the past two years - with assurances of inter-governmental co-operation in a range of fields from the economy to culture and the environment. But anxieties have been aroused by what the treaty leaves out. Mr Kohl and his Foreign Minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, have had to face down the opposition of their coalition allies from the Bavarian-based, and distinctly conservative, Christian Social Union (CSU), to get the treaty signed. The CSU wanted the treaty to include some support for the property claims of up to 2.5m Sudeten Germans, expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945 after the defeated German troops withdrew, most of whom now live in Bavaria. Since the collapse of communism in Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten Germans have lobbied aggressively to regain their former properties. Under the current Czechoslovak restitution law, properties confiscated before the communist takeover in 1948 cannot be given back to former owners. The Czechoslovak government has refused to include any provision in the treaty for outstanding property claims. Bowing to German pressure would have undermined its position in coming elections. Mr Kohl has overcome his political problems with fast footwork, made to look like confusion. He promised the CSU a parliamentary debate and resolution to back up the case of the Sudeten Germans. But the three coalition partners failed to agree on any text, and the debate has been postponed until after the signing. Mr Havel, meanwhile, has faced growing demands from the left-wing political parties in Prague to include a declaration in the treaty that the Munich agreement signed by Hitler in 1938, and used as the basis for the German occupation of the Sudetenland, was 'null and void.' The German government has refused to declare the accord null and void, on the grounds that such an action would make illegal everything which occurred in the Sudetenland between 1938 and 1945, including the registration of births and marriages, and property transactions, too. Instead, the treaty refers to 'the continuation of the Czechoslovak state since 1918.' This has only served to infuriate Slovak deputies, because it does not refer to the four years during the Second World War when Slovakia was a pro-Nazi independent state. Slovak as well as Czech deputies have to ratify the treaty in the next few months. See feature on German investment in Czechoslovakia</p>

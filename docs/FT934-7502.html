			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: A Rackham-ish 'Rusalka' at the Met David Pountney's production at the London Coliseum taught us that Rusalka is a white opera set in a Victorian nursery; at the Met it looks rather different. The company has taken over from Vienna and Houston a version by set designer Gunther Schneider-Siemssen and director Otto Schenk. The stage looks vaguely Arthur Rackham-ish, though with all the poetry dissipated by the colouring and the 3D enlargement. There is a good deal of flouncing about in gauzy costumes, and a good deal of rising up from or descending into a pool of glittering plastic. With bumpy follow-spots that emphasize the staginess, this is not a pretty show to look at. Nor does it sound pretty. John Fiore, who conducts, does so brashly, so that one hears the broad strokes Dvorak borrowed from Wagner, not the delicacy he supplied himself. The unfortunate score is made to appear pretentious, exerting itself in directions it cannot pursue - though one can well understand thatwhen the conductor has to spend three long acts looking at heavy Slavic twilights on stage. Unhelped by conductor, director or designer, the cast are doomed souls, except for those who use a bit of vigorous character-acting. Among the latter are Wendy White as the arms-akimbo Kitchen Boy, and Dolora Zajick and Sergei Koptchak, whose performances as Jezibaba and the Water-Gnome are strongly drawn. Janis Martin as the Foreign Princess is not in good voice, and Neil Rosenshein never seems a likely Prince. At the opening performance he was in trouble from the start, weak and wayward in pitch, and in the closing scene he almost disappeared from hearing. Gabriela Benackova in the title role offers much pleasure, but not quite enough. The creaminess in her singing, though lovely, is too material for a water spirit, and the voice grazes itself when it has to touch to the bottom note or two. She is at her best in the song to the moon, which this ramshackle production leaves standing as a solitary set-piece. All the rest  -two and a half acts of it - seems, at best, unnecessary.</p>

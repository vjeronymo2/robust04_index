			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pol Van Den Driessche: "Flanders Concluding </F> First Treaty With Poland"]    [Excerpts] For the first time in recent history, Flanders  will conclude an international treaty. During early June in  Warsaw, Flemish Prime Minister Luc Van den Brande will sign a  cooperation treaty between Flanders and Poland. It will  probably be followed by a Flemish-Hungarian treaty. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Aid </H5>   The establishment of the treaty was preceded by many years  of  preparation and cooperation. Through the New Europe Fund, the  Flemish Government invested 200 million Belgian francs in  cooperation projects with Poland. The talks were concluded last  month. The treaty covers virtually all fields which fall within  the Flemish Parliament's competence. It deals with the  development of the SME [small- and medium-sized companies]  sector, with professional training and labor relations, with  evolutions in the field of environment, and with culture.    The draft treaty will be submitted to the federal  government,  which will verify within 30 days whether or not the treaty goes  against federal powers. No one is expecting any problems, even  though it is no secret that the Belgian foreign minister is not  at all pleased with the phenomenon that regions are going  "offshore" in an increasingly independent way.    After that, nothing else will stand in the way of the  treaty's signature, which is scheduled for 6 or 7 June in the  Polish capital. Then the Flemish Council will have to approve  it. Only then will the Flemish-Polish treaty be ratified and  have international force of law.</p>

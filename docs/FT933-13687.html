			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Through a glass, darkly: If nothing else, the case for plain-speaking over Northern Ireland is now overwhelming Today he remarked how a shower of rain Had stopped so cleanly across Golightly's lane It might have been a wall of glass That had toppled over. He stood there, for ages, To wonder which side, if any, he should be on.  - 'The Boundary Commission' Paul Muldoon THE REVEREND Ian Paisley, scourge of liberals, Catholics and Irish romanticism, who towers over Northern Ireland politics like the Mourne mountains weep over Carlingford loch, was not being helpful. As I tested, gingerly, his reaction to my plan for Irish unification, his words of foreboding were as sulphurous as any in Paisley's three decades as Free Presbyterian minister and hard-line Unionist leader. 'God knows what will happen. There could be assassinations everywhere. It could be like Yugoslavia.' The British sell-out is already under way, he rasped. The effect could be read in people's faces and in loyalist violence. 'I go to funerals and it used to be that people talked. If they go today, they just walk. It's deep, deep, bitter resentment and anger.' Sitting in the small study of his voluminous Belfast home, Paisley glanced at a photograph of loyalist folk-hero Edward Carson, whose militia trooped in 1912 against Home Rule. Next to it on the wall were the wooden training gun and bandoleer of Paisley's father. There was no doubt that he was prepared to raise the loyalist standard again. To have expected anything less would have been naive. Paisley's career has been built on bogeyman politics; the apostates and Papists could not now be let through the glass partition. But the need for a positive contribution to stir debate and counter the rhetoric of Paisley and his followers is overwhelming. Terrorism abounds, but among politicians there is only imagery, stubborn threats - and an overwhelming sense that for one side to give just a little would be to shatter hundreds of years of history like a glass window caught in a downtown explosion. The province's political landscape has hardly changed since the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement when Margaret Thatcher and Dr Garett Fitzgerald, the UK and Irish prime ministers, agreed that the south should have a token say in the north's affairs. Since then the governments have looked to local nationalist politicians and those who want to preserve the union with the UK to dismantle the defences they have themselves erected. Northern Ireland is the biggest problem facing two west European governments. Each year about 100 people die. Damage to property in the province and on the British mainland runs into billions of pounds. Yet the recent Opsahl report on Northern Ireland, by independent commissioners, said: 'The British government's insistence that it is an honest broker, and that the ingredients of a settlement must be worked out by the two communities, adds to the recipe for conflict.' Hence my trip to see Ian Paisley, to look for a way beyond the miasma. To say Irish unification is a bold proposal is an understatement. There are doomsters aplenty, arguing that the Unionist veto that led to partition in 1921 is as potent as any time since the Protestant settlers of the 1600s. But there is a robust logic to the case for unity that - if all ways forward are to be explored - justifies testing. Leap forward a few years. A Northern Ireland secretary sits in his panelled office overlooking Horseguards' Parade, Whitehall. He baulks as news arrives of the latest terrorist atrocity. Loyalist killings, supposedly in the name of King Charles III, are rampant. His own life has been threatened by Protestant Red Hand Commandoes. Bombings by the nationalist IRA on the mainland have not stopped. But the newly-formed Democratic Unionist Paisley Memorial Party and the larger, more moderate Ulster Unionist Party are encased in a glassy silence, refusing to talk to the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. The secretary of state, who was at primary school when 'the troubles' erupted, sighs and begins to draft a House of Commons statement: 'Mr Speaker, His Majesty's government is concerned about uncertainty over Northern Ireland's future. The provisional IRA believes it can bomb the British out of the province; loyalist paramilitaries kill nationalists in retaliation. 'I emphasise that the government will never give in to terrorism, but we accept that the people of Northern Ireland have a right to know about their future. 'Over the 40 years since the 'troubles' erupted, many suggestions have been made for accommodating unionist and nationalist aspirations. Few have won support among more than a handful; none has endured. 'We believe there are only two practical choices. First, that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK in perpetuity. We could massively escalate the security apparatus. Many Sinn Fein and IRA supporters could be interned. A system of local government, as in English counties, could be introduced. But the breaches of civil liberties would be indefensible, the alienation of nationalists would deepen, the 1985 agreement would have to be torn up and the geographical anomaly of a land divided along a border drawn up after the first world war explicitly to create a protestant majority would remain. 'The second option is a united Ireland (gasps). We intend to open negotiations with the Dublin government about creating a new Ireland with protection for religious freedom and a powerful devolved Ulster assembly. 'Northern Ireland citizens will keep rights to British passports and to live in the UK. We see the new Ireland as having a special link with the UK, particularly in a European context. We envisage the UK Treasury subsidy to Northern Ireland, worth Pounds 3bn in 1993, continuing for many years. An extra 10,000 troops are being sent tonight to the province to reinforce the police against loyalist paramilitaries. 'It is a big step but, just as we cannot bow to IRA terrorism, we cannot allow the threat of a loyalist terrorist revolution to dictate the agenda.' (Uproar, shouts of 'Never', Ian Paisley Junior MP and 12 other Unionist MPs plus two dozen Conservative MPs storm out of the chamber. 'Order, Order.') Could it happen? Could a deal be struck between London and Dublin? How violent would be the backlash of unionists? Would the people of Ulster ever agree? In Dublin, the aspiration to unite Ireland exists, but with the anger, disarray and killings it would cause among compatriots in the north so obvious, there is little appetite to turn dreams into realities. At the Department of Foreign Affairs, a warren-like house off St Stephen's Green, stacks of the 1984 New Ireland Forum Report fill a room. This is the text from which the policy of the Fianna Fail and Labour party coalition government is still drawn. Compiled by nationalists opposed to violence, it prefered a united Ireland, 'achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the Unionist and nationalist identities.' So much is encouraging. But the words were carefully chosen. The emphasis at the foreign affairs department under Labour's Dick Spring is on 'agreement and consent'. He has angered the British government in the last week by floating ideas such as 'joint-soveignty' - but only as proposals that could be put to political leaders or voters in the province. It is striking talking to officials and politicians in Dublin how unification talk is regarded as blarney. I was left with a palpable sense of hypocrisy. 'There is no question,' one senior diplomat told me, 'of us imposing ourselves on the people of Northern Ireland.' There is horror at the prospect that Dublin might have to foot the bill for policing Northern Ireland and subsidising its welfare state. The British Treasury's Pounds 3bn annual subsidy is equivalent to a third of Ireland's total tax revenue. Already the Irish Republic spends three times as much on security per capita than the British. In the Dail there still hangs a copy of the 1916 proclamation of independence, asserting: 'We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies.' But on the opposition benches, Prionsias DeRossa, leader of the Democratic Left and former president of the Workers Party - which sprang out of the official IRA when it declared a ceasefire - is now prominent in the campaign for Ireland's constitutional claim on the north to be amended. He was interned in the late 1950s but renounces terrorism because: 'You don't win freedom by denying someone else their freedomcatastrophe.' Far more immediate are the problems of a 19 per cent unemployment rate. Middle class families who have moved from north to south Ireland complain about low child benefit, the cost of health care or education and of poorer roads. Northerners' suspicions, particularly of the continuing dominance of the Roman Catholic church, are reflected in inward reappraisal among the Dublin political establishment. 'Society in the republic is going through a process of rapid change,' says Ivan Yates, a protestant Fine Gael member of the Dail: 'Traditional values and beliefs and the influence of religion are all parts of this process of change.' Thus impetus for unification would have to come from Britain. Backing for unification by consent has come close: it is Labour party policy and, except after a particularly horrendous atrocity, Northern Ireland rarely rates as a political issue at Westminster. There is a sense of despair and - let us be frank - indifference as long as the number of casualties appears containable. Formal links between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionist Party are all but broken. Under James Molyneaux, UUP leader, the party's MPs sit on the opposition benches. Statuesque friends of the union like Enoch Powell and Ian Gow have retired or been murdered by the IRA. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, says Britain has no economic or strategic interest in Northern Ireland. He uses a careful formula: the province will remain part of the UK so long as a majority of its population want to stay. The Northern Ireland Office would object strongly, but it does not take much twisting of words to convert that into saying that Britain would back unity by consent. Andrew Hunter, Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee chairman, complains that the government's policy encourages the 'one more heavers' in the IRA. But indifference now is far from saying that unification could win support among Conservative MPs. Such a move would depend critically on whether a deal could be peacefully achieved. At this point the argument for unification by consent begins to fall apart. For it is apparent to any visitor to Northern Ireland that there could never be agreement on anything other than that Ulster's tragedy is deep indeed. It is wrong, for example, to suppose that Northern Ireland's Roman Catholics will soon outnumber the Protestants. Censuses have been misleading because until recently Catholics were urged by Sinn Fein not to answer the voluntary religion question. So the Catholic population is shown as jumping from 28 per cent to 38.4 per cent over the past decade. Smoothing out such aberrations, Professor Paul Compton,of Queens University, Belfast, reckons the Catholic population is growing by roughly 2 percentage points a decade. 'If you extrapolate that it still gives you between 40 and 50 years before you have a Catholic majority and it will probably be another 20 years before there is a Catholic majority in the voting population. Whether they will all want a united Ireland as well is another question.' But the defences against encroaching nationalism are already being raised. In a spartan office above a parade of shops in Lisburn, Ray Smallwood and David Adams puff nervously at cigarettes. They are chairman and secretary of the Ulster Democratic Party - ostensibly a fringe unionist party, committed to peaceful means, but regarded as voicing the thoughts of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association, a shadowy umbrella organisation for working class unionists and loyalist paramilitaries. 'The British people of Ulster know,' says Smallwood, 'that the 1985 Anglo-Irish dictat is about a process of unification by the back door.' UDP membership, he reckons, is more than 200. What would happen if unification moved closer? 'If my right to self determination was taken away. . . ' His voice trails. He pauses, then looks at me. 'All people have a right to self-determination.' That unspoken threat of the protestant population rising in revolt is prevalent across Northern Ireland, not just in the hearts of organised extremists. It worries the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The loyalist terror groups, the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force, are not as numerous as the nationalist IRA but older leaders have been purged, replaced by more ruthless, younger commanders. The security forces believe members move in and out, making infiltration harder. So far they remain largely a reactive force, retaliating against the IRA. The UFF and UVF have access to guns and grenades but as yet have no bomb-making facilities. Arms come from east Europe, South Africa and via pockets of Orange loyalism in Scotland and north England. Financing is via large-scale racketeering and extortion. At a time of perceived crises, however, the number of paramilitaries could quickly rise to wreak havoc across the province. The mostly-Protestant RUC itself, and the Royal Irish Regiment, would be under pressure to avert revolt within their ranks. In the middle class belt that stretches eastwards along Belfast lough from Northern Ireland's capital, the stubborn resistance of the Ulsterman is obvious. Talking to locals about unification closes doors, not opens them. Two local businessmen I approached refused to talk, even about the massive scope for cross-border trade (only 5 per cent of the republic's exports are to the north). They were probably sensible - strong words could catch the ears of paramilitaries looking for economic targets. Go into people's homes, and talk of unification is treacherous. Suspicion of the Irish republic - regarded as a safe haven for nationalist paramilitaries  -is rampant. 'There is too much history, too many people have been killed. These things are not forgotten. I'd leave the country,' said one professional family man I met. At Bangor Rugby Club I met Ronnie Boston, former club president and a retired local businessman. The club is a member of the all-Ireland rugby league but limits are firmly drawn: 'There was no conscription here during the war,' he says, 'but 100,000 people volunteered so it would anger me if Britain did announce that it was going to let Northern Ireland go. Our ancestors laid down their lives for the British.' Such realities are not lost on leaders of the nationalist community. John Hume, veteran leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told me that a 32-county Ireland 'can only evolve and it can only evolve based on diversity.' He does not talk about divided territory, only divided people. 'Ireland is already one piece of land.' The SDLP looks to the model of European union - even though the Unionist community is among the most Euro-sceptical in the UK. So the glass walls remain. The most poignant impression is of how the province is seen through prisms in London and Dublin. The republic acts as if pursuing unity but clearly could not accept unification without consent, and consent will not be forthcoming. The UK government wants a locally-acceptable settlement but seems blind to the uncertainty and fear its neutral position creates. At least Ian Paisley is unequivocal. A first step towards peace would be for both governments to be explicit about what they want. Is Dublin serious about unification? If not, why not say so? The air of dangerous confusion might clear. If both governments can agree on the province's constitutional future, a common strategy could be devised to tackle terrorism and economic deprivation. There would be some certainties. It would be far better than politicians in London and Dublin standing there wondering which side, if any, they should be on.</p>

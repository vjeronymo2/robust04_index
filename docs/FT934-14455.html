			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Volvo thwarts voting changes VOLVO last night blocked an attempt by Sweden's shareholders association to thwart the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault. It rejected demands for a change in the group's articles of association. Aktiespararna, representing thousands of small shareholders, wants a vote on the issue at the November 9 shareholders meeting called to approve the Renault agreement. A change in Volvo's articles requires a two-thirds majority, while the merger only needs a simple majority to go through. Volvo said its board had ruled the merger was in line with the existing articles and it would not propose any change.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Korean oil demand close to UK's SOUTH KOREA had the fastest-growing oil consumption in the world last year when usage rose by more than 20 per cent to 1.6m barrels a day - almost the same level as the UK - according to Mr Peter Davies, chief economist at British Petroleum. Launching BP's statistical review of energy, Mr Davies highlighted two trends: the continuing strong growth in energy demand in Asian countries and the fall in consumption in the former Soviet Union, which cancelled each other out, leaving world demand steady. Oil production from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has grown to meet expanding demand from East Asia with Opec output touching 26.2m b/d last year, the highest level since 1980. Mr Davies estimates Opec capacity at 27.5m to 28m b/d. The collapse of the economy in the former Soviet Union has led to declining energy consumption in Russia where it fell by 3 per cent and the other republics: consumption dropped in Ukraine by over 18 per cent partly as supplies from Russia were diverted. At the same time, production last year dropped by 1.3m b/d to 8m b/d. BP looked at the Samotlar field in western Siberia where reserves were estimated at 25bn barrels when it was first discovered. The field was brought to peak production very quickly, maintained that peak for less than 5 years and has since declined at a rate of 15 per cent a year. Mr Davies said the field was brought on too quickly and over-produced, in contrast with a similar field such as Pruhoe Bay, Alaska, where peak outout was lower but total recovery will be significantly higher. Growth of gas consumption is growing rapidly in the expanding economies of East Asia with usage up by over 30 per cent last year in South Korea, 17.8 per cent in Malaysia and 13.5 per cent in India. Mr Satish Sharma, India's petroleum minister, says there has been some foreign interest in the 45 blocks of oil exploration acreage being offered as part of India's fifth round of awards. He says this round will be followed by a rolling programme that will put acreage on offer every 6 months. 1993 BP Statistical Review of Energy: from British Petroleum, Britannic House, 1 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7BA.

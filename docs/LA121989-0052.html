			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOMB FOUND IN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE IN ATLANTA;  </P> <P> TERRORISM: ANOTHER DEVICE KILLS A SAVANNAH LAWYER. ATTACKS MAY BE LINKED TO  NAACP TEAR GAS INCIDENT.  </P> <P> A bomb was safely removed from the building housing the federal 11th Circuit  Court of Appeals on Monday, but a Savannah attorney was killed when another  bomb exploded in his office. The fatal blast came two days after the package  bomb murder of an 11th Circuit judge in Alabama.  </P> <P> In Birmingham, Ala., where authorities were investigating the bombing that  killed U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance on Saturday, FBI Agent Tom Moore  said: "The preliminary investigation (in Savannah) indicates strong  similarities to the other explosive devices in Birmingham and Atlanta."  </P> <P> The FBI said the attacks might be linked to the August, 1989, tear gas bombing  of the NAACP's regional headquarters in Atlanta. Special Agent William Hinshaw  said in Savannah that the agency is warning lawyers, judges and NAACP activists  in Georgia and Alabama to be suspicious of strange packages.  </P> <P> In Atlanta, frightened employees were evacuated from the five-story downtown  court building before the device discovered there early in the day was disarmed  by munitions experts. Security was tightened at other federal buildings in  Atlanta.  </P> <P> Authorities said that the Atlanta bomb had been found in a package in the  courthouse mail room. They refused to say to whom it was addressed but said it  resembles the powerful device that killed Vance and severely injured his wife,  Helen, at their Mountain Brook, Ala., home in the Birmingham suburbs.  </P> <P> Investigators said they are exploring a possible connection between the Atlanta  and Birmingham bombs. Officials said that the two incidents have been placed at  the top of the FBI's list of investigations.  </P> <P> "I can assure you, we will leave no stone unturned," FBI agent Allen P.  Whitaker told a news conference in Birmingham.  </P> <P> Jim Holland, a postal inspector, told the same news conference that "there  could be a significant connection between the two packages."  </P> <P> In Savannah, attorney Robert Robinson, a black civil rights activist and city  alderman, died after undergoing emergency surgery for injuries he suffered in  the bomb blast in his office around 5 p.m., officials said.  </P> <P> Robinson, 42, "lost his right arm, his left hand and some upper body tissue and  (had) severe damage to his legs," according to a fellow alderman, Floyd Adams.  </P> <P> A federal official who assisted in the investigation of the Savannah attack  described the "grisly" scene in Robinson's office in the city's historic  district, where the bomb blew a rectangular hole in the attorney's second-floor  desk.  </P> <P> "It would have been difficult to imagine anyone surviving that attack," said  the official, Lance Hearns, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms.  </P> <P> Hearns said the package had been delivered in the regular mail just before noon  Monday, but that Robinson had not collected it until he returned to the office.  </P> <P> "He carried it upstairs to his private office," Hearns said. "It was a very  unfortunate scene."  </P> <P> At a Savannah news conference late Monday, FBI agent Bob DeLoach said it was  "definitely a possibility" that white supremacists had sent the bomb that  killed Robinson.  </P> <P> Agent Hinshaw said the FBI also warned the NAACP that the attacks appear to be  related to the Aug. 22, 1989, tear-gas mail bomb attack at the NAACP's Atlanta  offices, in which eight people, including an infant, were injured.  </P> <P> The caustic gas bomb was sent to the civil rights organization via Postal  Service "Priority Mail." It was addressed only to the NAACP, not to any  individual, and had a phony return address.  </P> <P> Several investigators in Birmingham trying to find clues to Vance's murder were  immediately dispatched to Atlanta Monday. Both the Atlanta and Birmingham  devices are said to be "nail bombs," in which nails are packed into an  explosive device, and both were delivered through the mail. In addition to the  FBI, the Marshals Service and Postal Service, the federal Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms and local police officers and sheriff's deputies are  taking part in the investigations.  </P> <P> Authorities continued to comb court records, looking for cases that could  provide motives for the judge's slaying.  </P> <P> The 12-member 11th Circuit handles federal appeals from Alabama, Georgia and  Florida, and the bulk of the circuit's caseload is drug-related. Investigators  said that they are ruling out no possibility, including the theory that  Colombian cocaine bosses may be behind the murder.  </P> <P> However, in Washington, a senior official who is close to the investigation  went to great lengths to play down that possibility, asserting that all the  characteristics of the bombing make it unlikely.  </P> <P> "None of it seems to match what you would expect from trained killers trying to  deliver a message," the official said.  </P> <P> Another official said, "I don't think it makes any sense. You look at  motivation in this business, and the only person who says, 'I'd like to get rid  of that appeals court judge,' is a trial court judge who has been reversed (by  the appellate court jurist)."  </P> <P> The official, emphasizing that he was being facetious to make a point, said  that appellate court judges "are, by and large, a pretty faceless people. You  have to look very carefully at a newspaper report of their decisions to see who  wrote them. It wouldn't make a point" for Colombian drug kingpins to be going  after an appellate court judge, he said.  </P> <P> A knowledgeable source said Monday night that several federal judges in Florida  had received anonymous telephone calls from a man with a Spanish accent on the  afternoon that Vance was killed.  </P> <P> According to the source, the caller asked each of the judges whether Vance were  there and then hung up. Not until they learned later that Vance had been  assassinated did the Florida judges suspect that the calls may have been meant  as a warning, the source said.  </P> <P> Although investigators have refused to disclose details about the mail bombs, a  source close to the investigation disclosed that the package sent to Vance bore  the return address of Judge Lewis R. Morgan, a colleague on the 11th Circuit.  </P> <P> On seeing the familiar name on the brown-paper-wrapped box, Mrs. Vance said to  her husband: "Look, here's a package from Judge Morgan," said the source, who  is familiar with what the widow told investigators.  </P> <P> "I wonder if he's sending me some more magazines like he did last year," Vance  responded. Moments later, the bomb exploded.  </P> <P> Vance was only the third federal judge to be killed in this century.  </P> <P> The judge, who was highly praised as a scholar and as a person, has been  controversial at times. In 1985, he told a lawyer trying to prevent deportation  of 1,500 Cuban refugees that the U.S. government "can keep the detainees in the  Atlanta pen until they die."  </P> <P> That same year, he was on a panel that cleared the way for prosecution of Ku  Klux Klansmen in a violent 1979 confrontation with black civil rights marchers  in Decatur.  </P> <P> No one has claimed responsibility for the judge's murder, the Savannah bombing  or the placing of the Atlanta bomb.  </P> <P> The Atlanta bomb was discovered shortly after 9:30 Monday morning in the court  building's mail room during an X-ray examination of mail. Pictures of it showed  what "looked like electric wires," a mail room employee said.  </P> <P> Court officials telephoned authorities, who carefully examined the device,  taking fingerprints and other information that could help identify the bomb's  sender. At around noon, a member of the Atlanta police bomb squad, along with  an FBI official, emerged from the building carrying the device. They loaded it  onto a red truck, which sped away under police escort as bystanders looked on.  </P> <P> The bomb was taken to a site near the police academy, where it was safely  defused late Monday afternoon. Officials said that they will examine the  device, part by part.  </P> <P> FBI agent Whitaker said that the Atlanta bomb was addressed "to someone in the  court system," but he refused to elaborate. One source close to the  investigation said that the bomb package carried the return address of an  Atlanta attorney, but he refused to disclose the name, saying, "It's being  checked out."  </P> <P> In the wake of the incidents, law enforcement officials have extended their  precautionary warnings beyond judges to other court employees and their  families. "We have notified court families to use procedures" that include  screening any items they receive at home or work, Marshal Thomas C. Greene told  the Birmingham news conference.  </P> <P> Security measures were heightened at federal courthouses around the country  Monday.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, about two-thirds of Los Angeles' 30 federal District Court  judges met with the U.S. Marshal, officials of the U.S. Postal Service and the  Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad at the federal courthouse to discuss  security procedures.  </P> <P> Judge Terry T. Hatter said the meeting was useful but that he didn't plan to do  anything dramatically different. "We're going to be more cautious, that's just  using common sense," he said.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said, "I don't think (the Vance killing)  is going to intimidate any judge in this country. We have a lot of confidence  in the Marshals Service."  </P> <P> U.S. Marshal Samuel Cicchino would not divulge what had been discussed in the  meeting with the judges and said there would be no major changes in security at  the U.S. courthouse. For years, all persons entering the building from Spring  Street or Main Street have been required to pass through a metal detector, and  every piece of mail and every package that arrives at the courthouse is put  through an X-ray machine.  </P> <P> Cicchino said that on Monday one box that looked suspicious on an X-ray machine  was opened by the police bomb squad. He said it turned out to be a package of  Christmas cookies.  </P> <P> The marshal said that any person who receives an unordered package or anything  else in the mail that looks suspicious should call the 911 emergency number and  ask for help.  </P> <P> In San Francisco, the headquarters of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,  clerks diverted all mail for appellate judges to the main federal courthouse,  where it was X-rayed. Court of Appeals judges were given the option of having  their personal mail checked, Mark Mendenhall, assistant executive for the  circuit court, said.  </P> <P> Clerks were "taking very seriously" the possibility of violence and were  seeking authorization for a screening device for mail and personnel.  </P> <P> "We'd like them in place today," Mendenhall said. "Working through Washington  takes longer than today."  </P> <P> In Chicago, the U.S. Marshal's office said it had taken several specific  additional security measures at the federal courthouse but would not spell them  out. Because of previous terrorist trials in Chicago and sensitive gang  prosecutions, security at Chicago courts is already at a relatively high level.  </P> <P> In a related development, the Associated Press reported that Florida Gov. Bob  Martinez, who said his life has been threatened by Colombian drug barons, said  Monday that, as a result of Vance's assassination, he will consider wearing a  bulletproof vest. Martinez said he would reevaluate his previous refusal to  follow the advice of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which had urged  the governor to wear the vest during some public appearances.  </P> <P> Staff writers Doug Jehl in Atlanta, Larry Green in Chicago, Dan Morain in San  Francisco and Henry Weinstein in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

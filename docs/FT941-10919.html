			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (10): Protectionist policy - South Korea The Seoul bourse reflects the nature of the South Korean economy: protectionist, and subject to intrusive government meddling. Only since January 1992 has the stock market been open to direct foreign investment. Foreigners are limited to buying 10 per cent of a company's shares, and must go through a cumbersome identification process before being registered. This has proved frustrating for foreign investors who want to take advantage of the country's buoyant economy, which is expected to grow by at least 6 per cent this year. The foreign shareholding ceilings for Korea's leading blue-chip companies were filled long ago, forcing tardy investors to pay premiums of between 25 to 100 per cent for attractive Korean stock on the over-the-counter market. Overseas funds specialising in Korean equity, which are not subject to the shareholding limits, have also seen their premiums rise sharply. The government has promised to raise the foreign shareholding ceiling by an unspecified amount in two stages by 1997. But it appears reluctant to do so quickly. The first increase is not due until the second half of this year at the earliest, and may be only a slight rise to 15 per cent. The government justifies its caution by arguing that a sudden and rapid inflow of foreign capital would destabilise the economy, increasing the money supply and boosting inflation, while threatening to cause wide swings in share prices. Foreign brokers complain that simple xenophobia is the real reason for keeping foreign investment at bay. Ironically, foreign investment in the past two years has probably stabilised the stock market, which previously had been driven by short-term speculation, with domestic investors paying little attention to fundamentals. Foreigners have tended to be long-term investors, and, by example, have encouraged Koreans to do the same. But analysis of fundamentals is difficult, because accounting and corporate disclosure rules need to be improved. Recent government efforts to curb anonymous stock accounts have also contributed to a less volatile market, having reduced opportunities for the so-called 'big hands' - the main investors that dominate the market - to manipulate share prices. But this has not discouraged the government from trying to play its part in manipulating the market for political reasons. The crash of the bourse in 1989 forced the government to intervene as small investors complained about losses. The government created a stock market stabilisation fund, to buy shares and boost prices. Financial institutions, which operate under tight state supervision, were also ordered to become net buyers. 'Korea would like to have the world's first no-fault stock market,' said one western banker. Those efforts have paid off, the share index having almost doubled in the last 18 months. But the government slammed on the brakes in mid-January, as small investors complained that they were losing out to big institutional investors in the bull run. Individual investors, for example, claimed they had been handicapped by a requirement that they deposit 40 per cent of their buy order before shares are purchased; while institutional investors have not been forced to make an immediate payment guarantee. The government promptly ordered institutional investors to made a 20 per cent deposit. Foreign institutional investors will be subject to the new deposit requirement, which could further complicate their purchase of shares.</p>

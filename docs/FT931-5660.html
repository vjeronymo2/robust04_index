			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lower prices push SSAB to SKr165m pre-tax loss SSAB, the Swedish steel group which was privatised last year, slumped to a SKr165m (Dollars 21m) pre-tax loss in 1992 after a sharp drop in domestic demand and intense competition in the west European market. The steep fall in prices towards the end of the year meant the deficit was deeper than the group had expected last October. However, it suggested enhanced competitiveness, following the devaluation of the krona, and a promised round of price rises in Europe would provide the foundation for a return to profit in 1993. The 1992 result contrasts with a SKr218m profit in 1991 and follows a drop in operating revenue to SKr11.87bn from SKr13.76bn. The loss per share was SKr2.90 and the dividend was cut by SKr1 to SKr5 per share. Cash flow was a negative SKr124m. Lower demand and higher imports from eastern Europe combined to put pressure on prices in the European market while the threat of punitive import duties curtailed exports to the US. In Sweden, recession meant trading and processing revenues in the group's home market fell 20 per cent. SSAB said the trend of steel prices in western Europe would be the key influence on its result this year. Although the year had started badly, with prices down 10 per cent on their 1992 average, the group noted that many European producers were planning to raise prices from the second quarter. The group also believes it will benefit from its efforts to align capacity with domestic demand and from improved margins following the depreciation of the krona. It also expects lower energy taxes and reduced employer's social security contributions to have a favourable impact.</p>

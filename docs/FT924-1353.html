			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Bad checks at Barclays It almost beggars belief that a once great bank like Barclays could have run up an exposure of Pounds 440m to a single customer on the basis of little more than an expectation of indefinitely rising property values. Had its loans to Imry been syndicated, the bank would not be in the embarrassing position of making a Pounds 240m provision - enormous by any banking standard, except perhaps on sovereign debt. If the recriminations are likely to reverberate, the bank has at least found an orderly way of sorting out the mess. Having written off the money it lent to Marketchief to buy Imry in 1989, it is left with an exposure of Pounds 176m to a property company with sound management, net assets of Pounds 70m and a portfolio worth about Pounds 300m which is pretty well fully let. Since Barclays is now the beneficial owner of Imry, it stands to benefit from any property market recovery. Liquidation would have been a more likely result had Imry borrowed from a syndicate. Cynics would say Barclays, too, could have chosen this route but it would then have had to make an even larger provision. It may look silly yet again if the property market continues to fall, though the existing provision covers a quarter of its remaining exposure. Besides, there are some more immediate consequences. To restore confidence in its management, Barclays must find a banker of stature to work alongside Mr Andrew Buxton. Its 1992 dividend decision has also become even more agonising. The Pounds 165m provision to be charged in the current half is larger than the market had generally expected. Since there has been no discernible improvement in the lending climate since Black Wednesday, provisions may tip the bank into pre-tax loss for 1992 instead of allowing a small profit. That would make a maintained payout harder to justify.</p>

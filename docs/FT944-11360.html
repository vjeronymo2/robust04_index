			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Management: Bad connections at BT - The telecoms company's transformation has taken its toll on employee morale British Telecom's staff magazine - BT Today - is known inside the organisation as BT Toady. It therefore came as a surprise to many employees when the latest issue carried a devastating account of how attempts to improve customer service in one corner of the organisation were failing badly. The letter, from a senior technician in Worldwide Networks, was unsigned, but its basic message was simple. Despite the organisational upheavals of the past few years customers were still fleeing to the competition because of poor quality. They were doing this because basically sound ideas, such as multi-skilling and performance targets, were being implemented in a short-termist and counter-productive way by managers either too remote or too frightened to tell the truth. Sir Iain Vallance, the BT chairman, to whom the letter was sent, praised it as 'intelligent, articulate, to the point and just what we wanted from Total Quality Management'. He regretted, however, that the engineer had remained anonymous, while the staff magazine asked 'how can we overcome the culture of fear?'. The letter - which was only published after considerable internal debate - is a sign that some of BT's senior managers are becoming concerned about employee morale inside Europe's most profitable company. There is much in the 10 years since privatisation for those managers to feel satisfied about, particularly bearing in mind the introverted, civil service mentality which still prevailed at the start of the period. The customer now receives an incomparably better service at a lower price. The returns to shareholders have been impressive. Some of those gains have been bought at the expense of employees. The company has shed one-third of its UK employees - from 232,000 to 148,000 - since 1990. Those that remain work harder in a less secure organisation and their unions no longer have quasi-veto power over management decisions. But even for employees things could be a lot worse. Pay and conditions, especially for middle managers, are still well above average for equivalent skills and experience. And thanks to the generous redundancy terms accompanying the job cuts not a day has been lost in industrial action, a remarkable record for a highly-unionised company. The way that blue-chip BT has handled its employee relations in recent years is often regarded as a model by its peers. Mike Bett, the former head of personnel and deputy chairman of the company, has just been elected president of the Institute of Personnel and Development, Britain's main personnel body. But as BT braces itself for the next 10 years of life in the private sector  -a period which will be incomparably tougher than the first 10 thanks to competition and the new regulatory framework - cracks are beginning to appear in the shiny self-image of employee relations successfully reformed. At the normally placid employee annual meeting earlier this year Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, was almost assaulted as tempers boiled over. Hepher says that much of the anger was due to the uncertainty surrounding a disposal of part of the business which was resolved soon after. That is only part of the story. Almost all speakers complained about job insecurity but they also complained about lack of trust, excessive use of outside contractors, 'flavour of the month' organisational reforms, the disappearance of pride in working for BT. A young graduate entrant said that most of her peers were already looking for new jobs and the company was finding it hard to fill graduate vacancies in some parts of the country. Internal BT surveys suggest that only around one fifth of employees believe that senior managers can be relied upon to do what they say they will do. A similarly low proportion believe that the changes going on inside the company are good for them and even fewer believe that they have job security. A survey by the National Communications Union, the main BT union, found employees in customer service centres strongly commited to delivering a service to the customer, but a large majority no longer felt any commitment to working for BT. Such attitudes are also common among the 70,000 engineers, who were hit by the first big wave of redundancies. A recent dispute over more customer-friendly working hours for engineers seemed to illustrate not opposition to the changes but mistrust of how local managers would implement them. Many of these attitude problems are unavoidable when a once paternalistic company such as BT has to cut both its numbers and its cost base so rapidly. But BT managers are now beginning to wonder how to prevent poor morale affecting business in an organisation where a large proportion of employees have daily contact with customers. The job reduction programme is at the root of many morale problems. BT is still committed to voluntary redundancy, and has paid a high price for that commitment. Redundancy pay - which averages about Pounds 35,000 - has cost Pounds 2bn over the past two years, but there are other costs associated with the commitment including re-training the nearly 3,500 people currently being redeployed and even paying a few dozen people to sit at home on full pay. 'We can afford to be generous as long as we remain successful,' says Hepher. Nonetheless many people - especially, at present, those in middle management  -apparently feel that voluntary redundancy exists only in name, and that the insecurity will never end. Once the current target of a 100,000-employee company is reached, people fear that the next target will be 50,000, and with the introduction of intelligent networks they may be right. Hepher can offer little comfort. 'Our biggest problem is those who have not volunteered and who fear that one day we will have to move to compulsory redundancies. . .that fear is entirely logical,' he says. Some believe the commitment to voluntary redundancy has sent a confusing signal to employees. On the one hand, they point out, BT seems to be saying it is still the paternalistic employer which can guarantee a job, on the other hand people such as Hepher spend much of their time saying that era has gone forever. Hepher says that voluntarism is not set in stone but is still compatible with what the company needs to achieve. Many people believe that Hepher, who came from outside BT three years ago, would like to scrap it but finds Sir Iain standing in his way. Outside consultants suggest that voluntarism has made it more difficult to weed out poor performers. 'BT has lost some of its best people because of the way the system works, and it is left with an unusually wide range of people from extremely good to surprisingly dim,' said one. Outsiders also complain about how much management time the redundancy system consumes and how politicised it is. A few people have been targeted for redundancy on the basis of their appearance or how they write reports. One marketing manager achieved sales 50 per cent higher than target last year and received a large pay bonus, but then found herself on a list of people to go. But the cause of dissatisfaction is not only job cuts. According to Jeannie Drake, deputy general-secretary of the NCU, it is also the insensitive way the company is being restructured for those left behind. The unions accept that job cuts through technology and competition are unavoidable and believe that they have played an important role in delivering orderly shrinkage, despite their reduced influence at local level. A degree of corporatism still lives on at national level - the recent dispute over flexible working was, for example, finally resolved in a private chat between Hepher and Tony Young, leader of the NCU - and Hepher, who had never before worked with unions, is full of praise for their trustworthiness and rationality. But the unions complain angrily about some of the new managers who they claim cannot consult at all or whose idea of communication is to inform engineers repeatedly that they are very expensive compared with contractors (which is true). Drake points to the way seemingly conflicting targets create despondency. She cites the customer service centre staff - the company's front-line staff  -who were subject to a 25 per cent cut in numbers, while at the same time being required to answer all calls in 15 seconds and provide better-quality information. The unions also fear a creeping decentralisation as local managers are given more autonomy in the implementation of national rules. Hepher, however, stresses the limits of decentralisation: 'I have regrettably concluded that you need central direction on a lot of key things in an organisation like this,' he says. Some of these tensions are as unavoidable as those arising from job cuts, and whatever its shortcomings BT has been improving productivity at about 10 per cent per year in recent years. It is regarded as a model by most large European telephone companies and is closing the gap with the Americans. 'What strikes me is the way the company has struggled to preserve the best of the old public service ethos while making itself fit for a brutal world market,' says one consultant who has worked with BT since just after privatisation. There are even signs that the corner may have been turned on morale, at least for the 70,000 engineers who are no longer the main focus for redundancy. A popular experiment in Nottingham - eventually to be spread to the whole country - will allow engineers to earn commission for passing on new business from a customer. Although 25,000 middle managers are now in the firing line on redundancies, Hepher says he is considering a gentler way of approaching redundancy by allowing people 'to sign up today to leave in 18 months' or two years' time'. Nevertheless, to many people - especially those aged between 35 and 50 who have been in the organisation 10 or 15 years - the modern BT remains in bewildering permanent revolution. They keep taking the medicine but they never seem to get better.</p>

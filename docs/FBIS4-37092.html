			<p>BFN     [Text] Srinagar, India, June 16 (AFP) -- Outnumbered,  outgunned and plagued by bloody factional feuding, Kashmiri  Moslem militant groups are nonetheless planning to intensify  their armed struggle against Indian rule.    Dismissing claims by the Indian army that they are on the  run, a top Moslem militant commander warned that the guerrilla  movement could enter a new phase if the eight million Kashmiris  are not allowed to decide their own fate.    "The militancy begun in Kashmir will engulf all of India  soon  if it does not accede to our demands," said Majid Jehangir, the  deputy commander of the Hezbul Mojahedin, the most powerful  Kashmiri Moslem militant outfit.    "In Punjab, the Sikh militants will rise again," said the  33-  year-old Jehangir, who also goes by the name Khalidul-Islam, as  he touched a well-oiled AK-47 rifle at his feet. "They are  reassembling and reorganizing."    "We will take the struggle out of the Kashmir Valley in  stages," the burly, bearded guerrilla said at a hideout  surrounded by gun-toting youths. "We have started the struggle  in the Jammu region (of southern Kashmir) and we will be taking  it to Ladakh (in the north-east) and then outside the state.    "The question now is how long can India hold on to Kashmir,"  said Jehangir, whose Hezbul Mojahedin favors merging India's  only Moslem-majority state with Islamic Pakistan. "The  expenditure on Kashmir is likely to ruin India."    Jehangir claimed that his group had obtained U.S.-made  Stinger surface-to-air missiles, hundreds of which were supplied  to the Afghan mujahedeen during their war against the  Soviet-backed regime in Kabul, and many of which today remain  unaccounted for.    "We have got three Stinger missiles," he said, "and more are  coming."    He refused to disclose the source of the missiles but a  number of former Afghan mujahedeen have made their way to  Kashmir to fight alongside local Moslems in what they consider a  "jihad," or holy war.    "Militants from 46 Moslem countries have come to Kashmir to  help us ... There is no problem in recruiting boys these days,"  said Jehangir, who figures near the top of the army's  most-wanted list and who served three years in prison for  secessionist activities before rising to the number two post in  the Hezbul Mojahedin.    There are dozens of militant organizations operating in the  Moslem-majority Kashmir Valley but they are split between those  favoring independence and those seeking a merger with Pakistan.    Clashes between factions are common and have left nearly 400  people dead during the past three years, according to the Indian  authorities.    Yasin Malik, leader of the pro-independence Jammu and  Kashmir  Liberation Front, the Hezbul Mojahedin's chief rival for  popularity, has accused the pro-Pakistan group of targeting him  on two occasions this month.    Jehangir denied the charge, and played down the importance  of  rifts between the groups. "This is guerrilla warfare and the  more outfits there are, the more attacks there will be against  the enemy," he said.    He said his organization was open to a proposal by Malik to  merge the various outfits into two major groups -- those  favouring independence and those favoring a merger with Pakistan.    "If other militant groups agree to his proposal than we will  also accept it," he said.    India has poured tens of thousands of troops into Kashmir in  a bid to crush the Moslem insurgency, which it charges is fueled  by arms supplied by Pakistan.    It has consistently rejected Kashmiri Moslem demands to hold  a plebiscite to decide whether to remain part of India or to  join neighbouring Pakistan, which also claims the Himalayan  territory.    Nearly 10,000 people have lost their lives in Kashmir since  1989, and the violence has left its tourism-driven economy in  ruins.</p>

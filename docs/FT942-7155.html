			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities lifted by Treasury bond auction Wall Street Bonds set the direction for blue chip stocks yesterday, pulling them down in the morning and helping to push them modestly higher during the afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 10.13 better at 3,755.30, after recovering from a 24-point mid-morning deficit. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.52 at 456.33 in moderate NYSE volume of 254m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.07 ahead to 439.25, and the Nasdaq composite inched up 0.61 to 732.08. From the opening bell to close, the mood closely paralleled the vagaries of the bond market. Early on, equity investors were forced to contend with an unlikely combination of negatives - weak economic news alongside further declines by Treasuries. Though indications of an economic slowdown are often worrying to shareholders betting on strong growth in corporate earnings, such data often trigger an upturn in bonds because of the improved outlook on inflation, which would eat into the value of fixed-rate investments. But higher bond prices, and a concurrent decline in yields, are usually a plus for equities. Yesterday morning, however, Treasury prices receded in spite of the Commerce Department's announcement that orders of durable goods last month had grown by a meagre 0.1 per cent, against expectations of a solid 1.0 per cent gain. The bond market shrugged off the development amid concern over an afternoon note auction. The double blow hit stocks across the board. But when the Treasury auction was completed successfully, longer-dated government bonds reversed course and moved higher. Stocks followed suit, and the Dow industrials nudged into positive ground in the final hour. The session's most notable loser was Gtech Holdings, which plummeted Dollars 12 7/8 , or 37 per cent, to Dollars 22 3/4 . The company, which designs and operates on-line lotteries and games, warned that net income in fiscal 1995 would not show improvement on fiscal 1994. On the Nasdaq, Video Lottery Technologies plunged Dollars 3 to Dollars 14 1/4 after the UK government named its rival, Camelot Group, to operate a new national lottery. Ironically, Gtech is a member of the Camelot consortium. Among the Dow industrials, trading in Philip Morris was halted for the entire session, while its board was meeting amid stepped-up pressure to consider splitting the company's tobacco and food operations into separate entities. After the close, the company revealed it would take no action on the proposal. The stock fell 2.7 per cent to Dollars 53 3/4 the previous session. Technology issues again generated activity but the results were mixed. Hewlett-Packard had dropped Dollars 2 1/8 soon after the computer maker suggested during the analysts' briefing that its revenue growth may begin to slow from the current rate of 20 per cent. But the stock regained its stride to finish off Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 81 1/4 . Elsewhere, Compaq Computer jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 119 1/4 on news that it had displaced IBM and Apple as the world's leading supplier of personal computers. On the Nasdaq, Chiron dropped Dollars 42 3/64 to Dollars 62 17/64 after Montgomery Securities downgraded the biotechnology company. Computer stocks were mixed, with Lotus sheding Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 and Cyrix adding Dollars 2 to Dollars 28. Canada Toronto stocks closed mixed in continued quiet trading. The TSE 300 composite index edged up 4.39, or 0.10 per cent, to 4291.37 in volume of 48.2m shares. Stocks spent most of the day in negative territory before posting a small gain in the last hour. None of the 14 stock groups showed major swings. Banking and mining rose a little, energy, industrial products and golds were flat, and consumer products increased moderately. Bank of Montreal rose CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 26 1/8 after reporting slightly higher second-quarter earnings. Hudson's Bay Co gained CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 31 5/8 on reporting its first first-quarter profit since 1979. Brazil Sao Paulo closed up 8.1 per cent in heavy trade on bullish sentiment over the presidential race. The Bovespa index rose 1,740 at 23,018 points in high turnover of Cr406.4bn. Analysts said the breaking of the 22,800 resistance level charted a new bullish trend. They warned about profit-taking at tomorrow's opening. Mexico Equities closed virtually flat after a roller coaster session punctuated by profit-taking and a technical rebound. The key IPC index closed up 3.64 points at 2,472.16 - a gain of 0.15 per cent. Volume totaled a moderate 1.6bn new pesos, on 139.2m shares traded.</p>

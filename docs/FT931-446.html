			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Gilts galore ON THE face of it, Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3bn of partly paid 20-year gilt-edged stock takes place against an increasingly favourable international and domestic monetary background. Yet there is a problem of credibility; and it is not confined to the sheer volume of gilts that has to be sold to fund a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94. Since sterling parted company with the exchange rate mechanism the government has chosen to make an inflation target of 1 to 4 per cent the centrepiece of the new policy framework for its counter-inflationary strategy. Its aim is to bring inflation to the lower end of this range by the end of the present parliament. That means that issuing long-dated gilts at a yield of 8 1/4 to 8 1/2 per cent could cost the taxpayer a minimum real interest rate of 4 1/4 to 4 1/2 per cent; and if the government is successful in bringing inflation down below 2 per cent, the potential real rate could reach 6 1/2 per cent. By historic standards such rates would be appallingly costly. One obvious solution to the funding problem would be to raise larger sums at the short end of the market. Yet the authorities retain an aversion for funding at short maturities, for reasons which remain obscure. Despite the recent Budget changes in funding policy, sales of Treasury bills are still not counted as funding. Nor does the government expect to retreat from its practice of avoiding the sale of gilts with maturities of less than three years. Any Japanese investor considering the merits of a gilt yield of around double that available on longer-dated Japanese government bonds must therefore ask what the inscrutable British are up to. One possible answer is that ministers do not believe their own anti-inflationary rhetoric, and fear that the short-dated stock would have to be refinanced at higher rates later. Another might be that the Bank of England is prey to its old worry about being unable to deliver on its promises to the Treasury in a funding crisis. The second concern would be misplaced in a global market, where the only issue is the price at which supply and demand for funds are matched. The former worry looks all too plausible. It follows that the Treasury should either offer a better rationale for its aversion to short maturities than it has done to date; or it should change its funding policy.</p>

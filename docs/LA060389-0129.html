			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER GETS PROMISE FOR PAY, PLANS TO RETURN TO AIRPORT JOB  </P> <P> The firm building an elevated roadway at John Wayne Airport refused to work  Friday in a pay dispute but is expected to return Monday after receiving a  promise that it will be paid $300,000.  </P> <P> James McGee, attorney for Kettering-Krussman Inc. of Artesia, said a tentative  agreement was reached Friday morning in which the firm would return workers to  the construction site Monday morning to pour concrete it had been scheduled to  pour Friday.  </P> <P> McGee said, however, that the employees will not perform any work Monday unless  the $300,000 has actually been received. The firm claims that it is owed a  total of $1.3 million for the project.  </P> <P> Kettering-Krussman's 60-person work crew did not report to the job site Friday  after being told late Thursday that it should not return until the pay issue  was settled.  </P> <P> Bill Godwin, a project supervisor for general contractor Taylor Woodrow  California Construction Ltd., said his firm agreed during a negotiating session  Friday morning to make the payment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Contractual' Dispute  </P> <P> Godwin said the company had been at odds with Kettering-Krussman over "other  contractual matters" that led to the dispute, but he declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the county paid the Taylor Woodrow firm $1.74 million on Friday for  work done in April on the roadway and a garage project. Taylor Woodrow  officials had complained that the payment was overdue, but county officials  said Taylor Woodrow had not filed adequately documented payment requests.  </P> <P> Chris Elliott, project manager for the Taylor Woodrow firm, said Friday: "The  county is nit-picking and nickeling and diming us to death." Elliott denied,  however, that payment problems were threatening his firm's ability to stay on  the $310-million John Wayne Airport expansion project.  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions white paper falls down on reforms Sir, Mr N G Preston's letter (July 2) is timely. The worst of the legacies of Robert Maxwell has not been his plundering of pension funds but the extent to which government thinking has been obsessed with regulation, security and the custody of pension funds to the exclusion of a wider consideration of the inadequacies of the present system. Both the Goode Commission and the recent white paper have confirmed and reinforced the cosy bureaucratic conspiracy between the public and private pensions establishments. Apart from a small, but important, proposal (on flexible vesting) the white paper fails totally to suggest any reforms or even to hint that they might be necessary. The secretary of state is to be congratulated on obtaining legislative time in the next session of parliament for a comprehensive pensions bill. The white paper only goes half way to reform. The ideas put forward by Frank Field and Matthew Owen, the proposals set out by former economic secretary to the Treasury, John Maples (Personal View, November 12 1993), and the ideas offered by the late Philip Chapell and Lord Vinson on pension fund ownership are some of the informed and constructive ideas being put forward at the present time. It would be tragic indeed if social security secretary, Peter Lilley, funked the opportunity for a radical rethink. What is needed perhaps is not just a white paper but, following the Goode report, an even better commission] Mark Rittner, head of life &amp; pensions, Rathbone Brothers, University House, Lower Grosvenor Place, London SW1W 0EX</p>

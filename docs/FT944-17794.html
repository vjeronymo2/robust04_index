			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Austin Reed doubles to Pounds 1.84m Austin Reed, the clothing group, doubled pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 930,000 to Pounds 1.84m in the 28 weeks to August 13 on the back of maintained income from licensing and more than trebled profits from the retail operations. Turnover grew 12 per cent to Pounds 34.5m (Pounds 30.7m). Mr Chris Thomson, finance director, said the results had beaten many expectations, adding that the current strategy - in place for 18 months - had borne fruit for the past three seasons. He said that the heavily researched 'revitalising' of the product range was targeting customers better and had broadened the customer base. That, combined with the use of different retail formats for different locations and clientele, was helping the group lose its slightly outmoded image. A force behind the retail advance - to Pounds 523,000 (Pounds 140,000) on turnover of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 23.6m) - was the shop format called Austin Reed Sportsman, which sells leisurewear. In the spring a women's leisurewear line was launched. The group has 50 outlets, though some - such as those in three of Heathrow airport's terminals - are as small as 300 to 400 sq ft. Profits from manufacturing for other retailers rose to Pounds 486,000 (Pounds 258,000) on turnover ahead from Pounds 5.66m to Pounds 7.06m. Mr Thomson said that sales in Switzerland, Italy and Germany lost during the recession were now being regained. Borrowings were cut to Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 10.4m) and are expected to be down to Pounds 3m by the year-end. Interest charges were halved at Pounds 306,000 (Pounds 601,000). Capital expenditure on store refurbishment will total Pounds 4m for the year, against Pounds 2.5m. Earnings were 3.9p (2p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 2p.</p>

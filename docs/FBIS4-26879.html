			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- The draft law on the  People's Bank of China (PBC), was submitted today to the  country's top legislature, the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation.    PBC Deputy Governor Zhou Zhengqing told the Eighth Session  of  the NPC Standing Committee, which opened today, that "it is an  important law for China's current reform of its monetary system."    The PBC is given the legal status in the draft of being the  country's central bank. Under the direct leadership of the  State Council, it is entitled to issue currency and oversee the  nation's monetary organizations.    "The PBC, under the leadership of the State Council,  formulates and implements monetary policies independently and in  accordance with the law, and supervises and manages the national  finance industry free from interference from any other  administrative department, local government, social organization  or individual," the draft law says.    The PBC possesses capital and property, and is allowed to  operate businesses in accordance with the law. It enjoys civil  rights and has to fulfill civil duties, according to the draft.    The draft law determines that the PBC monetary policies  should aim at stabilizing the value of the national currency,  and shore up national industrial policies and development  schemes on the basis of the stable value of renminbi.    It provides six indirect macro-control measures the PBC can  make use of to reach its monetary goals. They include setting  the benchmark interest rates for the central bank, loaning to  national commercial banks, buying or selling state bonds or  foreign currencies, demanding financial institutes to pay in  reserves for deposits, and providing re-discount for the  financial institutes with accounts in the central bank.    Zhou said, "these powers will suffice for the central bank  to  control and adjust the currency supply and credit volume based  on the needs of national economic development, and guarantee the  overall balance of supply and demand."    The PBC will no longer extend credit to or receive deposits  from non-financial organizations or individuals, the draft  provides.    In addition, the draft law designates renminbi as the only  legal currency in the country, and it is issued only by the PBC.    The draft prohibits faking or intentionally destroying the  currency.    The draft law provides in principle that the PBC is  empowered  to ratify financial organizations, verify and inspect these  organizations and their business operations, and punish those  who violate financial laws and regulations.    "The supervision and control of the financial industry is  necessary because financial organizations deal in special goods,  i.e. money, and this has a great impact on the country's social  and economic development," he said.    The draft, containing eight chapters and 46 clauses, also  specifies the internal structure of the PBC.    According to Zhou, the law has been in preparation for 15  years.</p>

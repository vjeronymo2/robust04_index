			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: ADT Given the habitual secrecy of ADT's chairman Mr Michael Ashcroft, it was never to be expected that the company's annual report would give many clues to the real state of its affairs. But it does confirm what a deplorable muddle ADT has become. Investors have every reason to ask why the disposal of ADT's 48 per cent holding in Sechura has given rise to a Dollars 96m write-off, or indeed why there is no suggestion in the accounts that a principal shareholder in Sechura was Mr Ashcroft himself. Above all, there is no real explanation of why a year which saw the issue of ADT paper to the value of Dollars 335m also saw a horrendous drop of Dollars 842m in the group's cash mountain. As always, the answer will lie not in the group's operating businesses but in Mr Ashcroft's dabblings around the fringe. So far as can be told from an exceptionally opaque flow of funds statement, the operating businesses net of capital expenditure, tax and dividends were broadly cash neutral in the year. The same dabblings doubtless lie behind the drop of almost 20 per cent in the group's net asset value in the year. It would be nice to know what has happened to Mr Ashcroft's salary as a result of all this. Needless to say, in accounts certified by Coopers &amp; Lybrand 'in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the UK', we are not told that either.</p>

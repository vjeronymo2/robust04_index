			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Taiwan Trust lifts capital - Issue News Taiwan Investment Trust, which is to be launched today with Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, as chairman, has increased its capital from a planned Pounds 30m to Pounds 45m because of interest from institutions. The trust, which will be the only London-listed vehicle specialising in Taiwan, is to be managed from Hong Kong by Jupiter Tyndall (Asia). Among the directors are Mr Julian Seymour, who heads the private office of Lady Thatcher, and Mr Geoffrey Howard-Spink, director of Lowe Howard-Spink. Investing in Taiwan's stock market is problematic for foreigners because of restrictions placed on the amount to be invested. In addition, the central bank limits the amount of foreign currency which can flow into the island because it is concerned about appreciation of the local currency. Though the central bank recently acted again to limit inflows following a sharp stock market rally at the end of 1993, Jupiter Tyndall had already been authorised by the Taiwan authorities to invest a total of Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m). Of Taiwan's total market capitalisation of Dollars 183bn (Pounds 122bn) at mid-January, only about 2 per cent was held by foreigners.</p>

The two church officials  were sent by Teoctist, patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox  Church, to deliver a pastoral letter through which the patriarch  comforts and blesses the prisoners, as well as a medal on behalf  of the Holy Synod.    According to a statement by Teofan Sinaitul broadcast by  Radio Chisinau, after they had persisted for almost eight hours,  the authorities of the self-styled Dniester Republic did not  authorize their meeting. We hope that in a few days' or weeks'  time, when the authorities see fit to allow it, we will be able  to pray for a few moments together with the five prisoners,  Teofan said among other things, according to our Chisinau  correspondent, Mircea Dascaliuc.</p>

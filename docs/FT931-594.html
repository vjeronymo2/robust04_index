			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Yeltsin rides the Congress peaks and troughs THE Russian Congress of People's Deputies usually refuses to run to a simple script. It is an inchoate body, made up of shifting factions and allegiances with many deputies lacking representative experience. But the key to the ebbs and flows of resolutions, decisions and stalemates of this past weekend was in the stubborn fact that the deputies lacked the necessary votes to impeach the president, Mr Boris Yeltsin. This was despite the fact that after an appearance before the microphones which frightened his supporters and delighted his opponents because of its incoherence, he lost that sliver of support which had deprived his foes of the majority they needed to put the issue on the agenda. To the end, he seemed able to disappoint them of the two-thirds needed to impeach him. The congress has registered great waves and troughs in the apparent strength of the opposing side. On Friday, the president kept firm to his insistence he hold a referendum of April 25 on trust. He felt strong enough to taunt the deputies to put the question of trust in themselves on the ballot paper. The voices from the floor were looking for compromise, following the defection from the impeachment camp of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. Saturday morning marked the beginning of efforts to find a compromise. A resolution was put forward by the drafting committee, allowing the referendum but adding three more questions to the president's original one. These were: approval for election of president, for election of the deputies and - the sting in the tail - approval of the results of economic reform, which the president has consistently supported and which is assumed to be deeply unpopular. The president's side let if be known this was unacceptable. Though they had gathered in the expectation of discussing impeachment, the issue had not got on the agenda: a vote on Saturday confirmed that the necessary simple majority to discuss it still did not exist. Nor was the resolution on a four-question referendum allowed. Later, a harder line resolution appeared, proposing to suspend those of the president's aides who had persuaded him to appeal to the people on March 20, cancel his special powers, and dismiss his appointed provincial governors. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, took the stage in the morning session to give a speech of heavily-qualified support for his president, in which he was careful to say that 'without the president we will not be able to carry the heavy burden (of reforms)'. But it was also a speech which inserted the views that all sides were equally guilty for the crisis which had brought Russia 'to the brink of catastrophe'. It made the point that a decree issued by Mr Yeltsin early last week dismissing the chief administrators of Novosibirsk and Irkutsk had had to be revoked (Mr Chernomyrdin, rather pointedly, had made fulsome apologies to them for his president's mistake); and that early elections, which Mr Yeltsin has not favoured, were inevitable. In the general debate, the most cheered speaker was Mr Aman Tuleev, head of the Kemerovo region, who branded Mr Yeltsin's much-abused aides as a 'collective Rasputin'. But pro-Yeltsin deputies took the floor to defend economic reform and charge the Congress with unconstitutional behaviour. Mr Yeltsin's appearance before the microphones most harmed him. His face puffy, his hair flopping, he came to the microphone and with slurred diction and long pauses, said there should be a week of talks between himself, Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Chernomyrdin to try to find consensus. A number of his opponents said he was drunk; his supporters said he was over-strained; his staff that he was suffering from the effects of his mother's death last week, an explanation he later proffered himself in remarks to reporters. Yesterday morning, another consensus rabbit appeared from the behind-the-scenes hat. Said to have the support of the president, the speaker, the prime minister, the leaders of regions and republics and 'several factions', this resolution scrapped the referendum in favour of November elections to a two-tier parliament (which meant the scrapping of the present Congress). Mr Yeltsin, looking a little better, said that were it to be supported, he would cancel his decree calling for a popular vote on April 25. There followed some dozen speakers, each of whom denounced the draft agreement: if any faction really had put their name to it overnight, none admitted it in the hall. It went down with a mere 134 votes in favour. A feature of the rhetoric on this issue was an increase in the calls for the resignation of the Speaker, a move brewing since the beginning of the Congress, but which now took off. The nimbleness of Mr Khasbulatov's footwork was now turned against him: he was represented as a man of no principle. The proposal to vote on the impeachment of the president was finally put on the agenda, with 594 deputies voting for its inclusion. At the same time, slightly more deputies (614) voted to ballot on a no-confidence motion on Mr Khasbulatov. Mr Yeltsin's vote required two-thirds of the total number, that is, 689 out of 1,033: Mr Khasbulatov's majority was a mere 517.</p>

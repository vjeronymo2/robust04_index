			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scientists warn of increase in jobless URGENT government action is needed to regenerate UK industry, an all-party alliance of politicians, industrialists and scientists warned yesterday. The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee said: 'Without change, we shall at best become a manufacturing arm of Japanese, American and German companies whose governments have for years taken a more positive attitude to science and technology and to manufacturing industry than UK governments. At the worst, this will lead to chronic mass unemployment with ensuing community unrest.' The committee does not usually advise the government directly, but it has sent its report to the prime minister and ministers responsible for industry, science and education. Its warning follows a conference, which the committee organised with the Royal Society, on Japan's emerging lead in technology. Sir Gerard Vaughan, chairman, said: 'The message from the conference was clear and extremely disturbing: unless we make major changes, this country will become largely a labour market for other countries, without an adequate manufacturing base of our own. This will be disastrous for our future prosperity.'</p>

He told reporters on Monday [17 January] that all factions,  including the LDPR, had agreed that Zhirinovsly's people will  not head the commissions on foreign affairs, on defence and  security, on federation affairs and the budget.    In response Zhirinovskiy proposed to create a special  commission for him which would deal with geopolitical issues,  according to Ignatyev.    "We could not react to it in any other way than with  sarcasm", he added.</p>

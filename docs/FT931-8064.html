			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Books: Lear behind the scenes - Anthony Curtis relishes some fascinating insights into the Bard's great play THE LEAR DIARIES by Brian Cox Methuen Pounds 15.99, 211 pages SHAKESPEARE'S PROFESSIONAL CAREER by Peter Thomson Cambridge Pounds 24.95, 215 pages THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR edited by Jay L. Halio The New Cambridge Shakespeare Pounds 24.95 (paperback Pounds 4.25), 313 pages BRIAN COX played Lear in Deborah Warner's production of the tragedy for the Royal National Theatre in 1990. He doubled it with the part of Buckingham in Richard Eyre's production of Richard III, Richard being played by Ian McKellen. There were times on tour when Cox would have to do one role at a matinee and another in the evening. But he had enough voice left at the end of most days to dictate into a tape-recorder his thoughts and feelings about what had been happening to him. The result - The Lear Diaries - is a spontaneous, highly articulate account of what it is really like to be a leading man in a national company with the responsibility of one of the great roles in the repertory bearing down upon your weary shoulders each evening. We learn not just how the role takes over your emotional life but also the inroads it makes into your private and family lives; there were existing difficulties that were exacerbated by a protracted tour abroad. Throughout a year the National company took both plays to Madrid, Paris, Hamburg, Leipzig, Dresden, Cork, Tokyo, Cairo in addition to touring the UK. Cox does full justice to the pains of one-week stands and official hospitality, thankfully recording a final stop in his native Scotland. Above all Cox gives us fascinating insights into the mechanics of performance. He discusses the pros and cons of having to speak some of Lear's lines from a wheelchair which was part of the conception, and the effect upon the whole company's morale of the different venues, audiences and auditoria. Relations with other members of the company were crucial, particularly those with his colleagues taking the parts of his daughters and the Fool. Cox's comments reveal a mutual supportiveness that is miles away from the picture of chilling hauteur on the part of the star playing Lear in Ronald Harwood's play The Dresser. Mind you, there is plenty of griping as well, and a constant complaint at the way the lesser role Cox was playing in Richard III undermined concentration on the major one. It was only when they reached Eastern Europe that he began to see the real point of Eyre's setting of that play in a 1930s fascist mode. The fall of Ceausescu and of Margaret Thatcher provided unexpectedly relevant topical contexts. What would an historian of the theatre like Peter Thomson, the professor of drama at Exeter University and author of Shakespeare's Professional Career, give to get his hands on a diary of this sort kept by a member of Shakespeare's company? On, say, Burbage's uninhibited Cox-like comments on the rehearsal methods of those in charge in 'this wooden O'? Did Shakespeare and his fellow-actors have anyone comparable to a modern director? The answers to such questions have to be inferred from fragmentary allusions in contemporary documents and surviving play-texts. Just how much has now been reconstructed by a huge army of Shakespeare scholars we gather from Thomson's book. He gives a most interesting, compact account of Shakespeare's conditions of work. Thomson sees Shakespeare as a great accommodator - someone who was always prepared to adapt his genius to whatever or whoever was available. A striking illustration comes in the use he made of the comic talent in his company. Thomson leans here on David Wiles's study Shakespeare's Clown (1987), and points to the contrast between the parts Shakespeare wrote for his two great funny men - William Kempe and Robert Armin. Kempe, famous in his own right for his celebrated dance from London to Norwich, was the earthy, bawdy, gutsy comedian playing up to the groundlings for laughs in roles like Gobbo and Dogberry, and bringing down the house with his jig. He left the company in 1599 at the time of the move to the Globe, an environment where, it is suggested, his skills might not have been so greatly welcomed. Kempe was replaced by the more melancholic, musically gifted player, Robert Armin. Thomson thinks Touchstone may have been re-written to accommodate him, and that a role like that of the Fool in Lear was part of Shakespeare's intuitive response to Armin, Clown turning into Fool. It is a tempting theory. As for the play itself and its mad King, Thomson sees it as predicating the transition from the old feudal role of kingship under the Tudors to the more modern one of the newly crowned James I under whose banner Shakespeare and his colleagues were working. They now became known as the King's Men. Lear was a play about which Shakespeare appears to have had second thoughts after it had been staged. There are many significant differences between the text as printed in the quarto and the folio editions, so much so that the Oxford editors, Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, in their William Shakespeare: The Complete Works (1986), printed the play twice, giving both texts in full. Jay L. Holio, professor of English at Delaware, in his New Cambridge Shakespeare edition, does not go as far as that. He sticks to the Folio text where the gains are, to my mind, greater than the losses, but he does give the chief variations in the notes, which are a model of clarity throughout. Quotations from Q and F are printed in facsimile so that one may compare the variant texts in the form in which they first appeared. The New Cambridge Shakespeare, which 10 years ago set about replacing the old Dover Wilson edition, and of which Lear is the latest volume to appear, is now about half way through the canon. It is for my money the best single-volume edition to have to hand for general use. It started off in light blue Cambridge livery, but in the late 1980s apostatised to dark blue Oxford dress with a trendy David Hockney Shakespeare 'portrait' replacing the earlier C. Walter Hodges design. To anyone who has been collecting the volumes over the years in the hope of one day possessing the complete set, this mid-term marketing initiative has given an unfortunate boat-race appearance to the books on the shelves. Nonetheless one is very glad to have them.</p>

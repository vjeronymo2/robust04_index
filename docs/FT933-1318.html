			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Problems in US hit Laura Ashley shares SHARES IN Laura Ashley fell 22p to 87p after the niche clothing and home furnishings group warned its full year profits would be more than Pounds 7m below market expectations. The group reported interim pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds 1.31m, on sales up 23 per cent at Pounds 144m (Pounds 116.8m). Currencies accounted for some of this and allowing for that the rise was 13 per cent. Trading in North America had been slower than the group anticipated in April resulting in price markdowns in the second half being more than expected. Taken with one-off costs of Pounds 3m, North America would be responsible for full year pre-tax profits being lower than the Pounds 10m expected by the market. Second half pre-tax profits were unlikely to be 'significantly ahead of the first half.' The group will be spending a further Pounds 3m for marketing support and provisions against autumn and winter 1992 stock. Mr Jim Maxmin, chief executive, said the group's problems were not structural. 'The strategy in place is working,' he said. He had been over-optimistic about the timing of the recovery in the US. UK sales in the first half grew by 19 per cent and in continental Europe by 13 per cent. The 4 per cent rise in the US followed a 30 per cent plunge in sales in February and early March after bad weather and a decision not to repeat a large home furnishings promotion. Earnings per share were 0.22p (0.4p), and the interim dividend is passed. Gearing rose from 19 per cent to 28 per cent but Mr Maxmin expected a cash inflow by the year-end. COMMENT Much of what Laura Ashley has done, and says it will do, sounds most convincing. Sales figures are encouraging. The strong brand appears to have consumer appeal again and the group has put in place control systems which were woefully lacking last summer and led to the dismal US performance. But the market was not expecting to hear convincing arguments again, it was expecting the first signs of results. Yesterday's sharp share price markdown was a reaction to the postponement of recovery for another year and the market's waning confidence in management's ability to get to grips with the US business. The key remains the degree to which Laura Ashley has to mark down its US prices. At the moment a staggeringly high 70 per cent are being reduced. Sort this out and the p/e multiple, now more than 100 on a profits forecast at Pounds 2.7m and earnings of 0.6p, could come crashing down. But if the mark-down problem is not addressed, Laura Ashley will remain expensive.</p>

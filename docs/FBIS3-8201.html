Here is a statement from the session we have just received.    The council reviewed the importance and circumstances of the  Washington preliminary agreement on the establishment of  Bosnia-Herzegovina on a federal basis as a union of inherently  sovereign peoples in the Federal Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and its entering a confederal union with the Republic of  Croatia. The delegation of the Republic of Croatia, which was  headed by Foreign Minister Mate Granic and took part in drawing  up and signing the preliminary agreement, submitted a report to  the council.    The council Described the agreement as a historic event,  which further develops and strengthens the independent and  sovereign Croatian state and which secures the survival of the  Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and congratulated President  Tudjman and the Croatian delegation on the agreement. With its  active and consistent policy toward the European Community and  world factors, the Croatian state policy has created  preconditions and made possible the adoption of the agreement  and the reaching of accord with the Bosnian Muslim delegation,  while fully preserving the strategic interests of the Croatian  state.    The agreement of the Muslim and Croatian sides is not  directed against the Serb side, and makes it possible to find a  solution with the Serb side that will be acceptable to all three  nations within Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement marks the  success of Croatia's consistent policy implemented through  several agreements with the Bosnian Muslim leaders, President  Tudjman's letter to President Clinton, the participation in the  drawing up and adoption of Cutilheiro's plan on cantons, the  Vance-Owan plan on provinces and the Vance-Stoltenberg plan on  the union of republics, and President Tudjman's recent peace  initiative. The agreement also shows that major world factors  have accepted Croatia.    This also marks a change in the views of the United States  and leading European countries, indicating their resolve  regarding a solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in  the area of the former Yugoslavia. This agreement, which  heralds peace, has considerably consolidated Croatia's  international position as Croatia's interests correspond with  those of the West. Thanks to its principled policies Croatia  has been accepted as an entity with which the United States and  the EC are conducting international policies.    Croatia is no longer under the threat of sanctions. On the  contrary, full support has been demonstrated for the security of  the Croatian state and a quicker reintegration of the UN  protected areas into the constitutional and legal framework of  the Republic of Croatia and for the return of refugees at the  earliest possible moment. The aid needed for the restoration of  the country has been promised, while prospects are also opening  up for economic cooperation because the signed agreement has met  with positive reactions not only in the Western world but also  in Islamic countries.    The government of the Republic of Croatia will raise a  number  of concrete demands with United States, EC, and international  financial institutions to secure the aid promised for the  restoration of the country and for financing individual  projects. A delegation to take part in the further negotiations  in Vienna has also been appointed. It is tasked with drawing up  all relevant documents for signing a final agreement at the  highest level.    The Council also discussed the imminent expiry of the UN  Protection Forces mandate in Croatia. To this effect it decided  to prepare a demand for concrete measures, the emphasis of which  should be placed on full control over Croatian borders. The  demands will be submitted to the UN Security Council before the  expiry of the mandate.    Discussing the continuation of the initiated process of  normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, the council stated  that the process of normalization ought to continue but one has  also to resolutely let the other side know that Croatian and  international interests will not tolerate any further attempts  at outmaneuvering the implementation of relevant UN resolutions.    At its session today the council also discussed the need to  finalize as soon as possible the procedure of appointing the  state judiciary council. In this context it appointed a group  who will inform it about what has been done so far, it is  written at the end of the statement from the session of the  Presidential Council of Defense and National Security.</p>

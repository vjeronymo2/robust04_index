			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Casualties of gambling must not be ignored Sir, David Spanier, in his article 'Britain joins in a game once deemed a sin' (January 9), omits the central point about expanding the availability of gambling. It is, that the more people who gamble, and the greater the frequency, the more casualties occur from this activity. There is unquestioned evidence that the incidence of compulsive gambling is directly related to states and provinces where it is introduced. That a government would promote such an activity is no different from a government promoting the drinking of alcohol or the smoking of cigarettes. Furthermore, it has also been shown that the people who wager are the ones most vulnerable - single males on the fringe of society, minorities, late adolescents and young adults. And, still further, that gambling is a form of regressive taxation on this group. It is not responsible journalism for you to have omitted reference to the many epidemiological and sociological studies found in the Journal of Gambling Behavior. It goes without saying that any government which fosters such 'risky' activity without generous provision for researching the human damage and offering treatment, is not a government of the people. Sirgay Sanger, president and chairman, National Council on Problem Gambling, 69 East 89th Street, New York, NY 10028 US</p>

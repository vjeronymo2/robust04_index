			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Altruism and fear in middle ground A MIXTURE OF resignation, fear and altruism was expressed by middle-income professionals yesterday facing the prospect of higher taxes under a Labour government. Mr David Land, a bank official in Edinburgh earning between Pounds 30,000 and 40,000 said: 'Labour's tax plans would make me more miserable, most of my money goes to looking after our family. I would like see John Major returned by a whisker, but also to get constitutional change in Scotland.' He plans to vote Liberal Democrat. Less certain about his voting intentions was Mr Keith Green, who is in the same earnings bracket. He is single and an account director at a London marketing consultancy. He said that under Labour he would pay more tax without any guarantee of improved public transport or education. 'They seem to be taking money from a small group and giving it to another,' he said. 'I'll vote either Tory or Liberal Democrat.' Ms Sara Ramsden, a single London television producer in the same earnings bracket, said: 'I am concerned about what might happen with personal pensions, but the difference between Labour and Tory on my take-home pay would be around Pounds 500 a year. I am happy that money should go to support education and health.' Mr Charles Stafford, a single building engineer in London also earning Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000, said he would be happy to pay more in taxes and plans to vote Labour. 'If you look at the lack of funding in education more money has to be raised from the population.' The resolve to vote Conservative was a strong as ever for Mr Adam Applegarth, 29, assistant general manager at Northern Rock building society in Newcastle upon Tyne. He earns Pounds 45,000 a year, has a wife, who is not earning, and two children under six. 'I don't believe John Smith can hold the line against their spending ministers,' he said. Mr Roderick Nicol, an Exeter management training consultant on Pounds 50,000, would be hit by Labour's proposals. 'I'm not sure I trust any of the parties to spend money wisely,' he said. He planned to stick with the Conservatives. Some hardened Conservative voters were reluctant to comment publicly on their circumstances. One London corporate financier, single, aged 34 and earning between Pounds 40,000 and Pounds 50,000, said Labour's budget confirmed his intention to vote Tory. But a high income was no guarantee of Tory support. One publishing director, single, aged 27 and earning more than Pounds 60,000 a year, said she would vote Liberal Democrat. 'I feel guilty about the money I earn.' Additional reporting by Chris Tighe, James Buxton and Richard Tomkins.</p>

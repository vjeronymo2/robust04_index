			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Puma climbs back into profit PUMA, the German sports shoe and equipment company owned by Aritmos of Sweden, has finally broken into profit. Its return to the black for 1991 follows several difficult years of stiff competition in the US market and production hold-ups in Asia. The company made a group profit of around DM11m (Dollars 7m) before tax and restructuring costs. Mr Stefan Jacobsson, chief executive, said the move out of 1990's loss of DM9.4m made it clear the group was now on an upward trend. Puma had already foreshadowed a return to profit, despite having hopes of an end to its Far Eastern losses dashed by regional troubles in 1991. These stemmed from the organisational difficulties of shifting production to low-cost Indonesia, and a fire in the Philippines factory. Formerly owned by members of the Dassler family, Puma slipped into loss in 1986, the year its preference shares were sold to the public.</p>

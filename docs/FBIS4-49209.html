			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang] </F>   [Text] The son of a former state president is tipped to  head the 100,000-man armed police in a forthcoming reshuffle of  the anti-riot force in a bid to maintain stability in the  post-Deng era.    The decision to promote Liu Yuan, son of the ousted Chinese  president Liu Shaoqi, to political commissar of the paramilitary  force was a compromise between conservative and reformist  factions, Chinese sources said.    The younger Mr Liu, former vice-governor of central Henan  Province, joined the armed police last year as political  commissar of the paramilitary police's division responsible for  safeguarding the nation's reservoir and power projects.    Sources said his transfer from the civilian to the security  establishment last year was a move arranged by his patrons to  pave the way for his promotion in the armed police force.    Mr Liu's new unit is considered a key element both in the  internal power rivalries of Chinese leaders and in maintaining  social stability in the post-Deng era.    Many of the influential incumbent party elders, known for  their conservative views, were either supporters or proteges of  Mr Liu's father. But Mr Liu himself is widely considered as a  young educated reformist official Beijing sources said.    They added that Mr Liu's promotion was expected to be  welcomed by many party elders and military officers.    China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and state president  Jiang    Zemin were the key persons behind the decision.    Mr Deng has been actively trying to promote Mr Jiang's  status  and hold over both the People's Liberation Army and the security  apparatus, which includes the police, armed police and state  security forces.    Mr Jiang, who is also party chief and chairman of the  Central  Military Commission, has been trying to strengthen his hold over  the security apparatus, especially the armed police in the past  year.    During his recent trips to the localities, he sought out and  talked to senior officers of the regional army, paramilitary  police and the police.    Last September, Mr Jiang called a meeting of top armed  police  officers in Beijing and urged them to be ready in the "struggle  to safeguard state security and social stability" while  observing "the absolute leadership of the party".    Aside from patrolling the borders, the armed police must  also  respond to internal challenges to the party and government,  including those posed by dissidents and "class enemies".</p>

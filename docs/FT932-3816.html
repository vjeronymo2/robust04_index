			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Colonials' victory secures a corner on sports pages IT DID NOT quite make the front pages, but at least it made the front page of the sports sections, which soccer rarely does and especially not on mornings after the finish of ice hockey's finals, the first round of basketball's championship series and a full major league baseball schedule. The New York Times even thought it worthy of wry humour. Its skyline read: 'In another upset, Colonials 2, Red Coats 0.' Just in case the point was missed, its story of the match was headlined; 'Redcoats in Massachusetts? You already know the result.' Other newspapers were a little more prosaic about the US victory over England's soccer team in Foxboro, just down the road from Lexington where the 'first shot around the world' - the start of the American Revolution - was heard in 1775. The Washington Post's historical comparison could only reach back as far as 1989 to the great US triumph in the World Cup qualifying competition over mighty Trinidad and Tobago. But even to raise that equally epochal US performance must have hurt the English. Of course, there were many references to the 1950 US victory over England in Belo Horizonte, but that was an achievement far more burned in infamy in English recollections than in the American sporting consciousness. After all, in 1950 Ted Williams was still in his prime and Jackie Robinson, the first black in major league baseball, was capturing the national imagination. But this was also matched by simple amazement about the Wednesday result; after all this is a US team whose record in its last 15 matches, several against Caribbean and Central American teams, was a miserable single win (against Saudi Arabia), five losses and nine draws; it had failed to score in nearly 400 minutes play. Soccer has had a hard time re-establishing itself in the US since Pele hung up his boots for the New York Cosmos 15 years ago. But, as host of next year's World Cup, the US soccer establishment is at least trying and a victory over England can do no harm. But the competition for attention on Wednesday night was unusually severe. The last round of the Stanley Cup saw the Montreal Canadiens beat the Los Angeles Kings 4-1. The US is a bit ambivalent about ice hockey, but not about its luminous star, Wayne Gretzky, whose last game this may have been. Far exceeding that was the titanic first round clash in basketball, in which the Chicago Bulls beat the Phoenix Suns. This, too, was portrayed as the ultimate confrontation between two shaven-headed nonpareils - Michael 'Air' Jordan and 'Sir' Charles Barkley. In addition, the Baltimore Orioles - the nearest major league baseball team to Washington - have suddenly woken up. Thus the telecast of the US-England game only appeared on the deliciously named Home Team Sports cable station after the Os had put it to the (Oakland) As. Your correspondent, channel-surfing all night, confesses to have fallen asleep within five minutes of the Foxboro kickoff. UK clubs risk own goal, Page 6</p>

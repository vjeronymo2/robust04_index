			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 22 (AFP) -- The United Nations is  proposing a renamed, federal Georgia to resolve a conflict  between Tbilisi and the separatist region of Abkhazia, Swiss  mediator Edouard Brunner told journalists Friday [22 April].    Talks on a political solution to the conflict, held in  Geneva  since Tuesday with Russian participation, will continue May 10  in Moscow.    The idea is to create a decentralised new state within the  same frontiers, said Brunner, special representative of UN  secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The United Nations is insisting on the principle of  territorial integrity in the proposal, which has been presented  to both delegations, and "the two sides have come closer on a  certain number of points and ideas," he commented.    Brunner could not say whether the Abkhazians, who have  fought  for independence throughout 1993, would accept such a compromise.    "We are talking on the basis that they accept to discuss a  state which is not an independant Abkhazian state, but I cannot  read their hearts," he said.    A ceasefire agreement signed in Moscow April 4 includes  talks  on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia and the  deployment of UN peacekeepers as well as the political  settlement.    Brunner said he was waiting for a response from the two  sides  this weekend to a framework proposal for a UN force including up  to 30 percent Russian troops and contingents from other former  Soviet republics.    Last week UN and Russian negotiators came up with proposals  for a buffer force of 2,500 international observers between the  two sides along the Inguri River.</p>

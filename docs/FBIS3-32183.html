			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Guatemalan Defense Minister </F> General Mario Enriquez with unidentified reporters; place and  date not given; from the "Telepress" newscast]    [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez referred to  the U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Guatemala.    [Begin recording] [Enriquez] The president of the Republic  must defend the government. As a staunch defender of human  rights, he would not like to hear that there have been  violations of those rights during his presidential term.  Unfortunately, there have been a few cases during the six or  seven months since he assumed power.    Those are the cases mentioned by the State Department. This  was not a report but a statement expressing its position with  regard to the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC]. That  position is well-known in Guatemala and has resulted in  significant reduction in the number of voluntary patrols. Right  now only 40 percent of those patrols still exist, most of them  in the Departments of Huehuetenango, El Quiche, and Alta  Verapaz, where subversive groups are still present, which is the  why those patrols were created. The president of the Republic  has explained all that.    In addition, during a visit to the United States at the  invitation of General Sullivan, chief of staff of the U.S. Armed  Forces [title as heard], I met with representatives of various  nongovernmental human rights organizations and State Department  officials. I also visited the Pentagon for the first time. I  must say that during my meetings with nongovernmental  organizations, representatives from [words indistinct], Americas  Watch, Attorneys for Human Rights, including (Jennifer Harbury),  they were very sincere and broadminded about our situation.    I believe the government should also try to continue this  kind of communication, because many countries know only one side  of the story.    [Reporter] The State Department's report said that the  members of the Armed Forces, PAC, and the National Police are  the ones conducting these actions, including a majority of  extrajudicial executions. Do you agree or disagree?    [Enriquez] I agree, to a certain extent, because we cannot  deny that there have been some actions by PAC, for example the  case in Colotenango, which fortunately is already being handled  by the court. There have been other cases, like the regrettable  case of Jorge Carpio Nicole. Although those responsible have  not been fully identified, we strongly condemn these actions,  which should not occur in Guatemala. There have also been cases  of military policemen involved in bank holdups and national  policemen who have made mistakes.    There really have been very few violations of human rights  in  the past year. What has increased is the number of cases  reported. I believe 13,000 cases were reported, but there is no  evidence in these. We are aware of the situation.    We deeply regret the case of Jorge Carpio Nicole; we want to  find out who was responsible, so the weight of the law will fall  on the culprits. We suspect this was done the [word indistinct]  because they have killed many people. There are still many  doubts, but we believe the case will be resolved. The case of  the PAC in Colotenango has already been settled.    Now that the human rights meeting in Geneva is coming up,  some groups are trying to revive cases that occurred in 1989-92.  But the truth is that there has been significant progress in  Guatemala with regard to respect for human and individual and  political rights. Now there is more awareness of the people's  social and economic rights, but this will take time, and  violations will cease as Guatemalans' standard of living  improves. It will not be easy.    The police, the Army, the government, the PAC are the ones  usually accused because in the opinion of many statesmen and  according to, let's say, ideas held in common all over the  world, only the state can violate human rights because it is the  guarantor, it is responsible for guaranteeing respect for human  rights.    But at the last two meetings in Geneva the URNG [Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity] was also condemned because blowing  up electricity towers is indeed a human rights violation,  blowing up bridges is indeed a human rights violation. That is  sheer ingratitude; this is a poor country with many  infrastructural needs, and they carry out those attacks to the  detriment of the right to free movement and against life, by  preventing the supply of electrical energy. I know of the  problems and the torment the hospitals ensure with those sudden  blackouts, during which some people have even died. [end  recording]</p>

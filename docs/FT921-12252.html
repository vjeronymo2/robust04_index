			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Merchant bank in DM200m offering THE Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, is launching an issue of profit-sharing certificates (Genusscheine) packaged together with warrants. The nominal value of the issue will be DM200m, although the precise amount to be raised for the bank will not be determined until the issued is priced ahead of the planned offer date of March 1. Shareholders will be offered one certificate (nominal value of DM1,000) plus warrants for every 32 ordinary shares held. Each certificate comes with two warrants, entitling the shareholder to subscribe to one new DM50 ordinary share at two different dates. The certificates will be redeemed on June 30 2003. Details of the issue - the price of the certificates and the scope of the entitlement to profit share as well as the terms of the warrants - will be fixed and published shortly before the offer is formally launched. The certificates and the new warrants will be traded on the Frankfurt and Berlin stock exchanges. The bank said it was making this issue in order to strengthen its capital base under the terms of the German Banking Act. 'Given the sustained growth of our business volume, BHF-Bank is pursuing its policy of maintaining its good capital base by taking early capital-raising measures,' the bank said. Genusscheine are a hybrid between debt and equity treated as Tier Two Capital by the Bank for International Settlements and regular liable capital by German regulatory authorities.</p>

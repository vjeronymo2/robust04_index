			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The 1993 Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper  acknowledged in a Cabinet meeting the other day takes up the  issue of the safety of plutonium. More than 40% of the  main  body of the paper is used to explain that various measures are  being taken to ensure safety. In regard to the safety of  plutonium, the over-sea transport of plutonium by the  Akatsuki-Maru was the turning point since which apprehension has  been spreading among the people of Japan. For Japan, which puts  the nuclear fuel cycle as the pillar of its government policies  on atomic energy, wiping out this apprehension has become an  urgent issue. Given that alone, it is a good thing that a  definite assessment was given in the Nuclear Energy Safety White  Paper. Nevertheless, in promoting atomic energy, which is a  basis for non-fossil-fuel energy, constant effort aimed at  molding public acceptance is essential, and, while making doubly  sure about ensuring safety, the government should also use any  opportunity to get the people's understanding.    Excluding the data section, the main body of the Nuclear  Energy Safety White Paper consists of two sections: ``The  Current State of Nuclear Energy Safety Ensurance Measures'' and  ``Ensuring Safety in the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear Power Plant  Facilities.'' The two parts of the paper describe in detail the  measures for ensuring safety in nuclear reactors when the  plutonium formed in the nuclear fuel cycle is used.    Plutonium is obtained by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.  There is apprehension about the effects on the human body due to  radiation and chemical toxicity if plutonium is ingested or  inhaled. The chemical toxicity of plutonium is like that of  heavy metals. Although plutonium is thought to cause kidney  damage, the stance taken in the white paper is that there should  be more concern about the effects due to its radiation because  the specific radioactivity of plutonium is higher than that of  uranium. For that reason the paper focuses on FBRs, ATRs, and  LWRs in explaining how to prevent leaks and which other sorts of  measures should be taken to guarantee safety when plutonium is  actually burned in reactors to generate electrical power. It is  made clear that everything possible at the present point in time  is being done.    However, what must be considered here is that the opposition  to and unease about the use of plutonium are due in part to the  many technical unknowns. Actually, the Monju prototype FBR has  not yet reached criticality, and the Fugen prototype ATR is in  the stage of continued operation. The use of plutonium in an LWR  is slated to begin in the middle of this decade. Certainly the  government is compelled to recognize that the technological  incompleteness is what arouses anxiety.    The government must also pay heed to the fact that the  suspicions about undue information regulation for the purpose of  protecting nuclear substances is one of the grounds of the  argument against plutonium use. Although measures to guard  against mishaps such as nuclear hijacking are essential, the  government should recognize that opening up to public as much  information as possible is an important scheme that will appease  the opposition.    Furthermore, we cannot ignore the fact that an increasing  number of prudent nations in Europe and America are on the route  to a nuclear fuel cycle. Rather than worrying so much about  safety, the attitudes in Europe and America are based on reasons  such as financial difficulties, doubts about the economy of  FBRs, and preventing nuclear proliferation. Nevertheless, it is  inevitable that doubts as to why only Japan sticks out will be  stirred up. Safety is not the only problem with the use of  plutonium.</p>

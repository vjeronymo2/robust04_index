			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Poland outstrips emerging markets - Companies are about to capitalise on Warsaw's boom While emerging market strategists debate the appeal of Asia, or Latin America, Polish equities have left more conventional choices far behind this year. The Warsaw Stock Exchange has seen an almost uninterrupted boom since last Easter, taking the WIG index up from 1,040.7 at the end of last year to 11,354.6 yesterday, up 433.6 or 4 per cent on the day, and indicating gains of 991 and 718 per cent in local currency, and dollar terms respectively. The process has taken the recent return to government of former communists and their allies in its stride and share prices are expected to continue on the upgrade, at least for the early months of 1994. Mr Marek Borowski, Poland's finance minister and deputy premier responsible for the economy, has told investors that the government intends to give a top priority to privatisation through public share issues. In another confidence bolstering move the prime minister, Mr Waldemar Pawlak, has reaffirmed the promise that capital gains would remain untaxed, as planned by his predecessors, until the end of 1995. With continuing strong demand from domestic investors, Warsaw is still capable of weekly gains of 10 per cent on some shares, in spite of a slowdown last month. Now quoting 22 stocks, its ability to soak up new offerings was demonstrated by a recent public offer of 30.1 per cent of the equity in Bank Slaski. The bank, one of the nine state owned banks being sold off under the government's bank privatisation programme, saw a massive oversubscription with over 800,000 applicants offering 7,993.2bn zlotys (Dollars 372m) for 1,226.5bn zlotys worth of shares. The 500,000 zloty offer price should more than treble when the bank is first quoted on the WSE in the new year. There were many, effectively multiple applications. Nevertheless the Bank Slaski offer should lead to a major increase in the 200,000 or so investors who already have accounts with the country's 36 stockbrokers. In fact, the increased volume of business engendered by the offer threatens to swamp the brokers and means that the WSE has been forced to postpone the introduction of additional sessions until the second quarter of 1994. However, the numbers mean that the exchange, which reopened after a break of 52 years in April 1991, is firmly entrenched. 'Its development cannot be reversed' says Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the WSE chairman, commenting on the implications of the new centre left government. Small investors have rushed to buy shares this year and the underlying stocks, on an average p/e ratio of 36, are 20 to 30 per cent overvalued according to one foreign analyst. However, the market is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Financial reporting is developing in newpapers and newletters, and information on Polish stocks is being put out by foreign brokers like Smith New Court and the Italian-owned IMI Securities. Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank, which has just opened the first foreign-owned broking house in Warsaw, is also producing copious reports. Foreign investors, expected to bring a measure of stability to the exchange and accounting for 25 per cent of the stock ownership and 10 per cent of daily trading according to Mr Rozlucki, have drawn back a little as they wait for the bubble to burst. But there is also the prospect of more foreign input. The Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund, owned by the Boston-based Pioneer Group, has net current assets worth Dollars 350m of which one-third has been invested on the WSE. Turnover slowed in November as investors accumulated funds for the Bank Slaski offer. That channelled funds into the treasury, but now the exchange faces its first test as a provider of capital to the corporate sector as companies already quoted plan rights issues and private companies consider going public. This month sees a 500m zlotys rights issue from the Export Development Bank while Exbud, a construction company, and Swarzedz, a furniture producer, have already announced new share issues. The privately owned Kredyt Bank is planning to float its equity in the middle of next year, and become the fifth bank to be quoted on the WSE.</p>

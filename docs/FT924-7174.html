			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Long trek ahead for S Africa on the road from apartheid: FW de Klerk remains the only person who can complete the country's democratisation process THREE years after President FW de Klerk started South Africa's trek away from apartheid, the most positive thing to be said about him is that only he can complete the process: if, indeed, it can be completed at all. Whether or not he knew about the criminal farce perpetrated by his security forces against the African National Congress (ANC); whether or not he has, as must now be suspected, a deliberate policy to destabilise and undermine his political opponents; whether or not he is, as must be open to doubt, the 'man of integrity' whom ANC President Nelson Mandela once trusted; the fact is that the new South Africa cannot be born without him. But after Monday's revelations of low-life trickery from the military (involving an intelligence plot to use criminals and prostitutes to infiltrate the ANC's military wing), coupled with growing suspicions of far worse official crimes, doubts have been raised whether President de Klerk has the will,stamina, tact and skill to deliver a new multi-racial democracy. To prove he has, he must take action to tame his security forces, or abandon hope of a new South Africa. Failure would suggest that he is either too weak or too devious to succeed. The consequences of failure are already apparent. South African society is in crisis on almost every level: every week brings revelations of official plots to discredit the ANC and new allegations of official assassinations; every day seems to bring to light a new government corruption scandal, an unedifying display of venality and incompetence which may have cost South African taxpayers billions of rands. True to the traditions of Africa, a continent scarcely renowned for governmental probity, no ministers have resigned as a direct result of scandal. But the cabinet has been severely weakened none the less, as some of the most able ministers have resigned due to ill health or mental or marital problems. Meanwhile, black families continue to be massacred as politicians demonstrate lack of will to stop the violence. Leaders of the parties who signed a national peace deal last September (including the ANC and the mainly-Zulu Inkatha) refuse even to meet to discuss its implementation. And the dark mood of the nation is further blackened by economic decline. South Africa is completing its fourth dreary year of recession, and good rains to break the drought cannot on their own guarantee substantial recovery. Only a political deal on a new constitution can achieve that, but progress is painfully slow. Moderate ANC elements as well as moderates in Pretoria demonstrate the will to do a deal to govern South Africa in the transition to full democracy, but they have agreed few details. And even if they do, both sides may face sabotage from their own stubborn radicals. The two main players, government and the ANC, are due within a fortnight to retreat to a marathon negotiating session of up to a week. But such evidence of cozy collusion enrages Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of Inkatha, and peace in Natal can never be guaranteed as long as he remains estranged from negotiations. Revelations from the respected Goldstone Commission into political violence have cast a further shadow on the president's reputation. Mr Justice Goldstone, never one to jump to unwarranted conclusions, clearly believes that he is on the trail of a Third Force of security force members used to destabilise the ANC. Others, less circumspect, insist a Third Force had at least some role in fomenting the violence which has left thousands dead since Mr de Klerk took power. Mr de Klerk has consistently shied away from his most difficult problem: how to rein in the security forces, to ensure that they operate impartially but without provoking a revolt. South Africa's political violence cannot be tackled until the organs of state security prove their legitimacy and commitment to law and order. With their Wild West morals and conservative political views, that will not be easy. But, as South African political scientist Frederik van Zyl Slabbert points out, 'a new government, particularly a democratically elected one, that inherits a recalcitrant civil service and especially an antagonistic security force is a recipe for disaster and will make short shrift of any democratic constitution.' Much will depend on whether President de Klerk can regain the initiative lost in recent months. His strategy demands a position of strength. His goal is to legitimise the political system while retaining a substantial share of power for whites. In other words, to reform, not to revolutionise. But to reform the state is far more difficult than to destroy it, as Mikhail Gorbachev can attest from his reformist experiment in the former Soviet Union. The next few months will tell whether Mr de Klerk can succeed where Mr Gorbachev so tragically failed. Editorial Comment, Page 18</p>

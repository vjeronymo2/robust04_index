			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: FILM TOO 'TECHNICAL'  </P> <P> "They get into the technical (stuff); how wonderful this shot is, or that  special effect. They don't show the humanity of the people anymore, like they  did in the Spencer Tracy movies."  </P> <P> So laments Frederic Forrest, the veteran character actor and Oscar nominee (for  "The Rose") about these newfangled movies that tend to favor hardware over  heart.  </P> <P> The gravelly voiced actor hails his new movie, "Valentino Returns," as a  throwback to the days when movies put a lump in your throat. Forrest plays a  philandering '50s lounge singer whose wife abruptly leaves him and whose  teen-age son has just obtained a sparkling new pink Cadillac, which he takes  out to find adventure, romance and sex -- but only finds trouble.  </P> <P> Forrest, having been directed by the likes of Francis Coppola, Costa-Gavras and  Arthur Penn, did wage the occasional battle with first-time director Peter  Hoffman on this project.  </P> <P> "We fought a lot, and I was kind of hard on him, but I had to tell him the  actor's viewpoint," says Forrest, while stressing that Hoffman showed growth  throughout the shoot. "He'd been to film school and so forth, he didn't know  the acting experience as well as someone who had come out of the Actors Studio,  but he handled it very well."  </P> <P> Forrest is finishing up his stint on "The Two Jakes," which "Joker" Jack  Nicholson directs and stars. Forrest, God help him, was on the set the day  after Nicholson's beloved Los Angeles Lakers were swept clean away by the  Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> "Awww, Jack was OK," said Forrest, who once sauntered up to Nicholson, hoping  to enlighten him with a Lakers-Pistons update.  </P> <P> "Don't mention it, you snake," says Forrest, affecting an impeccable imitation  of Nicholson, "talk to me later, 'cause I taped it."

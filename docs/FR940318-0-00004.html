			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Adding an alternative laboratory procedure for mycoplasma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing using a microtiter technique;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Providing for the most contemporary laboratory methods for use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental sample selection,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> isolation, examination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> reactors, and program monitoring procedures for egg-type chicken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breeding flocks, meat-type chicken breeding flocks, and waterfowl, exhibition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poultry, and game bird breeding flocks; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Amending the procedure for determining the status and effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sanitation monitored programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes discussed above, we also proposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignate, revise, or amend certain footnotes in the regulations and remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph designations where they appeared before individual definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period ending September 24, 1993. We received three comments by that date,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a State department of agriculture, a college of veterinary medicine, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a veterinary research laboratory. These comments are addressed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment referred to our proposal to amend &sect;145.23(d)(1) to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of a federally licensed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella enteritidis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> bacterin to vaccinate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> birds in egg-type chicken multiplier breeding flocks following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bacteriological examination of environmental samples collected when the birds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were 2 to 4 weeks of age. The commenter asked if there was a decrease in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficacy of the bacterin when older birds were vaccinated. The label on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensed bacterin calls for birds to be vaccinated twice, once at 10 to 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks of age, and again at 17 to 18 weeks of age; there are no instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding older birds. Because the bacterin must be used in accordance with the label instructions, we believe that the regulations need not address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vaccination of older birds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our proposed amendment to &sect;147.7, ``Standard test procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mycoplasma,'' the second sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C) states that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilution required to give four hemagglutination (HA) units is calculated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dividing the stock antigen HA titer by 8. One commenter stated that the stock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antigen HA titer should be divided by 4 instead of 8. We disagree. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antigen titration is done with volumes of 50 &mu;L. In the HI test, 25 &mu;L of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antigen is added to 25 &mu;L of serum dilution. The antigen, then, must contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 HA units in 25 &mu;L; the 4 HA units would then be doubled for 50 &mu;L, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dividing by 8 is correct. Therefore, we did not make any changes in response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also in our proposed amendment to &sect;147.7, paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calls for the serial dilution of 25 &mu;L from a specified number of wells. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that such multiple transfers of volumes as small as 25 &mu;L  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be difficult using a multichannel pipettor due to incomplete volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer. We believe that no change in the regulations is necessary because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multichannel pipettors calibrated to deliver the proper volume are readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available from commercial sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (e)(iv)(B)(3) of &sect;147.7 states that for the assay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in the paragraph to be valid, the backtitration of the antigen must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be 1:4 or 1:8. One commenter suggested that the latter number should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> omitted because a backtitration of 1:8 would result in potentially suppressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HI titers. We believe that the 4&hyph;HA to 8&hyph;HA range allows for realistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance variation within the test while maintaining stringent quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control. As proposed, the protocol stated that the positive control must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within one dilution of the previously determined titer, so any loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity would be detected if a backtitration approaching 8 HA units was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppressing the HI titers of samples. Therefore, we did not make any changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in response to the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter pointed out that the 1:5 serum dilution referred to in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (e)(2)(v)(D)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of the proposed amendment to &sect;147.7 should actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a 1:5.5 serum dilution. While 1:5.5 is actually correct, the ultimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serial dilutions of the sample would be 1:11, 1:22, 1:44, etc., each of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be presented as the nearest standard dilution (1:10, 1:20, 1:40, etc.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without a loss of accuracy in the test. Therefore, we did not make any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in response to the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;147.11 stated that the Analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Profile Index for Enterobacteriaceae (API) system may be used to aid cultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifications. One commenter noted that API is not the only such system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could be used. We agree and have changed &sect;147.11(a)(5) to indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems other than API are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two of the comments encouraged us to amend illustration 1 in &sect;147.11 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately reflect the procedures called for in the text of proposed new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;147.11. As proposed, the text of &sect;147.11(a)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required the inoculation of non-selective plates in addition to two selective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plating media. The commenters pointed out that the upper right-hand block of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illustration 1 did not include the inoculation of non-selective plates. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree, and have added the inoculation of non-selective plates to the upper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right-hand block of illustration 1. The probability of isolating  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from organ tissues will be enhanced if non-selective plating media are used in addition to selective plating media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The main theme of Premier Li Peng's government work  report submitted to the Second Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] is: Grasping opportunities, deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and  maintaining stability. This main theme is where the overall  interests of the whole party and the whole country lie.    With such a theme in mind, this reporter yesterday  interviewed provincial Governor Ma Zhongchen, who is also a  Henan deputy to the on-going Second Session of the Eighth NPC in  Beijing, on how to successfully press ahead with Henan's  economic work and quicken Henan's development pace in the years  ahead.    Ma Zhongchen said: Since reform and opening up, Henan has  rapidly developed the economy as well as exploited and utilized  superior local resources. In 1993, Henan's gross national  product reached almost 160 billion yuan, representing a 10-fold  increase over 1978. Nevertheless, due to the limitations of  Henan's traditional planned economic structure, including the  traditional regional economic setup, the shortage of funds and  technology, and so on, Henan has remained to date as a principal  producer and exporter of farm and sideline products, energy, raw  and processed materials, as well as other key primary products.  In view of this fact, Henan has yet to fully develop superior  resources and raise resource exploitation efficiency.    Ma Zhongchen emphatically noted: The general train of  thought regarding Henan's economic growth in the years to come  should be: Quickening the pace of turning the province's  national economy into a market economy, comprehensively  implementing a strategy of building strong industry, improving  agriculture, making urban economic development push ahead with  rural economic development, effecting omnidirectional opening  up, and attaining higher development goals, and take the road of  development of carrying out intensive processing, exploiting  superior resources according to international and domestic  market demands, and turning resource superiority into economic  superiority. This train of thought regarding Henan's economic  growth was mapped out in a serious manner and in light of the  realities in Henan.    Mao Zhongchen emphatically noted: In order to implement to  the letter the aforementioned train of thought regarding Henan's  development, we should first and foremost try to enhance a sense  of a market economy, undergo four ideological transformations,  and focus on three key aspects.    Ma Zhongchen noted: The four ideological transformations are  as follows: 1. To build projects in light of market demands  instead of available resources. 2. To develop an intensive  processing industry capable of speeding up superior local  resources exploitation rather than step up superior resources  exploitation aimed at building an intensive processing industry.  3. To exploit resources in light of the international and  domestic market demands rather than domestic market demands  alone. At present, we should vigorously develop export-oriented  industries, enterprises, and products. 4. To make full use of  both overseas and domestic resources rather than local resources  alone. To this end, we should make more use of overseas  resources, including overseas funds, technology, qualified  personnel, and information, and turn them into a supplement to  such local resources as land, farm and sideline products,  mineral products, and labor.    The three key aspects are as follows: 1. To vigorously step  up intensive processing of superior mineral resources so as to  further develop coal energy industry, coal chemical industry,  petrochemical industry, aluminium industry, and building  material industry. 2. To successfully carry out intensive  processing of farm and sideline products. 3. To bring local  geographical superiority into full play and step up local human  resources exploitation.    Ma Zhongchen pointed out: In order to really turn resource  superiority into economic superiority, we should adopt practical  and feasible measures and carry out work in a down-to-earth  manner by devoting more energies to the following five things:  1. To deepen reform, adhere to the public ownership system as  the basis, vigorously develop various economic factors, fully  mobilize the enthusiasm of various parties concerned, and push  ahead with Henan's overall economic growth. 2. To further  expand opening up and make more use of foreign capital,  technology, and qualified personnel. 3. To promote scientific  and technological progress with an eye to raising technological  levels and output of Henan's national economy. 4. To raise  construction funds through more channels and in more forms and  successfully build each and every key project. 5. To establish  more lateral economic associations and invite coastal and  hinterland provinces to invest in Henan and take part in Henan's  resources exploitation.</p>

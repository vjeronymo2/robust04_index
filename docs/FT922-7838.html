			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's to look at structure of CUB FOSTER'S Brewing Group, the Australian beer, pastoral and finance group, yesterday announced a review of the structure of its Carlton and United Breweries (CUB) subsidiary, Australia's biggest brewer. The review was announced by Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive, as part of a drive to recover market share lost to National Brewing, the former brewing arm of Bond Corporation Holdings, now owned by Lion Nathan of New Zealand. Mr Kunkel said the review was 'a normal part of a management's task in any efficient organisation, and will ensure that the company is properly focussed to meet the opportunities of the 1990s'. However, the review is also in line with views expressed by Mr John Elliott, deputy chairman of Foster's. Mr Elliott believes the group has failed to extract full value from CUB's near-monopoly in Victoria, Australia's second most populous state. International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company controlled by Mr Elliott, owns 38 per cent of Foster's, but will be in breach of loan covenants on debts of about ADollars 2.5bn unless its bankers approve a financial restructuring plan due to be delivered today. The restructuring plan is believed to focus on a proposed merger of Foster's with SA Brewing, the South Australian drinks and industrial group run by Mr Ross Wilson. The plan suggests the merger could be accomplished through a share swap allowing IBH to repay much of its debt, and secure a return of about ADollars 2.60 for Foster's shareholders, compared with last night's closing price of ADollars 1.86. The deal has not been approved by the boards of SA Brewing or Foster's, and is understood to be opposed by Foster's directors, including Mr Nobby Clark, chairman. The deal would also face significant regulatory problems, including the need to gain approval from the Trade Practices Commission for a further reduction in competition in Australia's highly concentrated brewing market. Analysts said the review of CUB was likely to help IBH persuade the banks to roll over its debts, especially if it helps convince them that restructuring the Australian brewing operations will lift Foster's earnings and dividends. IBH depends on dividends from Foster's to pay interest on its debts, which was acquired to fund the purchase of the Foster's shareholding - the company's only asset. The shares are worth about ADollars 1.6bn. The company's bank lenders include Hongkong Bank Australia and Citibank. Analysts say the banks are unlikely to try to wind up the company in the short term. The most likely outcome is a deal which would remove some of IBH's debt and reduce the uncertainty surrounding the group.</p>

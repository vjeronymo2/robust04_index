			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Minolta Camera to expand office equipment business MINOLTA Camera will restructure its US subsidiaries and introduce an early-retirement plan for employees. The move is unusual for a Japanese company and a sign of the severe problems confronting the camera-maker. Workers are to be transferred from the struggling camera division to the office equipment division, on which the company is counting for a reversal of its fortunes. In the year to the end of March, Minolta reported a pre-tax loss of Y8.9bn (Dollars 70.2m), its first in 26 years. It was forced to write off a further Y16.9bn after agreeing to settle a US patent dispute. The company said at least 70 of its 2,500 employees in the US would take early retirement. A similar restructuring would be necessary for its European operations. Traditionally strong in foreign markets, which have been volatile in the past year, Minolta's long-term strategy includes increasing the share of domestic camera sales and expanding its office equipment business. However, the company was surprised by an industry-wide fall in domestic camera sales, including those of the single-lens reflex, for which it is best known. The market contracted by 9 per cent, while prices for new models fell by as much as 30 per cent. Meanwhile, Minolta has had difficulty penetrating the crowded domestic office equipment market, where its sales last year fell 5.6 per cent. Encouraged by a 7.3 per cent rise in exports, it is placing more emphasis on foreign sales. This new emphasis is reflected in the transfer of many of its 400 US camera workers to the marketing division for printers, colour copiers and other business equipment. It has found the US office automation market more accessible than the domestic one, characterised by loyalty to suppliers within a corporate family, or keiretsu.</p>

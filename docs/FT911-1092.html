			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: High ratings herald renewed optimism - Scottish Tories gather for their 1991 conference A SCOTTISH Conservative party activist, looking ahead to her party's annual conference which begins this afternoon, said: 'I expect we'll be a pretty happy bunch.' Scots Tories are always fairly happy when they get together, if only because they can temporarily drop that wariness about expressing their views too forthrightly which comes from being in a country where only 24 per cent of the electorate voted Conservative at the last election. Their happiness is increased by the knowledge that the party's standing in the opinion polls in Scotland is now, according to System Three in the Glasgow Herald, 27 per cent - one of its highest ratings since the early 1980s. The fact that before Mrs Margaret Thatcher was replaced by Mr John Major the party stood at 16 per cent tells its own story. In recent months the Scottish party has done better in local government by-elections than at any time since the 1970s. Mrs Thatcher herself helped to heal divisions last autumn by removing Mr Michael Forsyth, the right-wing Scottish Office minister, from his disastrous 14-month tenure of the Scottish party chairmanship. He was replaced by Lord Sanderson, a long-serving party dignitary. Yet in Perth the party is having to swallow the planned replacement of the community charge - introduced in response to the Scottish Tories' outrage at the 1985 rating revaluation - by the property-based council tax. It is also being asked by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to accept that the creation of a Scottish legislative assembly is a 'fantasy' to which few Scots attach much importance. Cannily the party managers have shoved most of the controversy into the first debate of this afternoon (many delegates do not usually arrive until Thursday), discussing an anodyne motion on the funding, functions and structure of local government. Of the 33 motions submitted on finance, nearly half supported the principle of the poll tax and none a property tax. Mr Lang gave every sign of fighting in cabinet to preserve the community charge in some form before accepting the council tax. His protestations that this interpretation of his role is, as he put it in an interview with the Financial Times 'a fantasy,' are politely disbelieved. 'The diehards are absolutely furious about the abandonment of the principle of the poll tax,' says a prospective Tory candidate, 'and in places there've been some resignations. But most see the greater cause (that of the party) as more important.' The idea of creating one tier of local government in Scotland instead of two is popular with most Tories, provided it can be done in a way that preserves existing pockets of Tory support. But the debate will allow an opportunity to raise the issue of creating a Scottish assembly, even if only to supervise those aspects of local government that could, under reform, revert to the Scottish Office. Mr Lang insists that local government and an assembly are unconnected, and asserts his strong opposition to an assembly, especially one with tax-raising powers. At the weekend, he dismissed opinion polls that showed 60 per cent of Tories and about 80 per cent of Scots favoured some kind of assembly. But in recent weeks there have been signs that the Conservative Party is thinking again about devolution. Mr Struan Stevenson, Tory candidate for Edinburgh South, argued for a strong assembly with power to levy all taxes paid in Scotland. Mr Lang said at the weekend Mr Stevenson's claim that demand for devolution was an immovable force was 'absolute nonsense.' Even if devolution is only raised in passing on the floor of the conference hall it will come up in fringe meetings, with the Scottish Young Conservatives strongly against and the Scottish Tory Reform Group gently in favour.</p>

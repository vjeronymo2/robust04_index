			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Board shake-up at Welsh agency THE Welsh Office has announced a shake-up on the board of the heavily criticised Welsh Development Agency. After the decision of Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman since 1988, to resign in the new year, Dr Roy Bichan, non-executive deputy chairman of Simon Robertson and a consultant to Simon Engineering, has been appointed deputy chairman. He replaces Sir Donald Walters, who will remain on the board. Dr Bichan, 50, is chairman of the Welsh Industrial Development Advisory Board and chairman of the north Wales branch of the CBI. He was chairman of the Llandudno-based Robertson Group until its takeover by Simon. The agency, founded in 1976, was severely criticised over financial procedures by the Commons public accounts committee on December 14. MPs queried redundancy payments to former employees, reimbursement of car and petrol expenses to directors, a grant paid to the chairman and a pensions payment. Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the committee, said there had been 'great laxity' in the agency's affairs. Three other members of the board whose contracts expire at the end of this year - Mr Colyn Gardner, former chairman of the DC Gardner group, Mr Tim Rees, a senior partner in Cardiff with accountants Coopers and Lybrand, and Mr David Roberts, former chairman of Pilkington Brothers' new business division - are not being reappointed. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said yesterday replacements would be made after the appointment of a new chairman. 'Once this has been decided I will wish to consult the chairman about two vacancies which remain." Mr Hunt is thought likely to look hard at the possibility of appointing a second woman to the board. Ms Pamela Kirby, managing director of Astra Pharmaceuticals, the British end of a Swedish producer of ethical drugs, was the first woman on the board when appointed in December 1991.</p>

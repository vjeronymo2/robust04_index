			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOOP PROPOSAL AIMS AT EASIER I-5-ARDATH ACCESS  </P> <P> Remember old "Wrong Way Roy Riegels," the football player who scooped up a  fumble in the 1929 Rose Bowl and rambled toward the wrong goal line? Well,  here's a highway overpass for him.  </P> <P> San Diego transportation officials are considering a proposal for a massive,  $12-million U-turn that would provide the long-awaited link for North County  commuters between Interstate 5 and the gateway to La Jolla: Ardath Road. There  is now no northbound entrance to the freeway or southbound exit onto Ardath.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Configuration Is Not for Dummies  </P> <P> This, however, is not a simple set of freeway ramps.  </P> <P> Under the plan, motorists heading out of La Jolla in search of northbound  Interstate 5 would first steer east on California 52. Half a mile down the  highway, they would veer onto a sprawling, horseshoe-shaped overpass that would  loop them back west. Heading the way they came, our intrepid drivers could then  catch another ramp leading to Interstate 5 north.  </P> <P> Similarly, drivers speeding south on Interstate 5 would rumble east on  California 52, hit the high-speed overpass and swing back west to pick up  Ardath Road and zip into La Jolla.  </P> <P> Riegels would be pleased.  </P> <P> But the plan, which is to be studied later this year by the state  Transportation Department, has yet to win many staunch boosters in La Jolla.  Moreover, officials with Caltrans grumble that the big loop seems, at first  blush, to be a bit wrong-headed.  </P> <P> "We tried to discourage the city from it, but they indicated they want us to go  forward with a study," said Kurth Barnes, a deputy district director for  Caltrans. "We just don't know how many people would really use it."  </P> <P> Barnes noted that motorists can now accomplish the same U-turn by heading a bit  farther east on California 52 and using the underpass at Regents Road. Others  sometimes simply take 52 all the way east to Interstate 805, which joins  Interstate 5 just a few miles to the north.  </P> <P> "This overpass would save maybe 1,300 feet of travel and maybe a couple of  minutes over turning off at Regents Road," Barnes noted. "We'll have to weigh  the costs against that sort of benefit. . . . But just studying it doesn't  commit us to it. The final conclusion may be that it shouldn't be built."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Answer Is Sought  </P> <P> Though well aware of the plan's shortcomings, San Diego traffic officials are  eager to see some sort of solution to provide the missing link between  Interstate 5 and Ardath Road.  </P> <P> The lack of ramps has prompted motorists to flood a trio of streets leading out  of La Jolla -- Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla Shores Drive and North La Jolla  Scenic Drive -- in an effort to reach Interstate 5 via La Jolla Village Drive.  </P> <P> About 55,000 vehicles a day are expected to use La Jolla Village Drive as  nearby UC San Diego expands during the next decade. By providing a link between  Ardath and the freeway, traffic on La Jolla Village Drive could be reduced by  up to 20%, traffic planners predict.  </P> <P> "I can see the advantages and the disadvantages of the U-turn," said Allen  Holden Jr., deputy director of the city's transportation planning division.  "It's not a simple one. I can see the benefit in providing those missing moves.  But I can also see that this is a fairly expensive project and the U-turn is  obviously not the same as providing the moves right there at the interchange."  </P> <P> Given their druthers, most officials would much prefer a simple, direct link  between Interstate 5 and Ardath Road, an idea that's been debated for more than  a decade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On a Steep Grade  </P> <P> But such a project is not so simple. Ardath Road sits well up a steep hillside  from the freeway, and an entrance and exit would require gargantuan bridges  that would cost more than $50 million.  </P> <P> Even then, the bridge project might gobble up so much room to the north that it  would interfere with traffic using the freeway's intersection ramps at Gilman  Drive, said Caltrans' Barnes.  </P> <P> A few years ago, planners turned to the idea of the big loop off California 52.  It is now one of more than 80 proposals on a list of road projects in the city  to be addressed by council members Feb. 13.  </P> <P> Funding, meanwhile, could prove a less testy problem than winning backing for  the big loop. The city already has begun setting aside $12 million for the  project from money collected under Proposition A, the 1988 half-cent sales-tax  measure designed to improve the county's transportation network.  </P> <P> If the overpass proves infeasible, another solution might be construction of a  "Texas U-turn" off California 52 at Regents Road, Holden said. That proposal,  which could be completed at much less cost, would loop an extra lane through  the underpass at Regents, allowing motorists to avoid a pair of existing  left-turn signals while making a U-turn to head back west.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big Loop Is Main Focus  </P> <P> For now, however, planners are focusing on the big loop, but La Jolla residents  have given the proposal a lukewarm reception.  </P> <P> Rob Whittemore, La Jolla Town Council president, said the cost of the overpass  would be less expensive than a direct link, but he is concerned that it might  create a magnet for traffic from Pacific Beach. Before the big loop is built,  he said, traffic planners should look toward improving the freeway entrances  and exits in Pacific Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Want Extra Traffic  </P> <P> "Pacific Beach doesn't like it when La Jollans drive through their town, and we  don't want Pacific Beach residents coming through La Jolla to head north on the  freeway," Whittemore said.  </P> <P> Virginia Grizzle, a longtime La Jollan and a traffic engineering aficionado, is  dead set against the loop. As she sees it, the overpass is "a Band-Aid  approach" that will only send more cars reeling toward the notorious Ardath  Triangle, the traffic-choked intersection between Ardath and Torrey Pines  roads.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of people in La Jolla think the idea is pretty silly, which is  what I think," Grizzle said. "This overpass is not really going to help things.  I just don't think it makes good sense, particularly when you're talking about  spending that much money."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The problem: There's no exit from southbound Interstate 5 onto Ardath Road, the  main route leaving downtown La Jolla. And there's no entrance to northbound 5  from Ardath. The loop might simplify life for people trying to get into and out  of La Jolla.  </P></p>

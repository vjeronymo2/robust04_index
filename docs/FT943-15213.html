			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Strategy - Buzzwords To succeed these days in any field from business and politics to sport and religion you need a strategy. In the past week alone Wall Street analysts have questioned whether there is a strategy behind the proposed merger between CBS, the broadcaster, and QVC, the home shopping channel, and the British trade unions have called upon the government to deliver a strategy to create jobs. The word derives from the Greek strategia (generalship) and entered English as strategie in 1688. It differs from tactics, which are immediate measures in face of an enemy, according to James' 1810 Military Dictionary. Strategy concerns something 'done out of the sight of an enemy'. The military origins translate into a language of sport or commerce through the shared concept of competition. Its derivatives, strategic, strategist and stratagem arrived in 1825 and 1838 respectively. The word relates to the medieval stratagem (an artifice or trick) conjured up again in Shakespeare's most warlike play, Titus Andronicus. Since strategy is familiar in management, investment and politics, the standard business lingo, it was to be expected that one sample Financial Times last week had defensive strategy (politics), strategy for reduced borrowings (Elf), investment strategy and long-term strategy (Schroders) and also strategy and technique (World Cup). The force driving technical uses of strategy is Game Theory, the mathematical analysis of conflict, usually in war or economics. Websters defines a game, the abstract set of rules players agree to or are forced to follow, as: 'a procedure or strategy for gaining an end', and the OED as 'a simulation of a contest. . . to test a strategy.' The idea of strategy dates from the original business-school handbook, Sun Tzu's 500BC 'The Art of War'.</p>

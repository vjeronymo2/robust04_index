			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sandra Sato] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazzelli  announced yesterday that Brazil will have a record grain harvest  of 73.6 million tonnes in 1994. The estimated production was  calculated by the National Supply Company (Conab). The minister  said the record harvest will provoke a drop in grains prices,  particularly beans, in the next 45 days. Beans were marked as  the villain in the FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso 2] Plan  because prices tripled following the creation of the Real Value  Unit (URV). Bean prices will "probably drop" again, the minister  said.    Guazzelli said the high price of beans followed a lack of  rain in bean-producing regions like Irece, Bahia. It is now  raining in the northeast and the Ministry of Agriculture is  anticipating that farmers will harvest 1.3 million tonnes during  this period of "partial harvest." This represents a 66-percent  increase compared to the same period in 1993.    Corn and soybean will help to make the 1993/1994 harvest the  best in Brazilian history. The minister said corn production is  up by 2.5 million tonnes and soybean by 1.5 million tonnes.  Conab figures show rice production is also up by 7.7 percent  compared with last year, to 10.6 million tonnes.    The current record was set in 1990 when total grains  production reached 71.5 million tonnes. The following two  harvests fell below 60 million tonnes. Last year production  reached 68 million tonnes. The numbers announced yesterday are  only estimates, but the minister trusts the figures. "The  harvest could even be larger because Conab calculations are very  conservative," the minister quipped. He added that the country  has the potential for even larger harvests.    While farmers produce their rice, beans, corn, and soybean,  the government is responsible for ensuring proper storage  conditions. Last year Conab withdrew the authorization of  several grain stores due to administration irregularities and  technical problems.    The minister said he does not anticipate any problems  because  some grain stores that lost their credentials have corrected the  problems and again offer their services to Conab. Guazzelli  figures he will need $2 billion to guarantee the  commercialization of the record harvest.</p>

Since the, Congress has enacted a number of statutes establishing research grant programs similar to those listed in &sect;52.1 of the regulation. In the past, new statutory authority would have been implemented by adding the new programs to the list of programs in &sect;52.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, after considering the long list of programs to be added and the very limited number of substantive changes necessitated by the new statues, we have decided to propose deletion of the listing of research project grant programs in &sect;52.1, and references to that listing in other sections. The regulations would be amended to apply to all research project grant programs administered by the PHS. Thus, it will not be necessary to include a long list of programs in the regulations or to go through the lengthy process of amending the regulations in order for them to apply to a newly established program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHS and/or its components that award research project grants will, as stated in proposed &sect;52.1, periodically publish a list of all the research project grant programs to which the regulations apply and the applicability of the regulations to new programs will be announced as PHS components initiate those programs. Under &sect;52.1, the regulations clearly apply to all research project grants administered by the PHS; thus, the lists described above are provided for the convenience of interested members of the public, rather than serving as a substantive notice of the applicability of the regulations. A list of the current research project grant authorities implemented by the regulations follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Research into the cause, diagnosis, treatment, control, or prevention of the physical or mental diseases, injuries, or impairments to human life, as authorized by sections 301 and 303 related provisions of the Public Health Service Act (Act) (42 U.S.C. 241, 242a); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Electronic product radiation control research programs designed to protect the public health and safety from electronic product radiation, as authorized by section 532 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360ii); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Research on health related educational technologies, medical library science and related activities, and for the development or dissemination of new knowledge, techniques, systems, and equipment for processing, storing, retrieving, and distributing information pertaining to health sciences, as authorized by section 473 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 286b&hyph;4); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Research on the social, behavioral, and biomedical etiology, mental and physical health consequences, and social and economic consequences of alcohol abuse and alcoholism, as authorized by section 464H of the Act (42 U.S.C. 285n); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Research on the causes, consequences and approaches of coping with adolescent sexual relations, contraceptive use, pregnancy, and parenthood, as authorized by section 2008 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 300z&hyph;7); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Health services research activities, as authorized by section 301 and 464H of the Act (42 U.S.C. 241 and 285n) and defined in section 409 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 284d); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Biomedical research in areas relating to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, as authorized by section 445B of the Act (42 U.S.C. 285e&hyph;4); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Research relating to medical rehabilitation, as authorized by section 452 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 285g&hyph;4); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Basic research to identify, characterize, and quantify risks to human health from air pollutants, as authorized by section 103 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7403); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Research relating to the evaluation of drug treatments for AIDS not approved by the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, as authorized by section 2314 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 300cc&hyph;14); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Research under the Medication Development Program to encourage and promote the development and use of medications to treat drug addiction; and collect, analyze, and disseminate data, as authorized by section 464P of the Act (42 U.S.C. 285o&hyph;4); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) International research relating to the development and evaluation of vaccines and treatments for AIDS, as authorized by section 2315 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 300cc&hyph;15); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

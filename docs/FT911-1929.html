			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / US denies Nato slowing EC progress on security SLOW progress in the European Community's negotiations on common security is not the fault of Nato, Mr William Taft, the US envoy to Nato, said yesterday. He rejected a complaint by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, that EC security discussions were being held up by the slower pace of parallel work in Nato. In an interview, the US ambassador said Nato had in fact delayed its alliance summit from July to the autumn 'because this would co-ordinate better with the work of the inter-governmental conferences' on a common EC security stance and other issues. 'This (delay) was a consistent desire by the EC countries' that belong to Nato, Mr Taft said, adding that 'perhaps Mr Delors was not aware of this'. However, at last weekend's meeting of EC foreign ministers, Mr Delors' call for Nato to speed up its talks was echoed by Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's foreign minister. The real debate over European security now seems to be shifting from the EC to Nato, to confront the arguments which are being put with increasing force by the US and which are strongly supported by Community states like Britain and the Netherlands. 'We have told the Europeans that in our view the development of a European security identity ought to strengthen the alliance, not compete with it, nor duplicate it,' said Mr Taft. He said Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, stressed to EC foreign ministers two weeks ago 'the essential character of Nato's integrated military structure, the need to avoid marginalisation of any of the allies (European countries outside the EC) and the desirability of the European political union developing a capacity to engage beyond Europe's borders'. Nato has agreed to boost its own rapid reaction force, but only for use within alliance territory. The US, along with Britain and the Netherlands, now sees a European rapid deployment force, acting probably under Western European Union (WEU) auspices, as filling the 'out of area' role that Nato cannot agree on for itself. Last weekend, Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, was urging his EC colleagues to think of setting up a permanent planning cell in the WEU, even in peacetime. However, Mr Roland Dumas, his French counterpart, dismissed all talk of such mechanisms in the WEU as secondary to the great question of principle: whether Europe had the political will for common defence. France, in fact, has gone very silent on the WEU over which it currently presides. It used its six-month presidency to convene a special 15-minute meeting of the organisation in the margins of the EC summit on April 8, ostensibly to give the WEU the task of co-ordinating aid to the Kurds but mainly to show how it could have life inside the EC womb. In fact, the WEU role in aid co-ordination has been virtually nil. By contrast, France has, albeit belatedly, joined in the strategic review in Nato.</p>

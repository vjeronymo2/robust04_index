In exchange for ephemeral international aid, Ukraine will  recklessly dispose of its nuclear weapons. Stetskiv spoke in  favor of simultaneous disarmament of all nuclear states. The  only promising news is that the agreement must be ratified by  the Supreme Council, he added, and this is very unlikely to  occur.    Stetskiv believes that the negative aspect of the  Partnership  for Peace initiative is that it contradicts the idea of the  Baltic-Black Sea Commonwealth; one positive aspect is that it  has been offered to Ukraine along with other Central Europe  countries, but not Russia. This, in his opinion, gives a chance  for Ukraine's integration with Europe without Russia. We should  knock more decisively on Europe's door, concluded Stetskiv.</p>

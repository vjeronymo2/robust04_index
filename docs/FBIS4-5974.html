			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, April 15 KYODO -- Thai Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai has called off a visit to Japan because of its  political uncertainty following Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's resignation announcement, Thai Foreign Minister  Prasong Sunsiri said Friday [15 April].    Chuan was scheduled to pay a six-day official visit to Japan  from April 22 to discuss emergency rice imports and bilateral  economic cooperation.    Following Hosokawa's surprise announcement on April 8 that  he  will resign, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak postponed a trip  to Japan slated for April 18 to 21 apparently because of the  anticipated government change.</p>

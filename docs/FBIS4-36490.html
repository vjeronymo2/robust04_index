			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Isam Qadamani] </F>   [Text] Minister of Communications Dr. Tariq al-Suhaymat  has reiterated Jordan's willingness to fully cooperate and  coordinate with the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] in the  areas of post and communications.    In statements to AL-RA'Y, the minister added that Jordan's  Ministry of Communications has supplied the PNA with a copy of  the Ministry's structural organization, as well as job  descriptions of the Ministry's components, sections, and  institutions at the request of PNA Minister of Post and  Communications 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, who held talks with  several Ministry officials in this regard. Al-Ashhab also  obtained details about the Jordanian telephone system.    Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian side requested to  benefit from the Jordanian expertise so that Palestinian cadres  may learn from them. He noted that Jordan will provide the  Palestinian self-rule authority with experts, technicians, and  engineers in the field of postal services and communications.  Additionally, Jordan will provide training to several PNA  employees working in this field at Jordanian institutions.    Al-Suhaymat indicated that the talks with al-Ashhab also  touched on effecting a direct telephonic linkage between the  Jordanian telephone network and the network expected to be  established in Gaza and Jericho. He asserted Jordan's readiness  to implement this linkage once the PNA requests this.    When queried further on the issue, Dr. al-Suhaymat said that  Jordan will effect a direct telephonic linkage with the  Palestinian side only in Gaza and Jericho at present, and in the  West Bank later. He noted that there will not be any kind of  telephonic linkages with or through Israel pending the outcome  of the peace talks. He added: "It is premature to speak of a  linkage with Israel at present."    Dr. al-Suhaymat indicated that Jordan has officially and  repeatedly urged the world states not to relay telephone calls  from Israel to Jordan.    With respect to cooperation in the field of postal services,  the minister of communications said that Jordan, in talks with  the Palestinians, has expressed its full readiness to transport  the mail coming from various parts of the world to the  autonomous areas via the King Husayn Bridge and vice versa in  accordance with the norms and methods currently in force.    Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian self-rule  authority must obtain an international telephonic code for its  communications so that it may gain complete independence from  Israel in this regard. He went on to say that this would be  less costly than using the Israeli network.    The minister indicated that Jordan will witness great  developments in the field of communications once peace is  achieved. He added that the Communications Corporation is making  enormous efforts to implement its projects over the next few  months to prepare for the start of the 21st century.</p>

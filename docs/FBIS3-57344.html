After an attempt to regain power which soon proved  abortive, Mutalibov left the republic on board a military  aircraft and has not gone back to this day.    On 17 June 1993, as a result of an armed rebellion raised in  Ganja by Colonel Suret Guseynov, the newly elected Azerbaijani  President Abulfaz Elchibey was forced to leave Baku secretly and  return to his home village of Keleki in the Nakhichevan  Autonomous Republic, where he still is.    On 3 October 1993, by a nationwide vote, Geydar Aliyev came  to power in Azerbaijan, and he is presently exercising the  powers of head of state.    All three consider themselves the legitimate president. All  three lay claim to the role of father of the nation. Each of  the three has his own view of the situation in the republic and  his own action program.    I recently met with all three.  <H5>  Audiences </H5>   In Moscow: I was helped to find Ayaz Mutalibov, who lives  "somewhere near Moscow," by better informed colleagues. Secret  contacts came into play, invisible threads were pulled, and  soon, on the strength of a pledge to report the planned  interview without bias, I was instructed to stay by the  telephone for the next 15 minutes.    Mutalibov himself called. He said he was willing to meet,  and dictated the address, on the condition that it was not to be  handed over to anyone else. Half an hour later I found myself  in a spacious, well-appointed, pleasantly furnished apartment  almost in the center of Moscow, where, according to Mutalibov,  relatives of his live and where he periodically meets with  people he wants to see. So I too was unable to visit the dacha  near Moscow which a businessman friend has rented for Mutalibov.  The ex-president, his wife, and their son and his family have  found shelter at that dacha for nearly two years now. The  out-of-town house, whose whereabouts are known only to a very  narrow circle, can probably be regarded as a place of political  asylum too, since a criminal charge still stands against  Mutalibov for failing, as president, to prevent the seizure and  destruction by Armenian gunmen of the Azerbaijani city of  Khodzhaly. "Aliyev says I could go back to the republic as an  ordinary citizen and live there freely, unoppressed. That is  not true. As soon as I turn up in Baku they will promptly  arrest me."    We each drank a glass of Azerbaijani "Goy Gel" cognac and  ate  a slice of bread with black caviar, ignoring for the time being  the expensive candies, nuts, and fruit. Then I gestured  interrogatively toward the dictaphone, and my host nodded:  "Switch it on."    In Keleki: Barely had the plane from Baku, arriving in  Nakhichevan eight hours late, come to a halt on the tarmac, when  I was intercepted at a passport check right there on the ramp.  Having been escorted to the chief of the commandant's office, I  was immediately subjected to questioning: Why had I come? To  see whom? My newspaper accreditation only heightened this  vigilant interest, as the Baku organizers of my meeting with  Elchibey had warned me beforehand: Press attention toward the  disgraced ex-president is not encouraged by the authorities;  better keep quiet about who it is you have come to see, or else  they will send you straight back on the same flight.    Having taken these instructions on board, I spoke very  vaguely about the purpose of my visit, and as soon as they let  me go, I made my way to the People's Front headquarters within  20 minutes; from there Elchibey's comrades delivered me to the  rayon center of Ordubad.    There in Ordubad, in the building of the former KGB rayon  directorate, is the stronghold of the ex-president's bodyguard,  with two armored carriers in the yard and, on duty around the  clock, unshaven men in camouflage uniform carrying automatic  weapons. In the guardroom, no bigger than a lobby, I counted  eight portraits of Elchibey, next to an "iconostasis" lovingly  arranged on a wall made of empty cigarette cartons.    As night approached, in pitch darkness, we left for Keleki.  Five people were crammed into a fully equipped UAZ jeep,  including a man with an automatic weapon who hid under a  tarpaulin. Three times there suddenly emerged from the gloom  along the way a trailer perched on the roadside or some other  kind of checkpoint, from which armed men sprang out, barring our  vehicle's path. They demanded the password, asked who was being  transported and what for, and, satisfied with a brief report,  withdrew into the darkness.    The residence of Mr. President (I was instructed to address  my lofty interviewee as that, and nothing else) turned out to be  a village building apparently intended for public use, some kind  of club or office -- frankly I could not make it out properly,  because there was not a glimmer of light around it; the  blockade.... Here, I was told, the president works from very  early morning until late at night (by the light produced by a  small generator, or a kerosene lamp), receiving the information  he needs by telephone, and also "from other sources." Nobody  specified exactly what sources, but it was said that regular  visits are made to Keleki by a few former staffers of the  presidential apparatus who have remained loyal to Elchibey,  retired ministers, and certain members of the Azerbaijani  parliament. Moreover it was stressed particularly that the  "legitimate president of Azerbaijan in exile" maintains contact,  as is proper, with foreign diplomats and statesmen.    Apart from numerous relatives, Elchibey has with him in  Keleki his wife and two school-age children.    I was instructed to present for inspection the bag holding  my  journalist's equipment. Then the chief bodyguard searched my  pockets and the folds of my clothing with his own hands.    Finally the audience took place. Abulfaz Elchibey sat at a  desk on whose smooth surface not a single object was to be seen  except for the telephone and an ashtray. The entire expanse of  wall behind my host's back was occupied by a map of Azerbaijan,  and next to it the state flag of the republic was hoisted.    "I am pursuing a course of resisting the rebel power,"  Elchibey said, in his native language, from which he never once  departed in a 90-minute talk simultaneously interpreted by an  aide.    In Baku: At about two o'clock in the morning, the head of  the press service cut short my wait: "The president will be  working for another hour or hour-and-a-half, he sends his  apologies." This could also be taken to mean that, at least  until the time indicated, the state secretary, prime minister,  head of parliament, ministers, and leaders of all the services  of the president's apparatus also would not leave their offices.  This work schedule was usual for Aliyev while he was, for 14  years, at the head of the republic, and it resumed when he  returned to power.    Be that as it may, at the second attempt I was admitted to  the official presidential apartments, which -- unlike  Mutalibov's and Elchibey's surroundings -- I consider it  superfluous to describe.    "I don't give interviews," Aliyev said, after a firm  handshake, "I don't have the time."    That was how our two-hour talk began....    Now, having, by means of a newspaper device, placed the  holder of real power on the same footing as two political  recluses who have lost that power at the whim of dramatic  circumstances, I am clearly not safe from objections on the part  of Geydar Aliyev, whose status is undeniably not to be compared  with the status of Ayaz Mutalibov or Abulfaz Elchibey, who,  although they consider themselves presidents, are free of the  burden of state decisions and the responsibility for them. This  difference in the positions of three well-known Azerbaijani  politicians, whose judgments and opinions, by creating a  stereoscopic effect, help us to approach a calm, unbiased  understanding of what is happening in the republic -- this  crucial difference should, I urge you, be kept in mind hereafter.  <H5>  By Wartime Laws </H5>   On 2 November Geydar Aliyev addressed the people, presenting  a detailed explanation of the reasons for the heavy defeats in  the war, and called on citizens "to defend Azerbaijan from  aggression by Armenian armed forces." Three and a half weeks  later the republic National Assembly tightened up -- with the  stipulation "for the duration of the war" -- the operation of a  number of articles of the Criminal Code. Henceforth, evasion of  the military draft carries the threat of five to eight years'  imprisonment. For evasion of mobilization, a prison term of  seven to 10 years is stipulated, or 10-15 years where there are  aggravating circumstances. For absence without leave from a  military unit at the front, there is 10-15 years' imprisonment,  or even the death penalty.    Those are the wartime laws adopted by the Azerbaijani  parliament and approved, according to December's figures, by one  out of every two people polled by the sociological group of the  republic State Committee for Statistics. The warring  Azerbaijani clans and groupings build their relations by these  same laws, having thoroughly grasped, for instance, this law:  that a defeat in war is a defeat in politics.    So does that mean that losses and casualties at the front  would suit some people in the republic?    A. Mutalibov: "I would give a straight answer if I had the  facts available, but in any event nobody in Azerbaijan will be  surprised by this question. A power struggle is going on. And  some people will stop at nothing in this struggle."    G. Aliyev: "We are constantly observing a desire on the part  of some political forces to reap benefits for themselves from  our military defeats. These forces -- first and foremost  People's Front forces -- are engaged in carrying out  provocations in the Army, going out to rayons close to the front  line and intimidating the population.... These forces have  especially tried to create the conditions for the seizure of  Azerbaijani rayons by the aggressors. We have information that  these forces, as the main culprits to blame for the situation in  which Azerbaijan now finds itself, wish to regain lost positions  and wreak revenge...."    A. Elchibey: "I categorically reject such accusations  against the People's Front. Geydar Aliyev is distorting the  truth, to put it mildly. He must know that it was when we were  in power that international efforts to settle the conflict  became more active and the UN Security Council resolution  providing for, in particular, the withdrawal of Armenian troops  from Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, was adopted. Incidentally, this was  the only rayon captured during my leadership of the republic.  Whereas under Aliyev six rayons have already been occupied, and  it is clear to everybody that the new authorities are unable to  ensure the country's defense and incapable of crating a strong,  professional army."    As of today 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory is under  occupation. The country has 1.2 million refugees, providing for  whom has already cost the republic budget 5 billion rubles,  whereas several times this amount is required. Refugees are not  given jobs. They are not paid benefits and pensions on time.  Concentrations of refugees have unprecedented disease and death  rates. As yet the new authorities have come up with very few  successful ways to ease the fate of these unfortunates, unless  you count the option suggested by the newspaper AZERBAIJAN,  which is more than respectful to the president: "Guest houses,  schools, and hostels do not need to be emptied to house  refugees. The coziest refuge for a million refugees is Geydar  Aliyev's heart."    G. Aliyev: "I consider that every family in Baku and other  cities and rayons could take a refugee family. This would be  very charitable. Some people have enormous houses and big  apartments. Let each one of them house a refugee family. For my  part, I recently instructed the Cabinet to take additional  measures."    A. Mutalibov: "No measures will be of any help so long as  the Karabakh map is a bargaining chip in the political game  being played by the Azerbaijani clans, groupings, and  individuals waging a bitter power struggle."  <H5>  Reforms by Installments </H5>   A Baku black marketeer, who responded with alacrity to my  request to be driven to Government House, explained to me his  interpretation of the difference between the previous and the  present authorities: "A year ago a traffic cop would sting you  for 50 manats, whereas now the going rate is at least a  thousand."    This has nothing to do with the change of authorities, of  course. The scale of graft is also about the same as it was.  It's just that the scale of prices is now different:  inflation.... It has reached a rate of 40 percent a month.    At the end of November bread and gasoline prices were raised  750 percent by presidential edict. In response to a question  from sociologists "how do you react to this," 29.2 percent of  those polled answered: "Negatively -- the edict will have no  effect in terms of stabilizing the economy."    G. Aliyev: "Prices for the most important products should  have been regulated at the right time, considerably earlier than  a year ago. Rather than people engaging in populism.  Azerbaijan has close economic and simply human links with  neighboring states. The difference in prices between here and  there had a painful impact on our already crisis-ridden economy,  which, furthermore, is largely geared to defense. Measures had  to be taken."    Only after bread in Azerbaijan started costing 22 manats  (220  rubles) did the waiting lines for it diminish appreciably, but  they have not yet disappeared. There are no waiting lines for  meat, but it is rationed in the state trading network. As are  sugar and butter. Admittedly "August" butter was only  distributed in December, and there has been no meat since July.  The consumer shopping basket costs 6,000 manats as against an  average wage of 2,500.    A. Elchibey: "The whole point is that following the  insurrection and my removal from power the National Assembly did  not adopt a single law opening the way to market reforms. My  edicts on privatization and the development of enterprise went  unfulfilled; they were removed from circulation, as it were. At  the same time uncontrolled privatization is steaming ahead.  Mafia clans originating, as a rule, in the former party  nomenklatura are getting their hands on plants and factories in  exchange for big bribes.... Corruption has assumed a  catastrophic scale."    A. Mutalibov: "Elchibey hoped that, severing ties with  Russia and other neighbors, Azerbaijan would resolve its  economic tasks by means of radical reforms. But this is  impossible. Market reforms must be implemented simultaneously  in all the countries of the former Union; it impossible to  destroy what are virtually centuries-old economic links and  break everything up at a stroke. I am a supporter of gradual and  cautious entry into the market. Although I believe that the  state hat which the republic's enterprises are currently forced  to wear is preventing them from developing freely. This is the  other, equally destructive extreme."    G. Aliyev: "Who is preventing, and whom? I even banned MVD  and Prosecutor's Office organs from checking the financial and  economic activity of state and commercial enterprises.  Henceforth such checks will be carried out only by the tax  inspectorate. I repeat: Our point of reference is a market  economy, a combination and interaction of various forms of  ownership. In the very near future parliament will again  examine the question of privatization...."    According to data from a poll conducted by the "Mirror"  ["Zerkalo"] republic newspaper, 70 percent of Azerbaijan's  highest-profile entrepreneurs regard present conditions here as  unconducive to private business. And to the question "How do  you assess the prospects" 62 percent answered: "They will  develop, but slowly." Here 48 out of the 50 people polled said  that the decisive condition for the development or, conversely,  the diminution of enterprise is the government's attitude to it.  And they were practically all agreed that one of the main  obstacles to the free and civilized development of private  business is the corruption among state officials, who are  continuing to struggle for power and spheres of influence. The  nature of this struggle is evidenced, in part, by the fact that  two-thirds of the entrepreneurs only agreed to participate in  the study after being firmly assured that the poll would be  anonymous.  <H5>  In the Open and Behind the Scenes </H5>   Political skirmishes in Azerbaijan continue to take place in  the open and behind the scenes. But now there is less shooting.    The opposition, whose ranks contain several parties of  varying degrees of radicalism, is not reticent. The  front-runners here are the People's Front, whose chairman is  still Abdulfaz Elchibey, and the "Musavat" party, headed by  former parliament speaker Isa Kambarov. Both organizations  regard Elchibey as the lawful president and Geydar Aliyev as an  inveterate political intriguer who seized power through an  insurgence.    In Isa Kambarov's view, Aliyev "is trying to govern an  independent state using the same methods he used to govern a  former Soviet republic." The "Musavat" party chairman also  believes that, by refusing cooperation with any influential  political force and relying solely on the apparatus, Aliyev is  narrowing his social base and risks losing power within a few  months if the round of military defeats continues.    G. Aliyev: "I am open to cooperation with all political  forces. But you see what happens.... I offered National  Independence Party Chairman Etibar Mamedov a choice of four  state posts, particularly the post of foreign minister. He  refused. Meanwhile there are representatives of various parties  working successfully in the government, including people with a  People's Front background.... Recently I held a meeting with  party and movement leaders. Everybody came except  representatives of the National Front, while the 'Musavat' party  sent an observer as if we were having a meeting of some kind of  official international body. This is all a joke...."    A. Elchibey: "How can you talk about any kind of cooperation  with these authorities when human rights are being trampled  underfoot. First a citizen is handcuffed right in the  parliament chamber, then a few days later the question of  stripping him of his deputy's immunity is raised. That was how  National Assembly Chairman Isa Kambarov was arrested; that was  how former republic General Prosecutor Ikhtiyar Shirinov was  taken into custody.... Former Defense Minister Ragim Kaziyev was  arrested and accused of corruption; former First Deputy Minister  of National Security Sulkhetdin Akperov is behind bars....  There are currently around 40 political detainees in  Azerbaijan."    G. Aliyev: "I don't know how many. This is criminal  activity, not politics."    This -- if not more so -- is the pitch at which the  confrontation at the top in Azerbaijan goes on, out of sight of  the public at large. By carrying out a ruthless purge of the  government and the presidential apparatus Geydar Aliyev  strengthened his power by precisely the same extent as he  undermined it by squeezing out his rancorous opponents in the  shape of the vice premiers, power ministers, and other state  officials put into retirement or into the dock, each of whom is  backed by influential clans and groupings.    But the main source of discomfort for Aliyev, of course, is  Suret Guseynov, the rebel colonel who successfully swapped his  combat enthusiasm for the premiership in June. The new cabinet  head's incompetence seems to be obvious to everyone in the  republic, from State Secretary Lala Gadzhiyeva, who asked me not  to ask her questions about Guseynov, to a semi-literate peasant  tea-picker.    G. Aliyev: "He was appointed following a proposal from me  and is working."    This was the briefest presidential answer during our  interview.    A. Elchibey: "Aliyev cannot remove Guseynov yet. That would  mean admitting that what happened in Ganja was nothing but an  insurrection -- that is, Aliyev obtained power from a rebel and  them formalized it via a nationwide vote. Guseynov, on the  other hand, is a puppet figure. He contents himself with his  lofty title without having real influence. The ministers of  defense, national security, and internal affairs are subordinate  to the Defense Council, which is headed by Aliyev. He controls  all the key posts in the government. Aliyev and his people will  never concede anything to us. They will fight to the last drop  of power."  <H5>  "Who Else?" </H5>   This is the general feeling. No matter who I spoke with  anywhere in Azerbaijan (state officials and politicians aside),  they almost all said the same thing: If not Geydar, who else  will help us?    They trust him. Or rather, they trust in him. This  desperate, maybe last-chance faith in a political messiah, a  politician who will bring them salvation from the universal  trials and tribulations, is already close to religious in some  respects. To the question "who do you trust in the current  crisis situation?" 77.8 percent of participants in a December  poll answered: "Azerbaijan President G. Aliyev." He has to his  credit: entry into the CIS, the restoration and strengthening  of relations with Russia, the initiation of contacts with Iran  and France, first successes in building a national army, the  stopping of the separatist movement in the south of the  republic, and the relative stabilization of the sociopolitical  situation. On the debit side there are the six occupied rayons.  Nobody here would be forgiven that number of defeats. For the  time being Aliyev is being forgiven.    A. Mutalibov: "He is undoubtedly a highly experienced  politician capable of skillfully controlling people and  therefore the country. So when I became leader of the country I  did not obstruct his return from Moscow and reacted calmly to  his decision to return to politics. Unfortunately, counter to  expectations, our relationship did not develop, in my view  because of some of his past opponents, who managed to come  between us...."    The people's trust in whoever is national leader is not  boundless, however. At the presidential elections Abulfaz  Elchibey obtained 59 percent of the vote, but last fall 98  percent of those who participated in the referendum gave him a  vote of no confidence. Barely a year had passed!    Disillusionment with democracy? A reversion to type, to the  old pattern of life? Neither. In Aliyev Azerbaijan sees not a  former member of Brezhnev's Politburo but first and foremost a  highly experienced politician, a ruthless pragmatist, and a  competent administrator.    In Azerbaijan, Russia, and other republics which survived  the  disintegration of the USSR people today are less and less  interested in ideological labels. They are less and less  interested in the color of the flag and more and more interested  in bread prices, the size of wages or pensions, and guarantees  of peace and tranquility.    And there is increasing revulsion everywhere to a power  struggle for its own sake, irrespective of who is involved or  under what slogans. The experience of our troubled times brooks  no delusion about the speed with which the last drop of power  becomes far from the first drop of blood.</p>

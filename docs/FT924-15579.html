			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Private View: Philosopher at the farm gate - Wendell Berry is suspicious of modern environmentalists who oversimplify, sloganise and are ready to compromise HOW GRATIFYING to meet a man who looks so much the part. Lean and leathery, over 6ft tall, with close-set eyes, a slow manner and an authentic drawl, Wendell Berry is every inch the city bumpkin's idea of a Kentucky farmer. Berry could have stepped from a Norman Rockwell painting. But his homespun exterior belies a vigorous mind: he is a lecturer, poet and polemicist who inveighs against the rape of Nature by Man in prose that thumps as remorselessly as a die-stamping machine. I asked him if he was a hillbilly. Berry bristled, then decided not to take offence. 'Well, some people would call me a hillbilly. It's a term like 'nigger', not famous yet as an insult but it's a term of denigration. It's used to denigrate country people and people who do fundamental work.' He was reared on a farm in Henry County, a tobacco-growing area of Kentucky, but Berry is less a farmer who writes than a writer who farms. Are you a gentleman farmer? 'No. Because I don't hire my work. I do it myself - and my wife. Or we swap work with neighbours.' For years more quoted than read in his own country, and little known outside it, Wendell Berry has been described as the best nature writer since Henry David Thoreau. His message, delivered with Old Testament certitude, is that man must learn to live according to nature's rules or destroy himself. He lives as much as he can without energy-consuming gadgets. I referred to his latest essays and said: You're pretty tough on the rest of us. 'No, I'm tough on myself. There is no self-righteousness in that book. The issue is how to think about a national way of life that is wasteful  - one I participate in just as avowedly in some respects as anyone else. I fly on airplanes. I drive an automobile. I'm hooked up to the utilities. I'm far from exempt from the evils I am talking about.' For fuel he burns wood from his 125-acre farm at Port Royal (pop. 130) on the Kentucky River, but uses a chainsaw to cut it. He has 15 acres of arable, grows vegetables, keeps a few cows and ewes and sells lambs in spring. He has no television. He works with horses and writes with a pencil. 'It's not that I'd rule out any particular piece of equipment,' he explained. 'It is that I would change the kind of consciousness that uses the equipment and the standards by which it is used.' Are you a Luddite? 'I wouldn't give priority to technical advance any more than I would to someone's profit or to the raw ambition of productivity. I understand why the original Luddites destroyed the weaving frame: they did it to defend their communities, and I would do the same, unhesitatingly . . . especially if I could get away with it.' He laughed. Wouldn't people go bankrupt if they followed your principles? 'No, that isn't true. My farm is not exemplary. There are many Amish farms of 80 to 125 acres on which a decent living is made.' You're not suggesting everyone should live like the Amish. 'No, I'm not suggesting anyone live any particular way. I'm suggesting that people have a responsibility to take care of the things they use, either directly or by proxy.' Berry talks calmly but writes savagely - about corporate underlings, the medical industry, 'industrial eating', (whose logical fulfilment would be a tube connecting our stomachs to the factory) and 'industrial sex' (a crude tally of couplings and orgasms). He grew up a Baptist and hereditary Democrat, cutting his dialectical teeth in arguments with his father, a lawyer-farmer. He goes to church but is a heterodox Christian. He cannot wait to vote against George Bush in next month's presidential election. Why? 'Because he's given the country away.' The drawling voice rose angrily. 'He and Ronald Reagan have collaborated to give the country away to the rich.' I tried hanging some labels on him. Aren't you simply nostalgic? 'I'm always accused of turning back the clock. You wouldn't tell an addict that he couldn't turn back the clock because health is somewhere behind him. What I'm talking about is the possible correction of potentially disastrous processes.' Aren't you out of date? Everyone's going green. 'That is not true. The industrialists will do nothing that they are not made to do. It was true in eastern Kentucky from the time the railroad first went in there and the coal started comin' out. And it's still true.' Americans don't surely still believe God created them to shop? 'Have you been to a mall lately? A lot of people in my country virtually live in malls.' Are you anthropomorphising Nature? 'No. If Nature could be anthropomorphised there'd be no need to worry about our relationship with it. Our economy never is going to resemble it exactly. But enterprises that can be located no place but in nature must resemble nature in certain ways. That is to say, we must not waste, we must return to the soil the things we take from it . . .' . . . for our own benefit? 'Yes. Oh, absolutely.' Are you really a sort of socialist? Berry paused. 'I am fundamentally, I think, a kind of Jeffersonian Democrat. That is, I believe in putting small ownership of usable properties ahead of the interests of capital. I don't think that the behaviour of money in large piles ought to be permitted to destroy the security of small livelihoods. I'm highly sceptical of government solutions on the one hand and I'm highly sceptical of the claims of the capitalists on the other.' Unprompted, he added: 'I've been accused of being a Communist also. I've been accused of the whole political spectrum. I think the problem is I'm some kind of anomaly.' Berry is suspicious of modern environmentalists who oversimplify, sloganise and are ready to compromise. 'When I write, I'm obedient not to the demands of any side, but to my own sense of what is required in this never-ending, never altogether satisfactory, effort to tell the truth.' What about the so-called holistic view of the world? ''Holistic' is a word I won't use, because it's gotten to be one of those slogan words. It's always seemed to me a word that compromises between disdain of a plain word like 'whole' and fear of a forthright word like 'holy'. 'I try strenuously to avoid words like 'sustainable' and 'organic'. When I talk about agriculture I usually say 'good', knowing, for instance, that there are good farms that may use a little herbicide.' Berry insists that modern economic nostrums are just plain wrong. We argued about the benefits of competition, of free trade, of international comparative advantage, of agricultural subsidies. Each time he returned to his motif: the imperative need to defend rural communities. When I suggested his protectionism was the sign of a redneck, he was angry. 'If you said that in a certain tone of voice, I'd sure as hell resent it.' It's the classic complaint of the small producer, I explained. 'I'd have to go back and ask you what is cheap about permitting a whole productive class of people to be destroyed? What is cheap about creating a national dependence on long-distance transport? What would be cheap, if that transport failed, about retraining those people to make those goods again?' Are you saying we should all live like you? 'Heaven forbid. Anyone who understands farming would be aghast at the idea of a lot of city people rushing into the country to farm. It would be like a mass movement to play the violin. What I'm arguing for is that we should conduct our economic life by a juster and more complicated standard, the health of the local ecosystem and the local community.' Nations should be reconstituted as collections of local economies. Towns and their surrounding countryside would exchange contracts for food, goods and services. Governments would be there to guarantee community freedoms. You say we can't seize Eden by assault. But isn't it you that's looking for the Garden of Eden? 'Well, I understand what the Fall is about, and I'm only trying to think in a way that is appropriate to a fallen human being. If we understand human fallibility and what science has told us about the unpredictability of the world, about small causes having devastating effects, then the message to me is: limit the size of your causes.' What is economic growth for? 'We're not talking about the fulfilment of needs. We're talking about the fulfilment of created needs. People in the western world tend to have more clothes than they need, more communications than they need, to eat more than they need. You have to distinguish between growth that's necessary and growth that's frivolous.' You're begging the question who decides what our needs are. 'Sure. But it's also a question of what we are taught to think of ourselves. Human mental needs are infinitely expandable, but you can eat only so much.' Your last book is called What Are People For? Have you an answer? 'There are many answers. People are certainly not just to be used by other people as labour or as soldiery or as consumers or as objects of desire. They're also for each others' enlightenment, for each others' pleasure. They are meant to take care of one another. So there would be many answers. My effort would be to keep there from being too few.'</p>

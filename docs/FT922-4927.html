			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Caledonia buys 27.3% stake in Exco from B&amp;C administrators CALEDONIA Investments, which once controlled British and Commonwealth Holdings - the financial services group that collapsed two years ago - has acquired a 27.3 per cent stake in Exco International from the administrators of B&amp;C. The move follows Caledonia's purchase last November of a 45 per cent stake in Bristow Helicopter Group, which also used to be part of the B&amp;C stable. Caledonia, which is 47 per cent owned by the Cayzer family, has paid Pounds 20.5m for the Exco holding as part of a placing of 60 per cent of the equity. This has valued Exco, one of the City's leading money brokers, at Pounds 75m. Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the admin-istrators from Ernst &amp; Young, said this was after stripping out Pounds 80m in dividends for B&amp;C. Values for Exco bandied about previously have included Pounds 230m, had B&amp;C avoided administration, and Pounds 100m, before stripping out the Pounds 80m. Caledonia backed the management buy-out of Exco from Gerard &amp; National, the discount house, in 1978. The buy-out was led by Mr John Gunn, later B&amp;C's chief executive. In late 1986, B&amp;C bought Exco for Pounds 673m. The following year, before the stock market crash, B&amp;C bought most of Caledonia's stake for Pounds 427m. At the time, B&amp;C's market value was Pounds 1.5bn. Mr Gunn is not involved in the renewal of Caledonia's links with Exco. B&amp;C went into administration two years ago today - its peak debt was Pounds 1.2bn. Exco has remained profitable throughout - last year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.5m - although attempts to float or sell it proved unsuccessful. Mr Richard Lacy, Exco's chief executive, said it had been a difficult period. The administrators' efforts 'to trawl the marketplace' to find a buyer had consumed a lot of management time. 'It would have been better to have a quick sale and to get on with life.' It could now concentrate on its money broking and government securities broking businesses, improve its services to clients and develop new products. Mr Peter Buckley, Caledonia's chief executive and a member of the Cayzer family, said: 'We know the people who run Exco. They have been through a difficult time and we have an opportunity to participate in a company that has a new lease of life.' He is joining the Exco board as a non-executive. Other institutional investors include funds managed by Gartmore Investment, Fleming Investment Management, Nihon Tanshi and Nittan AP. Employees will ultimately gain a 15 per cent holding. B&amp;C retains 40 per cent. Mr Adamson said: 'As we were in a position to start paying dividends to shareholders, the placing gives us some money now and a substantial stake in the future. We believe the 40 per cent we have retained will produce its rewards.' Exco was advised by NM Rothschild, which also arranged the placing.</p>

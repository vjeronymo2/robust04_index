We won't judge the political aspect of  the event. We will verify the document's legality. What do  jurists say?    Anatoliy Sobchak, St. Petersburg mayor and a lawyer:    "The Duma's decision is unlawful. Only those who have  acknowledged their guilt in the commission of a crime and on  whom judgment has already been passed can be amnestied. If  someone does not acknowledge his guilt (and the participants in  the events of 1991 and 1993 have, by all accounts, not done so),  how can they be amnestied?"    Tamara Morshchakova, judge of the Constitutional Court:    "I can say only that the act of amnesty differs from a  pardon  in that the latter is individualized. An amnesty may be granted  regardless of the stage of the proceedings in the case.  Moreover, it may also be applied to actions into which no  criminal proceedings have been instituted at the moment of the  promulgation of the act of amnesty."    Richard Pipes, professor at Harvard University:    "This decision demonstrates that the concept of a  rule-of-law  state is very underdeveloped in Russia. How can you amnesty  people who have not been tried at all and when no one even knows  whether they are guilty or not. It is a political move and has  nothing at all to do with the law."    Aleksey Kazannik, general prosecutor of Russia:    "Each of the defendants subject to the amnesty will be  informed of the content of the Duma decree. If they are in  agreement with the Duma decision, I will issue a decree halting  criminal proceedings."    As you can see, the legal and political impasse is obvious.  The two branches of power have gotten into this impasse. This  is the consequence of the ill-considered and mutually  destructive decisions that were made in the fall of 1993. The  sides have now tried to find a compromise. The president would  not want the creation of a parliamentary commission to  investigate the tragic events of October. The Duma went along  with him, as it were, and revoked the decision to set up a  commission. But it immediately made up the ground ceded by  adopting the amnesty act. As is becoming clear, this is not a  compromise capable of reassuring society. The house we live in  has clearly not become more peaceful. The Constitutional Court  could act as arbiter in the conflict situation, but it currently  is literally `outlawed,' as the law on the Constitutional Court  has not yet been adopted. The president revoked the old Law "On  the Constitutional Court" by his well-known Edict No. 1,400, so  the main arbiter remains offside.    What have the politicians been fighting for?</p>

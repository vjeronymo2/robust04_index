			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, May 20 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  The Slovak Information Service (SIS) cannot be entrusted with  the issue of screening (lustration) certificates because it is  not an organ of the state administration, but of the Slovak  Republic, former chairman of the Czechoslovak Constitutional  Court Ernest Valko says in an interview in SME.    All the members of Moravcik's new government are at present  undergoing the screening required by law to see if they  collaborated with the communist secret police. However, the  process is being held up because it is not clear who should  issue the certificates, Moravcik said recently.    Under the former federation, screening certificates were  issued by the Federal Interior Ministry, and "from the  constitutional law on the demise of the federation it follows  that the relevant organ for the issue of screening certificates  is the Slovak Interior Ministry," Valko says.    In March 1993 the government of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar  entrusted the SIS with issuing screening certificates for a  period of nine months. After this the question of the competent  body was to be dealt with by legislation, but this never  happened. The present government, according to its statements,  intends to solve the problem by amending the law on the SIS and  the screening law, which bans secret police collaborators from  holding high office.    "I find it very difficult to understand how, in a government  which included a professor of administrative law (Katharina  Tothova) and where the government decree was conceived by  legislators, such a misunderstanding could have occurred," Valko  said.</p>

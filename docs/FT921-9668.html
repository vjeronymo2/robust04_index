			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Impala Platinum slices dividend IMPALA Platinum, the world's second largest producer, yesterday cut its interim dividend by 31 per cent, from 80 to 55 cents a share, as first-half earnings fell 16 per cent. The performance of the South African group was better than analysts predicted, due largely to a large drop in expenditure on leases, royalties and tax, to R45.5m (Dollars 16.4m) from R211.2m. A 39 per cent fall in profits from platinum operations, to R218.1m, was therefore ameliorated at the bottom line, with attributable earnings 16 per cent down at R124.7m. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said the group was hit by unexpectedly weak platinum and rhodium prices, coming at a time of high capital expenditure, 'enormous' labour difficulties, and problems with the 'lock-up' of metals in refineries. The average price received for platinum dropped to Dollars 376 per ounce from Dollars 448 in the same reporting period in 1990. Mr Gilbertson said the group lost about 100,000 oz of platinum production, which could not be recovered. This was the result of labour difficulties which caused shaft closures and decreased efficiency. The shortfall was compounded by the 'lock-up' of 50,000 oz of platinum in the refinery because of construction and commissioning activity. The outcome was that Impala produced only 382,000 oz of refined platinum compared with 528,000 oz in the year-ago period. Sales dropped to 443,000 oz from 544,000 oz.</p>

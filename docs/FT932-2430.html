			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Poised for a US investor catwalk  -Daimler-Benz's new stock market strategy LAST week, the finance director of Germany's biggest industrial company appeared as part of an unusual double bill. Mr Gerhard Liener, finance chief at Daimler-Benz, appeared on stage with Mr Wolfgang Ley, managing director of the Escada women's fashion chain. The two men spent the day expounding the attractions of their shares to more than 1,000 investors from Baden-Wurttemberg in south-west Germany. Mr Liener will soon get further opportunities to parade the merits of the Daimler-Benz group on the investor relations catwalk. Later this year, Daimler will become the first German company to obtain a full listing on the New York stock exchange. Mr Liener's performance before US investors will be solo as no other German company has made the concessions, primarily on accounting requirements, required by the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) before permission to list is granted. Mr Liener says the move is part of a fundamental reorientation of the group's approach to the world's equity markets. This complements a rethinking of its manufacturing policies. In the last three years, Daimler has listed its shares in Tokyo, London, Paris and Vienna, adding to listings in Germany and Switzerland. Next year, it hopes to debut on the fledgling Shanghai stock exchange and may list shares in Singapore. The strategy is partly motivated by the desire for pure publicity. Daimler knows that it will score a public relations coup if it becomes the first European company to get a listing in China. 'But the main practical consequence will be that when we proceed to a new rights issue, our shares will be picked up in a much more international way,' Mr Liener says. Daimler last held a rights issue in 1989. It planned another for last year but this had to be postponed because of poor conditions in the German stock market as well as deteriorating profits - group net profits fell 25 per cent to DM1.45bn (Dollars 906m) last year. They are likely to fall further to DM1bn this year before, Mr Liener says, bouncing back next year mainly as a result of recovery at Mercedes-Benz, the group's luxury car subsidiary. He says the next rights issue will raise between DM2bn and DM3bn and will probably take place next year, depending on group profitability and the Daimler share price. The aim will be to distribute the shares as widely as possible. Thus the line-up of advisory banks will be broader than the last rights issue. It will include a number of US institutions and banks from other parts of the world. The issue will be made easier by Daimler's decision earlier this year to disband Mercedes Holding (MAH), a holding company set up in December 1975 to prevent Daimler being taken over by the Shah of Iran. This will increase the 'free float' of Daimler shares from 33 per cent to 45 per cent. It will, for technical reasons, make it cheaper for Daimler to issue its equity: the discount to the Daimler share price is likely to be 20 per cent rather than 40 per cent in 1989. If cheaper equity and good publicity are the main reasons behind Daimler's new approach to shareholders, Mr Liener says that it must do more to keep ordinary shareholders 'happy, informed and interested'. One way of doing this is to enhance the group's communications effort, but more important - especially for the US investors whom Daimler will be wooing later this year - is financial performance. This does not look good: last month the group reported a profit of just DM20m for the first three months of the year, down from DM480m in the same period last year. Mr Liener concedes the pressure to generate earnings will increase as a result of coming into closer contact with non-German investors. Producing figures according to non-German rules will make it much easier for analysts to scrutinise details of performance. This pressure is partly to be welcomed: 'It increases the awareness of management in the group that to be profitable and to increase profitability is one of the most important priorities of being in business. 'But we will not change our attitude from long-term to short-term thinking,' Mr Liener insists. 'If we do that we will lose something which is very important and very valuable, American managers deplore that they are the slaves of investors' short-term thinking.' He hopes that he will be able to tell US investors a very positive story when it comes to the rights issue next year. 'Profits as of 1994 will be considerably increased from current levels - the second half of the nineties is going to be very good for Daimler-Benz.'</p>

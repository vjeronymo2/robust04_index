Children's fares remain 10 cents, and those under 5  ride for free.  </P> <P> According to ferry officials, this is the first increase in six years and will  help meet the high cost of operating the ferry, which includes fuel, upkeep and  rent.  </P> <P> There are also plans to eventually replace the 30-year-old ferries with new  ones, officials said.  </P></p>

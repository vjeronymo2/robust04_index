 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIPC has represented that it has no objection to the agreements under which a participating market professional's cross-margining property would not be deemed to be customer property for the purposes of SIPA;

and maintain all cross-margining property received from participating clearing firms to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for non-proprietary cross-margining accounts or held in such accounts, and all accruals resulting from such trades, contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, separately from money, securities, and property received to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for or held in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining customer account, and related accruals;

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 4 QUARTERBACKS, 1 SUPER BOWL  </P> <P> This is the time of year that can make or break a quarterback.  </P> <P> Terry Bradshaw couldn't spell "cat" until he starred in a Super Bowl.  </P> <P> Phil Simms was never good enough in New York until he was perfect in a Super  Bowl.  </P> <P> Doug Williams never got the payday he deserved until he broke down barriers in  a Super Bowl.  </P> <P> If this is January, then the NFL spotlight must be on the quarterback. Heading  into the AFC and NFC championship games, this year's roll call of Final Four  quarterbacks is typical of the times.  </P> <P> There's Bernie Kosar and John Elway -- the unorthodox, side-arming flinger  against the once golden boy -- in Sunday's AFC showdown between Cleveland and  Denver.  </P> <P> There's Jim Everett and Joe Montana -- the new kid on the block against the  master -- in the NFC's matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco  49ers.  </P> <P> Somewhere in that group is a Super Bowl winner: if it's Montana, a repeat  winner, waiting the call of fame and fortune.  </P> <P> Elway and Montana know a little about the territory. Elway is a two-time Super  Bowl loser with the Broncos, born of expectations that at times have been  surrealistic. Montana is a three-time winner whose former coach was ready to  phase him out as recently as November 1988.  </P> <P> Indeed, of the four, only Everett has not been drummed through the NFL's school  of hard knocks. Kosar was booed this season in Cleveland. All he did was win  four division titles in five years as a pro. Elway was booed in Denver. All he  did was win a pair of AFC championships.  </P> <P> "There (were) some unpleasant things said and John hasn't had an easy year,"  said Dan Reeves, Elway's coach in Denver. "But he has performed well, and he  showed last week he still is able to do great things."  </P> <P> Elway, 29, became the third player in NFL history to have five straight  3,000-yard seasons. Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason are the others. Counting last  week's come-from-behind win over Pittsburgh, he has brought the Broncos back 16  times with last-minute rallies. It was Elway's crucial 36-yard completion to  Vance Johnson on a flea-flicker that set up the Broncos' winning touchdown in a  24-23 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.  </P> <P> If there's one thing Marty Schottenheimer appreciates in Elway, it's his  competitive fire.  </P> <P> "When you talk about his mobility and strong arm, the one thing people fail to  recognize is that he probably is as great a competitor as there is," said  Schottenheimer, head coach in Kansas City who lost two AFC title games to Elway  while in Cleveland.  </P> <P> "I've coached him in the Pro Bowl, and I've seen enough of him to know the guy  is a great competitor. And if you look at all four of these quarterbacks,  that's one common thread they all have."  </P> <P> Kosar's competitiveness helped him endure a year of insult and injury in  Cleveland. The Browns' quarterback bruised his right elbow in a Week 10 victory  over Seattle. He played through the pain, and in the next four games the Browns  went 0-3-1. When he went 20 quarters without a touchdown pass, he was booed at  home.  </P> <P> "If you ask Bernie how he is, he won't ever say he's hurting," said Bud Carson,  who replaced Schottenheimer in Cleveland. "But we've discussed it with the  doctors and they say he isn't in any career-threatening situation. He just has  had some different arm problems.  </P> <P> "When the time comes to throw the ball, especially in a big game when we have  to have it, Bernie comes through. We were much more concerned about him last  week, health-wise, than this week."  </P> <P> Kosar, 26, has had elbow, shoulder and finger ailments this year. Last week,  with various parts of his anatomy hurting, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 235  yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite the injuries, Kosar still  passed for 3,533 yards and 18 touchdowns this season.  </P> <P> It doesn't surprise Schottenheimer. "The thing that stands out is that at a  point in time when everybody thought he would be at his worst, he got the job  done," his former coach said. "That speaks volumes about Kosar as a winning  quarterback."  </P> <P> At a point in time when then-coach Bill Walsh was ready to pass the 49ers'  quarterbacking torch from Montana to Steve Young last season, Montana responded  with some of the best football of his life.  </P> <P> The 49ers won seven of their last eight games a year ago, and with Montana  showing the way, capped the season with a dramatic 20-16 victory over  Cincinnati in Super Bowl XXIII. His 92-yard drive at game's end produced the  winning touchdown, a 10-yard scoring pass to John Taylor. This year, the 49ers  are 15-2 going into Sunday's showdown, and Montana has elevated his game still  another notch.  </P> <P> Montana, 33, completed a staggering 70.2 percent of his passes this season and  posted the highest passer rating in NFL history, 112.4. His  touchdown-to-interception ratio of 26-8 is the best of his 11-year career.  Montana was named the NFL's MVP for his superior season.  </P> <P> Said first-year 49ers Coach George Seifert, "Any superlative you can use to  describe him fits."  </P> <P> Montana's next playoff touchdown pass will tie him with Bradshaw for the league  record of 30.  </P> <P> As fate would have it, there are those who compare young Everett to the veteran  Montana. In his second full season as the Rams' starting quarterback, Everett  passed for 4,310 yards and an NFL-high 29 touchdowns. He has a strong arm,  quick release and soft touch.  </P> <P> "It's a great compliment," Everett said of the comparison. "He (Montana) has  proven time and time again he's a Super Bowl winner, and I think that's the  judgment on quarterbacks. Comparisons are great, but I don't have a Super  Bowl."  </P></p>

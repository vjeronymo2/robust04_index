			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Lower-rated borrowers turn to Yankee sector the US bond market for foreign issuers - is proving an important source of funds for lower-rated borrowers unable to raise funds at an acceptable cost in other markets. A growing number of sovereign borrowers which do not command top credit ratings are discovering the market. Thailand, which carries a single-A credit rating, tapped the market earlier this year. Mexico and Turkey are expected to follow in the next few weeks, with east European borrowers such as Hungary also considering issues. Mexico is expected to launch a Dollars 250m 10-year deal via Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan, while Turkey is planning a Dollars 200m deal, probably maturing in seven years, via J. P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers. Another group of issuers are European banks, which have caught on to the fact that the Yankee bond market provides a rare opportunity to raise subordinated debt, which counts as capital under the Basle guidelines on international bank capital adequacy. Finland's Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Germany's Landeskreditbank both raised subordinated debt last month. A string of others, including more Scandinavian banks, are expected to follow. Banque Paribas, the French bank, and Bayerische Landesbank, the German bank, are among the names circulated among bond market participants. Lower-rated European companies are also finding that they can raise debt finance more cheaply in the Yankee market than in the Eurobond market. This is a sharp reversal from the 1980s, when only top-quality European borrowers could gain access to the US market. Since the start of 1991, however, only 12 per cent of borrowers in the Yankee bond market have carried a top triple-A credit rating. Single-A and triple-B issuers have accounted for 60 per cent of the market, according to Merrill Lynch. One reason for the turnround is that many investment institutions have hired credit analysts specialising in foreign debt in the past few years. 'US institutions have got up to speed on the credit composition of offshore debt,' said Mr James Quigley, a managing director on Merrill Lynch's global debt financing desk. Improved access for overseas borrowers has not come in the areas where it was expected. For example, the 144a market - a hybrid of public and private placement markets widely expected to attract foreign borrowers because of less stringent disclosure requirements - has failed to take off. However, the introduction of Securities and Exchange Commission rule 144a in April 1990 focused the attention of US investors on foreign debt. The recent growth of the Yankee bond market has been fuelled by demand from US mutual funds, which have been experiencing a heavy inflow of funds. Since the collapse of the junk bond market, fund managers have found it hard to satisfy their appetite for higher-yielding securities, which has been sharpened by the current low interest rate environment. Lower-rated overseas issuers are providing a ready source of high-yielding bonds. Although the US junk bond market has found its form again, the heavy pace of junk bond issuance has been almost matched by early redemption of outstanding junk debt, often due to refinancing. Last month, for example, Dollars 3.4bn of outstanding debt was retired, compared with Dollars 3.5bn in new issues, according to Mr Edward Mally, director of high yield research at Salomon Brothers. Even with Dollars 5bn junk bond issuance pending, there is still likely to be pent-up demand for high yielding securities. In addition, changes in the regulations governing insurance companies have increased the amount of capital they must hold against junk bonds, so that better rated but still high-yielding securities may prove an attractive alternative. While US institutions have become more interested in higher yielding securities issued by foreign borrowers, European investors have become increasingly credit sensitive. As a result of their relative credit assessments, triple-A rated government agencies, for example, can normally raise funds about 5-10 basis points more cheaply in the Eurobond market, while single-A credits and lower can save varying but often substantial amounts by tapping the Yankee market.</p>

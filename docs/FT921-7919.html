			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons hit by Alma collapse ALMA, the confectionery company which went into receivership yesterday, was the second largest holding in the portfolio of Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust. The trust said it had already written down the value of its holding in Alma last year, as part of a review of its unquoted portfolio which resulted in a Pounds 37m provision. But even after the write-down, Drayton advanced further loans to the company before attempts were made to sell the company late last year after its performance had deteriorated sharply. Drayton's final exposure in terms of equity and debt was Pounds 19.8m, equivalent to 11 per cent of its total portfolio. The trust, managed by Invesco MIM, said that 'no recovery which would be material in the context of net asset value is expected from the equity or loans in Alma'. The effect of a complete write-off will be to knock about 57.8p off the trust's net asset value, which at the last balance sheet date was 422.4p. In August, a sudden fall in its share price prompted Drayton to issue a statement detailing its exposure to unquoted companies. Drayton's share price has fallen from a peak of 587p in late 1989. A number of investment trusts specialising in the unquoted sector revealed write-downs of assets last year, as the recession battered the finances of smaller companies. Investors have questioned the methodology used by investment trust managers to value unquoted assets.</p>

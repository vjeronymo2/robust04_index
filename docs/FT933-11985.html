			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: Bayreuth's new Tristan and Isolde inspire optimism - Opera Opening performance at the Bayreuth Festival is still, it seems, the high point on the German cultural calendar. Eminent visitors are on show: this year Wolfgang Wagner had as his applause-attracting guests Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev; Richard von Weizsacker, the German president, was visible in the primo palco (so was Douglas Hurd). Crowds were out in force. Protesters, a bit rain-drenched, were also in attendance, waving banners questioning expenditure on 'star' opera at a time of belt-tightening for the arts throughout Germany. In this Ring-less year - a new one is due in 1994, conducted by James Levine  -the dominant question inside the theatre before curtain-up was a purely artistic one, cause among Wagnerians of long months of anticipatory excitement: would there be revealed to the world important new singers of Tristan and Isolde? Almost everything, in fact, was new about this Tristan, apart from the conductor, Daniel Barenboim (he had been in charge of the previous Bayreuth production, from 1981 onwards). The controversial former-East-German playwright Heiner Muller was undertaking his first opera production. Erich Wonder, an avant-garde designer much prized elsewhere in Germany, was tackling his first Bayreuth assignment. The Marke, Kurwenal and Brangane were all new - either to the house or to the opera. But it was the Tristan, Siegfried Jerusalem, and Isolde, Waltraud Meier  - native-born Germans both - on whom brightest beams of attention were trained. Performers of these mightiest of Wagnerian roles capable of surmounting the peaks and staying the whole course were always in short supply, even when, unlike today, the finest traditions of Wagner-singing were as a whole amply nourished and sustained. At least Jerusalem, now in the mature phase of his career, has approached the opera in careful stages, via his Bayreuth-germinated Siegmund, Parsifal, Walther and Siegfried: and, if light by traditional Heldentenor measurements, he has mastered the art of Wagner pacing. For Meier the risk was greater, the result even more more lambently affecting and elating to contemplate. She is still young (late '30s), slimly handsome, and in voice-type a dramatic mezzo-soprano - a Kundry nonpareil, Eboli, Delilah. In the history of this opera more than one leading mezzo has been tempted to 'think herself upwards' into Isolde (Marta Modl and Irene Dalis come to mind); more often than not, though, strain has shown through, and a long-term price has had to be paid. Meier's first Isolde inspires optimism. In this theatre - voice-flattering, of course, with its covered orchestra and focused acoustics - she could base it on the most appealing of her artistic characteristics, the floating across the orchestra of exquisite, legato-based long lines, with notes precisely sounded and smoothly joined in the classic manner. The voice, with its highly individual timbre (metal-tipped, liquidly vibrant), sounded not just beautiful but aptly in character, capable by turns of imperious flourishes, anger-heated surges, soft romantic raptures. No Isolde of recent times has bitten into the first exchanges with Tristan with such tellingly bated sarcasm, made such continuous sense of Wagner's internal rhyme-schemes - it sounded as though she had lived long with the character and inside the text before presenting both to the public. Those famous top notes were all there: not exactly trumpeted, not radiant with Anne Evans's lighter, easier grace, but never evaded and almost never forced. I hope Meier will resist calls to make the role her international calling-card; she needs to continue work on it, patiently and gradually. To be introduced in a short space to two Isoldes - Meier and Evans - of this calibre makes this something of a Wagnerian annus mirabilis. Jerusalem's achievement seems more qualified. Much of the lower-voiced, middle-range utterance in Act 3 was wonderfully full, rich-grained, with a musicianly nobility unparalleled in recent times. In extremis, as it were, he tended to produce volume and notes rather than musical and dramatic sense; now that he has proved his ability in the first department, the second needs to recapture all his attention. A conductor capable of steadier overall command of Wagner's long paragraphs would undoubtedly have aided him in the process. Barenboim responds strongly to the beauty of the sound-world - the dullness of his 1981 Tristan is now a distant memory - but still insufficiently to formal architecture: his extremes of fast and slow tempo seemed to me ungoverned by the opera's internal logic. The other notable stroke of casting was the powerful sensitive young baritone Falk Struckmann as Kurwenal; John Tomlinson's Marke was unsteady, too insistent in its expressive detailing, Uta Priew's Brangane sympathetic but hardly exceptional. Muller's production, an all-of-a-piece feat of cool, minimalist staging, was at once abstractly interesting, emotionally distancing (sparing movements, everything behind gauze), and centrally un-romantic. Wonder's designs achieved fine Rothko-like patterns and plays of light on curious but always fastidiously chosen stage properties (the love duet played out amid serried rows of headless, armless tailor's dummies). I found it somewhat like a visit to an exhibition of Tristan-related modern artefacts in a classy German art gallery. Not an unserious experience - the audience booed it violently - and not a waste of time; but I could not help feeling the occasion, and particularly the new singers, demanded something far more engaged. Performances until August 28.</p>

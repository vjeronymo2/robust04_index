			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / C&amp;G chief pledges action on cash bids Mr Geoffrey Lister, chairman of the Building Society Association, said yesterday that if the Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society was allowed to go ahead the association would immediately press the government for a change in the law in time to affect any future cash bids, Alison Smith writes. Last month's Lloyds bid has led to intensified lobbying of the government by societies who want to ensure that the Treasury review of the societies legislation does not include allowing other organisations to approach society members directly against the wishes of the board. The bid has also raised the fear among building societies about the ability to offer cash to society members of less than two years' standing, and doubts about the effectiveness of drafting of legislation.</p>

The two  countries, which will celebrate 30 tears of the restoration of  diplomatic ties next year, will inaugurate the "Korea-Japan New  Initiative for Economic Partnership (NIEP)" in April with its  first meeting slated in Seoul.    The establishment of NIEP was agreed upon in last November's  summit between President Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Kyongju. Officials of the two  countries have since had a series of working meetings to discuss  how it will be set up, what it will be called and what it is  supposed to do.    "Although there have been some differences as to the  function  and title, we faced little difficulties in realizing the  establishment of the NIEP," said a Korean official at the  Economic Planning Board [EPB] who was involved in the project.    As shown in the title of the organization, the NIEP is  expected to lay a solid groundwork for bilateral economic  cooperation, looking beyond the present and reaching out to the  21st century, Korean officials say.    "Basically, Seoul and Tokyo will be able to discuss  everything within the framework of the NIEP, from the bilateral  trade imbalance to economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific  region," an EPB official said.    The NIEP appears similar to the Dialogue for Economic  Cooperation (DEC), economic cooperation talks between Seoul and  Washington, which the new administrations of Korea and the  United States launched last year. But the NIEP differs from the  DEC in that the latter is supposed to be disbanded after a  certain period while the former will be in operation over a  longer period.    Officials say both the NIEP and DEC were designed to address  bilateral economic issues but the former will be more  comprehensive than the latter. In the NIEP, Korea and Japan  will tap assistant foreign ministers as their respective chief  delegate with 10-odd officials of various ministries  representing each country.    Two rounds of meetings will be held in Seoul and Tokyo this  year but from next year, the two countries will hold meetings  once a year in principle. What will be discussed in the  meetings will be reported to President Kim and Prime Minister  Hosokawa.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, May 26 (KPL) -- Prime Minister Khamtai  Siphandon on May 5 signed an order concerning forest  exploitation that all state agencies at both central and  provincial levels have to implement strictly.    The order indicated weak points in the implementation of the  party and state policy on forestry resources as well as  instances of violating this policy.    According to this order, permissions for cutting timber over  quota and for cutting timber for all building purposes which  have not been approved by the ministry concerned and the  government are no longer issued, and those issued previously are  ordered cancelled immediately and absolutely. No province can  allow private businsses and owners of saw mills and wood  processing factories to send their people to cut timber in the  forest by themselves. State authorities in cooperation with  locals will organise the cutting of timber and then sell it to  private businesses at log yards No. 1 or No. 2. Provinces have  to stop exporting log and sawn wood, and if necessary, they need  special permission from the government. Provinces having border  cross points with foreign countries should help the government  in inspections. Timber export without permission from the  governments absolutely not allowed to pass bordr points.    The government has allowed some companies only to do the  export of sawn timber. Any companies with no authorization from  the government are definitely not allowed to do so. The import  of timber from other countries to Laos or in transit to a third  country also requires a quota from the government. Installations  of mobile saw mills and wood slicing machines are no longer  allowed in the forest. Previous permissions on the matter, if  any, will be officially cancelled. Exchanges of timber for cars,  materials, equipment and other construction ventures are no  longer permitted. Provinces have no right to allow local and  foreign investors to set up wood processing industries and to  undertake forestry concessions. This matter is to be decided by  the government alone. The use by foreigners of labour, drawing  equipment and trucks for cutting timber in the forest without  permission from the government must be stopped.    The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of  Industry and Handicraft are asked to send their personnel to the  provinces to collect data on the numbers of villages and people  still living on slash-and-burn farming on upland and watershed  areas and their annual demand for rice. Then the personnel have  to discuss with provincial authorities a solution to the issue.  In areas where conditions are favorable, people may have to move  to fixed farming in the plainland, while those living in areas  not favorable for rice farming will be advised to stop  slash-and-burn farming and take up the planting of industrial  trees or cattle raising on the spot. The state will provide them  with rice, credit, money and animals. Slash- and-burn  cultivation in lowland areas which cause forest destruction is  also strictly banned.</p>

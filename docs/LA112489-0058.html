			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL SHUN ROLE IN LEBANON, ISRAELI SAYS  </P> <P> Israel won't be drawn into the Lebanese conflict again, and Lebanon's Christian  army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, "will pay the price" for his mistakes, a  government official said Thursday.  </P> <P> Syria has accused Aoun of involvement in the assassination Wednesday of new  President Rene Mouawad, a Christian rival of the general. Aoun denies it.  </P> <P> "We don't support Gen. Aoun," said Yossi Olmert, director of the Israeli  Government Press Office. "We are not in the pocket of any Lebanese warlord; no  Lebanese warlord is in our pocket."  </P> <P> Israel was allied with the Christians when it invaded Lebanon in 1982 to drive  out the Palestine Liberation Organization, but it has taken an increasingly  neutral position since withdrawing in 1985 from all but a border "security  zone" in southern Lebanon.  </P> <P> Iraq has backed Aoun because of its enmity for Syria, and Olmert claimed that  the PLO also supports the Christian general's efforts to drive Syrian forces  out of Lebanon.  </P> <P> "The Arab enemies of Syria do not happen to be our friends," Olmert said in an  interview. He added about Aoun: "He will do what he likes to do, and he will  pay the price. It is his problem."  </P> <P> In an unusually conciliatory statement toward Damascus, Olmert said:  </P> <P> "We have no problem with the Syrians managing to stabilize Lebanon if it is  done on a legitimate basis acceptable to the Lebanese, and provided we (Israel)  are not required to pay the price."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Israel's continuing unrest, violence in the West Bank left three  Palestinians dead, including a woman killed when a suspected collaborator whose  car was being stoned opened fire on a crowd, military and Palestinian sources  said.  </P> <P> Two of the Palestinians were believed to have been killed by fellow  Palestinians in the West Bank town of Nablus, a strongly nationalistic enclave  known for its violence and activism.  </P> <P> One of them, Haniyeh Abdelrahim Swaiseh, 35, was shot three times by masked men  as she entered the Casbah district, Palestinian sources said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Noel Irias] </F>   [Text] The majority of Sandinists interviewed by the  Nicaraguan Studies Institute (IEN) believe that caudillismo  exists within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] and  that the party has lost the support of part of its rank and  file, according to a study entitled "The FSLN: A Study of Its  Dynamics and Outlooks Based on the Opinion of the Rank and File."    The study is based on 191 in-depth interviews with FSLN  militants and sympathizers in neighborhoods across the country.  IEN Director Rodolfo Delgado reports participants were selected  from lists provided by the FSLN Leadership Committees in each  department.    The study's introduction reveals that, despite the loss of  credibility, the FSLN has maintained a solid social base of  approximately 23 percent of the population.    The document claims, however, this social base is not broad  enough to win the elections in 1996, much less when the support  is a mere 12 percent among the peasants and barely 8 percent  among the majority of the uneducated poor.    According to the IEN's final report, 55 percent of those  interviewed believe caudillismo exists within the FSLN. To them  the term caudillismo means "a perpetuation of power that  prevents the natural evolution of historical change." Forty-one  percent of those interviewed believe that phenomenon does not  exist within the FSLN.    Thirty-seven percent of those who believe caudillismo exists  within the FSLN "see the danger of succumbing to a lifelong  leadership."    "They believe caudillismo affects the image of the  democratization of the FSLN, pointing out there should be more  than one leader. The leadership should be broad and diverse at  every level," the study states.    According to the study, there is agreement on the  advisability of having the FSLN secretary general elected by the  national convention from a list of candidates provided by  members of the rank and file.    "They believe almost unanimously it would be advisable to  elect the FSLN secretary general from two or more candidates.  That would send a meaningful, democratic signal to the party  and to the Nicaraguan people," the IEN report states.    Among the most disturbing aspects of the study is that 56  percent of those interviewed believe the FSLN has lost popular  support due to the crisis the party is experiencing, its neglect  of the rank and file and the countryside, and the incorrect  methods of struggle used, among other things.    Regarding the different political currents within the FSLN,  the majority, 54 percent, believe these currents are hindering  the FSLN's progress, and 44 percent believe they are the result  of "a struggle for power."    Fifty-eight percent of those interviewed say they have no  preference for any current, because they are interested in the  FSLN's unity and principles, while "16 percent favor the  Democratic Left, and 5 percent favor the Renovating Current."    The IEN questionnaire included the question: "Do you believe  the FSLN has been involved in violent acts in the past three  years?" Fifty-one percent answered "not as a political party,  though some of its members have participated in violent acts."    Those interviewed believe "even though the government  initiates institutionalized violence with its neoliberal  policies, the FSLN cannot and should not respond with violent  demands or protests that can lead to tragic events that affect  the image" of the party.    The IEN study will be presented on 6 May at the Olof Palme  Convention Center. Among those expected to attend the  presentation are Mario Solorzano, Socialist International vice  president, Daniel Ortega, Sergio Ramirez, Carlos Fernando  Chamorro, Victor Hugo Tinoco, Orlando Nunez, and Oscar Rene  Vargas.</p>

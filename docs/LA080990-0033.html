			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR WATTS  </P> <P> As a resident of South Los Angeles, I think that the Watts redevelopment plan  is a good idea.  </P> <P> For example, if they build new businesses, there will be more jobs for people.  </P> <P> However, what about our homes? What if we don't want to sell our houses? I  think that government should just buy from the people who are willing to sell  their homes.  </P> <P> I think that in order to improve this community, the government should give  more jobs to people. That's why there are a lot of drug dealers on the streets  of Los Angeles. Finally, I think that government should build more recreation  areas for youths.  </P> <P> ROBERT MARTINEZ  </P> <P> Locke High School Student  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Yan Haiwang, secretary </F> of the Gansu Provincial CPC Committee, and Zhang Wule, governor  of Gansu Province, by staff reporters Lo Liang-liang (0149 0081  0081) and Yang Fan (2799 1581), and trainee reporter Chang Chun  (1728 6511), in Lanzhou; date not given: "Gansu Province Is  Basically Self-Sufficient in Grain"]    [Text] Lanzhou, 6 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- The project to  divert the water from the Tatong He to the Qinwangchuan region,  north of Lanzhou, basically has been completed. This project  will change the backward appearance of the rural areas in  central Gansu and have a major impact on the province's social  and economic development. When exclusively interviewed by these  reporters, Yan Haiwang, secretary of the Gansu Provincial CPC  Committee, and Governor Zhang Wule both took this project as an  indication of the tremendous achievements scored by the province  in reform and opening up, and likened the achievements to those  currently attained in Dujiangyan.    This is one of the key projects financed by the World Bank  in  China with a loan of $123 million. The construction of the  project is difficult because of its large span. The Pandaoling  Tunnel has an overall length of 15.7 km, and is the longest  water delivery tunnel in Asia and the seventh longest in the  world. With the world's most advanced equipment and technology,  the engineering companies from China, Japan, and Italy, which  are the contractors on the project, took six years to basically  complete this magnificent irrigation work, and have been highly  appraised by the World Bank and the Israeli experts.    Yan Haiwang stressed that Gansu, which in the past always  depended on grain transferred from other provinces, has been  basically self-sufficient since reform and opening up. Without  suspension or semisuspension in production, the large and  medium-sized enterprises here have performed better than those  in many other provinces. The secretary also pointed out that  Gansu is an entirely landlocked province, which is not along any  coast, big river, or border (except for several dozen km of  borderline contiguous to Mongolia with no economic  significance). Under the situation in which eastern China is  growing at a high speed, Gansu is determined to develop its  strong points and avoid weaknesses so as to restore the prestige  of the Silk Road, and the people are resolved to work hard for  the goal of shaking off the province's impoverished appearance.    Governor Zhang Wule pointed out: With the market economic  mechanisms taking effect, large and medium-sized state  enterprises in Gansu have acquired a fair competitive  environment. They are getting out of their predicament and  advancing in a good direction. The construction of the  multitrack Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and Baoji-Zhongwei Railway  soon will be completed and opened to traffic, which will  considerably enhance the province's railway transport capacity.  Moreover, the province will benefit directly from the  construction of the second Eurasia Continental Bridge between  Lanzhou and the Alataw Pass, and its investment environment will  be further improved. The State Planning Commission plans to  establish a project to build in Lanzhou a large ethylene plant  with a production capacity of 660,000 tonnes in a bid to  increase the economic strength of northwest China, after taking  into account the adequate output of petroleum and gas in  Xinjiang and the good industrial and traffic facilities in  Lanzhou. If the construction of this project is confirmed, the  province's output value will increase by several dozen billion  yuan, and Gansu will play an even more powerful role as an  industrial base in the vast northwest of China.</p>

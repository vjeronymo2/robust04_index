			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Henlys claims low acceptance HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader and bus and coach builder which is fighting a hostile bid from T Cowie, claimed that Cowie had won acceptances from holders of only 1 per cent of its shares. Henlys had served Section 212 notices, which are intended to discover the beneficial owners of shares, on Monday and received a reply on Tuesday which said that holders of 387,000 shares had accepted the offer. Mr David Matthews, former chairman and chief executive of Henlys, has said that he will accept the bid for his 7 per cent stake. On Tuesday afternoon Cowie bought 1.14m shares in the market at 73p, equivalent to 3 per cent of Henlys shares. Sellers included Mercury Asset Management, which sold 300,000 shares, Universities Superannuation Scheme, selling 250,000, and Eagle Star Insurance and Scottish Equitable, which each sold 100,000. The final closing date for the bid is Tuesday. The share prices of the two companies were unchanged yesterday. With Cowie at 120p its all-paper bid is worth 84p a share or Pounds 31.8m for the company, while the partial cash bid values Henlys at 80p a share or Pounds 30.3m. Henlys share price remains well below those levels at 65p.</p>

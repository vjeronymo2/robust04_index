			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Row at Land Travel creditors' meeting MR VALERE TJOLLE, chairman of the collapsed coach tour operator Land Travel, was assailed by angry creditors yesterday at a meeting which heard that he had received Pounds 400,000 of company money in addition to his salary over the past 16 months. The incident came after Mr Robert Buller, of liquidators Grant Thornton, also told the crowded creditors' meeting in Bristol that he had complaints that Land Travel had banked cheques on July 23, the day before the collapse, even though Mr Tjolle had already arranged to see him. Mr Buller said Pounds 6.6m of Land Travel's total debts of Pounds 12.4m, more than six times the amount originally estimated, was owed to would-be travellers. He said Grant Thornton had been able to identify 25,000 such customers. Because Land Travel was not bonded by the Association of British Travel Agents or the Bus and Coach Council, customers have no chance of receiving any refund unless they paid by credit card, in which case they stand to be reimbursed by the card issuers under the Consumer Credit Act. Mr Buller said there was little chance of any creditors receiving anything. After yesterday's meeting, Mr Buller said Mr Tjolle was owed money by Land Travel arising from his purchase of the company in 1990. He said Mr Tjolle appeared to have received the Pounds 400,000 before the period stipulated in the loan and in preference to the general body of Land Travel creditors. Mr Buller also said the Pounds 400,000 was in addition to Mr Tjolle's annual remuneration of Pounds 52,000. He said that from January to July this year, additional payments to Mr Tjolle were made at the rate of Pounds 14,000 a week. Mr Tjolle made a brief statement at the meeting in which he told the creditors, many of them elderly: 'I personally feel I have let you down.' He said that although he had nothing to hide he had been advised by his solicitor, Mr Angus Halden, not to answer any questions. During the two-hour meeting, an angry creditor threw a jug of water over Mr Tjolle and threatened him with a walking stick before being led away. Two creditors tore up pieces of paper and threw them in Mr Tjolle's face. Mr Buller said it appeared that the company was trading while insolvent for some time before the liquidators were called in. He said he had sold the Land Travel database to Shearings Holidays for a net consideration of Pounds 50,000. The company's furniture and computers were probably worth a further Pounds 25,000. Land Travel's cut-price European holidays included three nights in Paris or Brussels at Pounds 49, and 10 days in Poland at Pounds 159. Customers vent anger, Page 4</p>

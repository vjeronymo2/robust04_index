			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / GEC shares fall on profit warning Shares in The General Electric Company fell 13p to 320p yesterday - in a market that hit a new closing peak - after a warning by the chairman Lord Prior that profits this year would show little improvement over 1992. GEC's shares were marked down despite interim profits and dividends which advanced in line with City expectations. It marked the cooling of market sentiment towards the electronics giant, regarded as an unexciting but reliable performer. The City had anticipated group profits would be weighted towards the second half and was expecting about Pounds 935m in pre-tax profits for the full 12 months. Analysts yesterday cut full-year forecasts to no more than Pounds 900m. Interim profits fell in nearly every business area, and the cables division incurred a trading loss as a result of weak demand and cheap imports. Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director, said the company was in continuing discussions with British Aerospace, which were expected to lead to the announcement of at least two joint ventures in the near future. Talks which could have led to a merger of the two groups' defence interests were called off earlier this year. Pre-tax profits at the halfway mark were slightly up at Pounds 360m, compared with Pounds 356m, while turnover advanced 3 per cent to Pounds 4.39bn, against Pounds 4.26bn. Earnings per share inched up from 8p to 8.2p. A dividend of 2.81p will be paid, 4.85 per cent ahead of the year before. The group's order book improved to Pounds 13bn, from Pounds 11.9bn a year earlier, while total net cash stood at Pounds 2.43bn, against Pounds 1.8bn. Lord Prior, chairman, said most of the businesses had performed satisfactorily in poor trading conditions, adding: 'While profits will, as expected, be weighted towards the second half of the current year, the directors consider in the light of the current trading conditions that they are unlikely to be substantially higher than for last year.' In the year to March 1993, the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 863m on revenues of Pounds 5.6m. The group's pessimism is based on recession in mainland Europe; trading in Germany and Belgium had been particular poor, Lord Weinstock said, with France only marginally better. The company spent Pounds 499m on research and development in the first half. Details, Page 26 Lex, Page 24 London SE, Back Page</p>

Thus, Mr. Baburyan considers the mass media statements on  the  agreement on the Karabakh troops withdrawal within the period of  20 days, as groundless ones. Mass media reported on the fact  that the agreement was as if achieved as a result of the recent  meeting of Babken Ararktsyan, a Chairman of the Armenian  Parliament, and Rasul Guliyev, a Chairman of the Azerbaijani  Milli Majlis.    According to the information the Karabakh side possesses,  Mr.  Chairman said, there were discussed ways of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. No concrete treaty was  concluded.</p>

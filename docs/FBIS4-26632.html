			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- A New Zealand trade  delegation comprising 70 enterpreneurs is now in China, probing  new investment and cooperation opportunities.    The delegation, the largest ever from that country, led by  Minister of Trade Negotiations Philip Burdon, is expected to  lead to a new "investment wind" blowing from the South Pacific  island nation, trade officials from both countries believe.    In the trade group are representatives from New Zealand's  leading enterprises, such as Fletcher Challenge, Calt Halt and  the Lion Company, which have already invested in China. They  will tour Tianjin, Suzhou, Chongqing and Guangzhou to discuss  specific cooperation projects with local officials in addition  to holding two trade seminars in Beijing and Shanghai,  respectively.    In his talks with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, Burdon said that his country  attaches great importance to developing trade and economic ties  with Asian countries, China in particular. The New Zealand  Government has also launched the "Asia-2000" strategic plan  targeting the shifting of its trade focus from the traditional  European markets to Asia.    With the implementation of the plan two years ago, New  Zealand-China economic ties have entered a new stage in which  sole trade has given way to a variety of methods of economic  cooperation. China so far is New Zealand's tenth-largest export  destination and its sixth-largest import source, involving a  total trade volume of more than 500 million U.S. dollars last  year, a rise of 14.5 percent over 1992.    The first quarter of this year saw the bilateral trade rise  to more than 93 million U.S. dollars, up 12.6 percent over the  same period of last year. Chinese exports are mainly garments  and textiles and electronic appliances, and imports are mainly  resource-based products such as wool, timber, coal and iron ore.    As a traditional capital absorbing country, New Zealand has  in recent years encouraged its enterprises to invest in China.  By the end of last year New Zealand had invested in 148  enterprises in China involving a total capital of nearly 70  million U.S. dollars. Last year alone they set up 76 joint  ventures in pasture development, feedstuffs, woolen textiles,  fishing, computers and inland oil exploration. The total  contracted capital of 44.5 million U.S. dollars was more than  the previous year's total.    A New Zealand trade official said that the investment wind  is  expected to blow stronger along with China's economic  development and opening drive.    Over the past few years Chinese enterprises have also  invested in New Zealand. They run more than 20 joint ventures  with investment much larger than that poured by New Zealand into  China.</p>

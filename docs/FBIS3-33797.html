The shots were heard from the western corner of the  shrine while President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani was delivering a  speech.    The ceremonies, attended by tens of thousands of  participants, including foreign guests, were held at the  beginning of the ten-day dawn ceremonies, marking the arrival to  the country of the late Imam Khomeyni after a 15-year exile in  1979.    An unidentified person, standing 150 meters away from the  western gate of the shrine, shot a few bullets into the air and  was later seized by the crowd and handed over to the Law  Enforcement Forces. Major Reza Mohammad-Doust, a law  enforcement officer, told IRNA that interrogation started  immediately after the arrest and in the body search that ensued  a number of forged student, police and press cards were found on  the assailant.    The incident took place on the first day of the ten-day dawn  ceremonies, marking the 15th anniversary of the 1979 victory of  the Islamic revolution.    The shots did not disturb the ceremonies and the large crowd  of people, after chanting "death to munafiq" (munafiq, means  "hypocrite" a reference to the members of the Iraqi-sponsored  terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq outfit) and "Hashemi, Hashemi you are  the apple of our eyes", calmed down and continued listening to  the rest of President Rafsanjani's speech.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and </F> Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504): "Tian Shan, a Bridge of  Friendship"]    [Text] Bishkek, 24 Apr (XINHUA) -- Bishkek, situated at the  foot of Tian Shan, has in the last several days been enveloped  in an atmosphere of Sino-Kyrgyz friendship. The arrival of  Premier Li Peng has further deepened and harmonized the  friendship between the two peoples living on both sides of Tian  Shan.    "Love begins with the first meeting." President Akayev  warmly used this Kyrgyz proverb to describe how Kyrgyzstan is  developing its relations with China. Following talks with  Premier Li Peng, he told us: "My understanding of China began  with my visit to China in 1992. Premier Li Peng's current visit  to Kyrgyzstan serves to make him understand Kyrgyzstan better  and to complete the stage of mutual understanding. The time for  carrying out very effective cooperation has finally arrived."  Akayev made a general summary in the following terms of the  development of relations between Kyrgyzstan and China since the  two countries established diplomatic relations: "We have solved  the three most important issues over the last two years. First,  we have enhanced our neighborly and friendly relations. Second,  we have laid a legal foundation for cooperation. Third, we have  begun consultations on international and regional affairs."    Kyrgyz leaders consider Premier Li Peng the "brother and  friend" of the Kyrgyz people and they expressed deep emotion  toward the honorable Chinese guest and toward the Chinese  people. At many occasions, be it at the airport, at the elegant  state guesthouse, and at the lively banquet, President Akayev  and Premier Li Peng talked freely about friendship, exchanged  views, and explored ways of cooperation. The scheduled one-hour  official talks continued, as the passage of time was not  noticed, for two and a half hours in a sincere and friendly  atmosphere. At the ceremony for signing six important  documents, the two leaders wore smiles of contentment.    Strengthening economic and trade cooperation was one of  Premier Li Peng's important intentions during the visit to  Kyrgyzstan. He carried out with Prime Minister Abbas  Dzhumagulov an in-depth exchange of views on some major  cooperation projects in a pragmatic atmosphere. No sooner had  the Chinese entrepreneurs who accompanied Premier Li Peng's  visit arrived in Bishkek than they got in contact with and held  talks with their Kyrgyz counterparts. The two countries'  businessmen signed letters of intent for cooperation in  engineering projects and gold mining, as well as in other areas  of mutual interest. As a matter of fact, Sino-Kyrgyz  cooperation has already borne satisfactory fruits in some  sectors. At the hotel where we stayed, we had the luck of  enjoying Chinese-style noodles. The restaurant's manageress told  us that the instant noodles produced by "Ketelapu," a  Sino-Kyrgyz joint venture, are much loved by the Kyrgyz people  and can be enjoyed at all local restaurants. President Akayev  had also recently mentioned this noodle factory, which is a  model for joint ventures, to Chinese reporters. Its fine dried  noodles and instant noodles have not only met the demands of the  Kyrgyz market but have also been exported to other countries,  including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Therefore, the Kyrgyz  Government awarded the state's highest honor certificate to  Liang Chuansen, the former manager of this plant who had worked  so hard to set up the plant.    "Expanding and deepening the cooperation between the two  countries are quite necessary and will benefit the two  countries." This remark by Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov  speaks volumes about the wish shared by the business circles of  the two countries.    Kyrgyzstan's radio station began its morning broadcast amid  melodious music. The first news report was Premier Li Peng's  goodwill visit to this mountainous country. The first video  news report carried by the state television station's evening  news program was the lively scene of Premier Li Peng's visit.  Local media evaluated Premier Li Peng's visit highly. To cite  just a few of them: "Premier Li Peng's visit to Kyrgyzstan is a  major event of historical significance," "His visit will turn a  new page in the Kyrgyz-Chinese relationship," "The friendly  messenger from a great neighboring country is building a new  Silk Road"..... Premier Li Peng's remark that "China is willing  to develop equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with  countries in Central Asia" was broadcast over the radiowaves to  hundreds and thousands of households. Information officials at  the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry told us that in the last several  days, newspapers and radio and television stations in Kyrgyzstan  have carried extensive report on China and have praised China's  recent construction achievements. In Tashkent, Premier Li Peng  delivered a speech in which he declared in a firm and friendly  manner that China will always be a "good friend and good  neighbor" of the peoples of Central Asia. This has further left  a deep impression in the minds of the people.    Under the bright sunshine, the rolling Tian Shan looks great  and magnificent. Today, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese  and Kyrgyz leaders, the mountain chain linking the territories  of the two countries is becoming a strong link of friendship and  cooperation between the two peoples.</p>

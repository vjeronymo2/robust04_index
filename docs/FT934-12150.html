			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: A spot of competition for India's bootleggers - The opening of a huge but long closed liquor market EMPTY Johnnie Walker bottles are so much in demand in India that they sell for up to Rs50 (Pounds 1), as long as the labels are intact. They are popular with bootleggers who fill the empties with locally brewed hooch. About 60 per cent of the Scotch and other international-brand liquor sold in India is counterfeited in this way; less than 20 per cent is legally imported; the rest is smuggled. For years the world's leading drinks groups could do little to meet this pent-up demand. Successive governments banned imports except for luxury hotels, diplomats and duty-free sales to travellers. But, with the liberalisation programme launched by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, international drinks groups are being allowed back into India. The four largest groups, Guinness's United Distillers, Grand Metropolitan's IDV, Allied-Lyons' Hiram Walker and Seagram, all have plans to start producing and selling their drinks in India. They are entering a fast-growing but difficult market. Hard liquor is anathema to strict Hindus and Moslems alike and a commitment to its eradication is enshrined in the constitution. In practice, only the state of Gujarat is dry and consumption of spirits per head in the rest of the country is among the world's highest. Indian drinkers consume an estimated 230m cases of spirits a year, about two-thirds of it rough country-made liquor called arrack so crudely produced that deaths from poisoning are not uncommon. Most of the remaining one-third of sales, about 75m cases, is accounted for by larger distilleries making a range of spirits, mainly whiskies with English brand-names such as Royal Velvet and McDowell's No 1. Sales of foreign-brand liquors (including counterfeits) are roughly estimated at 1.5m cases. The international drinks groups are aiming at a niche between the top local drinks, which sell for up to Rs500 a bottle, and the international brands, selling at Rs1,500-plus on the black market. The target customers are urban middle-class Indians who are tempted by foreign brands but cannot afford black market prices. 'There are now 100m-150m people with more money to spend, with changing lifestyles and aspirations, who want internationally-known quality products,' says Mr LP Jaiswal, chairman of Jagatjit Industries, a leading Indian drinks company. Mr Tony Greener, chairman and chief executive of Guinness, the UK group which owns United Distillers, says: 'We believe there are outstanding opportunities to be developed.' The three British-owned groups are entering India via joint ventures: United Distillers with UB group, India's largest drinks producer; Hiram Walker with Jagatjit Industries; and IDV probably with Narang Industries, a Delhi-based distiller, though a deal has yet to be completed. Seagram of Canada is establishing a 100-per-cent-owned marketing subsidiary but will find a local production partner. The international companies have modest production targets of less than 100,000 cases each a year, partly because of the difficulties of operating in India and partly because of government restrictions. The Indian government is anxious that foreign liquor should not be a drain on the foreign exchange account, so officials have stipulated that bulk imports of malt liquor - the essence of Scotch - and other ingredients will have to be matched by exports. Since exports may grow only slowly, they will limit the scale of imports. Moreover, there will be no increases in overall licensed production capacity. United and UB are each investing about Pounds 3m in a venture which will build a bottling plant in Bombay and produce about 50,000 cases a year of Indian-distilled and blended whisky and 30,000 cases of locally-bottled Scotch, either Vat 69 or Black &amp; White. Hiram Walker and its partner plan to produce 30,000 cases of locally-bottled Teacher's whisky and another 30,000 of blends with locally-made alcohol. IDV is considering local production of Smirnoff vodka, Gilbey's gin and at least one whisky. Seagram's is planning a Pounds 5m investment in bottling Scotch and in producing Indian spirits and fruit juices, as well as wine-making. None of the ventures is expected to make a quick profit. Mr Devin Narang, managing director of Narang Industries, says: 'In the short term we have to build the brands. But in the long term the prospects are good.' Indian drinks executives do not expect the new initiatives to drive the bootleggers out of business. For one thing, the newly-introduced brands will themselves be the subject of counterfeiting. For another, the international groups have no plans to produce their top brands in India. There will be no Indian-bottled Johnnie Walker. So, the second-hand bottle sellers will still have a market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Law To Put Controls on Commercial </F> Insurance"]    [Text] China's first insurance law will prohibit  government departments and banks from setting up insurance  companies, according to a senior insurance official.    Qin Daofu, head of the drafting committee for the law, said  the ban will prevent these departments from using their  influence and connections to control the insurance market.    At present several departments such as the Ministry of  Labour  and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, are involved in the insurance  business in one way or another.    He said after the passing of the law, which is scheduled for  some time next year, these departments will only be authorized  to engage in social insurance business, such as unemployment  insurance and pension schemes.    The drafting of the law is nearly finished, Qin said, adding  that the committee studied insurance laws in 16 countries and  regions, including both developed and developing countries and  regions, while doing its work.    After the law comes into effect China's insurance market  will  have a comprehensive legal framework to ensure fair competition,  normal market operations and healthy development of the  industry, he said.    Under the law, the People's Bank of China will supervise the  industry. The bank will be responsible for ensuring insurance  companies fulfill the obligations they undertake in their  policies.    Qin said the guidance of the People's Bank of China is aimed  at maintaining order in the insurance business. And an  insurance association, which will be a self-disciplinary  organization, is expected to be established in the future.    The law will also require new insurance companies to be  formed as stock or mutual companies, he said.    At present, the Chinese insurance market is dominated by the  People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which has a  97-percent market share. The rest of the market is divided  between the Shanghai-based Pacific Insurance Company, China  Pingan Insurance Company in Shenzhen, Agriculture Insurance  Company in Xinjiang, and eight life insurance companies, Qin  said.    The law will apply equally to foreign-funded insurance  companies, he said. A foreign-funded company, if registered in  China, will be considered a domestic company. These companies  don't have to lodge a deposit with the People's Bank of China as  they have registered capital.    However, under the law, branches of foreign insurance  companies will be required to lodge a deposit guarantee with the  People's Bank.    They will also have to have a permanent Chinese resident as  their representative.    The law will also empower the People's Bank to make other  relevant regulations to govern the industry, he said.    Qin said many foreign insurance companies are eyeing the  vast  potential of the Chinese insurance market.    So far, more than 20 foreign insurance and brokers companies  have opened representative or liaison offices in the country and  two of them, the American International Group and the  London-based Sedgwick Group, have opened branches in Shanghai  and Beijing respectively.    China's insurance industry has seen rapid growth in recent  years.    In 1992, the total property insurance policies in the  country  reached 4.56 trillion yuan ($786 billion)-44.7 percent more than  the previous year.    Some 700,000 firms and 143 million families are covered by  property insurance policies, while 313 million people have  bought personal insurance policies.</p>

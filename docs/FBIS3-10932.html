Rubiano, Cali archbishop, told Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN)  the local media which had published information on the bishops'  attendance to a "summit" with Colombian rebels in Havana should  give the names of the alleged participants.    The priest categorically denied Nel Beltran, bishop of  Sincelejo (northwest Colombia) and mediator between the  government and rebels, had traveled to Cuba, as reported by the  Santa Fe de Bogota media.    The worst thing that can happen to the nation during this  election period is not to say the truth, said the president of  the Episcopal Conference when referring to the conflict caused  by the bishops' participation in talks with rebels.    Rubiano Saenz added "there must be an intention behind the  news that are given in that manner, with half truths, as they  remain up in the air."    Several Santa Fe de Bogota dailies and newspapers published  on 8 March photographs of Luis Madrid Merlano, bishop of the  Tibu petroleum area (northwest), meeting with guerrillas in the  mountains. The priest explained these were "pastoral dialogues"  seeking peace in his region.</p>

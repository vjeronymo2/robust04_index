			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The fossil of a frog  which lived about 150 million years ago was recently unearthed  in Sinuiju, a northwestern city of Korea.    Last year the fossil of Korean archaeopteryx of the early  Jurassic period of the Mesozonic era was discovered there, which  shows the course of the evolution of birds from primitive  reptiles, a higher land vertebrate. This convincingly proved  Korea being a cradle of human civilisation where extinct animals  and plants evolved systematically.    The discovery of the fossil frog in the same stratum is an  irrefutable proof that a fast evolution of the frog was in  progress in the Mesozonic era on the globe and the northwestern  part of Korea was the central arena of that evolution.    The great leader President Kim Il-song named the oldest  known  fossil frog discovered this time "archaeofrog."    The fossil unearthed and ascertained by authoritative  natural  scientists clearly preserves part of the vertebra, foreleg bone,  hindleg bone, and the pelvis.    Fossil frogs in the world had so far been discovered in the  stratum belonging to the period of and after the third Cenozoic  era, or about 60 million years ago. The frog fossil recently  unearthed in Korea belong to a time 90 million years earlier.    With the discovery of the fossil of archaeofrog which helps  establish a new academic view on the evolution of the frog and  its phylogeny and classification system, the long history of the  land of Korea has become ever clearer.</p>

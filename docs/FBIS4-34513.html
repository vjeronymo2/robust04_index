			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Text] The Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, Industries, and  Agriculture is asking the Legislative Assembly to reject the  copyright bill because it threatens the stability of companies  and the media.    In a letter sent to the president of the Legislative  Assembly, the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce asked for the  rejection of the bill as approved in a first debate by the  Education Committee, and it called for modifications presented  by the Panamanian Broadcasting Association (APR) and the  Panamanian Radio Chamber. The APR also sent a letter to the  assembly's Board of Directors asking for a rejection of the  copyright bill because it contains regulations that violate  freedom of speech and threaten the economic stability of radio  stations. Meanwhile, the Education Committee, which asked for  the approval of the bill in its second and third debates, said  the bill takes steps to protect all types of literary, artistic,  and scientific works in light of the fact that author rights  constitute the basic foundation for stimulating national  creativity. The commission said another reason for endorsing the  bill was Panama's current position in the international  community, because Panama has signed a number of agreements  requiring it to protect national works.</p>

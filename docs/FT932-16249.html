			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Talks on Ukraine's missiles at dead end NEGOTIATIONS between Ukraine and Russia over the future of the nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory have reached a 'dead end', Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk said yesterday. To resolve the stalemate, he has suggested to Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the issue be discussed by the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers. Mr Kravchuk rejected Russia's accusation that Ukraine wanted to be a nuclear power. But he reaffirmed Ukraine's claim to ownership of strategic nuclear missiles on its territory. An alternative of granting Russia ownership of the Ukrainian missiles was 'unacceptable' because Ukraine could not permit a foreign military presence on its soil. Radiation leaked from a plant in Siberia yesterday after an explosion in a tank containing uranium, Reuter reports. No casualties were reported in the incident at the Tomsk-7 complex, one of three facilities in Russia for processing spent nuclear fuel.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Euphoria revisited IT HAS long been clear that the securities markets are the only place left in the developed world where inflation continues to work its spell on prices. A sudden rash of paper bids and deals in the US, culminating in Bell Atlantic's outsized Dollars 22bn bid for Tele-Communications Inc on Wednesday, suggests that the business community has finally grasped the significance of this fact. If you have a barrowful of questionable currency, the sage thing to do is swap it as quickly as possible for something real. While most of the recent share-based acquisitions and mergers rest on plausible industrial logic, it seems likely that Wall Street's sky-high price-earnings multiples eased the thought processes of the industrial logicians more than somewhat. Other bid announcements that preceded this elephantine telephone and cable television get-together include the contested battle for the film and publishing group, Paramount Communications; the KeyCorp and Society Corporation regional banking merger proposal; and pharmaceutical giant Merck's offer for the biggest US drugs distribution group, Medco. It can only be a matter of time before all this activity spawns a clutch of imitators in the UK. City merchant bankers' nostrils are already twitching at the scent of fees. Bull market euphoria has thus entered a new phase; and it is, in a sense, the natural outcome of an asset price boom built on economic growth that continues to run well below potential. What else are businessmen to do but engage in paper shuffling when the economic indicators tell such conflicting tales? While broad money remains stagnant in much of the Anglo-Saxon world, reflecting the weakness of the banking system and the flight of savings out of banks into the capital markets, the narrow money used for transaction purposes is expanding vigorously, leaving central bankers in a quandary. Urgent need Bonds and equities have been rising simultaneously, despite the fact that the attraction of fixed-interest bonds for many investors rests on a deflationary view of the world that would be bad for corporate profits and equities. Some equity investors are assuming increased risk for no better reason than that the return on cash is low. Their optimism about corporate earnings is less a matter of analysis that the by-product of their urgent need for income. One thing that would make partial sense of a simultaneous bull market in equities and bonds is a decline in real bond yields, after adjusting for inflation, as a result of a shift in the supply of savings relative to investment demand. Put another way, if nominal bond yields have been coming down faster than the economists have been shrinking their forecasts of inflation, the real cost of fixed interest capital will have been falling. Because figures for real yields have to be based on forecasts of future inflation, there is inevitably a lack of precision about the argument. But the London Bond Broking Company estimates, on the basis of perfectly plausible assumptions, that real yields are now lower in the US, Japan, Germany and the UK than in the period from 1981 to 1992. In the case of the UK alone, the movement of index-linked gilts over the past 15 months clearly indicates a marked fall in real yields. Strain in Europe This flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that took hold after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Then it was widely assumed that the reintegration of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union into the free world economy would place huge demands on the world's financial markets. The assumption was reinforced by changed perceptions about Latin American debt and the growing enthusiasm in Latin America and Asia for economic liberalism. Yet in the event the strain in the financial markets has been largely confined to Europe, where unification transformed Germany from a net creditor to a net debtor as resources were diverted into the east German economy. Even then, the financial pressures, which were exacerbated by the rigidity of the exchange rate mechanism, came not so much from the capital markets as from the operations of the Bundesbank on short-term interest rates - this at a time when the Group of Seven countries were running up large fiscal deficits. In short, the global savings shortage failed to emerge. But that is no cause for complacency. If the developed world has been able to accommodate these new requirements for capital, it is because the demands have been more subdued than expected and savings have been higher thanks to recession. That said, the jumbo deals that are now making headlines in the world's financial press are no cause for alarm precisely because they are being financed by equity. Taken together with the wave of public equity issues across the globe, this helps mitigate the damage wrought by the junk bond excesses of the 1980s. If there is damage in these mega-mergers, it will be industrial rather than financial. And it will take a long time before the shareholders fully grasp what has been done in their name.</p>

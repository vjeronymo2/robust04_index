			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHEER WAS CHORE THIS CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> On Christmas, 6-year-old Kenny Leonard wanted to sail to the Persian Gulf in a  boat, loaded with gifts for his father and a bomb for Iraqi president Saddam  Hussein.  </P> <P> After dropping the bomb on Hussein, Kenny said he planned to voyage home with  his dad, who shipped out to the Middle East four months ago.  </P> <P> "Well, that's better," sighed Barrie Leonard, Kenny's mother. "Last night, he  said he wanted to swim there."  </P> <P> For the Leonards and others separated from loved ones by the Middle East  conflict, this Christmas was subdued as they struggled to celebrate a holiday  that usually unites families. Arrington (Lenny) Leonard, a petty officer 2nd  class, shipped out to the Persian Gulf aboard the San Diego-based destroyer  tender Acadia. His departure was abrupt and plans for his return keep changing,  as the U.S. increases its efforts to support Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> "Christmas without Lenny is not quite the same, it doesn't seem the same," said  Barrie Leonard, 30. "But we are trying to make it the best we can."  </P> <P> Barrie Leonard intended to celebrate two Christmases -- one yesterday with her  two small sons and one in March when she hopes her husband will return from the  Persian Gulf. Then, she figures she will set up the artificial tree once again  in its corner in the small living room in Imperial Beach. She and Kenny will  decorate it again with their ornaments, including the hand-made ones and ones  she got yesterday as presents.  </P> <P> Since the couple decided to postpone Arrington Leonard's Christmas until spring  and strapped by a $300 telephone bill (a result of her husband's calls from  ports), Barrie Leonard sent no gifts. Barrie Leonard planned to send a care  package of items he had requested: powdered beverage Gatorade, wheat germ,  cookies, and a videotape of his family's Christmas.  </P> <P> On Christmas eve, with all the childrens' gifts wrapped, the stockings laid  out, the house cleaned, the tree decorated, Barrie Leonard finally sat down to  write her husband. The previous  </P> <P> Christmas eve, the couple had stayed up until 2 a.m. as Arrington Leonard, 35,  struggled to assemble a new scooter for Kenny. She wrote a brief letter and  dissolved into tears.  </P> <P>  Darling, 24 Dec. 90 2256 hours  </P> <P>  For you it's Christmas Day as I write, and for me it's still the magic of  Christmas Eve. All is ready for when they wake up . . . I miss you so badly now  and wish you were here with us. It just doesn't feel right for me -- not having  you near.  </P> <P>  It's been a long long day. Tomorrow is bound to start early.  </P> <P>  Merry Christmas my love!  </P> <P>  I love you always -- Barrie  </P> <P> </P> <P> When Barrie Leonard awoke on Christmas, there was scarcely time to add the big  news into her letter: six-month-old Johnathan had cut his first tooth. She  tried to videotape the new tooth, but Johnathan kept putting his thumb in his  mouth. By the time her husband sees his youngest son again, Johnathan will have  teeth and be walking, she mused.  </P> <P> In the ten years of their marriage, Arrington Leonard had deployed before. In  fact, he shipped out and missed Christmas two years ago. But this time, his  absence is far more poignant as tension continues to build in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Barrie Leonard reassures herself thinking that his ship, a vessel that repairs  war ships, would not be deployed in a combat area since it has little ability  to defend itself. She tries not to think of the dire possibilities of war. She  tries not to think of poison gas being used against American troops, whose  numbers reached 280,000 several days ago.  </P> <P> "I don't like to think about that," Barrie Leonard said. "Otherwise, I would be  depressed all the time, I'd be sad all the time."  </P> <P> Instead, Barrie Leonard likes to think of her husband's return. She figures  Kenny will spot him the first and run to greet him. Then Arrington Leonard will  find her, holding Johnathan in her arms. Reunited on the dock, the family will  have one of their "family hugs" where they huddle together while Kenny calls  out: "Kiss left, kiss right."  </P> <P> And on Christmas, she liked to think of her husband, who planned to go ashore  for a buffet in Dubai. Arrington Leonard called his wife twice on Christmas  morning. He sounded bright and cheery. To his wife, the only sad part was the  uncertainty of his return.  </P> <P> This was a very different Christmas. Last year, the couple had planned and  shopped together for the children's gifts. This year, Barrie Leonard shopped  with the kids along -- staging distractions as she placed key presents into her  girlfriend's shopping cart.  </P> <P> When the kids started tearing into their presents yesterday, Barrie Leonard had  to orchestrate the event, pulling out gifts from under the tree -- a task she  always shared with her husband.  </P> <P> Kenny was immediately smitten by his new collection of GI Joe dolls and their  battle station. He kept mispronouncing the name of one doll, named "Capt.  Grid-Iron." Instead, Kenny called the tiny figure "Capt. Grid-Iran."  </P> <P> Quickly, the GI Joe dolls were gathered to form an invading team headed for the  Persian Gulf. Kenny gave instructions to each doll. But he halted when he got  to the GI Joe that had "Navy" emblazoned across its chest.  </P> <P> "Don't you think this one looks just like my dad?" he asked.  </P></p>

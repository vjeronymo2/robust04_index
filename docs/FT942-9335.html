			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Caldera pressed to alter course The administration of Venezuela's President Rafael Caldera faces growing pressure to change its economic policies after a steep devaluation, predictions that inflation will surge to 60 per cent or more this year and violent student protests. The Caldera government began a five-year term in February rejecting the free-market policies of the previous administration, and offering 'a competitive economy with social justice'. Thus far, it has produced measures that attempt to find a middle ground between market economics and government control of the economy, placing greater stress on the latter. The two leading opposition parties, Democratic Action and the Christian Democrat party (Copei), have accused the government of incoherence in economic policy, allowing cabinet members to contradict one another in public and advancing a populist strategy. They have sought a return to market-oriented policies. Economic and political uncertainty over the last three weeks has sent the bolivar down 12.5 per cent against the dollar at the official exchange rate and by over 22 per cent on the parallel market. This has caused economists to raise their inflation projections for this year. One prominent Venezuelan economist, Mr Pedro Palma, predicted that inflation could reach 60 per cent or more in 1994, up from 46 per cent last year. The administration has also faced violent protests in Caracas and other cities after police shot and killed a high-school student during a protest on May 5.</p>

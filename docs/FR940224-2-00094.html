Panel meetings will be held March 14, April 11, May 4, and, tentatively, June 21. The March meeting will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Bethesda Marriott Hotel, 5151 Pooks Hill Road, Bethesda, Maryland. Logistical information about subsequent Panel meetings will be available from the contact office listed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until June 1993, Federal regulations governing research on human subjects (45 CFR part 46) required research involving  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vitro <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fertilization (IVF) to be reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB). Because of the absence of an EAB since 1980, Federal funding of IVF protocols was not possible. With the enactment of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43), the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals was nullified. As a result, IVF proposals, as well as research involving human embryos that result from IVF or other sources, may now be considered for Federal funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH has received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis. However, before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. Panel members will be asked to consider various areas of research involving the human embryo and provide advice as to those areas they view to be acceptable for Federal funding, areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will be asked to recommend specific guidelines for the review and conduct of this research. Issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview. The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A critical part of the process of considering these issues is to gain an understanding of the diversity of beliefs and opinions held about the moral status of the human embryo and about Federal funding of research involving the human embryo. The NIH is seeking public comment on Federal funding of human embryo research for consideration by the Panel and encourages interested individuals and organizations to share with the Panel their views and perspectives on this important topic. Those who wish to submit written comments of any length should forward these to Steven Muller, Ph.D., Chair, NIH Human Embryo Research Panel, c/o National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. To ensure that public input is available to the Panel during its deliberations, written comments should be received in advance of the Panel's fourth scheduled meeting, May 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each meeting of the Panel will also provide an opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to make brief oral presentations to the Panel. During the first Panel meeting, public commentary was heard in a two-hour session. To register to make an oral statement before the Panel, individuals and organizations should contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor at the NIH by telephoning 301&hyph;496&hyph;1454 or by sending a facsimile message to 301&hyph;402&hyph;0280 or 301&hyph;402&hyph;1759. Oral statements must not exceed five minutes in length, and a copy of the remarks should be forwarded to the above address one week in advance of the scheduled presentation date. Opportunities to present statements will be determined by the order in which requests are received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number. General questions about the Panel or future meetings should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ruth L.

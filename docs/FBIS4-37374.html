			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee issued a  report today listing its proposals and recommendations for the  National Dialogue General Congress. Specifying the national,  legitimate groups that President Husni Mubarak will invite to  attend the congress, the committee recommended inviting  representatives of the political parties, the People's Assembly  and Consultative Council, professional associations, the General  Labor Federation, specialized national councils, the  universities, university faculty clubs, the media, writers,  research centers, and scientific research institutes;  individuals who have won state prizes; women's and popular  societies; and people concerned with children's, youth, and  sports affairs.    The Preparatory Committee also recommended that  representatives of the following groups be invited: student  federations, local government councils, chambers of commerce,  industrial federations, banks, economists, agricultural  cooperatives, and people concerned with family planning and the  anti-illiteracy campaign.    It also recommended inviting a group of public figures and  cabinet members.    The Preparatory Committee recommended that every political  party be represented by four members, one of whom would be the  party leader.    Regarding the working method and the organization of the  National Dialogue General Congress, the Preparatory Committee  recommended that the congress should meet to approve the  committee's recommendations and then divide itself into three  main committees: the Political Committee, the Social and  Cultural Committee, and the Economic Committee. Every congress  member would choose the committee he would like to join. He  would list this as his first choice, and then another committee  as his second.    The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee recommended that  every political party should have the right to attend the  meetings of any of the three major committees. Every committee  would then elect a moderator who would organize the debates and  the committee's work.    The Preparatory Committee stated that the moderator of each  committee should have the right to summon any official to appear  before it in line with the committee's request.    The Preparatory Committee proposed that the National  Dialogue  General Congress should have an office staff consisting of its  Moderator General, appointed by President Husni Mubarak, the  elected moderators of the three committees, and three other  members to be selected by the president from among the leaders  and representatives of the political parties participating in  the congress. The office staff would oversee the activities of  the congress.    Concerning the issues that the congress will debate, the  Preparatory Committee decided that the Political Committee would  discuss the revision and amendment of the law pertaining to the  exercise of political rights, the fight against extremism and  terrorism, and the revision and amendment of the law organizing  the powers and responsibilities of the Socialist Prosecutor.    The Preparatory Committee recommended that bills under  discussion and the draft general budget should be submitted to  the Consultative Council prior to their discussion by the  People's Assembly. This would be in line with the recent  tendency to give legislative powers to the Consultative Council,  which would mean adopting a two-chamber system when discussing  and passing bills.    With regard to the economy, the Preparatory Committee  recommended that the National Dialogue General Congress debate  issues pertaining to continuing the economic reform process  toward the attainment of a market economy, while at the same  time specifying the state's role in this transformation.    The Preparatory Committee recommended the elimination of all  obstacles hindering economic development and investment. It  called for providing backing for cooperatives and encouraging  the citizens to participate in industrial and agricultural  economic development plans.    The Preparatory Committee's report stressed the importance  of  paying more attention to exports, regarding this as a strategic  objective. It urged combating deviant practices, economic  corruption, and the theft of public wealth. It recommended  greater backing for domestic industry and agriculture vis-a-vis  foreign competition.    The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee recommended that  the Social and Cultural Committee debate the future of education  in Egypt, the anti-illiteracy campaign, population affairs and  family planning, and human health.    The committee emphasized the need to confront violence,  fanaticism, and terrorism.    It called for developing rural areas and creating a balance  between them and urban areas.</p>

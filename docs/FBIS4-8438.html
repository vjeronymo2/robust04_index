			<p>BFN     [Text] Kozloduy, April 13 (BTA) -- Jean-Pierre Delcasso,  leader of a team of the World Association of Nuclear Operators  (WANO), described as very fruitful his work together with  operators of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant for the upgrading  of the nuclear and operational safety of the older generating  units. Mr. Delcasso called a news conference today at the end  of his one-year mandate as WANO team leader. The team has been  working here for two and a half years. It exercises technical  and management supervision and shares its experience with  Bulgarian operators. Summing up, Mr. Delcasso said Units One  and Two had been revamped and their safety upgraded. The WANO  team has helped sign an agreement between an engineering centre  in Lyons and Energoproekt of Bulgaria. Contacts have been  established between the Kozloduy Power Plant and Buget of  France, as well as between the National Electricity Company and  Electricite de France. In 1993 alone the latter provided 12  million French francs to the Kozloduy Plant and a further 8  million is to come.    Expressing WANO's position, Mr. Delcasso said the Kozloduy  Plant was good and safe, adding that much money would be needed  to keep it in that condition. He called on the Bulgarian  Government to provide finance for the power plant and to commit  itself to its future and to the future of nuclear power  engineering. In France, both the prime minister and the finance  minister bear direct, even legal, responsibility if they fail to  perform their duty concerning nuclear power plants, Mr. Delcasso  said. He presented the new team leader, Mr. Bernard Paillen,  until now director of a nuclear power plant in Normandy.    For his part Kozloduy chief Kozma Kuzmanov said: "The day  will come soon when we will have to shut down the plant for lack  of money needed for its safe operation." The plant got an  average of 200 million leva a month from the exchequer in 1993,  and a mere 180 million leva for the first quarter of this year,  despite the deterioration of financial indicators: the  strengthening of the dollar against the lev, a rise in inflation  and the introduction of VAT [value-added tax]. The Kozloduy  Plant is not ours, we are only employees here; it belongs to  Bulgaria, it is the dynamo of Bulgaria's economy, a national  asset, so that everybody should care for it, Mr. Kuzmanov told  the news conference.    He accused of demagoguery and terrorism "experts" who  expressed faked concern in the press saying that the plant posed  a danger. Kozloduy's operators and management bear the entire  responsibility for its safety and they come in for a great deal  of unfounded, tendentious and incompetent criticism. "We are  tired of explaining that this is a normal power plant like any  other power plant in the world. We have convinced the world of  this but it will take more effort to do so in Bulgaria," Deputy  Manager Ivan Ivanov said.</p>

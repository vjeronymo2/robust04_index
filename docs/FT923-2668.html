			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Heinz in Wattie Industries move HJ Heinz, the US foods group, has made an application with New Zealand's anti-trust Commerce Commission to take over Wattie Industries, the New Zealand food unit of Goodman Fielder Wattie, Reuter reports from Wellington. GFW, the biggest food company in Australasia, has said it planned to float Wattie on the New Zealand Stock Exchange later this year. 'Yes, Heinz has made an application to us for authorisation for a takeover under section 57 and that is being investigated,' a commission spokeswoman said last night. An application to the commission does not necessarily mean a company will make a bid for the company it is applying to take over.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   IFP Election Decision `Turning Point' in ANC-IFP  Relationship  -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 20 April in a page-18  editorial says Inkatha's decision to participate in the election  "means, at a minimum, a drastic diminution in the prospects of  kwaZulu/Natal's polling booths becoming a war zone. It means  having that super-thorny political question -- where does Zulu  support reside? -- at last answered in the only true way it  could ever be answered, with potentially immense implications  for understanding kwaZulu/Natal and thereby stabilising the  province. It means Inkatha brought into parliament, as opposed  to standing outside looking in aggrieved and dangerous." The  agreement also "contains at least the seeds of a lasting turning  point by which the ANC-IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] relationship  may grow away from brutal enmity into constitutional rivalry."  However, it is "all too easy to expect too much. We will not  all of a sudden find doves and peace songs in the bullet-split  air around, for instance, the Thokoza hostels." But THE STAR  believes a process has been started that may lead to "a steady  cooling of the conflicts, led by a downscaling of the slanging  matches from political leaders."    Peacekeeping Force in Townships `Major Mistake' -- A second  editorial on the same page declares that the decision to deploy  the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) in East Rand townships  "was a major mistake." "Within days of its taking over from the  SADF [South African Defense Force], Thokoza, Katlehong and  Vosloorus once again became killing fields." "The TEC  [Transitional Executive Council], which was responsible for the  establishment of the NPKF, must bear a heavy share of  responsibility. By pressing for the deployment of hastily  trained soldiers in an area notoriously difficult to police, the  TEC has exhibited classic symptoms of political conceit and  myopia."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   IFP Election Decision `Fairly Balanced' Deal -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 20 April in its page-6 editorial  believes the country owes Kenyan Professor Washington Okumu "a  great debt for pushing his way into a mediation process that  Henry Kissinger, Lord Carrington and five others had already  given up on." However, "no one should be naive enough to  believe what the agreement reached yesterday guarantees peace.  Angola provides a stark warning that an election does not mean  that all participants will abide by its results." BUSINESS DAY  says the election deal "provides only a framework for overcoming  constitutional differences. It does not resolve them. In the  end, Buthelezi blinked first. He had to. He did not abandon  (or perhaps he returned to) the realm of reason and strategic  thinking. He chose the better of two bad options." But "the  ANC too, has been forced to give ground, and for good reason.  While some of its leaders may have believed Buthelezi could be  vanquished by brute force and financial deprivation, others,  knowing well the classical theories of guerrilla warfare,  realised that the process would be debilitating and that success  was far from guaranteed." Although the ANC's concession is "not  as stark as those made by Buthelezi," the ANC had to agree "to  postelection mediation." The ANC has "effectively removed from  the ambit of the Constitutional Assembly that forum's powers in  the most crucial constitutional area--regionalism. This, after  all, was Inkatha's main objective in the first place. It looks  like a fairly balanced and therefore workable, deal."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   IFP Election Decision `Last-Minute Reprieve' -- Referring to  the IFP decision to participate in the April election,  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 20 April says in a page-8  editorial "the last-minute reprieve comes at a time when some  were squaring up for a civil war that would have brought untold  damage to this country and its people." "It has been a long  haul but our final word is to congratulate Mr de Klerk, Mr  Mandela and Dr Buthelezi."</p>

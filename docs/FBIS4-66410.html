On the afternoon of 25 October, the Japan Atomic Energy Research  Institute held its 21st Conference To Report Atomic Energy  Safety Research Results, and the majority of the five reports  and lectures were related to this issue. This implies a shift  away from the past, which dealt mainly with reactors. Here I  will introduce one bit of welcome news concerning the deep  underground disposal of high level waste.    In the report entitled "Movement of Radioactive Nuclides  Deep  Underground," Muneaki Aneo (Lab Director, Environmental Safety  Research Department) presented results of tests conducted at an  underground research facility in Canada's Manitoba Province in  1987.    Recently the amount of water in downtown Tokyo leaking from  rusted (oxidized) water pipes has grown too great to be ignored,  but the environment deep underground, which is nearly oxygen  free, is quite different. The image held by most of the general  populace is that high level waste buried deep underground will  come back via our underground water supplies in the not too  distant future. This is the idea behind the movement protesting  the plan by PNC's Storage Engineering Center for a site at the  town of Horonobe in Hokkaido. However, the environment deep  underground is completely different from that of the ground near  the surface that is producing such a ridiculous amount of  leakage in downtown Tokyo.    In the tests JAERI conducted at a facility 240 meters below  the surface in Canada, the underground water that flows through  this layer (a fissure zone) was drawn into a large, sealed steel  box via a pipe. Inside this box were large diameter pipes packed  with various types of rock from that layer and arranged so the  underground water would flow through them. Several types of  radioactive substances were introduced via the inlet pipe, and  the distance of their movement through the rock-filled pipes was  carefully studied. The results of these experiments are as  follows:        -  Roughly 90 percent of the radioactive substances  introduced into the underground water were absorbed by the rock;    -  The greater the ratio of iron and biotite in the rocks, the  greater the absorption of radioactive substances; and    -  Most  significant, among the various types of radioactive substances,  the "lighter" the nuclides were, the faster they moved through  the rock, and the movement of "heavier" nuclides such as  neptunium, plutonium, americium, etc., which are found in high  level wastes, was much, much slower (for example, iodine moves  110 times as fast as americium).       This fact is important because water 200 or 300 meters  underground flows only a few meters a year. Because it flows so  much slower than water near the surface, it is no exaggeration  to say that movement of radioactivity from high level waste  through the layers of rock in underground water occurs in  ultra-slow motion.    We must remember that the purpose of these tests by JAERI  was  to focus only on the relationship between the bedrock (a natural  barrier) in which the high level waste will be buried and the  movement of radioactivity that has leached into the underground  water. We should not forget that the high level waste will be  surrounded by a triple wall (artificial barriers) consisting of  (1) vitrification, (2) a metal protective container, and (3) a  buffer material (a type of clay) between the protective  container and the bedrock that will be nearly impermeable to  underground water. Through many years of testing and research  PNC has obtained a perspective on sealing in radioactivity for  more than a thousand years, and this research by JAERI further  supports the geological disposal of high level waste.</p>

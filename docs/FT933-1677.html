			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Dollar slips as markets calmer THE dollar yesterday lost much of the ground it had won against the D-Mark in the immediate aftermath of the Russian crisis as dealers took the view that events in Moscow would not unsettle western nations or financial markets. Shortly after President Yeltsin's announcement that he would be suspending parliament, there had been a frantic round of dollar buying as dealers viewed the US currency as a 'safe haven'. But yesterday, the dollar lost much of the ground it had made up, as dealers were encouraged by signs that the crisis in Moscow was not spilling onto the streets. After peaking at DM1.6475 on Tuesday night, the dollar slipped back to close in London yesterday at DM1.6285. Bond markets remained calm for most of the day, as dealers also took the view that President Yeltsin was winning the power battle in Moscow. However, there was a frantic round of selling late in Europe by intra day traders who were seeking to take profits. Trading in fixed-income markets is expected to remain choppy in the next few days and investors may yet decide to shift some funds out of Europe if the Russian crisis shows no signs of being resolved. Gold trading was also a good deal calmer after a wild response to the Russian news on Tuesday evening. The price of gold closed at around Dollars 353.95 an ounce.</p>

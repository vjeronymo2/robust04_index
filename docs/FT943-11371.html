			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw buys more dealerships for Pounds 5.7m Evans Halshaw, the motor distributor, is expanding further from its West Midlands base with the acquisition for Pounds 5.7m of GT Cars Group, a private company with seven dealerships in the east Midlands and South Yorkshire. The purchase, foreshadowed in June when Evans Halshaw launched a Pounds 29m rights issue, completes an acquisitions programme which, in the last year, has more than doubled its number of dealerships to 90. 'We need to spend the next 12 to 18 months consolidating what we've got,' said Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman. Consideration for GT is Pounds 750,000 in cash, Pounds 2.7m in loan notes and the issue of 495,050 new shares at 454 1/2 p each, a premium of 11 1/2 p on yesterday's closing share price. In a separate transaction, Evans Halshaw is paying Pounds 1m in loan notes for the freehold of three sites which GT holds under lease. In the 1993 year, GT reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 662,000 on turnover of Pounds 41.2m.</p>

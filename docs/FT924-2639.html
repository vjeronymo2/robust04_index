			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Pilkington There is no doubt that Pilkington is still suffering from the nasty volume swings that periodically disfigure its industry, as yesterday's 70 per cent fall in interim profits grimly testifies. Yet the exasperating aspect of Pilkington's recent history lies in its unhappy ability to exacerbate its plight. There is no evidence from yesterday's statement that the arrival of Mr Roger Leverton has yet made much difference. By strolling into the downturn with excessive borrowings, costs and capacity, Pilkington only deepened its cyclical downswing. By cutting capital expenditure and sacrificing the Sola spectacles business in its desperate determination to hold the dividend, Mr Leverton is in danger of dulling the coming upturn. Even assuming Pilkington receives Pounds 200m for Sola, the sale is likely to be dilutive and the money will make only a small dent in likely year-end borrowings of Pounds 800m as Pilkington continues to bleed cash. Dealing with that problem should have required a much more rigorous rationalisation. Instead Pilkington seems intent on decorating the Christmas tree while the roof needs repair. In time, the huge operational gearing of the business should mean that profits surge when recovery arrives, although overcapacity may complicate the sums. The benign effects of devaluation and Pilkington's severe squeeze on working capital may yet buy the company time to save its face. However if there is no improvement by next June, Pilkington's decision to maintain its dividend will leave it looking pretty reckless.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Guarantee expected on BR pensions THE GOVERNMENT is expected to announce later today a solvency guarantee for British Rail's pension scheme to insure payment of full pensions following privatisation even if the scheme's investment income falls sharply. The scheme's trustees spent yesterday with ministers hammering out a compromise which would allow trustees to support a restructuring of the scheme following privatisation. The trustees, who include representatives of BR management and employees, had warned that without the solvency guarantees, future pensions could be at risk. They argued that their legal duty as trustees forbade them to approve scheme changes which would leave members worse off than they had been. The extent of the guarantees and how they will be applied is to be announced in a joint statement from the government and the BR pension scheme board of trustees. The trustees' case for guarantees was believed to have been strengthened by news that the actuarial valuation due to be completed in October will show the Pounds 1bn surplus of three years ago to have fallen by two-thirds. The government has retreated successively from its hard-line stance on post-privatisation plans for the BR scheme. It had first proposed seizing a portion of the scheme's Pounds 8.5bn assets and promising in return to guarantee an annual increase for all pensions in line with inflation. Instead, the government has said it would use the assets to create an ongoing scheme for all current members who remain employed in the rail industry. A portion of the assets will be hived off to create a separate scheme for current and deferred pensioners - now roughly 150,000.</p>

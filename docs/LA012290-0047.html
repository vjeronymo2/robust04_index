			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEY REFORMER QUITS EAST GERMAN COMMUNIST PARTY;  </P> <P> EAST EUROPE: THE DRESDEN MAYOR'S RESIGNATION DEALS THE STRUGGLING ORGANIZATION  ANOTHER BLOW.  </P> <P> The reeling East German Communist Party received another sharp blow late Sunday  with the resignation of one of its brightest reformist stars.  </P> <P> The 46-year-old mayor of Dresden, Wolfgang Berghofer, announced he is leaving  the party along with 39 other senior party members from the southern part of  the country. The group demanded that the party disband.  </P> <P> Berghofer's resignation had been rumored ahead of time, but it still came as a  severe setback to the Communists, who are struggling to regain credibility with  East German voters in preparation for the country's first free elections,  scheduled for May 6.  </P> <P> Some analysts predicted that Berghofer's defection will result in the collapse  and dissolution of the party before the election takes place. The Dresden mayor  was generally considered the party's No. 3 in terms of popularity.  </P> <P> Berghofer's announcement came Sunday evening, on the heels of an earlier action  at an emergency party congress, expelling former leader Egon Krenz from  membership. Krenz, the man who opened the Berlin Wall in early November, had  taken over as head of East Germany's government in October, replacing the  toppled Erich Honecker. Honecker was expelled from the party in December, the  same month that Krenz quit as party chairman.  </P> <P> The emergency congress also threw out of the party 13 other members of the old  ruling Politburo, including Guenter Schabowski, a reputed reformer, and former  Defense Minister Heinz Kessler.  </P> <P> But at the end of a long weekend meeting, the congress continued to resist  pressure that the party disband.  </P> <P> Krenz appealed his expulsion, arguing that he had saved the party from  disintegration by opening the Berlin Wall and undertaking other liberalizing  reforms. His appeal made him the first former top leader to fight back  publicly. A number of other former top party people were expelled last month,  and nine are in prison on charges of corruption.  </P> <P> Senior party members who joined Berghofer in quitting issued a sharply critical  statement Sunday, declaring that the Communist Party had "ruined the country  and should be dissolved." They also called for reunification with West Germany,  a market economy, and the cleanup of a heavily polluted environment.  </P> <P> As the emergency meeting got under way here Saturday, a motion by some members  to disband the party was overruled by a secret vote with the support of new  party leader Gregor Gysi, who himself was catapulted into the top position as a  reformist-minded dissident lawyer.  </P> <P> Among the defectors who joined Berghofer in leaving the discredited party  Sunday was Friedrich Wokurka, who heads the state-owned Robotron company, East  Germany's largest electronics firm.  </P> <P> Most political observers believe that Berghofer will join the newly created  Social Democratic Party, a sister to the West German party of the same name.  The West German Social Democrats form the main opposition to the ruling  coalition, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.  </P> <P> Berghofer did not announce his future plans Sunday, but if he should move over  to the Social Democrats as expected, it could give the new party a significant  edge in the coming election, according to political specialists.  </P></p>

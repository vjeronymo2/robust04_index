			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: New premium business falls at CU and L&amp;G TWO INSURANCE companies, Commercial Union and Legal &amp; General, have announced falls in new UK annual premium business for 1992. CU saw a 2 per cent drop in UK regular premium business to Pounds 56.3m, while L&amp;G suffered a 16 per cent fall from Pounds 170m to Pounds 143m. On worldwide annual premiums, CU rose 9 per cent to Pounds 180m, thanks to sharp increases in the US, Canada and continental Europe outside the Netherlands; L&amp;G fell 12 per cent to Pounds 196m. In both cases, the lingering UK recession, which deters consumers from taking out long-term commitments, was held responsible. Both companies registered a rise in overall new business following increases in single premiums. CU's new single premiums in the UK more than tripled to Pounds 426m, helped by Pounds 300.5m sales of the with-profits bond which was launched during the year. Worldwide single premiums grew 55 per cent to Pounds 1.05bn. L&amp;G's worldwide single premiums increased from Pounds 535m to Pounds 693m, if irregular bulk pension transfers are excluded. Its UK managed and segregated fund business saw new monies rise from Pounds 854m to Pounds 2.23bn, thanks to heavy sales of its indexed funds.</p>

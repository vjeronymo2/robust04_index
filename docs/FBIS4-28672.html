			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK Will Immediately Withdraw From IAEA and Regard UN </F> `Sanctions' as Declaration of War, DPRK Foreign Ministry  Spokesman" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement today:    The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] recently committed an act of gravely encroaching upon the  dignity and sovereignty of our Republic by following the United  States' policy of stifling the DPRK.    The Board of Governors' meeting of the IAEA on June 10  demanded opening of our military sites on the pretext of the  nuclear issue and adopted an extremely unreasonable "resolution"  on the "suspension of the agency's assistance" to our country.    This is obviously the agency's "sanctions" against us and,  in  essence, a prelude to UN "sanctions".    With the adoption of the "resolution" the plot of the United  States and some quarters of the agency's Secretariat to isolate  and stifle our Republic on the pretext of "a solution to the  nuclear issue" has at last entered into a reckless stage of  practice.    As is known, we have made every possible well-intentioned  effort to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities even  in our unique status.    However, as we have accepted more inspections by the agency,  pressure on us has increased and things have got all the more  complicated, and the security and sovereignty of our Republic  now are exposed to threat hourly.    Some quarters of the agency's Secretariat have escalated  their moves to stifle our Republic, ignoring all our good  intentions and leniency, and finally brought the situation to  such an extent where they took "sanctions" this time.    In this the United States and the IAEA Secretariat openly  revealed their attempt to encroach upon our sovereignty and  stifle us by using the leverage of inspection.    The conclusion at which we have arrived today when some  quarters of the agency's Secretariat have chosen an undisguised  exercise of strong arm is that pressure on us increases and our  peaceful nuclear activities hit a bigger snag while we are bound  to the unfair framework of the agency.    Ours is not the sort of people who reconcile themselves to  humiliation even with their national sovereignty and dignity  violated.    That the Secretariat of the agency tried to impose its total  inspection on us by threatening us with "sanctions" is an  intolerable insult to our people who regard independence as what  keeps them alive.    When pressure and "sanctions" are imposed on us, our will  grows stronger and our peaceful nuclear activities become all  the more free.    In face of the folly of the IAEA which has taken  unreasonable  "sanctions" against us and, moreover, is attempting to intrude  even into our military sites, the DPRK Foreign Ministry has been  authorized to declare as follows:    Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA.    We will consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions"  adopted by the agency with regard to our issue up until now and  will not be bound to any rules or resolutions of the agency  hereafter.    Without the agency we can develop our independent nuclear  power industry and expand international cooperation in the realm  of nuclear activities.    Secondly, we declare that the inspections for the continuity  of safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will  no longer be allowed.    Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed till it has  been decided whether we return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty or completely withdraw from it.    Hence, the agency's inspectors now will have nothing to do  any further in our country.    Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that UN  "sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war.    "Sanctions" and dialogue are incompatible. It is our  inevitable option to counter expanded "sanctions" by hostile  forces with expanded self-defence measures.    This stand of ours will never change until our nuclear issue  has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation.    We will keenly watch the development of the situation in the  days ahead.</p>

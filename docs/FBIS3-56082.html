The step earned sizable support from the rightist opposition  but was sharply criticized by some members of the ruling  majority. Kestutis Jaskelevicius, chairman of the parliament's  Budget and Finance Committee, ironically remarked that the next  step would be to impose a ban on short skirts.    A special commission of the Lithuanian Finance Ministry said  the move would eliminate possibilities to root out illegal  casinos by applying economic methods and to get additional  budget receipts.    A similar view was expressed by Finance Minister Eduardas  Vilkelis.    The parliament ignored the commission's arguments because  "believers pray for such a decision." The law will come into  effect if it is signed by the president.    The regulations of establishing casinos and gambling rules  were approved by the Lithuanian government only a half year ago.</p>

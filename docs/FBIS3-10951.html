The purpose of this committee is to analyze the current  situation and come up with proposals for a way out of the  crisis. The committee includes the following: Jacques  Saint-Louis, former deputy under President Leslie Francois  Manigat; Emmanuel Menard; and Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the  Mobilization for National Development.    Those who participated agree that it is imperative that a  harmonious way out of the crisis be found, based on the dominant  theme of national reconciliation. To that end, a committee  called the Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization was  elected, including Professor Gregoire Eugene, leader of the  Haitian Social Christian Party; Joseph Willio Noailles; Jacques  Saint-Louis; Max Antoine, Jr.; Gabriel Augustin, leader of the  Assembly of Democrats for the Republic; Jean-Auguste Bellerice;  Dieudonne Laroche; Cyprien Cicier; and Daniel Narcisse, leader  of the Federated Party of the Liaison of Democratic Forces.    This committee will be in charge of coordinating with the  various political parties, organizations, and authorities,  working both in Haiti and abroad, steps aimed at mobilizing the  vital forces of the nation and reviving in Haitians a sense of  duty toward the common homeland. The goal of this initiative is  concerted action in the broadest sense, for a lasting solution  to the crisis. The Initiatives Committee, which sponsored this  meeting, makes a point of thanking those who participated in it  and congratulating members elected to the head of this  committee, wishing them productive work.    This was signed by Jacques Saint-Louis of the Initiatives  Committee.</p>

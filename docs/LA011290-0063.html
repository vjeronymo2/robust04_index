			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Looking at Darren Waterston's atmospheric, virtually colorless landscape  paintings is a bit like imagining familiar objects in knotholes. Silhouettes of  waterfalls, mountains, trees and ghostly wanderers are conjured up through the  alchemy of wood grain, thin washes of black and pale yellow oil paint, touches  of graphite and veils of wax. The stately images sometimes seem calculated to  evoke the ink paintings of Chinese masters -- particularly in the long, thin  scroll-like formats of two "Scenes from Purgatory and Paradise." Several works  have a darkly romantic, brooding quality created with liquid shapes and blurry  points of light.  </P> <P> A rather fey 18th-Century air permeates "Portrait of a Plague" in which a  transparent, all-white, elegantly attenuated male figure stands on tiptoe with  his palms out and his face a mask of fear. In a trio of small, wonderfully  resonant "Myth" paintings, blurry lights and elusive figures hint at major  themes in the realms of politics, religion and magic. Deftly slipping in and  out of memories of historical periods of time with the most sparing of illusory  means, Waterston is already sui generis -- pretty impressive for an artist  still in his mid-20s.  </P> <P> Alison Saar's small folk art-style figures have the matter-of-factness of back  fence gossip and the prideful toughness of lives that have endured stormy  weather. Pieced together with bits of tin, chips of china and the sort of odds  and ends you'd find in an old sewing basket, these wall pieces celebrate folks  like "Jesus Jones" -- a guy with a halo and stigmata on both hands, who also  holds a cigarette and has a transistor radio stuck in his rolled-up shirt.  </P> <P> "Blue Plate Special" is a humorous way of describing Salome (with a rusted  metal nude body and bright-red lips and nipples) carrying the head of John the  Baptist on a plate. Saar's approach is like vernacular religion. Pieces with no  apparent religious references usually suffer in comparison. But in "Chilley  Willie," the image of a washboard musician -- made with a real washboard and a  row of thimbles -- she translates the funky appeal of the music-making right  into the heart of the work.

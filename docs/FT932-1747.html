			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca active Both classes of Zeneca shares eased 4 to 618p, with activity concentrated in the 'old' stock, where turnover reached 3.9m. The Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, at 600p a share, closed yesterday and the easier trend in the stock price was attributed to expectations that any stock not taken up by holders will be placed in the market by the brokers to the issue. Fisons, on the other hand, extended the recent outstanding performance, with the shares closing a net 5 1/2 up at 177p after heavy turnover of 8.2m. Specialists attributed the spectacular outperformance of the stock - up from a low of 147p only a couple of weeks ago - to the recent approval of Tilade by the US authorities. Amersham jumped to 775p xd after the US Food and Drug Administration approved the company's Metastron drug.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Yeltsin offers upbeat message at US summit: Tension eases over Bosnian arms embargo Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin opened their fifth summit in 18 months yesterday with mutual proclamations that US-Russian relations had never been better. Mr Clinton told a large audience on the sunny south lawns of the White House that the two countries were now partners not adversaries, adding, 'where we do disagree, we can discuss our differences in a climate of warm peace, not cold war'. Mr Yeltsin was equally upbeat, saying it was 'all the more exciting for the two countries to join hands'. Perhaps with an eye on his nationalist opponents at home who have attacked his co-operation with the US, he described the US as 'a strong partner and not an easy one to deal with - just like Russia'. One potential source of disagreement - not only with Russia but also with Britain and France - was eased when Mr Clinton confirmed that the Bosnian government had agreed to a delay of four to six months in the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo against former Yugoslavia. Bosnian president Alia Izetbegovic told the UN general assembly yesterday that Bosnia wanted the continued presence over the winter of the UN peacekeeping force, largely made up of British and French troops. Their withdrawal would probably have followed the end of the embargo. Mr Clinton had been under orders from Congress to seek a lifting of the arms ban, unilaterally if necessary, by October 15 if the Bosnian Serbs refused to sign the peace plan drawn up by the western contact group, which includes Russia. Mr Yeltsin said his reaction would be 'negative, of course' to any move to rearm the Bosnians, but Mr Clinton was able to say that the question was now 'largely academic'. The first of the Russian president's two days of talks centred on foreign and security policy issues. The initial session with Mr Clinton lasted throughout the morning rather than the planned 30 minutes, with Mr Yeltsin reporting 'some pluses and some minuses'. Mr Yeltsin then said at a State Department lunch: 'We do have to take account of the special interests of our two states.' This was an apparent reference to US reservations about Russian intervention in Nagorno-Karabakh which featured prominently in the morning round. A senior US official acknowledged later that Russia did have legitimate interests in the enclave, but he added: 'So do the Armenians and the Azeris.' Although Mr Yeltsin signed an assortment of trade and investment agreements, worth over Dollars 1bn (Pounds 630m) in the afternoon, today's talks will be devoted principally to economic issues. Mr Yeltsin can expect pressure from the US to quicken the pace of economic reform. The US has gone to some lengths to create the right mood for this summit. For the first time, Mr Yeltsin was staying at Blair House, the official guest house, rather than the Russian Embassy. Yesterday afternoon a White House ceremony honoured servicemen from both countries killed in the last war, some recompense, in US eyes, for the exclusion of Russia from the D-Day celebrations last June.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds after sharp early decline Wall Street US stocks, led by cyclical and pharmaceutical issues, rebounded yesterday even though bonds were stubbornly anchored in negative territory, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.33 better at 3,701.02, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.11 higher at 453.02 in brisk trading. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.29 ahead to 440.20, but the Nasdaq composite gained 6.84 to 740.68. A downward drift in share prices at the opening accelerated into a full-scale retreat soon after the National Association of Purchasing Management released its April survey at 10am. A more bullish market may have interpreted the data as the best of both worlds, as it indicated the economy had grown at a better-than-expected pace last month, while price increases moderated. The overall index of business activity came in at 57.7, against a March reading of 56.7. The prices-paid component slipped to 63.2, from 64.2 the previous month. In the event, stocks chose to focus on the US Treasury market, a path which led to solid losses by mid-morning. With sentiment weighed down by a host of unfavourable technical factors and an overriding uneasiness over monetary policy, bonds were showing moderate losses over the entire session. Still, share prices managed to battle back to near their opening levels by midday, and powered solidly ahead late in the afternoon. In the end, investors apparently decided to take the good economic news at face value, bidding up the share prices of companies expected to benefit from healthy growth. Alcoa jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 70 1/2 , DuPont gained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 1/2 and Ford climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 60 7/8 . The pharmaceuticals sector was in play following news that Roche, the Swiss drugs group, had made an agreed Dollars 5.3bn takeover bid for Syntex. The offer, which valued Syntex shares at Dollars 24 each, propelled the stock Dollars 8 3/8 higher to Dollars 23 1/2 . Elsewhere, Upjohn gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 amid speculation that its weak new-product development program would make it the sector's next target. Buying spilled over into Merck's stock, pushing it up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 31 1/8 and contributing to the Dow industrial index's rally. Warner Lambert jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 69 1/2 and Pfizer Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 . On the Nasdaq, Wellfleet climbed Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 77 5/8 and Cisco Dollars 2 3/16 to 32 1/2. Microsoft added Dollars 3 to Dollars 95 1/2 after announcing a development pact with Texas Instruments.</p>

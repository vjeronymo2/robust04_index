			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / International Bonds: Cracks show in fragile consensus over new issuance THE FRAGILE consensus among Eurobond firms on the conduct of new issue business, which has looked strained for months, last week deteriorated further. The cause of disagreement was an Ecu400m 12-year issue by the European Investment Bank, lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets under a pricing and fee structure which many firms deplored. Many leading new issue houses declined to participate in the transaction. However, behind the acrimony lies a change in the economics of the market. The common front among leading firms has been deteriorating since new issue activity started to boom last year. Big firms have became more adventurous, hungry for a larger slice of the market and prepared to take risks to match. The EIB issue was controversial partly because it offered participants, including the lead manager, only a very slim return for underwriting. Deutsche Bank underwrote most of the transaction and said it had substantial lead orders for the bonds. Underwriting risk was very small and remuneration was correspondingly slight, it argued. The deal was not the first to offer underwriting fees lower than the norm established in the dark days of the late 1980s. A striking feature of the primary Eurobond market this year is an increasing number of 'block trades,' deals wholly underwritten by a single firm at a reduced rate. Last week, Abbey National raised Pounds 250m over five years from an issue wholly underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The fees were undisclosed but were probably well below the established level. Merrill Lynch was the sole underwriter for a ADollars 150m 15-year deal for the State Electricity Corporation of Victoria. Again, fees were undisclosed. The last few issues by the EIB have also been handled as block trades by firms willing to take on the majority of the underwriting risk for a marginal return. Moreover, there is an underlying trend for lead managers to take a larger proportion of new issues which are, on the surface, sold through a wide syndicate of firms. Block trades are a natural extension of this. 'The new issue business is no longer about following secondary market trends and pumping out bonds indiscriminately. Firms need to concentrate on real investor flows, lining up lead orders for a deal,' commented a new issue manager. The EIB and Deutsche Bank also declined to use 'fixed price' syndication techniques which have been established in the Eurobond market since 1989 and are widely credited with restoring order and profitability to the primary market. Instead, the deal was structured as an 'old style' deal, using syndication practices which many firms hoped never to see again. Under an old style deal, underwriters buy the bonds from the issuer at a discount but are free to sell at any price. The EIB bonds carried an issue price of 100.66, but were owned by the underwriters at 98.535. In theory, the underwriters can sell the bonds at any level up to the issue price, at which point they earn 'full fees' - in this case a handsome 2.125 per cent of the amount raised. In practice, the bonds usually trade down to the price at which the underwriters own the deal, as syndicate members compete to off-load paper into the market. At this level the underwriters earn no fees. The EIB issue was quoted by the lead manager at a discount equivalent to full fees as soon as it was launched. In a 'new style' fixed priced syndication, underwriters buy bonds from the issuer at a discount as before, but must sell the paper at a level prescribed by the lead manager during the initial stages of the deal. There is no pretence that underwriters will earn fees as high as 2.125 per cent. If all the bonds are sold to investors at the fixed price, underwriters might expect to earn 0.30 to 0.35 per cent from an issue similar to the EIB deal. However, by holding the bonds at a fixed price until the majority of bonds are in the firm hands of investors, this margin should be secured. Badly priced issues will still drop in price once they are allowed to find a 'free-market' level. But proponents of the fixed price system argue that it brings much-needed order and discipline to the primary market, protecting the return paid to underwriters and, therefore, the long-term health of the primary market. Hence Deutsche Bank aroused the ire of its peers not only for underwriting bonds in return for slender fees, but also for reverting to syndication techniques which - if copied by other borrowers - many fear would erode the profitability of all market participants. If current trends continue, however, such fears will be overtaken by events. The bigger new issue houses appear to be moving away from syndicated deals altogether for all but the largest transactions. Those firms with a capital base large enough to absorb underwriting risk look increasingly determined to use this 'critical mass' to win new issue business alone.</p>

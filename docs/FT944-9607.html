			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greenpeace: a changing role, but not out of a job Sir, In her long article, 'Campaigners all at sea' (November 12/13), Bronwen Maddox says Greenpeace has 'campaigned itself out of a job', because it has achieved 'extraordinary success in changing the relationship between advanced industrial societies and the natural world'. Sadly, we have to disagree. The 'success' has been mainly confined to the establishment of political conventions and increased understanding - attitudes have changed but activities mostly have not. For the media the global environmental crisis has perhaps been eclipsed by the 'environmental revolution' in the attitude of politicians and industrial public relations but this is change in appearances, not substance. Maddox cites the London convention on radioactive waste dumping, but Sellafield still pumps waste out to sea from land. Toxic waste dumping at sea has been banned. Yet waste is still legally discharged from land, dumped on land or incinerated. And, as she says, 150 countries acknowledged global warming at the Rio Earth Summit yet carbon dioxide emissions are still set to rise. There is no international treaty to protect forests, even on paper: we are taking direct action to stop the Brazilian mahogany trade. The Montreal Protocol on protection of the ozone layer was incapable of forcing industry to adopt technologies that did not use ozone destroying or global warming gases. This led Greenpeace to intervene in the market with 'greenfreeze' refrigeration, instead of continuing to rely on the media and government instruments to deliver change. Maddox fairly describes some of the problems faced by environmental organisations in a more environmentally-aware world: we must change role from mainly identifying problems to delivering change. But our task is to stop destruction, not just to draw attention to its most visible forms. Chris Rose, campaign programme director, Greenpeace UK, Canonbury Villas, London N1 2PN</p>

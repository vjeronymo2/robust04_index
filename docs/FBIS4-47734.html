			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Although the Liberian Transitional Council is  standing in place, and a slow process of demobilizing the  warring factions is now under way, the problems for Liberia are  far from over. For weeks now, bitter fighting has been going on  between factions within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia], and today, there are further reports of  fresh fighting between Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces and  Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn fighters on the road to ULIMO  headquarters at Tubmanburg. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison  telexed this report:    The fighting intensified there along the Clay-Tubmanburg  Highway. Villagers fleeing the war zone said that both Krahns  and Mandingos are targeting elements of the Gola and Vai ethnic  groups, the original inhabitants of Bomi County. We are not  part of their war, but we are the ones dying innocently, said  Francis Ramsoa, a Gola. The situation has caused a further  movement of villagers into displaced camps in the Po River  community, 20 km northwest of Monrovia. They said fighters on  the two opposing sides were breaking down doors and windows and  burning down houses of civilians suspected of supporting either  side. According to the villagers, hundreds of others, mostly  old people, were left behind in the frenzy to flee. I don't  know what has happened to my father. He could not run and the  bullets were sounding closer. So, I ran, leaving him behind,  (Wusu Williams) explained, sobbing in tears. She said fighters  of both sides had instituted forced conscription and were  compelling villagers to carry looted items on their heads. If  you refuse, you are shot at on the spot, she added. Aid workers  said about 150 panic-stricken villagers arrived on Saturday [30  April] alone in (Kamara) village which is already swarming with  2,000 refugees, mainly women, children, and the elderly.  Reports from several sources in the capital said further  clashes were continuing between the two sides to control the  ambushed village, a town 30 miles northwest of Monrovia.    The field commander of Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces,  Mohamed Duguya, in a statement on Saturday, ordered all  civilians to leave the area and called for the withdrawal of  African peacekeeping troops deployed in the area.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Foreningsbanken reduces losses A near 50 per cent fall in loan losses helped Forenings-banken, the Swedish commercial bank, cut operating losses in the first half to SKr60m (Dollars 8m) from SKr1.1bn in the same period last year. However, the bank warned that a hoped-for return to profits in the full year could be delayed by a slower than expected upturn in the economy caused by a recent rise in interest rates. The caution echoed a similar warning this week from Swedbank, another leading Swedish bank, which downgraded its underlying profits forecast for the full year. Foreningsbanken, which like the rest of the country's banks has been hit by a spate of bad loans over the past three years, said loan losses in the first half fell 46 per cent to SKr1.19bn from SKr2.2bn last time. Net problem loans, after provisions of SKr3.23bn, were SKr6.92bn at the end of June, down from SKr9.38bn at the same stage a year ago. Net non-performing loans still accounted for 7.5 per cent of the total lending portfolio. In common with the other banks, Foreningsbanken suffered sharp falls in interest income and other operating income due to lower lending volumes, shrinking interest margins and losses on bond trading. Net interest income was down 5 per cent to SKr1.76bn from SKr1.85bn, while other operating income was down 25 per cent to SKr338m from SKr448m. Profits before loan losses rose to SKr1.13bn from SKr1.09bn.</p>

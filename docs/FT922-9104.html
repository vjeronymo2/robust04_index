			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Coffee and cocoa at fresh lows THE SEEMINGLY inexorable slide in coffee prices remained the outstanding feature of the commodities market this week. With technical chart signals still pointing downwards, fundamentals bearish and further heavy producer sales expected it was no surprise to see London Futures and Options Exchange coffee values fall to fresh 22-year lows. In New York, where the arabica variety grown chiefly in Latin America is traded, the market steadied towards the end of the week on news that Brazilian exporters will seek emergency measures to boost prices at a meeting with their government next Monday; there was also talk of Colombia taking a hand in action to stabilise prices. But that factor had little impact on the contract in, mainly African, robusta coffee that is traded in London. A Dollars 17 fall yesterday left the July robusta futures price at Dollars 676 a tonne, down Dollars 52 on the week and Dollars 320 since the begining of this year. Stocks of coffee held in importing countries have reached 19m bags (60 kg each), about twice the required level, according to Mr Peter Kettle, analyst with ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. Against this background, 'producers have to sell for what they can get,' commented Mr Lawrence Eagles, analysts with London futures broker GNI. The same situation applies at present in the cocoa market. Consumers, already well covered and aware that a rally of any size would be likely to prompt heavy producer selling, are in no rush to buy. So modest producer selling this week from the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, and Ghana was enough to send prices to fresh 16 1/2 -year lows. The London market's July futures position touched Pounds 557 a tonne yesterday, before closing at Pounds 565 a tonne, down Pounds 24 on the week. At the London Metal Exchange the technical tightness that has been distorting the price structure of the zinc market for some time at last showed signs of easing, but not before it had driven the backwardation (cash premium) against three months metal to Dollars 106 a tonne. In normal circumstances forward metal would be at a premium to cash, reflecting the cost of holding physical metal - principally warehousing charges, insurance and lost interest on capital employed. The reversal of that price relationship is associated with inadequate availability of metal for immediate delivery, but with LME warehouse stocks of zinc standing at a record level - they rose this week by 1,000 tonnes to 245,775 tonnes - the apparent shortage has inevitably aroused suspicions of market manipulation. As nervousness about the threatened supply squeeze faded the cash price became vulnerable to the bearish fundamental and technical considerations that had begun to depress the three months price last week. Falls over the past three days cut the price by Dollars 38 a tonne and narrowed its premium over three months metal to Dollars 82 a tonne. Cash zinc closed yesterday at Dollars 1,349.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22 on the week, while the three months price was at Dollars 1,267.50 a tonne, down Dollars 25. The LME's strongest market was tin, where prices reached the highest levels for 13 months. Yesterday's announcement of a 105-tonne fall in exchange warehouse stocks to 11,955 tonnes and news of Brazilian plans to cut output helped to push the cash price to Dollars 5,977.50 a tonne, up Dollars 107.50 on the week. And the three months price got tantalisingly close to the Dollars 6,000 a tonne that traders have identified as the 'near-term target', before ending Dollars 95 up at Dollars 5,982.50 a tonne. Copper prices reversed early falls to end higher on the week. The cash price rose Pounds 8.25 to Pounds 1,240.25 a tonne yesterday, encouraged by news of a 4,300-tonne LME stocks fall to 275,350 tonnes. In contrast aluminium stocks showed a rise of 15,250 tonnes to a new record of 1,231,750 tonnes. But that appeared to be shrugged off and the cash price ended the week Dollars 7.50 up at Dollars 1,297 a tonne. Silver was the strongest of the precious metals markets, putting on 6 cents yesterday to end 10 cents up on the week at Dollars 4.12 a troy ounce. Traders said the rise was influenced by positive technical factors and a renewal of optimism about prospects for an economic recovery in the US, which was given further encouragement yesterday by the announcement of a bigger-than-expected rise in US non-farm employment in April. US traders pointed out, however, that there was stiff resistance around Dollars 4.15 an ounce.  ---------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ---------------------------------------------- tonnes  ---------------------------------------------- Aluminium    +15,250   to   1,231,750 Copper        -4,300   to     275,350 Lead            -175   to     134,975 Nickel          +252   to      26,730 Zinc          +1,000   to     245,775 Tin             -105   to      11,955  ----------------------------------------------</p>

If they want to reinstate politics and  win back their credibility, then they must first restore order  themselves. Let us make this a priority for the coming months."    Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, speaking yesterday at a CVP  [Christian People's Party] New Year's reception in Ingelmunster,  was referring tacitly but unmistakeably to the present  atmosphere of scandal in parliament, following on from the  Agusta case. "In the past, and far too frequently even today,  all sorts of questions where wrongly settled on a  party-political basis," he said. "They went from telephone  connections through appointments to government contracts. This  gave birth to the totally incorrect image that anything can be  arranged on a party-political basis."    It was an analysis of the antipolitical atmosphere currently  overshadowing parliament that amounted to the following  diagnosis: it is your own fault. "Politics must become far more  humble," he said. "Politics neither can nor should pull  everything toward it and want to decide everything. And in  those matters that must be settled politically, a partisan  approach must be excluded as far as possible, especially when  the practical functioning of government is involved. To this  end, decision-making procedures in a range of fields must be  made legally and administratively objective. Obvious examples  are recruitment and appointments in the civil service and  magistracy. Fortunately, important steps recently have been  taken in the right direction, but we must go farther."    The prime minister then broached the theme of `rendering  services.' "The mediatory role often expected of politicians by  the population must be made increasingly official by appointing  ombudsman positions," he said. "That is what has happened in  state-owned companies. That is also the purpose of the  government's draft bill to set up a general ombudsman position.  Greater autonomy and responsibility must also be given to the  departments concerned in awarding government contracts. The  principle of seeking the best price-quality ratio must be made  more general."    "The practice of (indirect) economic compensation, which has  cost us a lot of money but resulted in little, must also be  stopped," he said. "The legislation on government contracts  must be changed in this sense." This comment can be applied  without modification to the Agusta case, where alleged  compensation was decisive, with far-reaching consequences.    The prime minister continued his thoughts in that direction,  still without mentioning Agusta by name. "The financing of the  political parties also continued for too long in a grey shadowy  area which poses many questions," he said. "There is a need for  clarity and transparency. The laws on the limitation of  electoral campaigns and the financing of the political parties  are steps in the right direction. However, they must be  tightened up."    There was a third recommendation which flows directly from  the Agusta affair, namely the abuse of parliamentary immunity.  "The parliamentary status gives rise to misunderstanding and  even suspicion," Dehaene said. "Does parliamentary immunity  really still belong to our time? In fact, the status offers no  protection, but the contrary: Now MP's are judged twice." Once  during the debate on lifting their immunity, and a second time  if prosecution actually takes place. "The financial, social and  fiscal status must also be clarified," Dehaene said. "There is  no need for privileges or such things, but a proper social and  financial status allowing MP's to work well, a status that also  makes the position attractive again."    "The St. Michael's agreement contains important elements of  political renewal," Dehaene said, briefly interrupting his  invisible Agusta thread at Ingelmunster, but soon picking it up  again. "The renewal is too slow. We must go fasterr. Let us  make that a priority for the coming months. But then it is  necessary that clarity be quickly established in a number of  areas. That is in the interest not only of those involved, but  politics as a whole." That presupposes, the prime minister  concluded, that "all instances respect the rules." This was  understood as veiled criticism of the very regular breaches of  confidentiality in the Agusta affair investigations. "Democracy  is a delicate plant that must be nourished carefully," he said.</p>

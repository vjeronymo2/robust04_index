			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Tough week for Dollar THIS WEEK should mark the beginning of a more realistic approach to the dollar, writes Peggy Hollinger. The premise, popular for some time before last week, had been that the US economy was set for recovery; that argument had even helped the dollar rise some 13 pfennigs against the D-Mark in January. The betting was that German rates would have to come down, while US rates would hold, and perhaps even rise. That feeling was so strong that the dollar was largely able to shrug off a whole series of depressing numbers - until last week. Starting on Monday, the dollar began a steady decline which was only reversed temporarily on Thursday for a bit of profit-taking. Two things were working against the US currency: the Bundesbank and the actual state of the economy. Repeated statements from the Bundesbank that German monetary policy would remain tight began to shake the market's confidence. On Friday, severely disappointing US jobs data put the final nail in the coffin. Now, there are no illusions about the state of the economy and the most likely scenario is a cut in the Federal Funds rate. Figures due out this week will offer little argument against such a move: US retail sales are unlikely to provide much encouragement. However, some of the pressure might come off the dollar with the raft of UK statistics out this week. Some attention could focus on the weakness of the UK economy and the political consequences of that weakness, according to Dr Mark Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank. The retail prices index, UK retail sales, unemployment figures, and industrial production are all due this week.</p>

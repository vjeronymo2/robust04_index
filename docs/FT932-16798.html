			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / US jobs figures catch markets off guard US MARKETS were caught off guard yesterday as payroll employment fell by 22,000 last month, against forecasts of an increase of 100,000-150,000. But encouraging figures for the first quarter as a whole indicated that the economy was continuing to grow steadily. The fall in non-farm employment sent financial markets into a tailspin. Bond prices fell sharply as dealers ignored the unexpected fall in March payrolls, and focused on the big gains in January and February payrolls, which they feared could lead to higher inflation. By late last night the benchmark 30-year long-bond had fallen more than a point, pushing the yield above 7 per cent. The jump in bond yields unnerved stock markets already weakened by bad corporate news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 68.63 down at 3,370.81, having swung wildly in early trading. Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, said the figures underscored the urgency of passing President Bill Clinton's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) stimulus package. Interpretation of the data was complicated by a sharp upward revision for January, showing a rise in employment of 113,000 rather than the 44,000 initially reported. Figures for February were revised slightly to show an abnormally large gain of 367,000. In the first quarter the monthly rise in employment averaged 125,000 against 85,000 in the fourth quarter of 1992 and 38,000 in the three preceding quarters. The jobless rate last month was unchanged at 7 per cent, sharply lower than the 7.7 per cent peak reached last summer. The only substantial rise in employment last month was seen in the services industry, which has accounted for three-quarters of jobs created in the past year. This increase, however, was largely offset by sharp decline in construction which was adversely affected by severe storms on the east coast last month. Manufacturing employment fell slightly. The jobs figures caused concern following several weak figures this week, including a decline in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index. There was also a fall in the Purchasing Managers' Index, a barometer of conditions in the manufacturing industry. However, other statistics remain more encouraging. The University of Michigan's confidence index was higher at the end of March than at the beginning, although it remained slightly down for the month.

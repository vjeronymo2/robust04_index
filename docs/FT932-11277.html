			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: More opera at Covent Garden Jeremy Isaacs, general director at Covent Garden, yesterday proclaimed the Royal Opera House to be in 'goodish shape'. Despite making a surplus in 1992-93, tight financial constraints continue and are reflected in the 1993-94 season. For the Royal Ballet there are no new full length productions at Covent Garden; the 'new' Sleeping Beauty is to be premiered during the US tour. For the Royal Opera there are seven new productions but three are co-productions with other opera houses. The incoming opera director Nicholas Payne signposted four initiatives which are reflected in the 1993-94 season. The Wagner repertory will be revitalised; in October there is a new production of Der Meistersinger, and a new Ring is planned from 1994. A Verdi Festival starts in 1995, with the aim of performing all his operas by 2002. In the meantime a fresh Aida, not seen at Covent Garden for a decade, opens in June 1994. As ever there is a desire to perform more British works, with revivals of Birtwistle's Gawaine and of Britten's Gloriana (in a guest performance by Opera North) and to broaden the repertoire with little known works. In 1993-94 there will be new productions of Massenet's Cherubin; of Giordano's Fedora (produced in association with La Scala, Milan); and Rossini's Mose in Egitto (first seen in Bologna). The other new productions are Scottish Opera's recent Die Zauberflote and Janacek's Katya Kabanova, which will be directed by Trevor Nunn. In its bid to pay off its deficit so that the government will be better inclined to give Covent Garden the money needed to rebuild its theatre, the Royal Opera House has plenty of popular classics in its programme, including 17 performances of Carmen and ten of Madama Butterfly. There will also be much more opera (which produces a bigger box office) than dance. Jeremy Isaacs is keen to popularise opera and is asking sponsors to help Covent Garden by subsidising seat prices as well as sponsoring productions. Four Saturday night performances will be subsidised in this way with over 1000 seats priced at under Pounds 12 The aim is ten such performances a year.</p>

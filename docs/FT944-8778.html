			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / What the Chancellor should do in this years budget The chancellor should increase incentives for investment in the Budget, says a survey of businesses by Barclays Mercantile, Philip Coggan writes. Businesses were asked to pick the three measures they most wanted to see in the Budget. The most popular response, picked by 56 per cent of those surveyed, was higher first year capital allowances for investment. Nearly 47 per cent wanted to see a reduction in National Insurance contributions, while 34 per cent wanted to see a cut, or at least stability, in interest rates.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY  </P> <P> Olympic diving champ Greg Louganis is back in a bathing suit -- to play  lifeguard and romantic interest to Traci Lords. It's for Abba Entertainment's  "The Object of Desire," which just started filming in the Central American  nation of Belize, with Lords as a soap opera queen on holiday, stalked by a  crazed fan.  </P> <P> The winner of four Olympic gold medals doesn't see any problem being teamed  with a former porn star. "As far as I'm concerned, she's an actress. And I'm an  actor. And I think we work well together," he says by phone from the Caribbean  nation, adding, "She happens to be real sweet. I just had dinner with her last  night."  </P> <P> Now 30, Louganis has studied acting and dance, with stage experience dating  back to childhood. (Last summer, he was Prince Charming in a Long Beach Civic  Light Opera production of "Cinderella.")  </P> <P> The role in "Object of Desire" is his biggest to date, following a bit part in  a straight-to-video pic, "Dirty Laundry," and some TV game show appearances.  He's nixed other film offers, he says, because "they wanted a body, I think,  more than anything."  </P> <P> But isn't he scantily clad as a lifeguard? "Yes, but there's more to this  character than just a bathing suit. There's a relationship here. To be frank,  I've been ready to make a transition -- from being an athlete -- for a long  time. But most of the general public doesn't seem ready for me to make that  transition. This is a kind of step."  </P> <P> It's not unlike learning a new dive, he says: "It's terrifying. You're testing  unknown waters." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

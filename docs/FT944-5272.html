			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Olympics drug abuse 'shock' China's Olympic Committee expressed 'deep shock and regret' at the weekend over a finding by the Olympic Committee of Asia that 11 Chinese athletes had tested positive for performance enhancing drugs at the recent Asian games in Hiroshima. China announced that it had appointed a committee to investigate the episode and said those involved would be punished severely under international rules. The report was carried by People's Daily in its back-page 'brief news' columns. The OCA finding that a number of its top athletes, including several members of its all-conquering women's swimming squad, had failed doping tests is proving a severe embarrassment for China.</p>

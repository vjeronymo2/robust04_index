Only two persons who voted for Shumeyko do not belong  in this apparat-administrative team.    In the meantime, commenting on the results of voting in a  conversation with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Yegor  Stroyev, head of the Orel Oblast administration and member of  the Federation Council, remarked that "the senators have made a  "Solomonic decision." They offered no cause for a standoff  between the Federation Council and the president. But today, to  make the Federation Council efficient, Shumeyko should propose  members of the opposition as his deputies. He, in fact, will  have to solve the dilemma: disobedient deputies versus an  obedient house or vice versa."</p>

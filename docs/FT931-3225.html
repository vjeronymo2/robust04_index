			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo falls as Hong Kong stages a rally LIGHT profit-taking ahead of the March financial year-end depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average closed below the 18,000 mark after seven consecutive gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 117.88 at 17,968.30, finishing below 18,000 for the first time in three trading days. The index rose to the day's high of 18,117.09 in the morning, but was pushed down by profit-taking in the afternoon to set a low for the session of 17,945.22. Volume remained almost unchanged, at 350m shares against 336m. Traders said that yesterday was the last trading day of the year for most corporate investors, who close their books this Friday. Declines led advances by 599 to 407, with 150 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 8.89 to 1,344.71, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.95 to 1,073.73. Companies with close ties with Japanese railway groups gained ground after JR East, which plans to submit its application for listing next month, held a meeting for stock analysts on Monday. Some investors were encouraged by reports that more analysts had attended the meeting than had been expected. While details for the listing have yet to be decided, JR East said it expected to target retail investors for its listing, offering a high dividend. Mr Graeme McDonald, an analyst at James Capel, said future profits for JR East were dependent on its revenue from operations other than its core business, so that most investors would be looking at the level of projected capital expenditure. Nippon Densetsu Kogyo, a core electrical engineering company closely linked to the JR group, advanced Y60 to Y2,250. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y1,000 to Y802,000 on profit-taking by dealers. NTT-related shares also lost ground, with Daimei Telecom Engineering, a telecom engineering concern, falling Y22 to Y827 and Kyowa Exeo losing Y23 to Y975. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 83.72 to 18,992.43 in volume of 66.9m shares. The index declined for the first time in four trading days on small-lot selling in the afternoon. Roundup THERE WERE some strong performances among the region's markets. HONG KONG showed some recovery on buying by institutional investors. The Hang Seng index rose 125.43 to 5,980.04 but turnover dropped from HKDollars 5.5bn to HKDollars 3.9bn. Sentiment remained nervous after China's political attacks, although there were expectations of good results from Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa, which report tomorrow; Cheung Kong climbed 80 cents to HKDollars 21.50 and Hutchison by 40 cents to HKDollars 15.70. HSBC regained HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 65.50, having reported better than expected 1992 profits after the close on Monday. Hang Seng Bank retrieved HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 65. AUSTRALIA gathered momentum, encouraged by remarks from Mr Paul Keating, the re-elected prime minister, that there was scope for a cut in official interest rates. Some analysts said they were expecting a 1/2 percentage-point reduction in rates. The All Ordinaries index ended 32.9 up at 1,659.3 in turnover of ADollars 281.1m. Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network acquisition of 4.98 per cent of John Fairfax Holdings lifted the newspaper group's shares 12 cents to ADollars 1.96. SINGAPORE closed higher following the government's announcement of changes in the Central Provident Fund's investment rules. The Straits Times Industrial index rallied 18.54 to 1,649.35, with some 124.6m shares traded. The government said on Monday that it would allow CPF members to withdraw more funds to invest in equities and unit trusts. SEOUL weakened for the first time in four trading sessions on worries about renewed political tension between South and North Korea, caused by Pyongyang's withdrawal from an international nuclear pact. The composite index retreated 7.86 to 637.87 as turnover fell Won200bn to Won300bn. MANILA lost early gains as investors switched funds to Hong Kong, but the composite index closed 4.13 up at 1,475.78. NEW ZEALAND recouped Monday's losses, receiving a fillip from rises in Telecom of 8 cents to NZDollars 2.85, a record high, and Goodman Fielder of 9 cents to NZDollars 2.13. The NZSE-40 index gained 17.66 at 1,584.69 in turnover of some NZDollars 30.5m. BOMBAY advanced for a second day since the market reopened following Friday's series of bombings, in which more than 60 people died at the BSE building. The BSE index added 38.58 at 2,459.85. Brokers said shares rose on solid support from state-owned financial institutions, with supply limited because trading has been restricted to one hour and tight security had restricted the access of participants.</p>

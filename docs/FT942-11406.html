			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (14): Sales pitch is more convincing - While Budapest has failed to live up to its promise as a regional base, recent investments show renewed faith in Hungary's potential / Trading hubs, Hungary Hungarians have rarely been shy about selling themselves. In the early 1990s the pitch was that Hungary could be a springboard - bridgehead and base were also popular terms - for western companies set on doing business in eastern Europe. No other nation combined experience of trade in the communist bloc and familiarity with the west. Hungary, while a member of Comecon, began to open up its economy in 1968 and further in the 1980s. Budapest had many of the geographical qualifications to act as a regional base. It is the largest city in central-eastern Europe and lies at the heart of the Carpathian basin at the confluence of road, rail and river routes. But little of Hungary's promise has been fulfilled. Talk of springboards is 'passe', a Hungarian trade and investment official says privately. 'It was quite fashionable and trendy three years ago. Now it's not such a hot issue.' Few international companies have set up regional headquarters in Budapest. Vienna remains the location of choice. Multinationals such as Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan which set up production in Hungary to sell to the whole region have had to think again. Suzuki, which with its partners is committed to an investment of Yen32bn to produce an eventual 60,000 Swift cars a year, has shifted its sales focus from eastern to western Europe. Investors' and exporters' plans went awry when Comecon, the Soviet-led trading bloc, came apart in 1991. Suddenly, exporting from Hungary gave no extra access to eastern markets. Demand collapsed as economic restructuring and recession began to bite. Closer inspection has shown up Budapest's drawbacks as a regional business hub. Backward financial services remain a constant source of irritation for international businesses. Financial institutions in Budapest cannot even conduct some bilateral trade with the former Soviet Union, let alone handle complicated east-west transactions. Hungarians often, fairly or unfairly, also lack credibility as intermediaries. 'For western products everybody wants to buy from a westerner,' says Philip Santens, director of the European office of trade development agency ITD Hungary. But not all dreams are dashed. Hungary last year agreed to establish a Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA) with Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia. That accord abolished barriers on about half of trade in industrial goods. A new initiative this year will speed up tariff reduction with the goal of fully free trade by the end of 1997. East European economies are turning up too, promising plumper markets for exporters. Poland's GDP grew by 4 per cent in 1993, and the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected this year to follow their larger neighbour into recovery. Recent investments show a renewed faith in the value of Hungary as a regional base. A subsidiary of Siemens, the German engineering company, last December took over Hungary's MKM and intends to use the telecommunications cable maker to supply Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine. Budapest is becoming a more efficient business hub with western banks such as Creditanstalt, ING, Commerzbank and Credit Lyonnais establishing branches there. Domestic banks have improved their regional reach. Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank has, for instance, this year opened offices in Kiev and Almaty and Budapest Bank one in Moscow. Telecommunications services have improved dramatically for business users with the installation of new digital exchanges. The Dollars 875m investment by Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US in Hungarian national operator Matav promises further development. Ironically, it is just as Hungary's international salesmen are giving up the springboard pitch that it is beginning to sound more convincing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis -- Important issues are not leaking out of  the current negotiations between Israel and the PLO. Topping  these is the primary and sensitive issue in which Israel  categorically rejects Yasir 'Arafat's entrance into Jericho and  Gaza after the Israeli withdrawal and during the transitional  period.    This issue exhausted efforts to achieve progress on the  other  levels of negotiations. However, Israel considers this issue  unquestionable and insists on this stand. As a compromise, the  PLO asked Egypt to intervene in order to rescue the situation.  Egypt presented a compromise proposal to establish a temporary  headquarters for 'Arafat in al-'Arish so he would be close to  Gaza in order to organize matters and to take the helm of the  government.    AKHBAR AL-USBU' learned from well informed Palestinian  sources that Israel has now completed defining what it calls the  yellow area between Gaza and Dayr al-Balah, in which there are  Israeli settlements, and that this area includes the coast.    In another development, Yasir 'Arafat asked the Russian  leadership to intervene in order to cancel Israel's decision not  to allow him to enter Gaza and Jericho during the self-rule  period. The Soviets promised to use all means to cancel the  Israeli decision.</p>

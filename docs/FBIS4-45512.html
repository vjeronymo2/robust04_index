			<p>Chapare   <F P=102>   PY2306003494 Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 11 Jun 94  Section 2 p 1 </F>  <F P=103> PY2306003494 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Cruz EL MUNDO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent] </F>   [Text] La Paz -- Minister of Government German Quiroga  Gomez has stated that due to current coca prices (180 Bolivian  pesos per load), it is impossible to successfully implement an  alternative development program in the Chapare region. Quiroga  said that in view of this, it is indispensable to increase drug  enforcement in this region. Ten years of statistics show that  by increasing interdiction, market values decrease and more  peasants decide to resort to alternative products.    Quiroga said that currently there are virtually no valid  arguments to convince coca growers to replace their crops,  because it is not economically profitable.    Quiroga delivered a speech during the opening ceremony of  the  Seminar on Alternative Development sponsored by the U.S.  Embassy's USIS in conjunction with the Social Defense  Undersecretariat and the La Paz Journalists Association. The  seminar was held for around 20 journalists from several  departments who are travelling today to Chapare to observe the  development of banana, citrus fruit, and pineapple plantations  and the like.    Quiroga added that peasants would be willing to replace  their  excess coca crops when they were convinced it was more  profitable to produce other crops. He said that for farmers it  is a question of opportunity and necessity, and that it is  essential to take this into account to achieve proper levels of  alternative development. Quiroga stated: "It is meaningless to  invest in infrastructure and equipment in the Chapare region if  it is not profitable for coca growers to switch crops."    Quiroga said: "With current prices, we will never be able to  replace coca farming if we exclusively rely on the good will of  coca growers, and Bolivia will continue to be the second largest  drug producer."    Quiroga explained that the current policy of control of  dangerous substances groups under one single unit the three  aspects of drug enforcement (interdiction, alternative  development, and drug prevention). He said that from this point  of view the Ministry of Government will implement alternative  development and peasant education programs wherever there are  interdiction and drug enforcement programs.    Quiroga said it is regrettable that in Bolivia the only  newsworthy articles are those related to trafficking activities  in what he described as the "bad Chapare" region, and that this  represents only 20 percent of the population. He said that the  remaining 80 percent has either always been devoted to legal  activities or is voluntarily replacing its excess coca crops.    He added that five years ago the Chapare region only  produced  coca that was sold in the market. Quiroga said that nowadays  coca is neither transported nor marketed. He said that instead  cocaine paste is being produced on nearby plantations, because  peasants have available the technical facilities to macerate  coca. Sixty percent of the coca growers in the Cochabamba  tropical region are involved in drug trafficking. Quiroga  warned that "we have a time bomb on our hands."    Moreover, Social Defense Under Secretary Mario Soliz said  that through an agreement approved by the COB [Bolivian Labor  Federation] on 23 March, coca growers have agreed to eradicate  5,000 hectares of coca by the end of the year, and that they are  therefore obliged to comply with this. Soliz said that the  government is empowered to exercise interdiction mechanisms if  this goal is not achieved. He added, however, that the current  policy favors dialogue with coca producers, as there is no  intention of turning the alternative development program into a  violent issue, and even less of turning against the peasants.</p>

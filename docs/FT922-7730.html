			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Base rate cut unsettles fixed income planning LAST week's base rate cut was not good news for everyone. Those keen on the certainty of investing for a fixed income - mostly pensioners - found some promising avenues closed off immediately as National Savings withdrew all its products without notice. And interest rates for savers were reduced quickly by building societies. Further base rate cuts are now expected when, only a month ago, a jump of two points was canvassed widely in the event of a Conservative election defeat. Some pundits forecast that rates could even undercut those of Germany - a psychologically important barrier to breach. The election result reinforced the beliefs of a growing number of analysts who expect a low-inflation, low-interest rate environment for the rest of the decade. Double-figure base rates are still not all that low in historical terms, they argue, so more cuts could be in store. This could be the time to lock in returns. But income investors must swallow some unpalatable facts. First, you will normally have to sacrifice some capital growth. The more growth you are prepared to lose, then, in general, the higher income you can afford; and, indeed, a very high income often will be earned at the expense of a capital loss. Second, you must decide if the income is needed monthly or annually. You should get better value if you only need payments once a year. The most obvious product is a gilt (or UK government bond) which can be bought for only a small fee at a post office. The present high level of government debt ensures there will be plenty of gilts around for the foreseeable future. Gilt investors can make capital gains; but when investing for income, it is simplest to buy a bond and then hold on to it. If you buy a particularly short-term bond, you might find you are just deferring a problem, according to David Kauders, a fee-based adviser who specialises in financial planning using gilts. Yields - the technical term for the proportion of the price you pay which you will receive in income - are lower than they were immediately before the election, but Kauders says that 9 per cent is achievable. However, appropriately long stocks - which are not redeemed until at least the year 2000 - are thin on the ground and it can be difficult to juggle them so that you receive a regular monthly income. It is also important to remember, when buying stock priced above 100, that your capital value will be eroded if you hold it until maturity. Annuities are the most effective income providers, but only because they repay your capital as well as income. They are, therefore, most useful if you are sure you will not need the capital again, and best avoided if you want to keep future options open. They are offered by life companies, and those not bought with the proceeds of a pension plan come in two basic varieties. Immediate annuities continue to pay out a fixed income until you die, whenever that happens, while temporary annuities pay out over a fixed period. In either case, however, the company will pocket your capital once you die, so this is not a good investment if you are keen to leave a handsome inheritance behind you or if you have reason to fear that you will not live long. The rate you receive depends on two main factors: your life expectancy and the state of the gilts market. You will be paid more if your life expectancy is shorter, or if gilt yields are high. This means you get better value the longer you wait - unless you think gilt yields will fall. As a rule, they are worthwhile for men aged 70 or over and women aged 75. According to Baronworth Investment Services, the best rates now available for temporary annuities lasting for nine years, and taken out by a male aged 70 paying Pounds 10,000, are Pounds 2,023 annually from Pearl Assurance and Pounds 1,983.27 annually from Canada Life. For an immediate annuity, on the same assumptions, the best rates are Pounds 1,463.40 from Sun Life of Canada and Pounds 1,460.52 from Equitable Life. Guaranteed income bonds, as their name suggests, provide a guaranteed rate of income over a fixed term. They tend to be offered by smaller life offices. Both monthly and annual income payments are available, although rates for the latter will be higher. As with all these investments, they are underpinned by gilts - which meant that virtually all the GIBs on the market were withdrawn abruptly on the day after the election. The rates now on offer are less generous. GIBs have the significant disadvantage for non-taxpayers that basic-rate income tax is deducted at source and cannot be reclaimed. Baronworth's best buys for monthly income (assuming you have Pounds 10,000 to invest) are 7.91 per cent from American Life over one year, 7.63 from American Life over two years, 7.6 from Premium Life over three years, 7.61 from General Portfolio over four years, and 7.8 from Hill Samuel over five years. For annual income, Baronworth's best buys are 8.44 from Prosperity over one year, 8.3 from CCL Assurance over two years, 8.5 from Liberty Life over three years, 8.15 from Consolidated Life over four years, and 8.52 from Prosperity over five. National Savings provides taxable monthly income bonds which pay 9.25 per cent. The maximum holding has now been increased to Pounds 50,000. These bonds are most appropriate for non-taxpayers, while they are just about competitive for basic-rate taxpayers. Banks and building societies often offer fixed-income products, but many have been dropped unceremoniously in the light of base rate speculation, so choice is not wide and few offers are exciting. According to Money Facts, the best onshore rates for accounts providing fixed monthly income are provided by Exeter Bank and Halifax Building Society. Over one year, Exeter offers a fixed 9.5 per cent on a minimum of Pounds 5,000. On an investment of Pounds 10,000, Halifax offers 9.43 per cent over one year, 9.02 over two years, and 8.83 over three, four and five years. Midland Bank Trust and TSB Channel Islands offer the best offshore rates.</p>

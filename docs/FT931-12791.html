			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Cost of capital It seems that companies seeking fresh equity finance this year will be paying a very high price, at least according to the BZW equity-gilt study. Using a model based on current and projected dividend flows, the study calculates that the cost of equity capital reached a 30-year peak in 1991 and only fell back a little last year. This analysis confirms the widespread view that dividend growth will be heavily constrained; the last time capital cost so much was 1959 and real dividends fell for the next three years. The implication is also that rights issues are currently an expensive form of finance. Under the circumstances companies should try to retain as much of their earnings as possible, rather than pay high dividends and seek external funding. Those with strong cash inflows may be able to expand faster than those relying on outside capital to gear up for economic recovery. The current vogue for recovery stocks may be getting ahead of itself. As bank lending is also subdued, the bind on companies is tight and there may even be a general shortage of risk capital. However, by relying on the rapid dividend growth of the 1980s for expectations about the future, the model may over-estimate the cost of raising equity. Besides, companies feeling the pinch may not worry about the rate of dividends shareholders are expecting in future. They may still come for rights issues - if they can sell the underwriters a good story.</p>

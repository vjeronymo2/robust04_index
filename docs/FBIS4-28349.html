			<p>BFN     [Text] On 4 June, the Canadian Government gave Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai a letter requesting  deregulation in Japan's Building Standards Law [BSL] and the  Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS). In a bid to urge Japan  to increase imports of Canadian timber and other products, the  letter has asked the Japanese Government to incorporate the  request into a deregulation package, which will be compiled by  the end of June.    Touching on the BSL, the letter claims: "Canadian-produced  timber products are capable of satisfying fire prevention  standards the same as those for nonwooden buildings." It  requests the easing of building standards to enable the  following: 1) construction of three-story wooden apartment  houses in fire zones and semi-fire zones; and 2) construction of  three-story wooden hotels using the 2- by-4 method.    The JAS bans the use of coniferous plywood for a concrete  mold and strictly restricts the use of North American timber as  structural wood such as pillars and beams. The letter has  demanded the review of such restrictions. With regard to the  Plant Protection Law, it has requested that negotiations on  import agreements be shortened.</p>

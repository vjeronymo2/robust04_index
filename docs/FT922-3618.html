			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Caution for BCCI creditors CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were warned yesterday by its majority shareholder to accept the provisional liquidation plan or risk ending up with nothing. At the second day of a hearing in the High Court to determine whether to ratify the proposal, the government of Abu Dhabi, which owns more than 70 per cent of BCCI, said the proposed pay-out to creditors was 'not open to renegotiation'. The eight-strong creditors' committee has objected to the plan announced by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, in February. It includes compensation of Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 926m) for creditors. Touche Ross says creditors will eventually receive between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of money owed to them by BCCI. The creditors' committee said the pay-out would be nearer 15 per cent to 17 per cent. The committee representing former employees of BCCI, who argue that they have been neglected, called for further time to negotiate on the settlement. The hearing is expected to continue at least until tomorrow</p>

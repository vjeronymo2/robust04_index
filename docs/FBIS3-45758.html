			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Leng Mou (0397 4188)] </F>   [Text] China's comprehensive reform will mainly be carried  out in cities and towns this year. The ability of the large  numbers of workers in cities and towns, especially low-income  and retired workers, to withstand the effects of reform will  have direct influence on the outcome of this carefully designed  plan. Associate Professor Feng Tongqing of the China Worker  Movement Institute in Beijing, who has long been engaged in the  study of workers' mentality, pointed out that when carrying out  reform, one must taken into account economic compensation and  welfare assurance for workers in the lower income bracket, and  one should never overestimate the workers' capacity to withstand  the effects of reform.    In recent years, poor coordination between a series of  reform  projects launched in mainland China has resulted in an increase  in the living expenses of worker households and relatively  insufficient compensation in terms of actual income. Feng  Tongqing believes that a reform plan which keeps the workers'  "net burden" at the level of about 5 percent of their income  will, generally speaking, be more readily acceptable to most  workers. But, while raising pay, it is still necessary to  introduce a full range of reforms regarding the insurance,  housing, price, and welfare systems, so as to keep a basic  balance between pay rises and the due price for introducing the  reforms in the areas of insurance, housing, price, and welfare.    Anyway, the reform package will possibly cause a chain  reaction in commodity prices, as excessive price hikes will  possibly be intolerable to the workers. What is more, price  increases caused by an increase in labor costs usually ends up  the cost transfer process with enterprises paying the price in  the form of losses. Also, as reform may advance faster, thus  imposing heavier a burden on workers during a certain period,  the pressure on some low-income worker households may exceed the  limit they can withstand. Feng noted that the limit of "net  burden" that the workers can withstand should be scientifically  estimated so that it can be kept within a certain range without  causing any fluctuation in the workers' daily economic life.    Associate Professor Feng Tongqing participated in the  discussions, forecasts, and analysis that resulted in the blue  paper: "An Analysis and Forecast of Social Conditions in China  (1993-1994)." He emphasized that relative grievances among low-  income workers, fluctuation in the workers' daily economic life,  and the intensifying conflicts between workers and management  may all contribute to more frequent occurrences of  "eventualities." The so- called "eventualities," he explained,  are collective actions taken by a certain number of workers  (more than 10 people), in the form of strikes, collective  slowdowns, collective visits to government departments to lodge  complaints, assemblies, sit-ins, and so on.    Statistics by the letter and visit bureaus of the CPC  Central  Committee General Office and of the State Council show that the  number of visiting groups and individual visitors received by  the two bureaus from January to May last year increased by 31  and 29.8 percent over the corresponding period in 1992. Of the  cases raised during these visits, 28 percent were to complain  about some issues related to daily economic life. Meanwhile, as  shown by incomplete statistics made among enterprises in 10  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central government, the number of eventualities that took  place in the second quarter of 1993 was 83.9 percent higher than  the figure in the corresponding period in 1992.    Feng Tongqing said: Intensifying conflicts between  management and workers is a basic cause for eventualities. The  workers have grievances against reforms within their  enterprises, especially against some enterprises' practice of  "three changes and three no- changes" regarding the redundant  manpower layoff operation; specifically, the practice of  changing workers but not changing cadres; changing first-line  employees (that is, producers) but not changing second- and  third-line staff (that is, administrators); and change on  general issues but no change on deep-rooted issues. Feng  Tongqing held that it is necessary to quickly establish a  tripartite mechanism which enables the trade unions and  enterprises to open talks, with the government as a mediator, so  that the labor disputes can be put on a normal basis. Only in  this way will it be possible to substantially reduce  eventualities.    The knotty problem of personnel reemployment has long been  disturbing enterprises. This problem has not only dampened  workers' initiative, but it is also the basic reason why the  standing of workers in state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises has been further downgraded. An estimate shows that  at the moment enterprises in mainland China have some 17 million  redundant personnel, of whom about 10 million are working with  state-owned enterprises. Statistics released by the labor  department indicate that some 200,000 of the 1 million personnel  laid off from enterprises still remain jobless. According to  the plan by the government department concerned, the  re-employment of redundant personnel of enterprises will not be  properly solved until 2000.    Therefore, Feng Tongqing said the standing of workers of  state- owned enterprises is expected to be further downgraded in  1994.</p>

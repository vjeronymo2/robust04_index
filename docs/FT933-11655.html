			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: US sale ends Philips' presence in defence PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to sell its US defence activities to its local management team and to Carlyle, a privately-held Washington-based merchant bank. The sale marks the last stage of Philips' withdrawal from defence electronics. Magnavox Electronic Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary with annual turnover of more than Dollars 400m, has been for sale since the late 1980s. Attempts to sell the unit were hampered by the downturn in the sector caused by the end of the cold war and subsequent sharp cuts in defence spending. Philips declined to give financial details but said it expected the divestment to be completed by the end of September, pending government approval in the US. In 1990, the Dutch company sold its European defence electronics activities, mainly to Thomson of France, as a first step in withdrawing from a sector which was no longer regarded as belonging to the group's core businesses. Philips was yesterday unable to say whether the transaction would yield a book profit. The company's second-quarter results, due on August 5, will include an extraordinary gain of Fl 1.1bn (Dollars 567m) on the recent sale of its minority stake in an Asian semi-conductor joint venture, Matsushita Electronics Corp, to Matsushita of Japan. Philips emphasised that the Magnavox defence activities were unrelated to Philips' other Magnavox companies in the US, which make televisions and other consumer products. The divestment of Magnavox Electronic Systems marks the realisation of a long-standing goal for Philips, which announced its retreat from defence electronics in 1989. A year later, Philips fell into financial difficulties that prompted it to divest a number of businesses, including personal and mini-computers, as part of efforts to return to sustained profitability.</p>

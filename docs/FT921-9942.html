			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / US jobless rise may spur Fed to reduce rates A SHARP fall in US employment last month fuelled speculation yesterday that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, may cut interest rates again in the near future. The Labour Department said non-farm payrolls fell by 91,000 last month. Financial markets had expected a gain of about 30,000 jobs. Bond prices rose sharply at first on Wall Street but fell back once it became clear that the Fed was not going to cut interest rates yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 30.19 points at 3,225.40. 'I expect the Fed to take out a bit more insurance and nudge rates lower,' said Mr David Rolley, senior financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, a forecasting group. If the Fed decides to act, it is likely to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent. The fed funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow from each other. Some economists expect a bigger move. C J Lawrence, a New York broker, yesterday predicted another full point cut in the discount rate to 2.5 per cent before the end of the month. Other analysts, however, believe the Fed will resist political pressure to stimulate the economy because of signs of a revival in monetary growth in recent weeks. The employment report, the first comprehensive guide to economic trends last month, suggests the economy entered the new year in worse shape than expected. It indicates gross domestic product may be declining, rather than static as most economists had predicted. Employment declined in nearly all sectors, including services. Manufacturing and retailing each shed about 50,000 jobs. Figures for December were also revised down to show a gain of only 3,000 rather than the 31,000 previously reported. The politically sensitive unemployment rate, however, held steady at 7.1 per cent last month. It is based on a less reliable data series than the payroll employment numbers. Payrolls have declined by 300,000 since October, wiping out the gain in the previous six months of faltering economic recovery. Job growth in services has ceased in the past three months after steady gains between April and October. Manufacturing employment has fallen significantly for five months running. Yesterday's report also showed a sharp decline in the factory working week last month, a sign that industrial production may have fallen substantially. The employment figures follow a series of gloomy statistics, including a further fall in consumer confidence last month and a sharp drop in factory orders in December.</p>

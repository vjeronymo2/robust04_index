At a secret enlarged meeting of the  Central Military Commission (CMC) on December 18 and 19, the top  brass also agreed to implement the long-stalled decision to  demobilize up to half a million soldiers. Moreover, senior  officers have taken steps to restore military relations with  America by dispatching Executive Vice-Chief of Staff General Xu  Huizi to the United States in the spring.    Chinese sources said yesterday the personnel changes which  began late last month were the most extensive since the  reshuffle of the leadership of the seven military regions in  1990. They said, aside from rejuvenation and  professionalisation, the CMC wanted to achieve a factional  balance to ensure support for the post-Deng leadership with  President Jiang Zemin as its "core."    A number of officers believed to be close to disgraced chief  political commissar General Yang Baibing have been purged.  Commander of the crucial Beijing Military Region, General Wang  Chengbin has retired in favour of one of his deputies, General  Li Laizhu. Considered a modernisation-minded professional,  General Li served in the Tianjin region before becoming  vice-commander of the Beijing region in 1985.    The most politically sensitive move took place in the  Chengdu  Military Region with the removal of Political Commissar General  Zhang Gong, a crony of General Yang's. General Zhang, a  spokesman for the Martial Law Command guarding Beijing in  mid-1989, has been replaced by General Zhang Zhijian, another  vice-commander of the Beijing Military Region.    General Tao Bojun has been appointed a vice-commander of the  Guangzhou Military Region, which will play a significant role in  the stationing of troops in Hong Kong after 1997. A chief of  staff of the regional command since 1992, General Tao is  considered a rising star. He accompanies CMC Vice-Chairman  General Liu Huaqing on his ongoing tour of Thailand and  Indonesia. Other personnel movements in units including the  Nanjing and Shenyang military regions are expected in the near  future.    Within PLA headquarters, the most thorough-going changes  have  hit the General Political Department, considered a power base of  General Yang's. Two assistant directors, General Du Tiehuan and  General Xu Caihou, have been promoted vice-directors. It is  believed that prior to and after the fall of General Yang, a  number of his colleagues, including the incumbent  Director-General Yu Yongbo, have switched allegiance and  professed loyalty to President Jiang.    At the General Logistics Department, which is headed by  Jiang  loyalist Fu Quanyou, General Zhou Youliang has replaced the  retiring vice-director General Li Lun. General Zhou has since  1988 been head of the Army's Department of Capital Construction  and Barracks.    An informed source said patriarch Mr Deng was anxious that  the Army, led by Mr Jiang in his capacity as CMC chairman, would  help the leadership defuse political "contradictions" that would  arise in the course of radical market reforms in the mid-199Os.  He said while Mr Deng had used his influence to prop up Mr  Jiang, the patriarch had sought to keep a factional balance  within the PLA. "The purge of the so-called Yang Clan has been  less severe than expected," the source said. "Several officers  who have gained promotions, including General Zhang Zhijian, a  former head of the Beijing Municipal Garrison were once allies  of General Yang."    Another decision made at the CMC was to start the  demobilisation of as many as half a million soldiers in 1994.  While the decision to trim the 3.2 million-strong PLA was taken  in 1991, only token numbers of divisions and personnel had been  cut.    Western military analysts said the CMC had this time bitten  the bullet because of rising costs, difficulty in recruitment,  as well as the improvement of ties with former adversaries  including Russia, Vietnam and India. "Costs saved by  demobilisation will be pumped into the armaments modernisation  programme," a Western diplomat said. It is understood a  sizeable portion of the demobilised soldiers would be absorbed  by the para-military People's Armed Police, as well as new  law-enforcement entities such as urban "patrol police" units and  anti-riot squads.    Meanwhile, the army leadership has decided to reciprocate  overtures made by the American military by sending a high-level  officer to the U.S. Sources close to the PLA said General Xu  would probably make his trip after the Lunar New Year. A  Vice-Chief of the General Staff Department since 1985, General  Xu, an expert on training and equipment, has visited the U.S.  before.    Diplomatic sources said General Xu's visit was the result of  a partial thaw in bilateral military ties achieved during a trip  to Beijing last November by the Assistant Secretary of Defence,  Charles Freeman. Aside from the resumption of top-level visits,  Mr Freeman and his hosts discussed the setting up of a bilateral  committee on military co-operation.    It is understood an American Defence Department official  will  be visiting Beijing later this month to discuss the frame of  reference of this committee. "The co-operation committee will  steer clear of sensitive issues such as weapons sales or the  transfer of military technology," a source said. "It is likely  the American side will help the PLA in the transformation of  military factories into facilities for producing civilian  goods." The source said the top brass was hopeful that the  Chinese Army might again tap U.S. expertise in modernising its  weapons.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(asa)"] </F>   [Text] Businessman Rudolf Mosny is putting himself forward  in the new role of politician and is entering onto the Slovak  political scene. Yesterday, he briefed correspondents on his  new political movement, New Slovakia [Nove Slovensko]  (established on 6 May 1994), whose aim is to reverse the  unfavorable development and to renew the citizen's faith in the  legislative and executive bodies. The New Slovakia movement  acknowledges the basic principles of modern liberalism, founded  on the inviolability of democratic values, and affirms an  effective market economy that provides social guarantees. The  movement will join the preelection campaign and is counting on  getting into parliament. So far, it is represented in about  half of the districts in the Slovak Republic.</p>

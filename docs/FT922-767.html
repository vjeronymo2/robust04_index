			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (21): No exit, so far - Overstaffing in the public sector EVERY DAY, about 25 workers turn up at a factory in Delhi where, according to management, they are paid to do nothing. The factory's plant was long ago removed by its owner, the electronics company Weston. But repeated requests to the workers that they transfer to another factory or leave with compensation have been turned down. Mr Sunder T. Vachani, managing director, says the 25 are each paid Rs3,000 (Pounds 56) a month, an average wage in Delhi for a production worker, but he adds they spend much of their time asleep. He has not approached the government for permission to make them redundant: he predicts that it would be refused. Weston and thousands of other Indian employers have a surplus of labour, because they are bound by a plethora of rules and regulations which make the redeployment and retrenchment of workers extremely difficult, if not impossible. The government has signalled a willingness to act, but is encountering enormous problems in formulating a policy, both to make it easier for private companies to exit and on 58 so-called sick industry units which it wants to move out of public ownership. With the help of a Dollars 500m loan from the World Bank, it plans to set up a National Renewal Fund to provide resources for dealing with displaced workers. But that is of limited use in a country that has no social security net to catch anyone made redundant but has huge labour surpluses. Overstaffing is most severe in the public sector. The World Bank has identified it as one of the most serious obstacles to Indian industry's competitiveness. It estimates that there is a surplus of 250,000 to 300,000 workers in the public sector; many believe that to be an understatement. Partly as a result, the Indian public sector includes numerous sick units whose liabilities exceed their assets. The 58 units being tackled by the government now have accumulated losses of Rs100bn and a total workforce of 470,000. Private sector employers want an exit policy for the public sector, so that losses can be tackled, inflation rates cut and taxes reduced. But many want a government policy to make it easier for themselves to tackle inefficient workers and loss-making units. In theory, provision already exists, through the Industrial Disputes Act, for closing down unprofitable units. However, job security and compensation arrangements are subject to more than 100 regulations, and the act confers discretionary powers of decision on states and government. However, the laws of many states forbid closure, and states which have a more liberal regime are reluctant to assent to closures and redundancies. Companies which close unilaterally, without permission, face losing plant and equipment without compensation. State governments will often take over the operations and run them at a loss, rather than see workers lose their jobs. Many industrialists believe the success of the economic liberalisation will be jeopardised unless the government formulates an exit policy. 'Entrepreneurs and foreign companies will be reluctant to get into manufacturing if they feel there is no way out if they get into difficulties,' says one. He is having difficulties finalising a joint venture with a Japanese company, because of the lack of an exit policy in India. Among organisations seeking a tougher approach is the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce. Mr V. C. Dutt, its chairman, has called on the government for employers to be able to cut back at least 1 per cent of their workforce without going through the 'proper labour and legal procedures.' But the government, in treading warily on formulating a policy, can claim that the clamour for reform from industry is by no means universal. Mr Tarun Das, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, is sceptical about the need for radical change in labour laws. 'Employers are already shedding labour and their organisations are becoming leaner,' he says. 'Much more needs to be done; there is overmanning across the board. But companies can already do it, provided they have the consent of the unions.' Job-shedding can be achieved even without the consent of unions. Earlier this year, union leaders at Premier Automobiles advised members to turn down an early retirement package, but about 3,000 of the 9,500 workers rejected their advice. In such circumstances, the state did not intervene; nor did it want to. Nonetheless, Mr Vinod L. Doshi, chairman, believes an exit policy is needed. 'We do not envisage it, but if for any reason demand does not pick up and we are in dire trouble, we will have no means of further reducing the workforce. Companies in other countries do not face the same constraints.' With the views of industrialists appearing sometimes to conflict with each other - and the political pressures surrounding the formulation of the policy so great - it is hardly surprising that there have been some confusing and often contradictory messages from senior ministers. As long ago as last December, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minster, promised an announcement within a month. Six months later industry is still waiting. Other ministers and Congress-I spokesmen occasionally say that an exit policy is not under consideration. That, however, is more to do with their regret that the phrase 'exit policy' was ever used, because of the emotions it arouses. Means to retrain and redeploy labour are certainly under consideration, even if some ministers insist that the plans do not include 'retrenchment'. In recent statements Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, has attempted to allay workers' fears that the government's industrial policy would not affect their interests. Implementation of the new policies would not render them jobless, he says. 'Whatever we are doing, we are doing for the welfare of the workers.' Such statements do not convince the trade union leaders, and it is difficult to see how a radical improvement in India's industrial performance can be achieved without significant change to labour laws. That, in turn, is hardly likely to work to the advantage of workers.</p>

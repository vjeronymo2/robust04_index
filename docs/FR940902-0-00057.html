			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is clear that reasonable conditions can be placed on the mechanics of providing access, including time and place restrictions. It is preferable that such management details be developed at the State and local levels and not in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute and the regulations permit customer confidentiality by excluding from mandatory disclosure information which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. A Federal definition of that phrase is unnecessary since it is a term best defined in local situations by State or local law. A State or local privacy law or requirement which prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information which constitutes an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy would not be in conflict with the JTPA public access requirement. On the other hand, the Act's requirement of public access is a statutory condition to the receipt of grant funds and a conflicting State requirement does not excuse a failure to comply. In other words, if a State or local law applicable to all records exempts certain specific kinds of identifying information ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  name, address, social security number or other personal identifying information), it could be applied to restrict the disclosure of some of the information in a JTPA applicant's or participant's file. On the other hand, a State or local law which prohibited disclosure of all employment and training records would sweep so broadly that it would conflict with the Act's disclosure requirement. In order to emphasize that requirement, the informational provision in the regulation that the public access requirement applies ``notwithstanding the provision of the State or local law'' is retained in the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``informational'' statement regarding the Freedom of Information Act produced some confusion and is removed from the final regulation. The only reason this statement was put into the interim final regulation was that the coverage, or non-coverage, of the Federal Freedom of Information Act has been a recurring subject of inquiry. The Freedom of Information Act applies to the disclosure of records in the custody of Federal agencies. In like manner, the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) applies to records described in section 165 of the Act. Section 627.460 records are not Federal records until submitted to the Secretary. Until then, they are not covered by federal ``freedom of information'' or ``privacy'' requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Property Management Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.465 reflects the requirements of section 141(r) of the Act, which provides that the Federal requirements generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments are the requirements governing the title, use, and disposition of real property, equipment, and supplies purchased with JTPA funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal requirements generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments are codified for Department of Labor grant programs at 29 CFR part 97. Therefore, the provisions of those regulations applicable to property requirements are incorporated into this section for governmental recipients and subrecipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal requirements generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments provide that subrecipients that are institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations will follow the Federal agency regulations that implement OMB Circular A&hyph;110, as codified in DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 95 (59 FR 38270 (July 27, 1994), therefore, those requirements are also incorporated into this section for those types of entities. It is expected that this approach will provide administrative relief for such subrecipients since it will prevent an organization administering other Federal grants or subgrants from having to follow two different sets of requirements. In addition, the Federal requirements applicable to intangible personal property have been incorporated into this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are no Federal requirements generally applicable to commercial subrecipients; therefore, &sect;627.465(c) provides specific JTPA requirements for these organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A small number of commenters raised the question of whether prior approval by the Department of Labor is necessary for property acquisitions. Language is added to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to waive any Department of Labor prior approvals relative to property acquisitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

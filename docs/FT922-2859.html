			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Markets Last week's dividend cut from Pilkington and dividend warning from Taylor Woodrow were a reminder of the fragility of UK equity values. On a rolling 12-month basis, growth in UK dividends may now be a mere 1 per cent. In calendar 1992 it could be little better, in which case dividends will have lagged inflation for the third year running. In past recessions, the fall in real dividends was more severe. But these were times of high inflation and lower or negative real interest rates, making the alternatives of cash or bonds more unattractive still. Today, the choice between asset classes is made harder by fresh uncertainty about inflation. If the Maastricht treaty falls apart, the UK's commitment to the ERM may come under renewed scrutiny. It used to be argued that if ERM membership meant the UK could enjoy German inflation rates, gilts no longer needed to offer the same yield premium over equities. If that principle is being challenged at the same time as real dividends continue to fall, what price the yield ratio? The conservative answer would be to trust to equities, however bad the short-term outlook for dividends. The belief that inflation is conquered is less convincing at the bottom of the economic cycle than it would be at the top. And while the importance of a fixed exchange rate system in controlling inflation is real enough, it is worth recalling that when gilt yields first rose above equity yields, in the 1950s and 1960s, sterling was a member of the ERM's predecessor, Bretton Woods.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Top cars to hire for that special occasion - Driving For those special hire car occasions in the UK, you have to admit that a Ford Escort will not really do. Weddings, birthdays, self-indulgent weeks off - these demand something a little more demonstrative than the average small family hatchback that is meat and drink to the usual car hire firm. Having said that, of course, Hertz are running a special offer of a Ford Escort cabriolet - not a car to be sneezed at in these summer months - for Pounds 99 per day, inclusive. You must, however, be at least 30; and the offer closes at the end of September. To be frank, it's a start, but only a start - especially when you consider the alternatives. Wykehams of South Kensington, for instance, will hire you something altogether more adventurous: a Morgan Plus 4, for only Pounds 496.87 per week, insurance not included. And if this true Brit fails to excite you, they also do Alfa Romeo Spyders at the same price. At the other end of the scale, Alan Day Car Rental, based in Swiss Cattage, will let you have an awesome Mercedes S300 for a mere Pounds 1280 per week (plus Pounds 19 per day insurance supplement), or the even more desirable SL280 sports model for Pounds 1575 per week. And for the determinedly eccentric, a Land Rover Defender TDi can be borrowed from 4x4 Motors of Bromsgrove, for only Pounds 320 per week, if you absolutely must drive up a corrie or negotiate a peat bog. If you have a full motorcycle licence, of course, then the place to go is Scootabout, on the Albert Embankment. Its list of rentable motorcycles is too long to explore in detail but, if you need to look like Mickey Rourke for a few days and have no regular machine, they can hire you anything from a Kawasaki GT550 for Pounds 150 per week, up to a Kawasaki GIR 1000 (with appropriately mind-blowing performance) for only Pounds 280 per week. If the truth be told, however, the doyen of exotic car hire must be Modena Car Rentals of Birmingham. Its list of rentables includes everything from a BMW 7-series, to a Ferrari Testarossa and a Bentley Turbo. In between lie such startling pieces of machinery as a TVR Griffith, a Honda NSX and a Porsche 911 Carrera. The prices naturally reflect the rarity of these vehicles, and while the cheapest weekly rate is Pounds 50 (for a Mitsubishi Shogun, of all things), the top rate (for the Testarossa) is Pounds 3783.50, inclusive. Like all the other car hire firms, of course, Modena will quote you a daily rate, but at just under Pounds 600 for the Testarossa, this may be something of a false economy. Given that it costs considerably more for a day than a Morgan for an entire week, you can see that the Testarossa is not to be undertaken lightly. If, on the other hand, it gives your bank manager a seizure when he catches you in it, it can only be money well spent. Hertz Rent a Car, 081 679 1799; Wykehams, 071 589 6894; Alan Day Car Rental, 071 435 1133; 4x4 Motors, 0527 576777; Scootabout, 071 582 0055; Modena Performance Car Rentals, 021 773 0470</p>

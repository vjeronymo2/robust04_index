			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 4 FROM MORNINGSIDE, 1 FROM PALOS VERDES WIN AWARDS  </P> <P> Two players and two coaches from Morningside High School were recipients of  three of four South Bay awards Sunday at The Times All-Star Basketball Brunch  at the Anaheim Hilton.  </P> <P> Lisa Leslie was a repeat selection as girls Player of the Year, Tyrone Paul was  named boys Player of the Year, and Co-Coaches Carl Franklin and Ron Randle were  named boys Coaches of the Year.  </P> <P> Wendell Yoshida of Palos Verdes was named girls Coach of the Year.  </P> <P> The five award winners were honored along with the rest of the 20-player South  Bay All-Star Team. In all, 12 teams representing different circulation areas  were honored at the brunch.  </P> <P> Leslie, named the nation's top schoolgirl player by Gatorade last week,  averaged 26.9 points, 15 rebounds and 6.9 blocked shots as a senior to lead  Morningside to a 32-3 record and its second straight State Division I title.  The 6-foot-5 center capped her four-year varsity career at the state finals  March 17 with 35 points, 12 rebounds and seven blocked shots in a 67-56 win  over Berkeley despite suffering from chickenpox, strep throat and a fever.  </P> <P> Paul, the Southern Section Division III Co-Player of the Year, averaged 20.5  points, seven rebounds, four assists and four blocked shots a game to lead  Morningside to the Ocean League title and a 24-4 mark. The 6-6 senior forward  possesses a 46-inch vertical leap and had many dunks.  </P> <P> Franklin and Randle guided Morningside to the winningest season of any South  Bay boys basketball team. The Monarchs were ranked No. 1 in the state among  Division III schools most of the year and captured their sixth league title in  the last seven years. They were surprised by Lompoc, 83-80, in the Southern  Section 3-AA quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Yoshida led Palos Verdes' girls team to a successful season despite the  graduation of 6-5 twins Heidi and Heather Burge, who as freshmen helped the  University of Virginia reach the NCAA Final Four. Palos Verdes won the Bay  League title -- extending its league-winning streak to 47 games -- and reached  the finals of the Southern Section 3-AA and Regional playoffs, losing both  times to powerful Brea-Olinda. The Sea Kings finished 29-6.  </P></p>

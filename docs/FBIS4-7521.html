			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Damir Zoric, vice president of the Chamber </F> of Zupanijas of the Croatian parliament and a member of the  Small Council of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, by Branko  Podgornik; place and date not given: "The United States Only  Gave a Sign"]    [Text] The Croat-Muslim agreement in Washington should be  supported, but without euphoria, says Damir Zoric, vice  president of the Chamber of Zupanijas of the parliament of the  Republic of Croatia and a member of the Small Council of the  Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS]. Zoric says that this truly  might be a strategic turnaround in Croatian policy, but he adds  that caution must be maintained with respect to the results of  that agreement.    "Some Croatian opposition parties, especially Drazen Budisa  and the HSLS, the Bosnian Croats, and the Franciscans have come  out in favor of a Croat-Muslim agreement, and they did so at a  point when it was not so popular, nor did it bring political  success with most of the public. If at least one human life  would have been saved, the agreement would have been successful.    "Nevertheless, those who have now come into their own should  not be euphoric, nor should they hunt scapegoats, but should  proceed cautiously so that the agreement really bears fruit,  because implementing it will be painful," Zoric warns.    [Podgornik] What do you think about the confederation of  Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina?    [Zoric] Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina can enter into  definite intergovernmental relations only after they become  sovereign over their entire territory. It is in the interest of  Croatia for Bosnia and Herzegovina to remain an integral state,  and for the Croats to be equal citizens in it. But it seems as  though some people see in this proposal a confederation of a  truncated Croatia with a detached piece of Bosnia and  Herzegovina. That would be a triumph for the conception held by  Serbian expansionism, which means death to both Croatia and  Bosnia and Herzegovina, because those two states, whether in  confederation or separate, would be territorially untenable in  the face of an expanded chetnik Serbia, which is ravaging our  entrails.    [Podgornik] But the United States guarantees that it will  support the territorial integrity of Croatia, so it seems that  we have never been closer to recovery of the occupied  territories.    [Zoric] It is true that the United States has changed its  policy toward that area. But, if I might so put it, the United  States has only given a sign to Croatia and Bosnia and  Herzegovina. There still is not a single reliable manifestation  that the United States is really thinking seriously. The United  States sent an ultimatum to the Serbs around Sarajevo, but that  ultimatum also threatens the Croats around Mostar. Clinton said  that the United States has found its strategic interest here;  however, this happened at the same time when Saudi Arabia was  announcing that it would invest $8 billion to buy U.S. aircraft.  The question is whether that will be enough. At the same time,  it is easy to see from the Serbian media that with their most  recent offensives in Bosnia and the violation of the truce in  Croatia they have actually been testing to what extent the  Americans are willing to persist in their new course of policy.  <H5>  The Specter of a Revived Yugoslavia Is Abroad </H5>   [Podgornik] Are you afraid of a revival of Yugoslavia?    [Zoric] That danger does exist. For instance, the Croats and  Muslims create a federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and want  to marry it to Croatia--so that Bosnia and Herzegovina formally  remains intact, but with the status of the Bosnian Serbs  unresolved. What in that case could prevent the international  community from allowing the Bosnian Serbs confederation with  Serbia? When you have that kind of asymmetrical confederation  with a Bosnia and Herzegovina that exists as a legal entity, you  could get Yugoslavia in the course of a single night.    [Podgornik] When could a referendum be held of the  population  concerning the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and  Herzegovina?    [Zoric] That referendum could be legitimate only if it could  be conducted in the areas now occupied as well. If it were not  conducted in the areas occupied as well, the referendum might  legalize the amputation of a fourth of the territory of the  Republic of Croatia.    [Podgornik] What consequences will the Washington agreement  have on the domestic scene of Croatia?    [Zoric] I think that the Croatian Government has made a good  move and should now encourage creation of confidence and  national consensus among the Croatian political forces. But the  responsibility for that, I would say, lies above all on the  opposition, which at this point ought not to cause nervousness  and hunt scapegoats for the past, because that could be  devastating to the process of peace between Croats and Muslims.  For those who favor Croat-Muslim cooperation, the fact that  there is an agreement is much more important than to seek  justice or a gain for the party. I am convinced of that, and I  would like to see that happen, at least as far as my HSLS is  concerned. Nervousness would not favor the Croats in Bosnia nor  the Croats in Herzegovina, for various reasons.  <H5>  The Baneful "Tito's Youth" </H5>   [Podgornik] Does this mean that the HSLS will now be less  critical of the government?    [Zoric] No. We have not been critical of the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Union] just because of the disastrous policy toward  Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now that  one of the sore points for the nationality has started to move  toward resolution, the opposition ceases to be hostage to the  issue of Bosnia and has been given more room. Now we can be  still more critical of the incumbent party when it comes to  denationalization, transformation of ownership, and many moves  made in the economic area.    [Podgornik] Could implementation of the Washington agreement  encounter any serious resistance in a segment of the incumbent  party or the opposition?    [Zoric] There are more grounds for supporting the agreement  than the other way around. Some people will see the agreement as  a continuation of Croatian policy, others as a change of  direction, still others as an alliance against a common enemy,  and yet others as the interest of the nationality or the human  interest.    The conduct of the new policy, however, could be very  painful  in Herzegovina. The policy of reaching agreement between Croats  and Muslims is out of step with the facts and emotions at the  moment, and we should therefore take care that its  implementation does not conflict with reality. Another question  is whether the same people can carry out two concepts that are  so different, those people who have gone from war to alliance. I  am afraid that resistance could arise to people who as  bureaucrats go too far in carrying out particular directives. In  the HDZ of Bosnia and Herzegovina there are people who do not go  abroad because they might have certain problems with foreign  judiciaries.    [Podgornik] You are referring to Mate Boban?    [Zoric] I am referring to "Tito's Youth," who are today  ruling Herceg- Bosna. Those who at one time sweated profusely in  labor brigades in order to earn badges as shockworkers. Some  people who are today guiding the HDZ as a people's party of  Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina at one time had the first  founders of the HDZ in Herzegovina called in for police  interviews. They are very clever political operatives, but not  very clever with their own people, whom they are now putting  between the rock and the hard place, and in the end they have  driven many people in Herzegovina crazy.    Look at the result. The Herzegovinians are humiliated. The  rest of the nationality looks on them as the problem causing  unrest all over Croatia. And it is well-known that the  Herzegovinians are that part of the Croatian nation, formerly  and now, who from the depth of their soul have been fighting  with their lives and resources for Croatian independence even  against Yugoslavia, which signifies death to Croatia and Croats.    Today, their political leaders are issuing reports to the  effect that there are supposedly no problems in Herzegovina.  However, there certainly are problems in Herzegovina. People are  confused, because they were waging war for a cause, they were  losing their lives, their children, their husbands, their farms.  They had more casualties in the war with the Muslims than with  the Serbs. Today, many people are asking: Why? That question is  troubling a great number of people who have sizable families,  and they are living in complete economic and political  uncertainty and confusion. This is the average destiny of most  people who until yesterday were told that they would be the  masters of Herceg-Bosna and that Neum was Croatian. And today  they are being given explanations that under the Washington  agreement Croatia would be allowed passage through Neum and that  what is happening to them and Croatia constitutes a continuation  of a successful policy. If Croatian political forces do not act  cautiously, I am afraid that the Herzegovinians could again end  up on what for them is the perpetual "wrong side." That is in  fact why I cautioned that the opposition now has greater  responsibility than the government, because this is a question  of fundamental interest to the nationality.  <H5>  There Is No Split in the HSLS </H5>   [Podgornik] Is the HSLS threatened with a split such as has  happened in the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] or the IDS [Istrian  Democratic Conference]?    [Zoric] No. In the course of the fierce campaign against us,  the HSLS proved that it is a mature political party. Maturity is  not a consequence of complete and doctrinaire unanimity of  opinion in a party, but above all of responsibility and  practicality. The HSLS is a political alternative to the  incumbent party in its program, its strength, and the people it  brings together.    [Podgornik] Can the HSLS remain the second party? How do you  interpret the disagreements in the party which have even broken  through to the public?    [Zoric] The HSLS can remain the second party, but it will  not, it will do everything to become the first party. As for the  second question, let us say that perhaps we have a good  conception of political marketing. We live on the public's  interest in us, so we have taken pains to interest people in  something that sounds more enticing, more unusual.    [Podgornik] Are you really the leader of the "harder ethnic  line" in the HSLS?    [Zoric] Many people have attributed that to me. Because I do  not see what is bad about that, I can publicly admit that it is  my honor to be perceived that way. We are a democratic party,  and with us every position is won through a competition in which  there is a candidate and an opposing candidate, so some win and  some lose. That will also happen in the party convention in May,  but that will not signify a split. For example, there are seven  candidates for the four vice presidents of the HSLS. If one of  the candidates loses in a race with me, that will not signify a  split, but will mean that the party is organized along  democratic lines. We operate along democratic lines even within  the party, which is why I think we are able to bring Croatia  real democracy.    [Podgornik] You recently made a trip to the United States  with Ivan Herak, who during that trip was expelled from the IDS.  Will he really become a member of the HSLS?    [Zoric] I have talked to Herak a great deal, and I think  that  these are very close political ideas. I naturally tried to  persuade him to come over to the HSLS and I will be glad if I  managed to persuade Herak. I would also like Denis Jelenkovic to  come to the HSLS. I think that the HSLS has a great chance of  success in Istria, because it is the second party there, and  Drazen Budisa, you recall, obtained a convincing majority of the  votes among all the presidential candidates in the election.</p>

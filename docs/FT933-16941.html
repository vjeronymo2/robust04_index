			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / People: SIB poaches solicitor The Securities and Investments Board has appointed Guy Sears, a solicitor with City law firm Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens, to the newly-created position of head of enforcement litigation. Civil litigation is a growing part of SIB's enforcement activities. There have been 46 cases in the last five years involving injunctions, restitution orders and compulsory liquidations under the Financial Services Act. The growing case load prompted SIB to develop the capacity to handle the work in-house. Until now it has relied on law firms such as Denton Hall to do the litigation work for it. Sears has done several cases for SIB and has considerable experience in insolvency litigation, making him a natural choice, a former colleague at Denton Hall said. Sears, who will join SIB's legal division today, said that over the next two to three years he hoped to build up SIB's capacity to handle all but the very largest cases in-house. By moving to SIB he has given up the chance of high future earnings as a partner in a lucrative City law firm, but, confessing to ambitions in the regulatory field, he said he had never viewed law firm partnership 'as the be-all and end-all'. Just 32, he came late to the law having read natural sciences at Jesus College, Cambridge, qualifying as a solicitor in 1987. Law, however, runs in the family. His father is a judge in Hong Kong.</p>

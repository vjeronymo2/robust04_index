			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that Egyptian Prime Minister Dr.  'Atif Sidqi has urged the Jordanian Government to respond  positively to the requirements of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement, both the political part which was signed in Cairo,  and the economic part which was recently signed in Paris.    Dr. Sidqi, who led the Egyptian side to the meetings of the  Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, has linked the  reactivation of Egyptian-Jordanian economic cooperation with  Jordan's response to the strategic U.S. policies, "which Egypt  is concerned about implementing in the field of comprehensive  development in the region," as Sidqi put it, and which Egypt  cannot disregard.    He said that his visit to Amman reflects Egypt's concern  about reactivating Jordan's role in the economic plan set for  the region, which will begin in the occupied territories, in  which Jordan is a key player, and which will eventually lead to  the creation of a Middle East economic entity, and later a  political entity.</p>

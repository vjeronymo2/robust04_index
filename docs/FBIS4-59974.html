			<p>BFN     [Text] Today the Islamic nation is celebrating Jerusalem  Day according the Jerusalem Committee's resolution, issued at  its meeting in Fez on 19-20 April 1984 under the chairmanship of  His Majesty King Hassan II, God make him victorious, the  chairman of the Committee.    Today is an occasion for more than 1 billion Muslims  throughout the world to renew their insistence on the Arabic  character of this holy city, despite the Zionist practices to  obliterate its Arab and Islamic features.    King Hassan II, the chairman of Jerusalem Committee, had  emphasized during one the Committee's sessions that we should  use all our human and material strength and potential to up hold  the word of right and to persuade those who know and those who  do not or who are pretending not to know that our rights should  be returned as soon as possible.    This gracious royal invitation to return the right to its  legitimate owners reflects the effort made and being made to  support the issues of Islam and the Muslims.    While commemoration of Jerusalem Day is coinciding this year  with the peace process in the Middle East, and especially in the  land of Palestine where the Palestinian authority has assumed  its duties in the self-rule areas, what has been achieved  represents only one step of many that are required to be made on  the path of achieving a just and comprehensive peace.    No doubt Jerusalem will remain the core issue in any  settlement in the area, and the question of recovering it will  remain a joint nationalist and Islamic preoccupation. It will  remain the objective toward which the Palestinian, Arab, and  Muslim generations will aspire.</p>

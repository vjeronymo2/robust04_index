			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN CAR SALES SPUR RECORD OUTPUT  </P> <P> Spurred by brisk domestic demand, Japan's production of motor vehicles in April  hit a monthly record of 1,091,977 units, up 1.4% over a year ago, the Japan  Automobile Manufacturers' Assn. reported today.  </P> <P> The association said domestic sales grew 6.2% to 569,797 units, a record for  any April. Exports decreased about 10% because of sluggish demand overseas,  coupled with the yen's appreciation, the association said.  </P> <P> Introduction in April of a lower sales tax, replacing the higher commodity  levy, was responsible for brisk sales, association officials said. The uniform  6% tax on car sales replaced the commodity tax, which had ranged from 18.5% to  23%.  </P></p>

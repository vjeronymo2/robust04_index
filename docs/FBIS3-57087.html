The document indicates, in particular, that Duma deputies  must enjoy the right to be immediately received by the leaders  of organs of power at all levels and are entitled to demand that  they eliminate violations that have been identified, while for  their part the leaders of organs of power must eliminate the  violations.    A considerable proportion of the draft decree is devoted to  questions of material support for legislators. For instance, it  is proposed to establish for Duma deputies a monthly salary of  90 percent of a federal minister's salary. That is, around  270,000 rubles at present. However, additional payments will  make up for the lag in relation to ministerial pay. All  deputies will receive presumably monthly a 50-percent additional  payment "in view of the special nature and intensity of work."  There will also be additional payments for particular posts.  The State Duma chairman gets [an additional payment of] 40  percent of a deputy's salary, and his deputies and the chairmen  of Duma committees and subcommittees get 25 percent. There is  also provision for long-service payments -- 40 percent. In  addition, all deputies are reimbursed for expenses associated  with legislative activity to the tune of 10 minimum salaries.    Duma deputies, like their predecessors, will have free use  of  all types of transportation apart from taxis and will have the  right to get tickets without waiting in line and to wait for the  required forms of transportation in the former deputies' rooms.    Diplomatic passports will be issued to State Duma deputies  for their entire term of powers.    As for housing, the draft decree envisages allocating  legislators from outside the city official housing within three  months, but only for the period during which they exercise a  deputy's powers and without the right of privatization.    The document also takes into account the possibility of  dissolution of the Duma. In this case deputies must be paid a  one-shot grant for the entire period remaining until the end of  the term for which they were elected. They must also be granted  free return to their home and the free shipment of up to 10  tonnes of baggage. Final adoption of the decree is planned for  the evening sitting.    The main topic of the first half of this Duma workday was  discussion of the draft decree of the Federal Assembly's lower  chamber on the plan of legislative work.    Overall this day in the State Duma is again going fairly  quietly. Routine work is proceeding. At the same time State  Duma security services are tightening security measures since a  REUTER correspondent was reportedly detained in possession of a  pistol on the balcony of the Duma meeting hall. Apparently it  was a gas pistol.</p>

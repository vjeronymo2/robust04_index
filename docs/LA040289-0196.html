			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD TIME TO PLANT JAPANESE MAPLE TREE  </P> <P> Now is a good time to plant a Japanese maple tree -- it fits into any garden.  It grows as a small tree or shrub that offers spring growth in a red color,  soft green summer leaves and fall foliage of scarlet, orange or yellow. As a  bonus, it provides a graceful silhouette of delicate green or red branches in  the winter.  </P></p>

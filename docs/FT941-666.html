			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Move on flight control sell-off: Break-up of UK aviation authority set to be pushed forward The government is expected to press forward later this week with its proposal to privatise the Civil Aviation Authority's air traffic control services. Under the plan, the CAA would retain its role as a regulatory agency but all air traffic control services would form part of a new private body. The move would enable the CAA to tap financial markets to help fund a Pounds 400m modernisation programme, but is expected to spark concerns over safety. Critics also question the privatisation of a service aimed at giving airlines and passengers best value and lowest costs since the new body would be under pressure to improve margins. The government announced its intention to privatise the CAA's National Air Traffic Services in the November budget, when it said it would set up a working party to draw up proposals. These have now been completed and the government is expected to announce on Thursday its decision to launch the necessary consultation process ahead of privatisation. The CAA has already split its air traffic control operations from its regulatory activities and these have been run with increasing managerial efficiency. This has been reflected in an improvement in air traffic flows to and from the UK. Average delays on outbound flights fell by 39 per cent from 1992 to 1993 and delays on inbound flights fell by 23 per cent during the same period. Investments in air traffic control infrastructure are expected to total about Pounds 400m between now and the end of the century and the government is keen to encourage private funding for these projects. The CAA has already started developing an air traffic service centre in Hampshire and another centre is now scheduled to be built near Glasgow to replace the older facilities at Prestwick. Until now, the government has set the CAA a target of 8 per cent return on capital. In the year to March 1993, the CAA made a profit of Pounds 11m on turnover of Pounds 569m. Air traffic control accounts for about two-thirds of the CAA's total payroll of 7,300. The CAA shares air traffic control facilities with the Ministry of Defence, which is responsible for military air space and some commercial flights, including Concorde supersonic flights. Another potential problem with privatisation is the fact that UK air traffic control charges are collected by the European Eurocontrol agency and paid back to the CAA. Modifications would probably have to be made if the UK decided to set up a private air traffic control agency.</p>

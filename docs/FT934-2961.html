			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts continue to benefit from post-auction euphoria UK government bonds continued to rise yesterday, benefiting from post-auction euphoria, the favourable inflation background and hopes of another base rate cut. In spite of all the new supply, the gilt market managed to rise a further 3/4 of a point at the long end yesterday. The Bank of England - which succeeded in selling Pounds 3bn of 6 3/4 per cent stock due 2004 at Wednesday's auction - sold at least another Pounds 800m of assorted tap stocks yesterday as investor appetite for gilts remained strong. The Bank sold out two of the four tranches announced on Wednesday afternoon: a Pounds 400m tranche of 6 per cent stock due 1999 and a Pounds 400m tranche of 8 per cent stock due 2013, both of which were exhausted early in the day. Dealers said the low inflation background was generating a lot of interest in longer-dated gilt issues, especially since the November RPI figure due out next week was expected to be good. In addition, some investors appeared keen to put any surplus cash into the market for the year-end. 'No-one wants to be seen sitting on cash, given the shape of the yield curve,' said one dealer. European government bonds showed strong gains on hopes of lower interest rates and led mainly by a technical rally in the German market. The German long bond futures contract, which opened at 100.46, reached an all-time high of 100.87 before slipping back to 100.77 by late afternoon. Dealers said once the contract broke through its previous high of 100.66, it spurred a flurry of buying which drove the market higher. The long end of the market outperformed the short end, leading to a flattening of the yield curve. Also providing a welcome lift for bunds was the downward revision yesterday in western Germany's November inflation rate to 3.6 per cent year-on-year from a preliminary 3.7 per cent. French government bonds continued their rally, taking their cue from the German market and helped by the strength of the franc which stayed comfortably within its former European exchange rate mechanism bands. 'People are expecting to see a German rate cut and that would pave the way for the Bank of France to ease,' said one dealer. The March futures contract on the Matif ended up 0.26 at 129.30, while in the cash market, investors were mainly interested in longer-dated issues. The November consumer price data is due to be released today and is expected to show a rise of 0.1 per cent from October, giving a year-on-year rise of 2.2 per cent. The high-yielding European bond markets of Spain and Italy spurted, but the sharp rise was more a sign of them catching up with the other European markets after the recent public holidays, rather than a reaction to domestic news. The Italian government bond future rose to a high of 117.00 up from Wednesday's close of 116.61. In recent days, investors have been shifting out of three-year bonds and switching further up the yield curve to the five-10 year area. The US Treasury market bounced back yesterday from a setback that immediately followed news that an important measure of producer prices had risen at a slightly higher-than-expected rate. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 ahead at 101 9/32 , with the yield easing to 6.15 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 4.149 per cent. With traders widely anticipating a very positive reading, the release of November price data was somewhat of a letdown. The Labor Department said that core prices, excluding the more volatile food and energy components, had increased 0.4 per cent, while the overall index was unchanged. Forecasts had centred on a 0.2 per cent rise in the core rate.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Afghans sign peace accord AFGHANISTAN'S rival mujahideen leaders shook hands and embraced in a rare show of goodwill yesterday, as leaders of seven factions and Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani, the president, signed an agreement to end factional fighting. Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, played host and acted as the principal negotiator during the six-day talks. The agreement brought Afghanistan's two leading foes together. President Rabbani and his chief rival, Mr Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, shook hands and sat down for face-to-face talks, their first such meeting in more than six months. Under the agreement, Mr Rabbani will remain president for 18 months while Mr Hekmatyar will assume office as prime minister. However, the leaders were unable to decide the most divisive issue of allocating cabinet posts, and agreed only to form a new cabinet in 15 days. The future of Afghanistan's powerful defence minister, Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, and that of the powerful Uzbek general, Rashid Dostum, also remains uncertain. Mr Hekmatyar has been demanding that Mr Masood should be removed from the Defence Ministry, because both he and President Rabbani belong to the same party. In the agreement, there were no clear provisions for including Gen Dostum in the government or for any high offices to be given to his party, the Junbish-i-milee, to gain his support. At least 5,000 people have been reported injured and hundreds killed in rocket attacks on the capital, Kabul, launched by Mr Hekmatyar's men, since the beginning of the year.</p>

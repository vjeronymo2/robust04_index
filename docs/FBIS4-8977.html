			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Today's Meeting Between President and </F> SLD Deputies; Walesa Will Go to the Field"]    [Text] Yesterday morning Lech Walesa received an  invitation to meet with the Deputies' Club of the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD]. The president decided to accept it because  "one does not refuse to meet organized social forces of over  five or 10 persons." The president's spokesman stated that the  meeting will be held today at 1700. As it seems, the subject of  the meeting will be the conflict between the coalition and the  Belweder. At noon, the president is supposed to meet with Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy.    Commenting on the proposal of amending the Small  Constitution, Lech Walesa said in an interview for the PAP press  agency that he cannot underestimate an initiative that "may be a  great fire. Therefore, I must sometimes, at the beginning,  strike in such a way as to make everyone think."    The president also said: "I will not do anything that would  show that I am violating the law. I will ask the people whether  the Basic Law and the political system of the country may be  changed when some political group is built for two hours.... I  will establish a force that will not allow this to happen, and  it was in this sense that I said this force will resolve the  parliament. It will be entitled to that. It is in the interest  of the state and in the interest of each of us to see to it that  any accidental changes in the system do not take place.... I  reacted in this way in the name of responsibility for the future  of the state."    Asked about his reaction to the self-governmental elections  ordered by the prime minister, Lech Walesa stated that Waldemar  Pawlak should not have done this because the deadline for  signing the electoral law is 21 April. He said that it was the  first time he had to complain about the prime minister, and he  points out to him that one should not act this way. The  president also announced that, starting on Friday, he would go  to the field, he would discuss all these issues with people, and  he would persuade them to force their deputies to resolve  problems well and logically.    "We would like to tell the president about the intentions we  have when we are resolving a dispute between the supreme  authorities of the state," said SLD Spokesman Zbigniew  Siemiatkowski--"a dispute that, as a consequence, may paralyze  them and cause imponderable results."    Siemiatkowski would not confirm that the meeting, proposed  only by the SLD (the club of the Polish Peasant Party--the  PSL--has not invited the president to a talk so far), proves  that the SLD is carrying the burden of the conflict with the  president. He also said that a meeting with the entire club  does not rule out the possibility of talks in a smaller group;  he did not want to discuss any conditions or limits of the  compromise that the SLD is willing to reach. He stressed that  there will be no preliminary conditions on which both parties  would be ready to meet. According to the SLD spokesman, the  prime minister had to schedule the elections for 19 June because  it was the only possible date.    It is unofficially evaluated in the Sejm that today's  meeting  proves that the parties to the conflict want to reach an  agreement. This would mean that it would not be necessary to  amend the Small Constitution, and the president may unblock the  issue of the nomination to the vacant posts in the government.    A meeting of the governing coalition was scheduled to take  place on Tuesday [19 April] evening. The plans were  complicated by the prolonged session of the government.  Nonetheless, late in the evening, in the premises of the Office  of the Council of Ministers, there was a meeting of the  representatives of the coalition, including Aleksander  Kwasniewski, Jozef Oleksy, and Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the SLD, as  well as the PSL's Jozef Zych. Journalists did not receive any  information on the subject of the talks.</p>

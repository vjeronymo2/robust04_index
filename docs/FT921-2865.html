			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Observer: Inflationary Britain's Labour party may pretend that it is not going to screw the City, but Observer remains highly sceptical. Take yesterday's shadow Budget statement. Cost of the 12-page booklet plus a few tables is Pounds 25. The government's equivalent 80-page Red Book costs Pounds 9.65 and for Pounds 30 you can take out a year's subscription to the Bank of England's very informative bulletin. The young press officer at Labour's Walworth Road headquarters insists that the price is set by supply and demand. However, an old Labour hand tells me that one has to charge a lot, or people don't think it is a serious document. . . .</p>

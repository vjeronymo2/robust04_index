			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ST. JOHN'S BURIES USD EARLY IN LAPCHICK TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Malik Sealy scored 20 points Saturday and No. 20 St. John's beat the University  of San Diego, 74-59, in the opening round of the Lapchick Memorial Tournament.  </P> <P> The Redmen (4-1) play Wright State in today's championship game. Wright State  (2-0) beat South Alabama, 96-82, in the other first-round game.  </P> <P> Gylan Dottin scored 12 points and John Jerome added 10 for USD (2-2), which  plays South Alabama (1-2) in today's consolation game.  </P> <P> St. John's has never lost a game in the tournament it hosts, and the 15th  edition's first game was never in doubt. The Redmen jumped to an 18-2 lead and  led, 42-12, with 4:09 left in the first half. USD made just eight of 32 field  goal attempts (25%) in the first half.  </P> <P> "I think we were intimidated early on," USD Coach Hank Egan said. "We had that  look that can put you in a catatonic state. I'm not proud of the way they  played, but I'm proud of these people.  </P> <P> "You can run, but you can't hide. You have to play all 40 minutes."  </P> <P> The Redmen dominated the boards, and the Toreros couldn't keep up with the  running game as they didn't break into double figures until 7:28 was left in  the half.  </P> <P> Every St. John's player available played in the first half, and the Redmen's  biggest lead of the first half was the half-time margin of 50-18.  </P> <P> St. John's then opened the second half with an 8-3 run for its largest lead of  the game, 58-21 with 16:08 left.  </P> <P> The Redmen then went scoreless for the next 4:50 and were not as sharp as in  the first half while USD chipped away at the lead. USD outscored St. John's,  41-24, in the second half. The final score was the closest margin of the second  half.  </P></p>

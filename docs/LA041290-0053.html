			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOME S.D. EXPORTERS READY TO REAP BENEFITS OF EUROPEAN CHANGES IN '92  </P> <P> As exports go, the 20-foot-high, inflatable red Fiat sent to France last week  by an El Cajon manufacturer may not appear to be all that substantial a  commodity.  </P> <P> But the balloon, created by Bigger Than Life Inc. for the auto maker's French  distributor, could be a visible symbol of the opportunities awaiting some San  Diego County exporters in 1992, when the 12-nation European Community market  becomes generally more accessible to foreign manufacturers.  </P> <P> Bigger Than Life, which specializes in promotional inflatables, is one of  several San Diego exporters that plan to intensify European trade efforts in  1992 and after. As a manufacturer of nontechnical or unlicensed goods, Bigger  Than Life officials say, their company in particular stands to benefit from  pending changes in European Community trade laws.  </P> <P> "We really would like to move into Europe more heavily," said Peg Trumper,  Bigger Than Life's international sales supervisor. The European Community's  changes will allow the 5-year-old company's distributors to more easily ship  their products to events in various nations, she said.  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the new European Community rules is the elimination of  certain physical, technical and fiscal barriers to trade. Stoppages at customs  posts will be reduced, and uniform customs documentation will be introduced for  all countries, eliminating the need for scores of different forms.  </P> <P> The European Community will also introduce standardized industrial  specifications and requirements that will make it much simpler for foreign  manufacturers to produce, package and market products for all of Europe. The  new standards, which take effect Jan. 1, 1992, will also eliminate differing  tariff rates.  </P> <P> However, manufacturers of technical goods, such as medical equipment and  biotechnology products, will still require export licenses from destination  countries and so may not necessarily find a smoother path to the European  market. For that reason, international trade analysts are at odds on just how  beneficial the new trade rules will be for many of San Diego's high-tech  companies.  </P> <P> Dick Powell, director of the U. S. Commerce Department's San Diego district  office, said the new rules will have minimal effect on the "several hundred"  local high-tech companies that are already experienced exporters to Europe, for  whom the European Community's changes will require only minor marketing  adaptations.  </P> <P> Of local manufacturers' $2.6 billion in export sales in 1988, the last year for  which figures are available, about 26% of that was to Europe, Powell said. The  amount nearly equals the 28% of total export sales destined for customers in  Pacific Rim nations.  </P> <P> "Pacific Rim, Pacific Rim, Pacific Rim is all you hear," Powell said. "What  happened to the European Rim? Just the fact that we do about the same amount of  business there that we do in the Pacific Rim is a surprise to everybody,  including the media, because all the hype is on the Pacific Rim."  </P> <P> The Commerce Department's San Diego office has been deluged with inquiries from  businesses about the prospects of selling products in newly democratized  Eastern European markets, Powell said. But local exporters probably won't make  much headway into the Eastern bloc until the market infrastructure of  distributors, dealers and sales representatives is developed, Powell said.  </P> <P> Still, the European market changes have been beneficial in that they have  caused many local small businesses to finally focus attention on international  trade opportunities.  </P> <P> "The big problem most small business people have is they are simply not aware  that there is potential outside the United States. That's the problem," Powell  said, "whether it's EC '92 or Pacific Rim."  </P> <P> Mary Teagarden, a professor of international management at San Diego State  University, predicted that small businesses will more easily gain access to  specialized markets in Europe as a result of the upcoming changes.  </P> <P> "Consumer tastes will remain individualistic," Teagarden said. Germans will  still be Germans, Italians will still be Italians, each with their own likes  and dislikes, she said. It will not be "a United States of Europe," Teagarden  said.  </P> <P> Many small firms now find it difficult to compete in Europe because of the  costs incurred to build a product to the varying specifications of the  different countries. Now, there may be up to 12 different requirements on the  same components for household electrical appliances.  </P> <P> In addition, exporters to the European Community must deal with myriad tariffs  and 12 currencies. Simply moving goods from country to country "has been a  major headache" because of bureaucratic obstacles, Teagarden said. The new  rules promise to do away with all the differences, thereby ensuring one  standardized marketplace.  </P> <P> However, Teagarden said, U. S. businesses should not expect immediate results.  "Everyone's looking at it like it's going to happen overnight," she said. "I  think it will be a slow transition, a very political transition. It will happen  incrementally."  </P> <P> Some executives said the changes are more a cause for concern than excitement.  Hal Stitt, vice president of marketing for Wavetek Corp., predicted that a  smaller number of larger manufacturers will arise to dominate the standardized  market.  </P> <P> "The American industry is enamored with the thought that a united Europe will  make it easier to sell," said Stitt, who is also a committee chairman for the  San Diego chapter of the American Electronics Assn., an industry trade group.  "American businessmen need to plan to protect their own turf, because it's  going to come under attack."  </P> <P> Wavetek, a test and measurement equipment manufacturer, has sold its products  in Europe since the early 1970s. European exports represented about 20% of  Wavetek's $85.2 million in sales in the fiscal year ended last September.  </P> <P> Of the upcoming changes, Stitt said: "It's kind of like having a bear outside  your tent. That causes a little excitement more than caution."  </P> <P> As far as Bigger Than Life is concerned, the changes in Europe can only help it  take advantage of what in 1992 will become the most populous industrialized  market in the world. The 12 countries that make up the European Community have  about 320 million consumers -- 30% more than the population of the United  States -- with a purchasing power of about $4 trillion, according to Commerce  Department figures.  </P> <P> Bigger Than Life's giant inflatables are assembled at its 52,000-square-foot  manufacturing plant on Fayette Street in El Cajon. The company employs 120  artists, designers, production and sales employees.  </P> <P> Bigger Than Life projects that its 1990 sales will total $8 million, up from $6  million in 1989. Exports will account for about 15% of 1990 sales, with nearly  half those shipments going to Europe.  </P> <P> Trumper said increased marketing of the company's colorful inflatables, which  range from facsimiles of Bugs Bunny to beer bottles, should mean European sales  will continue to increase. The European Community's changes are an added  benefit "because we're already there," she said. "We're already ready for it."  </P> <P> Past and present clients have included Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Levi Strauss  and others in the United States and abroad. But perhaps its best known creation  was a 55-foot helium-filled replica of Superman made for the Rose Parade that  broke free of its tethers in November, 1988.  </P> <P> After a 30-minute cruise that included a foray into Lindbergh Field flight  patterns, the gas-filled caped crusader crashed on Cowles Mountain about 3  miles west of El Cajon.  </P></p>

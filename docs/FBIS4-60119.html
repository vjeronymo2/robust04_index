			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Israeli occupation Army has today decided to  prevent the Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip from entering  the rest of occupied Palestine. [passage omitted]    More details from our correspondent in the occupied  territories:    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] The first  challenge faced by the Israeli-Palestinian agreement has been  represented by two armed attacks in the Gaza Strip on Israeli  soldiers. [passage omitted]    Radwan Abu 'Ayyash, chief of the Palestinian radio and  television authority, commented on the operations by saying:    [Abu 'Ayyash] Naturally, such incidents have a negative  affect on the peace process, but they could also be a necessary  incentive for putting an end to the occupation and putting an  end to these consecutive waves of violence, be it by this or  that side. This requires us to work relentlessly and without  weariness to achieve a comprehensive and just settlement for the  Palestinian people, and security for all the inhabitants of the  region.    [Correspondent] [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

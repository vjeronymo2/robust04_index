			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedish bank moves back into the black NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-owned bank, said falling interest rates and rationalisation helped it achieve a SKr1.7bn (Dollars 211m) profit in the first six months of the year. In the same 1992 period it suffered a SKr5.2bn loss. The figures are not strictly comparable as the bank's position has been strengthened following a reconstruction at the start of the year when SKr50bn of problem loans were transferred to a separate state entity called Securum. This cut the number of the bank's non-performing loans to a quarter of its previous level and created the conditions for a strong recovery in profitability. Operating profit before credit losses rose to SKr4.52bn in the first half from SKr1.39bn, reflecting an increase in net interest earnings and lower costs. Credit losses dropped sharply to SKr2.78bn from SKr6.61bn. Just over SKr1bn of these losses were related to the transfer of assets and reserves to Securum. The bank said non-performing loans fell to SKr10.4bn at the end of June compared with SKr11.1bn at the start of the year (excluding Securum). It added that its pro-forma capital adequacy ratio increased from 8.9 per cent to 10.0 per cent over the same period. Nordbanken said its full-year result would exceed the half-year level, although it warned that second-half profits would not be as large as in the first six months. Last year, the bank suffered a SKr16.0bn operating loss, the biggest deficit ever disclosed by a Swedish bank. 'The outlook seems good for even lower interest rates, which is good both for customers borrowing from the bank and for the bank's investment activities,' Nordbanken stated. The government eventually intends to return Nordbanken to the private sector, although it has not set a timetable for the move.</p>

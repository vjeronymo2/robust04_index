			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Statistics chief seeks business links MR BILL McLENNAN, head of the Government Statistical Service, is looking for ways to improve the data it can offer government departments and businesses. An internal inquiry into the operations of the service is trying to find and fill gaps in the provision of data. Mr McLennan wants the service to form stronger links with the business world, mainly because he believes better business contacts will focus statisticians' minds on data that other people find useful. He also wants the service to examine ways to gain more finance via private-sector sales. The investigation covers the statistical work of about 30 Whitehall departments and has been ordered by Mr McLennan. The study, due to be completed by the end of this year, is likely to focus on specific items of data that could be sold to companies, either directly by the government or through private-sector statistical agencies. The statistical service, which employs about 5,000 people, of whom 700 are statisticians, has an annual budget of about Pounds 120m, virtually all of which is met from public funds. The service co-ordinates the statistical work of officials in a range of government departments including health, transport, social security, employment, trade and industry and defence. The inquiry is likely to focus on ways to: Obtain from different government departments statistics that relate to specific regions of the UK, for instance in the field or housing or environmental issues. Allow individual departments to pool more of their data, for example to determine the statistical links between areas such as unemployment and health. Use computers and telecommunications more effectively to channel data between government departments and users. Bring together in an accessible form specific kinds of data of interest to the business world. Link sources of statistics in the UK more closely with those in other parts of Europe to enable a better comparison of broad trends in areas such as transport or social security. Identify new surveys which might be needed to plug gaps in knowledge, for instance concerning the service industry which is less well monitored than manufacturing. Mr McLennan, an Australian who was appointed to the GSS just over a year ago, has recently won the approval of ministers to redirect the work of the service to make its work more relevant to companies as well as to other parts of the government. He is also director of the Central Statistical Office, which is mainly concerned with economic data and answers to the Treasury. He has introduced more rigorous procedures in the CSO to reduce leaks of sensitive economic information.</p>

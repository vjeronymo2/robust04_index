			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese top official on  Hong Kong affairs Lu Ping said here today that Hong Kong's last  Legislative Council and district boards will not be passed  through 1997 and China will not compromise on this matter of  principle. Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of  the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory Committee  for Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said this  during a meeting between the Chinese mainland members at the  committee and Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese National  People's Congress and local members of the national committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Lu  said his committee will take into full consideration opinions  from all walks of life in Hong Kong in order to ensure a smooth  transfer of power in 1997. He stated that China originally  hoped to solve the "through train" for the last Legislative  Council in the territory, but the British side closed the door  of cooperation. Thus, the Sino-British talks on arrangements  for the 1994/95 elections broke down and there would be no  "through train", Lu said. "But Governor Chris Patten does not  believe there would be no through train. So I sincerely hope he  would not cherish any illusion on that," Lu said. By July 1,  1997, he continued, the first SAR Legislative Council will be  produced in the territory according to the Basic Law and  relevant regulations of the Chinese National People's Congress.  At that time, all members of the last Legislative Council  should step down the "train" and this is definite, Lu added.  He noted that his committee will listen to various opinions on  formation of the first SAR Legislative Council and of the  district boards and ensure a smooth transition.</p>

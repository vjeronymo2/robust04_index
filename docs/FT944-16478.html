			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (8): Slow progress on sell-offs The sale of Bulgaria's most prestigious Black Sea hotel, the five-star Grand Hotel Varna, has been the biggest privatisation investment by a Bulgarian company to date. A 49 per cent stake was sold earlier this year to Multigroup, one of Bulgaria's most powerful private holding companies and Balkanbank, one of the country's five biggest mainly state-owned banks for Lev509m (about Dollars 10m at the time). Under the scheme adopted by the privatisation agency, employees were offered 20 per cent of shares at a preferential price and the remaining 31 per cent were floated. 'Since privatisation we are targeting a higher spending segment of the market,' says Dotko Dotkov, the newly appointed general director. 'As a private company, we can develop a proper investment programme to upgrade several floors with special 'business class' rooms, and provide higher quality service and better promotion through western tour operators.' In spite of resistance from different groups, the privatisation agency has announced the coming sale of other hotels including the Vitosha Grand Hotel Sofia, and Rodina, as well as several hotels in winter and spa resorts and some of the country's biggest Black Sea resorts, such as Sunny Beach and Albena, which are offered for sale en bloc. Foreign groups such as Daewoo of South Korea, Delta France, Holiday Inn, Ramada, Radisson and Styles Hotels, as well as powerful Bulgarian financial and industrial groups such as TSBank, Tron and Multigroup have shown interest while ITT Sheraton has applied to buy the Sheraton Sofia Hotel Balkan which it has managed for the past few years. Years of recession and power struggles between the privatisation agency and local tourism officials mean sell-offs are not going smoothly. Managers of state-owned hotels and resorts fear they may lose their jobs and claim privatisation will benefit foreign investors by selling the most profitable hotels at give-away prices. But western consultants emphasise the need for speedy privatisation. At present the 3,000 private sector tourism-related companies account for only 10 per cent of total turnover. Meanwhile Balkan Bulgarian Airlines, the national carrier, which transports most Bulgarian visitors with its fleet of 58 aircraft is also up for sale. The state will retain 40 per cent and at least 51 per cent shares of the airline will be left in Bulgarian hands. The privatisation agency recently rejected an offer by Avicon, an Austrian-Swiss company, to provide know-how but no cash for a 49 per cent stake.</p>

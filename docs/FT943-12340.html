			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Technology: When anomalies become the norm - Technically Speaking Let me set the scene. You are a senior executive in a business where your success is largely due to good scientific research done in a textbook manner. Ideas and projects are assessed by means of achievability, funding is allocated either internally or by grants, and the whole is guided by the opinions and boundaries dictated by experts and learned magazines. So far so good. Now let me raise a question. Someone in your organisation notices an anomaly. This, by definition, is 'an irregularity or departure from the common rule'. At this point, the usual thing is that the anomaly is ignored. An anomaly is an embarrassment. It may mean the validity of the work so far is in question. This person may check with magazines and databases and will find no reference to his problem. He may discuss it 'off the record' with his peers. It will affect present and future funding and credibility if he follows it up. Quite often, an anomaly questions tried and tested scientific laws that have worked well for years. This researcher is daring to suggest that they are wrong or at least need modifying. The pressures on this person will probably stop him reporting his findings to you. There is an automatic human reaction when exposed to an anomaly and that is disbelief. This is healthy. The next reaction is the belief that by not recognising the anomaly and not researching it, it will cease to exist. This is fear and also faulty thinking. No one is to blame here. It is the system that has grown up over the years to ensure that projects are worthwhile for funding, that the funding is well spent on 'do-able' ideas and that professional journals and databases screen out faulty information. The solution is to make anomaly research a legitimate subject. The snag at the moment is that the scientific community, though aware to some degree or other of the problem, is powerless to do anything about it. (If scientists talk about it, they risk their funding.) This is where you, as chief executive, come in. You have nothing to lose and much to gain by allowing anomalies to become a subject for discussion and by positively promoting anomaly research within your business. It could then be discussed and researched, funding would become available and information could be published about it. Worldwide, there are probably a few thousand researchers working on anomaly research-related projects. They are mostly self-funded or funded by their own businesses, but increasingly they are being funded by enlightened companies, with the most significant funding coming from Japan and the US. There are dozens of formal and informal societies set up to promote knowledge between the research workers. The advent of person-to-person networking via the telephone system allows global communication between individuals. This all bypasses the traditional research mechanisms that are not geared up for anomaly research. The following example from my particular area of research, energy generation by non-conventional techniques, illustrates what I mean. This quote is from The Denver Report issued by Pace (the Planetary Association for Clean Energy) about a recent symposium attended by 350 leading experts in new energy. 'There are now eight variations of experimental findings worldwide related to cold fusion. Despite popular belief, this technology is not 'dead' and is generally low profile in very competitive patent development stages . . . replication and further research is being done in over 30 countries.' This may be of no relevance to you, but whatever your area of interest, I can assure you that there are anomalies and that people are working on them somewhere.

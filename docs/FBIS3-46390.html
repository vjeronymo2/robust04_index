			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Preparatory work  for Xiaolangdi Water Conservancy Project on the Yellow River,  the second largest of its kind in China, is nearing completion.    The preparatory work, which began at the end of 1991 and is  expected to be completed eight months ahead of schedule, has  cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about 137 million U.S. dollars).    Infrastructure for the project, including facilities for  transport, water and electric supplies, telecommunications and  facilities to house the construction workers, has been completed.    Roads totalling 60 km, covering the construction site, have  opened to traffic. The Yellow River bridge, or Huang He bridge,  which ranks first in China in handling capacity, has been built.    The rail transshipment station, which is expected to handle  nearly one million tons of materials and equipment, is also  nearing completion.    During a recent inspection of the construction site, Deputy  Minister of Water Conservancy Zhang Chunyuan urged all the  workers to continue to work hard so that the principal part of  the project will start this year.    Located about 130 km downstream from the Sanmen Gorges Dam  in  central China's Henan Province, the Xiaolangdi Water Control  Project has a designed storage capacity of 12.6 billion cubic  meters.    Experts say that the 11-year project, together with other  reservoirs nearby, will enable the lower reaches of the river to  resist the level of a flood that occurs only once in one  thousand years, instead of its present water-control capacity of  only once in dozens of years.    The project will make it possible to basically eliminate ice  runs plaguing the lower reaches and prevent the Yellow River bed  in the lower reaches from silting and rising, which has been a  constant problem for hundreds of years.    The project will cost hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.  Part of the project will use loans from the World Bank, and  international bidding will be invited for the undertaking.</p>

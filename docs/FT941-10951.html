			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: Portugal seeks Es63bn for cement group Portugal is seeking Es63bn (Dollars 360m) from the privatisation later this year of Secil/CMP, a cement producer, even though there were no bids for the company at Es59bn in a first attempt at privatisation in 1993. The government said limits on foreign investment would be lifted. He said the state no longer planned to retain a golden share giving it a veto over corporate decisions. Bids are being sought for 80 per cent of the state's 58 per cent holding in Secil and its 100 per cent holding in CMP (Companhia de Maceira e Pataias).</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Commission struggles to hold ring on animal welfare in EU: An issue that deeply divides member states Four British men were recently challenged by a vegan author to spend a week living like battery hens in return for a payment of Pounds 10,000. They were required to squat in a scaled-up cage with no toilet facilities living off rice and beans. The fact that they lasted only 18 hours before giving up was heralded as a triumph by some of Britain's more radical animal welfare campaigners. Farmers were scathing: 'How the hell can you compare feelings of a human being with those of a hen?' said one livestock producer. There has been a big public response to the British campaign by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. But, like other national governments in the European Union, the British cannot make changes to legislation on animal welfare without the sanction of Brussels. Rules governing the treatment of farm animals which include journey time limits and the size of battery hen cages are set in Europe. But the European Commission is deeply divided between countries in the north and south. 'The trouble is, there is little tradition of animal welfare in countries like Italy and Spain,' said one Commission official. Public pressure groups pushing for improved conditions for animals are also not so well established in these countries. The gulf between different EU countries was evident last month when the Commission tried to get agreement on new rules governing the transport of live animals. Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark insisted on an eight-hour time limit on shipment of animals before they must be rested, fed and watered. The UK wanted to impose a 15-hour limit which is applied on its domestic transit, while southern member countries wanted no limits at all. The result is that existing rules allowing a 24-hour journey without a break remain in place and the Commission has agreed to open further consultations with scientists. Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, told a recent meeting of a pan-European animal welfare lobby that the well-being of animals was a political priority for him. 'But it's a complex question which touches on many different interests which are not always reconcilable.' These different interests were illustrated by the public outrage in the UK recently when the RSPCA released undercover videos showing conditions in some Spanish abattoirs where sheep were not being adequately stunned before slaughter. Although European Union rules are in place, the Spanish government has told the Commission it is difficult getting workers on the ground to apply them. UK farmers argue that Britain has some of the highest standards in the world for the treatment of farm animals. But animal welfare issues raise the public's ire more than almost any other controversy. The British government has been receiving 1,000 letters a day from people concerned about the transport of live lambs to the Continent following the RSPCA's high- profile advertising campaign. Newspaper advertisements show lambs crushed into lorries with no food and water and the caption: 'Before they're roasted in garlic and rosemary they're soaked in urine and excrement.' The Commission's resources for policing infringements of animal welfare rules itself are stretched. It has only 20 inspectors for checking on abattoirs and conditions of animals in transit and must rely on a great deal of co-operation from local authorities. Exporters have not been won over on the issue of transport, however. Mr David Parker who runs the British Association of Sheep Exporters, calls the RSPCA's campaign 'highly emotive and entirely unobjective'. He has reported it to the Advertising Standards Authority for misrepresenting conditions among sheep on cross-channel journeys. He says the trucks shown in the newspaper pictures are not export lorries and the photos are not dated to show when the transport was taking place. Mr Parker believes the emphasis put on time limits is misleading as the most traumatic thing for the animals is unloading and loading them. 'Trials have shown that, as long as they are handled well, it is far better to move sheep in one go rather than unload them into a strange building and give them food and water,' he said. Growing demand by continental slaughter houses has meant increasing exports of live British lambs in recent years and almost 3m will make the crossing this year. Although it is more expensive to ship live sheep, prices are high enough to make the journey worthwhile. Mr Parker said that an eight-hour limit would add about another Pounds 1 to the cost of transporting each animal but the trade would still be financially viable. However, if an eight-hour limit were imposed, the trucking of sheep from Scotland to the West Country would be affected and the extra costs could be enough to put some slaughterhouses out of business. Some countries have suggested that responsibility for forming legislation on the handling of animals should be devolved to a national level. But the Commission has staunchly refused. 'There is no question of giving up these issues to member states - it would allow for unfair competition,' said one official. So Europe is stuck with its unwieldy decision-making process which frustrates the hopes of thousands of campaigners. But the Commission has managed to push through rules stipulating that hens in battery cages should have slightly more space from 1995.</p>

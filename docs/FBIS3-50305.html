			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 26 January "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, January 26 (BTA) -- Yesterday's address  by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov for a speedier passage of the  1994 national budget is the main story in today's press.  According to STANDART NEWS, the prime minister predicted early  elections. A comment in STANDART NEWS says the prime minister  played a risky game. "The prime minister forebodes a national  tragedy if the budget fails to pass by mid-February," says  KONTINENT. "The ball is now with the Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP, the former Communists) who command a majority in  parliament and determine the cabinet's fate," says the paper.  According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, the unrealistic deadline for  passing the budget is most likely a prime minister move seeking  to leave government losing as less respect as possible. The  socialist DUMA says the BSP will make a political decision on  the budget at a special plenum. A comment in the paper says the  prime minister's statement sounded like an ultimatum and the  political forces made it clear this was not a constructive tone.  "This, however, does not mean the nation is approaching  elections, as in that case it may end the year without a  budget," says DUMA. The daily of the Union of Democratic Forces  (SDS) DEMOKRATSIYA emphasizes Berov called the Socialists  traitors. "BSP declined to consider the financial programme of  its own government," says the daily. [passage omitted]</p>

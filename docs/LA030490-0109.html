			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN'T GET THERE . . .  </P> <P> In the summer of 1988 I spent an enjoyable week in Pakistan visiting Lahore,  Rawalpindi and Islamabad. But I had a different experience than Frank Jossi  ("Echoes of an Empire Linger on in Lahore," Jan. 28) with air travel.  </P> <P> Within Pakistan the flights were so cheap that it was difficult to catch  flights without reservations. In Lahore they told me I could not buy a ticket  to Gilgit, but must buy it in Islamabad, and then would have to wait at least  one more day before I could fly. I learned that it usually takes a minimum of  10 days to reserve a flight to Gilgit, and that if Gilgit is fogged in, flights  are canceled. I believe there is great demand for Gilgit in the summer to  escape the heat in lower Pakistan. Most everyone was friendly and helpful.  </P> <P> I couldn't get on any of the flights to Gilgit even though I got up at 4 a.m.,  thinking I had paid for a reservation. About 20 others couldn't get on either.  </P> <P> LARRY BAILEY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Foster's up 21% in spite of decline on brewing side Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian company which owns the Courage business in the UK, reported a 21 per cent rise in profits after tax and abnormal items in the half-year to end-December, to ADollars 210.8m (USDollars 151m). This was on spite of lower earnings from its core brewing interests, Profits in the same period of 1992-93 stood at ADollars 173.6m. First-half sales were ADollars 2.62bn, compared with ADollars 3.49bn. The improvement, however, was due entirely to lower interest charges, which fell from ADollars 123.6m to ADollars 89.3m, and a ADollars 49m abnormal surplus related to asset sales, compared with a ADollars 17.7m gain in the previous year. By contrast, Foster's said its total brewing profit fell from ADollars 302.9m a year ago, to ADollars 279.8m. The Australian operations at Carlton and United Breweries chipped in a 26.7 per cent improvement in operating profits, at ADollars 129m, which Foster's said came on the back of increased market shares - rising to 54 per cent of the Australian market overall in December - and some product launches. Exports to Asia-Pacific and the Middle East also grew 'significantly'. In the UK, Courage saw earnings before interest and tax decline from ADollars 131.3m to ADollars 100.7m. Although about ADollars 10m of this was due to exchange rate movements, Fosters blamed most of the fall on higher sales and marketing expenditure. Sales volume was static and market share nudged ahead to just over 19 per cent. Courage's performance was hampered by British consumers taking advantage of relaxed excise duties to import cheap European beer. Courage - Britain's second largest brewer - said it also expected Inntrepreneur Estates, its pub joint venture with Grand Metropolitan, to break even in 1994 despite an an Pounds 18m (USDollars 263m) loss in the 12 months to September 30 last year. In Canada, meanwhile, the contribution from Molson fell from ADollars 69.8m to ADollars 50.2m. However, Foster's said around ADollars 14m of this reflected the change in ownership structure, which saw the Australian group's stake fall from 50 to 40 per cent. After the lower interest charges - which reflected the ongoing disposal programme at Foster's and associated reduction in the group's heavy debt levels - pre-tax operating profits were 13.3 per cent higher at ADollars 178.3m. Foster's said the economic outlook in its main markets of Australia, the UK and Canada, was improving.</p>

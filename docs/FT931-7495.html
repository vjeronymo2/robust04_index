			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Observer: Denway's debut Not hard to see who were the real winners in this week's Hong Kong stock market debut of Denway Investments, the China 'concept' stock which was 657 times oversubscribed. Denway itself ought to have made HKDollars 120m-HKDollars 150m simply from the interest on owning the over-subscription funds for a week. Not bad, given that it only forecast HKDollars 129m net profit for 1992. Denway's main adviser, Peregrine, should have done nearly as well. As part of the underwriting deal, it got to keep 3 per cent of the issue, which could mean it will double the near HKDollars 50m in fees it has earned.</p>

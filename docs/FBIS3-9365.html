			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F> Young Democrats, by Attila Gy. Fekete; place and date not given:  "Banana, Orange, and Tie -- Viktor Orban on the Fidesz's  Chances"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fekete] In spite of the  cooperation agreement between the parties of the liberal bloc,  serious tensions are straining relations between these parties.  Some people believe to know that the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] has given up on the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] as an ally and it is opening toward the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] that appears to have more chance at the  elections. According to some politicians, the two biggest  liberal parties are now only trying to find an excuse to  terminate the liberal bloc's agreement.    [Orban] We will never have perfect tranquillity in the  liberal bloc, after all, we are also rivals of each other at the  elections. The question is whether the parties' chairmen will  have enough wisdom and strength to convince their membership  about the significance and importance of the cooperation. If  the parties' chairmen do not find the right proportion between  competition and cooperation then the liberal bloc might fall  apart. In my view, similar debates and tensions exist between  the conservative parties, and they will probably also happen in  the left-wing bloc.    As for the other half of the question, namely that the SZDSZ  has "given up" the Fidesz and is seeking cooperation with the  Socialists, I do not believe this. For the SZDSZ, a break with  the SZDSZ and cooperation with the MSZP at the same time would  result in a party split. Considering the SZDSZ's membership in  the provinces, this would lead to the party's disintegration.  This is not in the interest of either the Fidesz or the SZDSZ.    [Fekete] Although the party leaders do not like to enter  into coalition speculations, the voters are interested in which  parties would be willing to govern together. At the same time,  your statements indicate that, apart from the parties of the  liberal bloc, namely the SZDSZ, the Agrarian Federation, and the  Entrepreneurs Party, the Fidesz does not have any other possible  coalition partners.    [Orban] A strange situation has arisen because almost all  parties -- including the MSZP and the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] -- claim that the Fidesz is a possible coalition partner  for them while we emphasize our distance from both these  parties. With the approach of the elections, it is unwise to  enter into coalition speculations, but I believe that we can and  must talk about moral dilemmas. It is obvious that a  significant number of the electors want to replace the current  coalition. In view of this, the thought that we would still  have to work together with one or other party of the current  coalition after the elections can expect to meet with serious  resistance within our party and among the electors, too. On the  other hand, our membership would resist it just as much if we  had to cooperate and work together with those who are the legal  successors of the party that is responsible for the economic  destruction of the country. When we know the final results of  the elections, if this question is still valid then, we will  convene the Fidesz's appropriate decision-making bodies, the  national committee or the congress, and we will discuss the  future. One thing is certain: The Fidesz cannot participate in  a coalition in which it cannot implement the most important  elements of its program. On the other hand, all politicians  have delicate points. On 16 June 1989, at the burial of Imre  Nagy, I made a speech and I cannot deviate from the spirit of  this, whether I am thinking about the Fidesz's coalition  possibilities or my own role.    [Fekete] Does this mean that you exclude the possibility of  a Fidesz-MSZP coalition or that you personally would not  participate in this government?    [Orban] I have formulated principles. The consequences of  these in a given situation will be made public when we are  facing this given situation.    [Fekete] Do you have similar commitments as regards  cooperation with the MDF? During the blockade of the taxi  drivers, you publicly called the government a liar.    [Orban] The speech I have mentioned before was about the  future, rather than on relations with the MDF, the MSZP, or any  other party.    [Fekete] Earlier, the Fidesz indicated that, from the  Fidesz's point of view, the assessment of the MSZP partly  depends on whether Sandor Nagy [chairman of the National  Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary] or Laszlo Bekesi  [economic expert] is higher up on their national list. However,  according to economic observers, the Fidesz's economic policy,  the half turn, is closer to Sandor Nagy's views than to  Bekesi's....    [Orban] The Fidesz's program lays the main emphasis on  economic growth, therefore, it is a program that creates  workplaces. On this point, Nagy's goals certainly coincide with  those of the Fidesz. Therefore, we would have a good chance to  coordinate our goals with the trade unions. However, we have  significant differences on how this goal can be achieved. As  early as 1990, the Fidesz suggested that the parliamentary  parties and the interest groups of the employers and employees  should sit down at a negotiating table and agree on the rules to  be followed during the period of economic transition. We have  not given up this idea and, if we are given the opportunity to  govern after the elections, we intend to make a Hungarian  Moncloa pact. Without this, and without cooperation with the  trade unions, it would be much more difficult to put the  Hungarian economy on a growth course.</p>

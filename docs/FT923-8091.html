			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Pressure mounts in Russia for change of course A GROUP of arch-conservative managers of large Russian enterprises are expected to call today for a reversal of government economic policies at a time when opponents of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, are setting a date for his removal. The Industrial Union, a parliamentary faction headed by Mr Yuri Gekht, who has long opposed the government's radical reforms, has invited 2,000 plant managers to Moscow to endorse an alternative reform agenda and demand a new government. Claiming the present cabinet's policies will bankrupt 'most enterprises', they want more support for heavy industry and state farming, more credits from the central bank, wage increases, price controls and the maintenance of a 10-year ban on the resale of farm land. Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the bigger Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who also has political ambitions, may speak at the meeting even though he considers his organisation to be more progressive than Mr Gekht's. Significantly, a spokesman for President Boris Yeltsin went out of his way yesterday to stress that the Russian leader would not attend - as if to distance his boss from this particular industrial lobby. Mr Yeltsin, on holiday, has given no hint he plans further cabinet changes, but he is under increasing pressure to abandon radical reforms. He also feels let down by the west which has so far delivered less assistance for his reforms than he had expected when he launched them. An assistant to Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, who believes a new government is needed, predicted yesterday there would be a change of cabinet on September 20, when Mr Yeltsin returns from a trip to Japan and parliament reconvenes. The Civic Union, a centrist grouping of three opposition parties headed respectively by Mr Rutskoi, Mr Volsky, and Mr Nikolai Travkin, a worker turned politician, also plans to present the government with an ultimatum in mid-September to either resign or change course. The Russian government has drawn up contingency plans for electric power cuts for the 12 months beginning October 1, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Tass said the plan envisaged possible cuts of up to 25 per cent of overall daily consumption. Cuts could also reach 20 per cent during peak demand. 'This has been done to ensure the stable work of power systems if critical shortages of electricity arise,' it said, quoting the deputy chairman of the electric power committee. The report gave no explanation of why power cuts may be needed. But general chaos in the Russian economy, shortfalls in energy production and cutbacks in nuclear power development have all taken their toll. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, leader of Georgia and former Soviet foreign minister, yesterday signalledhis intention to use force againstrebels holding his interior minister hostage, reports John Lloyd from Moscow. The move comes after the collapse of an offer of reconciliation - rejected on Tuesday - and is prompted by the increasing impatience of the Georgian military and security forces with Mr Shevardnadze's previous efforts to avoid using violence against the supporters of former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Mr Roman Zventsadze, the interior minister, was captured in the city of Zugdidi - a stronghold of the Gamsakhurdia supporters - together with an aide of Mr Shevardnadze and other officials. In a midnight address to the nation, Mr Shevardnadze, known for his emotive language when foreign minister, said 'I think that right now the question of 'to be or not to be', whether good or evil will win out, will be resolved. I will work with you (the people) and fight to overcome the forces of evil.' He claimed to have 'failed' in underestimating the capacity for malice of the rebels - and disclosed that he had offered to resign as head of the ruling State Council - an offer refused by his colleagues. A botched coup attempt by therebels involving the capture of the main TV station was put down last month when troops stormed the building. Editorial comment, Page 12</p>

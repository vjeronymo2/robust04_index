			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Berry Birch slips to Pounds 460,000 Profits of Berry Birch &amp; Noble, the USM-traded financial services group, slipped from Pounds 518,571 to Pounds 460,104 pre-tax for the half year ended July 31. Turnover advanced from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 3.59m. The shares fell 11p to 164p. The directors blamed the setback on substantial investment to secure continued expansion of the business, including development of the new office in Clevedon, near Bristol. They pointed out that without these costs there would have been a 'healthy increase' in operating profits. Interest income declined to Pounds 36,994 (Pounds 77,847). Earnings per share worked through 1p lower at 5.3p but the interim dividend is lifted to 2.1p (2p).</p>

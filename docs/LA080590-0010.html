			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: RANCHO SANTA FE: DELICIAS TOWN  </P> <P> The town of Rancho Santa Fe, just northeast of San Diego, is turning into a  major eating destination. It is the site, to begin with, of the most famous  small produce farm in the state, Chino Ranch -- noted for supplying top-quality  fruits and vegetables to Wolfgang Puck, Alice Waters and other restaurant  stars. It is also the place where one of L.A.'s best French chefs, Claude Segal  (ex-Ma Maison, Bistango, Four Oaks, and MaBe), has opened Tapenade, at the  Rancho Valencia tennis resort.  </P> <P> Now another French chef of note, Guy Leroy -- a longtime friend and associate  of Puck and former chef at the El Encanto Hotel in Santa Barbara, Carsley's in  Atlanta, Chapo on Melrose Avenue and the Squire Restaurant at San Francisco's  Fairmont Hotel -- is in charge of a new restaurant kitchen in Rancho Santa Fe  as well.  </P> <P> Leroy's venue is Delicias, just opened by developer Paolo Parviz on the Paseo  Delicias. "The name is kind of fun," says Leroy. "People ask me, 'What's it  called? Delicious?' I say, 'Well, it had better be delicious!' "  </P> <P> Although he is not a partner in the new establishment, Leroy says, "I designed  and built the kitchen exactly the way I wanted it, so I have a little  Rolls-Royce of a kitchen. We've got a pasta cooker, a mesquite grill, a  wood-burning oven, a beautiful little pastry room. We're having lots of fun.  We're making grilled chicken with mashed potatoes, veal flank steak with  mushroom-Beaujolais sauce, simple food like that. We don't want to be too  exotic."  </P> <P> The restaurant, which is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, also boasts a  shaded patio, framed in rosemary and jasmine. "And you know," Leroy says,  "having Chino Ranch practically next door is a dream for a chef."  </P> <P> STAYING PUT: Some months ago, Alberto Liani, proprietor of Il Giardino in  Beverly Hills, told this column that his restaurant was scheduled to be  demolished later this year. Since that time, though, the city of Beverly Hills  has declared a moratorium on new construction in the area, and the owner of the  property -- entertainment business mogul David Geffen -- has canceled his  construction project. Il Giardino, says Liani, will thus remain open for  business until further notice. The restaurant has taken advantage of its  renewed lease to expand, adding a new 60-seat patio and a piano bar.  </P></p>

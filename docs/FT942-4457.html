			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: US funds buy paper mill debt Several US investment funds have emerged as the biggest creditors of the troubled Gold River newsprint mill in British Columbia, after buying more than half of its CDollars 230m (USDollars 166.6m) debt at a deep discount. The involvement of the US funds - so-called 'vulture funds', because they seek to profit from distressed businesses - has made the future of the mill even more uncertain. Gold River is one of the most modern paper mills in the world. It has been mothballed since Christmas, when its bankers turned down a proposal by its biggest shareholder, Avenor (formerly Canadian Pacific Forest Products) for short-term funding. An official at Odyssey Partners of New York, one of the US funds, said the mill was 'an excellent piece of equipment' with 'a lot of value'. He declined to give details of Odyssey's intentions, but indicated that some developments were likely within the next few weeks. Mr David Toole, Avenor's chief financial officer, said the company had so far had no contact with its new creditors. It is drawing up proposals aimed at restarting the mill. These include securing cheaper and more reliable wood supplies. Avenor wrote off its entire CDollars 147m investment in Gold River last year. Its eight partners include publishers in the US, UK, Japan and Singapore. The bank lenders are understood to have received between 19 and 30 cents per dollar of face value for their loans. A leading member of the bank group said: 'When the 'vulture capitalists' get involved and you lose the majority of the bank syndicate, it gets to be too much trouble.' Banks which have sold their loans include Toronto-Dominion, Union Bank of Switzerland, and Royal Bank of Canada. TD has been replaced as leader of the creditor group by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the international accountants. The removal of Gold River's annual output of 230,000 tonnes from the market helped other North American newsprint producers impose a 6 per cent to 7 per cent price rise earlier this year. The producers hope to push through a second, similar increase in August.</p>

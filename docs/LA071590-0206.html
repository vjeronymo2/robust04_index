			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SECTION TO APPEAR TUESDAY  </P> <P> A special section on the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace, which opens  this week in Yorba Linda, will be included in copies of Tuesday's Times Orange  County Edition. The section examines the long struggle to build the library,  compares it to other presidential libraries and offers an architectural  critique. It also contains a two-page diagram of the library interior and  birthplace and assesses whether yet another "New Nixon" has emerged since his  days in the White House.  </P></p>

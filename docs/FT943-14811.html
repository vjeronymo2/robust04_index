			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Figueres bends to fiscal reality: Costa Rica's new president is forced to be more pragmatic The fierce campaigning against economic liberalisation that won the Costa Rican presidency for Mr Jose Mara Figueres has given way to a more pragmatic approach since he took office in May. Mr Figueres, a 39-year-old engineer with a master's degree in government from Harvard University in the US, promised to renegotiate a structural adjustment programme with the World Bank and pay greater attention to social needs. But the difficult fiscal position inherited by his government means Latin America's youngest president will have to seek external financing to fulfil social programmes. That will oblige his government to remain in favour with the Washington-based international financial institutions. 'His challenge is how to harmonise the relative satisfaction that there is with the development of macro-economic policies with the level of dissatisfaction that there is on social issues, fundamentally in health and education,' says Mr Carlos Sojo, a political analyst. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have been receptive to proposed changes to programmes suggested by a government delegation last month, says a finance ministry adviser. The government rejected a demand by the World Bank to reduce the public sector by 25,000 job-holders, and has said it will implement a plan for 'state rationalisation' instead. The new government has said it would not remove the state insurance company's monopoly in the short term and would keep an open mind on the control by the state oil company Recope of refining and distribution of petrol. But Mr Leonardo Garnier, planning minister, says progress will continue on opening the banking sector so as to let private banks offer cheque accounts, now the preserve of state banks. The government also remains committed to the sale of state cement and fertiliser companies. The new economic team has been keen to stress that there will be no big changes in a broad policy of economic liberalisation despite the campaign rhetoric. 'We agree with the international banks' concern to liberalise the market and make the state more efficient,' says Mr Garnier. 'But we want to find the best instruments to do so,' he added. Costa Rica's heterodox liberalisation policies were initiated by two governments from Mr Figueres's National Liberation party (PLN) from 1982-88, and senior members of those administrations are now back in cabinet posts. Since taking office on May 8, Mr Figueres has been sharply criticised by former government ministers for reiterating campaign attacks on his predecessors whom he accuses of leaving the state coffers empty. Mr Rafael Angel Calderon, the previous president, has pointed to single-digit inflation, healthy foreign exchange reserves, 6 per cent growth, and low unemployment as the achievements of his administration. His government also signed a free-trade agreement with Mexico, and oversaw sharp growth in exports and tourism, reducing traditional dependency on coffee and bananas. But economists say that, in the run-up to the election, the previous government, in keeping with traditional priorities at such times, artificially held down prices and let the fiscal deficit run, leaving Mr Figueres with a legacy of debt and repressed inflation. 'If I were the finance minister I would sit down and weep,' says Mr Dennis Melendez, an economic consultant. A close examination from the International Monetary Fund, which is expected to send a mission this month, is immnent for the government. It is keen to re-establish a stand-by agreement with the fund as an indication to lenders that it is following sound macro-economic policies. Mr Carlos Manuel Castillo, who combines the role of central bank president with that of economic supremo, went on national television recently to say that the government hoped to reduce the fiscal deficit to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of 1995. This is unlikely to impress the fund. Mr Figueres took over the presidency 46 years after his father, Jose 'Pepe' Figueres, overthrew Mr Calderon's father and set off a brief but bloody civil war. A victorious Mr Figueres abolished the armed forces and implemented extensive social reforms. His son's efforts to emphasise social issues will be hampered by the split in his party over his nomination, which followed accusations that his alleged involvement in the murder of a small-time drug dealer in 1973 made him an unfit candidate. His government's slim margin of victory in the election in February also means he does not enjoy a strong mandate, and acrimony with the opposition party does not augur well for future negotiations with Congress, where he will require opposition support.</p>

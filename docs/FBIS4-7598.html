			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mladen Bosnjak report on the statements by </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Raymond  Flynn, U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, in Sarajevo on 1 April --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Bosnjak] Mr. Silajdzic stressed at the  beginning of his statement that the arrival of Raymond Flynn,  U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, again confirmed the interest of  Bill Clinton and Holy Father Pope John Paul II in the situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Then he said:    [Silajdzic] As for me, unfortunately I had to tell the  ambassador about some things that do not sound very optimistic,  generally speaking, and asked him to convey this to the highest  authorities. What I said is that the continuation of the peace  process is endangered with the latest attacks on Gorazde -- a  massive offensive is under way, and many people are being  killed, innocent people; with the attacks on Bihac, and the  ethnic cleansing, the new wave of ethnic cleansing -- against  which President Izetbegovic protested yesterday -- that is  taking place in Bosnian Krajina.    Today I received information from the chairman of the  International Red Cross, responsible for central Bosnia and  Bosnian Krajina, who said that we have to either protect the  6,000 people in Prijedor and the surrounding area or move them  out. Their lives are in danger. This is very bad news.    In connection with Gorazde, the international community is  silent about it. A zone that has been proclaimed protected by a  UN Security Council resolution is under attack. An offensive is  underway, and many people have been killed. I am certain that  the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina can  follow the development of the situation, they can see it on  their television here in Sarajevo, and their command knows very  well what is going on. The United Nations has been informed;  the Security Council has been informed. However, there is no  reaction. The situation is repeating itself, where the  aggressor is allowed to do almost anything he wants. I will  repeat, the continuation of the peace negotiations has been  seriously endangered with these latest activities by the  aggressor in the region of Gorazde and Bihac, and the ethnic  cleansing of the remaining non-Serbian population in Bosnian  Krajina.    [Bosnjak] Ambassador Flynn expressed the concern and the  understanding of the American people for the suffering of the  people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and spoke of the appeals and  prayers of the Holy Father for the return of peace.

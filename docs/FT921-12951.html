			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Miners pay rise threat to Russian economy THE Russian government was yesterday struggling to retain control of its economic reform programme after President Boris Yeltsin reportedly conceded large pay rises for miners and abandoned the target for a balanced budget in the first quarter of the year. Mr Yeltsin, who met representatives from Russia's biggest coalfield, the Kuzbass, on Wednesday, was reported by the Interfax news agency to have conceded their case for higher salaries. Such a concession to the powerful mineworkers would open the way to further wage demands by other industrial workers. At the same time, the chairman of the Russian central bank, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, told the Russian parliament that monetary reform was 'senseless - a complete waste of time and energy' at a time of unrestrained monetary growth. Mr Matiukhin said Russian internal debt had risen to Rbs375bn, out of a total debt of the former Soviet Union of Rbs500bn  - though other figures published yesterday showed the Russian debt to be even higher, at Rbs572bn from a total Soviet debt of Rbs990bn. The bank chairman said that he expected to print Rbs34.3bn in the first quarter of 1992, a significant rise over the same period last year. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, wrote this week in the Financial Times that Russia could 'sink into a disastrous wage-price spiral' unless inflation were soon stopped. He also told the Russian parliament on Tuesday that the first quarter's budget deficit would equal 1 per cent of the country's GNP, or Rbs11.5bn despite a pledge to balance the budget. Commentators have cast doubt on the projected small size of the deficit. President Yeltsin yesterday suspended all import restrictions and declared Russia open to foreign investment, Reuter reports from Moscow. A government resolution said customs tariffs were suspended with effect from January 15. A new customs regime would be drawn up, with a view to introduction on April 1. Mr Yeltsin was also due to sign a decree allowing every citizen or organisation to trade at any place in any goods, except those banned for sale, without needing to obtain permission from the authorities.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GOV. CUOMO KILLS LEGISLATION OPENING TIOGA PARK TRACK FOR THOROUGHBREDS  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today vetoed legislation that would have put the closed  Tioga Park Racetrack near Binghamton into business as a thoroughbred facility.  </P> <P> Cuomo said that although he favors opening the track because of the jobs it  would create in the Southern Tier, he is also concerned that harness tracks  across New York state would be hurt by the Tioga facility's operation.  </P> <P> "I remain convinced, however, that a solution is not only desirable but also  possible," said Cuomo in his veto message.  </P> <P> The governor said he would submit new legislation next year designed to bring  about the opening of Tioga Park while offering protection to the harness  tracks.  </P> <P> The harness tracks had complained that Tioga Park, because it would be running  at night, would be direct competition for them. The state's other thoroughbred  tracks run in the afternoon.  </P></p>

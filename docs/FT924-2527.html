			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Panetta will speak for the deficit-sensitive MR LEON PANETTA has spent much of the past 15 years developing his credentials as one of Congress's most know-ledgeable, intense and intellectually curious experts on the US budget process. As chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee for the past four years, the California congressman was one of the Democrats' leaders in budget summits with the Republican administration. With the White House and Congress now about to come under the control of the same party, there will be little need for budget summits. His Republican admirers are not surprised, therefore, that he is taking the opportunity to move to the executive branch as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr Panetta was originally a Republican himself, but he changed party shortly after being fired by President Richard Nixon as head of the Office of Civil Rights because of his complaints about how slowly the administration was approaching desegregation. First elected to Congress in 1976 from a district centred on Monterey, he is now in his second stint on the budget committee where, unlike other House committees, members serve only six years at a time. He has long been a spokesman for deficit-sensitive Democrats, carrying the lesson he learned from his father - an immigrant from Italy who always paid cash - who 'kicked the hell' out of his 18-year-old son when he found he had secretly acquired a credit card. 'He's a workhorse, and not a show-horse. He's not the kind of guy who sits around and kisses babies or clips ribbons,' comments one friend. Taking an administration job may allow Mr Panetta to acquire a Washington home of his own. He now shares a two-bedroom house with three other Democratic congressmen.</p>

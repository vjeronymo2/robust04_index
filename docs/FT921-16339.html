			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Derivatives markets were quieter yesterday but the Footsie future contract continued to exercise a strong influence over the underlying cash market. In early deals, the March Footsei contract rocketed by a premium of around 70 points, one of the largest premiums ever recorded; fair value now stands at about 29 points. Traders stressed that the early advance reflected heavy short covering by London traders who had convinced themselves that Wall Street would fall overnight. With the Dow in fact up by 3.58 overnight, there was a scramble to unravel positions in futures. The futures sector soon settled down to more modest trading, and the underlying equity market followed suit. By the close, the March contract was trading at a 50 point premium against cash, making an acceptable 20 points ahead of fair value. Business in traded options fell away to 21,048 contracts from Thursday's 26,261, with the FT-SE contract recording only 6,118. The Euro-FTSE contract returned to the top of the actives list but, with only 998 trades, made little stir. Individual share contracts were less busy yesterday. Amstrad recorded 943 contracts, and Allied-Lyons restraded 700.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>   [Excerpts] Yesterday, the "Solidarity" party political  commission selected journalist and businessman Samuel Lewis  Galindo to be the presidential candidate for the 1994 elections.  Carlos Clement was selected as the candidate for the first vice  presidency, and Maria "Marisin" Villalaz de Arias was selected  to be the second vice presidential candidate.    A resolution from the party's political commission indicates  that Solidarity meets the necessary conditions and has the  necessary strength to head a presidential slate as a result of  its image, active membership, discipline, organization,  prestige, determination, and consensus to accomplish the unity  and progress of the Panamanian people.    The resolution states: "Solidarity has been taken into  account by other important political forces, which have  contacted the party to gain its support with the intention of  participating in the next election process."    Lewis Galindo's nomination was announced yesterday at one of  the party's main political centers located in the Obarrio  neighborhood, after a lengthy meeting between the party's main  leaders. Samuel Lewis Galindo, a principal member of the  National Brewery board of directors, expressed appreciation for  the nomination and promised he will head a civilized political  campaign aimed at eliminating hatred and uniting the Panamanian  family.    "Neither I nor my party will sow hatred. Today, more than  ever, we must make a joint effort to help solve the numerous  problems that are devouring our community's underpriviliged  groups," he pointed out. [passage omitted]    Yesterday, the presidential candidate stated that  Panamanians  are tired of disputes and conflicts which lead nowhere. "We are  the party that will save the country from chaos and hate mongers  who would rather have individual confrontation instead of  striving for useful things," Lewis Galindo restated. He said  that under the motto "leadership, honesty, and work," Solidarity  gathers Panamanians from all social levels to give answers to a  society that feels unprotected at this time.    First vice president candidate Carlos Clement was the public  works minister at one time. He is an architect specializing in  urban development. He is also one of the party's founders and is  currently party treasurer.    Second vice president nominee Dr. Marisin Villalaz de Arias  was director of the National Medical Association. She was active  during the civic struggle against Manuel Antonio Noriega's  dictatorship. She was a Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement  candidate for legislator for the 8-9 Circuit during the 1989  elections.    Abraham Martinez, Solidarity party political affairs  secretary, told LA PRENSA that the slate headed by Samuel Lewis  Galindo will be recommended to the national directorate during  the national convention. Martinez also said Fernando Manfredo  decided to abstain from participating on the slate in order to,  as he put it, support any new alliances the party may enter.    The political affairs secretary holds that Solidarity is the  party with the most number of followers and greatest drawing  power. "We are working on specifics. On Tuesday 10 January [date  as published] we will completely sweep through the San Miguelito  District," he concludes.</p>

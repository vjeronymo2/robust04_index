			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Plea bargain waters down BNL charges MS JANET RENO, the US Attorney General, yesterday approved an unexpected plea agreement that throws out nearly all the charges against Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Atlanta branch manager at the centre of the long-running Iraqi loans scandal. Mr Drogoul, who made Dollars 5bn of loans that helped to finance Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, was supposed to stand trial next Wednesday, accused of a range of conspiracy charges, money laundering and defrauding the Rome head office of BNL. If convicted, he would have faced a term of life in prison. Instead, yesterday, Mr Drogoul was allowed to plead guilty to two counts involving bank regulatory violations and one count of wire fraud. The justice department said it would seek a jail sentence of about five years. Mr Drogoul will have a chance to argue in court at his sentencing hearing in November that higher authorities, including Rome, knew of his Iraqi loans. The charges Mr Drogoul agreed to plead guilty to yesterday involve filing misleading reports to the Federal Reserve Board and accepting a financial gift from a BNL customer in order to repair his home. Ms Reno, who personally made the BNL case decision, said yesterday: 'We are going to continue our efforts to determine if other wrongdoing occurred.' When asked if that meant the Justice Department would pursue allegations of criminal wrongdoing by former Bush administration officials, a spokesman for Ms Reno said: 'Absolutely.' He added: 'The investigation continues and is a very broad one and includes all the allegations that have been made.' Mr Drogoul was originally indicted on 347 counts in February 1991. Last month lawyers for Mr Drogoul issued subpoenas demanding testimony from former President George Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker, arguing that the BNL loans were merely part of a larger US covert programme to aid Iraq. The handling of the BNL case has led to congressional demands for a special prosecutor.</p>

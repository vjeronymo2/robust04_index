			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: Surrealist comes out of the closet - The work of Alberto Savinio currently at the Accademia Italiana It is not the easiest thing to be the artist son or younger brother of an established reputation, especially if that reputation is critically uncertain or in decline. Invisibility, in such a case, is not quite the physical impossibility we might suppose. It took two major surveys of 20th century Italian art, at the Royal Academy in London early in 1989 and at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice a few months later, both of them sponsored by Fiat, and the Tate's On Classic Ground in 1990, sponsored by Reed International, to bring the surrealist painter, Alberto Savinio, back into the light in propria persona. And now the Accademia Italiana happily completes the process by bringing to London a select but ample retrospective of his life's work (24 Rutland Gate, until February 23: sponsored by the Banco di Santo Spirito and, for the catalogue, by Alenia). Savinio, who died in 1952 at the age of 60, was the younger brother of Giorgio de Chirico, the first and foremost of the Italian metaphysical painters of the years around the First World War. He took his pseudonym in 1914 to distinguish himself from his brother's celebrity, in Italy at least, for he was active himself within the avant-garde circles of Futurism and the Metaphysical Movement, though as writer and composer rather than as painter. It was not until 1927 that he turned to painting, but by then, though he would win enough domestic reputation over the next 25 years to merit a memorial show at the Venice Biennale of 1954, the world had moved on. We should not be too surprised at his comparative obscurity. It is true of all national schools that they contain artists of true quality and stature that the rest of the world knows little about - we think of our own Spencer, Bomberg, Matthew Smith, Freud until lately, even Sickert. If Savinio's case is unusual, the fault is somewhat of his brother's making, or rather of his critics' reading of his work. For metaphysical painting, forerunner of surrealism yet quite distinct, and admittedly of authentic art-historical significance, was held by the 1920s to have had its day. And with it, down the critical chute, went de Chirico, of whom the long-received opinion was not that his later work was of marginal interest, but of no interest or worth at all. The retrieval from neglect of Italian painting between the wars in general, and the rightful reappraisal within it of de Chirico in his later career, have been among the more interesting moves in our revisionist times. The perhaps unexpected effect has been not merely to re-examine the movements and tendencies of which artists as various as Sironi, Carra, Martini, Morandi, Pirandello, de Pisis, Casorati, Severini and, of course, Savinio were a part, but to put greater and particular emphasis on the work of the individuals themselves. Savinio is as notable a beneficiary as any, paradoxically so in having so long persevered under a pseudonym he manifestly never needed. He is truer, which is to say more unequivocal a surrealist, than his brother, if surrealism, of which the very essence is contradiction and ambiguity, could ever be unequivocal. Unequivocally ambiguous might do it. His imagery is rich in transformations, monstrosities and double-functions, in a tradition that goes back to Bosch and Archimboldo: faces as concoctions of still-life; figures with the heads of ostrich, owl or turkey-cock; emblematic heaps of brightly coloured blocks, balls, poles. And over all there hangs the sense of ancient spirits, gods and demons, the more threatening and disconcerting for lurking in such a comical and lugubrious manner. Neptune rises monstrous at the far end of the silent, deserted quay. The river god peers boggle-eyed above the farthest mountains. Surrealism is essentially a literary genre, drawing its imaginative authority from the power of its imagery, and the interpretative indulgence it affords. The execution must shift for itself, and Savinio, with his habitual desiccated tempera surfaces, carries it off more by his whole-heartedness than technical sophistication, more enjoyably robust than subtle in its seductions. Yet surrealism in its Italian variety always retains a quality of the metaphysical, a quality of mood and atmosphere, a heightened, febrile atmosphere at that, fraught with the sense of nightmare, of an impending, unknowable doom. The form is too solid, the space too clear, the light too strong for comfort. Like his brother, Savinio will always keep the fearful patient's temperature a degree or two too high.</p>

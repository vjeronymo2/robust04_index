			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Russians riot as share pyramid begins to totter: John Lloyd assesses the impact of the MMM crisis The threatened collapse of a pyramid selling share company in Moscow is pitting the newly awakened forces of consumerism against the widely distrusted Russian authorities, calling into question the self-image of post-Soviet man and causing riots in Moscow and St Petersburg. MMM, a company which, since the beginning of this year has promised, and to many delivered, wealth through the simple purchase of shares - whose face value has risen from Rbs500 to over this past weekend Rbs115,000 - as far as is known owns nothing and invests in nothing. The 'shares' are quoted on no exchange, and rise by fiat of MMM and its director, Mr Sergei Mavrodi. It is a financial pyramid and it appears to have reached its apex. The shares were promoted in television campaigns. Created by Mr Bakhyt Kilibayev, a Kazakh film director, they feature the working class Golubkov family which enriches itself through MMM. From modest beginnings, the Golubkovs rise to the possibility of a Parisian holiday  - 'after all, why not?' says Lenya (Leonid) G to his wife Marina Sergeyevna, in a phrase which has become a slogan of the times. The 'high ups' began to rumble disapproval. Mr Yeltsin said recently 'Lenya is getting on my nerves' - a reaction which the daily Izvestiya said insulted the millions of Lenyas who wanted a little of the good life that the president had secured for himself. Last Friday - a black one for MMM - a triple salvo was fired from the finance ministry, the anti-monopoly ministry and the tax inspectorate, alleging widespread abuses by MMM both centrally and in two Russian cities, and non-payment of nearly Rbs50bn in taxes. MMM's reaction was instant and incandescent. Mr Sergei Brish, an MMM spokesman, said the company was not liable for taxes - and that documents called for by the government had been prepared and despatched in a van to the tax department but were unfortunately stolen en route. In outraged letters published in the press, Mr Mavrodi took up the loftiest of ground. The 'high-ups', he said, did not like popular enrichment. If the 'high-ups' were against them, then they would rise against the authorities to start a revolution of shareholders. The shareholders are beginning to revolt, but not yet against the government. They want their money. Immediately after the flurry of government warnings, the black market price for MMM shares - selling at the end of last week for Rbs105,000 - dipped to Rbs40,000. MMM closed most of its 60 Moscow and 76 regional buying and selling points - but took advertising space to claim the difficulties were temporary and the share price would be hiked up to Rbs115,000 - and on Monday opened up again and appeared to calm the gathering panic, as the black market price soared once more. But on Thursday, it dipped again and the selling points closed. Crowds began gathering at No. 26 Varshavskoe Chaussee in southern Moscow - the only point where shares could be sold - and round the MMM branch office in St Petersburg. By yesterday evening, some 10,000-15,000 people were gathered round the Varshavskoe office, and MMM had called for riot police. The crowd was indeed aroused: at the front, there was pushing against the police lines and evident anger. Said one shareholder, Mr Vassily Karpov - a pensioner - 'I bought 20 shares three months ago when they cost Rbs28,000 and I was going to take a holiday in Sochi (on the Black Sea). It's all I have.' However, another, Ms Elena Truvin, said: 'I think most of us still support MMM because they haven't let us down. The government did all this by their stupidity.' Of Mr Mavrodi nothing is known. MMM released a statement yesterday saying that its points would re-open as soon as the police could guarantee the safety of the money delivered to them. In the weekly Soversheno Sekretno an anonymous psychologist opined that Lenya Golubkov had changed the image of the average Russian from that of an obedient worker to an Oblomov - the hero of Goncharov's 19th century novel, who spends all day on a couch dreaming of wealth but incapable of earning it.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / People: Former Hammerson chief takes expertise to Asda John Parry has been appointed as a non-executive director of Asda Property Holdings, following his retirement earlier this month as managing director of Hammerson Property Investment and Development Corporation. Tony Roscoe, managing director of Asda, said that Parry had been asked to join the board because of his integrity, depth of knowledge and experience of running a much larger property company. Asda Property Holdings used to be one of the few residential property companies on the stock market, but the proportion of residential property has now fallen below 10 per cent of its portfolio. Over the last 18 months the company has repositioned itself by selling residential property and buying high yielding commercial property. Parry joined Hammerson in 1984 from Commercial Union Properties, where he was managing director. He spent his early career as a development surveyor. Parry was last year's president of the British Property Federation, a landlords' association. He is also a member of the Department of Environment's Property Advisory Group, a member of the British Council of Offices and a board member of the College of Estate Management at Reading.</p>

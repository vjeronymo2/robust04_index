			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 17 (AFP) -- The European Community  criticised U.S. attempts to force open the Japanese market here  Thursday [17 February], and proposed a joint approach with  Washington and Tokyo to overcome Japan's barriers to foreign  imports.    EC Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the Community did  not  support the U.S. strategy to negotiate sectoral market shares  with Japan because "there seems to be an element of managed  trade in it." He was speaking at a press conference to launch a  major export promotion campaign aimed at helping small and  medium-sized European firms get a foothold on the Japanese  market.    The United States and Japan have been brought to the brink  of  a trade war because of Japanese refusal to accept numerical  targets for increasing imports of American products. Brittan  said the EC was nervous about the U.S. "numerical target"  approach because American gains in Japanese market share could  be at European expense.    The EC, by contrast, is trying to make European goods more  attractive to Japanese consumers, while at the same time trying  to make Japan dismantle general barriers to foreign imports such  as tax laws and cartels. Brittan suggested that the EC and the  U.S. might work together in a "trilateral approach" with Tokyo  to push exports to Japan and at the same time create an economic  environment which would encourage Japanese consumer demand. But  he stressed that the idea was still in its infancy, and not yet  a firm proposal.    Announcing the "Gateway to Japan" initiative, Brittan said:  "We are pushing open the door to Japan.... We look to European  businessmen to march through that gateway into the Japanese  market." Penetrating the Japanese market might be difficult, he  said, but was possible if the Europeans produced quality,  properly-promoted products at the right price.    The Commission said the "Gateway to Japan" programme would  include workshops throughout the EC for medium-sized companies  interested in testing the Japanese market, plus trade missions  and displays in Japan. It is to concentrate during a kick-off  1994-95 phase on support for companies in the medical equipment  and handling, mechanical handling, machine tools and furniture  sectors.    The programme is to be extended in 1995-96 to other fields,  possibly including such sectors as marine equipment,  construction materials and equipment, waste management  technologies and packaging machinery. The Commission said these  were sectors where European firms were particularly competitive,  although underrepresented on the Japanese market.    Brittan said the European Commission would finance the  three-year campaign to the tune of ECU7.1 million (7.8 million  dollars). It will be run by the Association of European  Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Euro-Chamber). The EC's  trade deficit with Japan was 31 billion dollars in 1992 and 26  billion dollars in 1993.    Brittan said EC sales to Japan between 1986 and 1992 had  increased 78 percent faster than its world-wide exports, but  that this trade had fallen off over the last two years.    Euro-Chamber president Thomas MacPherson said: "This is a  very major project. The message is that selling in Japan is not  impossible. It can be profitable."    The Commission also announced it was extending another  annual  scheme to boost EC-Japan trade -- by teaching Japanese to about  50 young European executives, then placing them in Japanese  firms for six months.</p>

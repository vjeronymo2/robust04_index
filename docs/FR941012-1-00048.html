			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Duration of Waiver; Accident and Incident Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the requests indicated a 2-year period for the beta test, the FHWA notes that the alpha test was delayed several times to resolve technical matters. Since all research in a field environment is likely to experience some start-up delays, the FHWA proposes to make the term of the waiver 3 years for HELP and 3 years for ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, or until the beta test is completed, whichever occurs first. This would allow for a continuous period of data collection once the programs were fully underway. If the waiver is granted, this period would begin when the FHWA publishes the final conditions of the waiver in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Motor carriers participating in ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP would be required to provide the FHWA's Office of Motor Carrier Standards with information on accidents (as defined in &sect;390.5 of the FMCSRs) involving the vehicles equipped with the transponders. Accident reports would be required to be submitted every 6 months, and would be required to contain the information listed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A copy of all accident reports prepared and required by State or other governmental entities or insurers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Interview information with the driver and occupants of the CMV involved. The information would be required to include specifically whether the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle believed that the presence of the transponder was a factor in the accident. The interview would be required to be conducted by a motor carrier employee responsible for supervising the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. State and Local Laws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA strongly encourages State and local authorities with safety regulations that would prohibit the use of the proposed transponders to accept the terms of the waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V. Number of Vehicles To Be Equipped With Transponders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The number of straight trucks, tractors, and motorcoaches that may be equipped with the transponders would be limited to no more than 5000 for ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and 25,000 for HELP. The names and USDOT numbers of the motor carriers participating in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP programs, as well as the number of transponder-equipped CMVs operated by each carrier, would be required to be provided to the FHWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Termination of Waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The transponders would be required to be removed from the CMVs participating in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP projects (1) upon completion of the 3-year period, or (2) upon completion of the project, or (3) when required by the FHWA either at the completion of a semi-annual review or at any time it is determined by the FHWA that the continued use of the devices decreases the safe operation of the vehicles on which they are used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP would be required to provide separate reports at the conclusion of the program describing the transponder's installation and use. The reports would be required to include information obtained from the drivers on the device's effect on visibility through the windshield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA requests public comment on the proposed waiver and on the attendant conditions. Comments are also sought from State and local enforcement officials relating to their experiences with windshield-mounted electronic devices, such as those used in electronic toll-collection systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA is also interested in comments on the projected impacts on safety if windshield-mounted transponders were to be allowed under &sect;393.60(c) of the FMCSRs, without the conditions that would be imposed under the waiver.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (49 U.S.C. 31136, 31502; 49 CFR 1.48)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: October 5, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Rodney E.

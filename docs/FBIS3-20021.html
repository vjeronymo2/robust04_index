			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ignoring the Lessons of History"] </F>   [Text] The Greek Government has reacted strongly to the UN  Secretary-General's recommendation to the Security Council that  Turkish troops be sent to former Yugoslavia as peace keepers.  Greece's objections are certainly not unreasonable, even though  the West will dismiss them as yet another example of Greek  nationalist hysteria and paranoia. How could the deployment of  2,700 Turkish peacekeepers destabilise the Balkans, as Greece  has been claiming, Western policymakers would ask. And why  should Turkey's offer have been turned down considering the  shortage of peacekeeping troops and the reluctance of most  countries participating in UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], to  send more soldiers to former Yugoslavia? Countries like Britain  and France, understandably, welcomed this move because it meant  they would not have to send more soldiers to the Balkans.    Greece on the other hand has every right to complain. First,  as Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias pointed out in his letter  to the Security Council, the move went against "general  principles applying in cases of sending special UN troops".  These principles "are the nonparticipation of countries with  some historical relation to war in the area and nonparticipation  of neighbouring states," he said. Turkey might not be a  neighbouring state, but it is very much part of the Balkans  which it ruled, in the guise of the Ottoman empire for some 500  years, until early this century. The "historical relation"  cannot be denied. And neither could the possibility of  destabilisation in the Balkans; Turkey will initially send  almost 3.000 soldiers into former Yugoslavia, but the number  could increase substantially in the future.    Then there is the Cyprus factor which has been completely  ignored. It is an amazing paradox that Turkey, an occupying  power for 20 years, can join a UN peacekeeping force in one of  the most unstable regions in the world. This is a country whose  1974 "peace operation" in Cyprus has meant the stationing of 30  to 40 thousand troops and some 300 tanks on the island ever  since. And all indications are that it has no intention  whatsoever of withdrawing them. Admittedly, it will be  extremely difficult, if not impossible, for Ankara to do the  same in former Yugoslavia, but that is not really the issue.  The fact is, the UN Secretary-General should not have even  considered the sending of Turkish troops as an option, bearing  in mind the situation in Cyprus and Turkey's blatantly negative  role in UN-sponsored attempts to find a settlement. This makes  it quite clear that neither the Secretary-General, nor the UN  Security Council consider Turkey has any responsibility for the  division of Cyprus and repeated failures to achieve a settlement.    Obviously such trivialities are not given a second thought  by  the Western powers, all of which enjoy excellent relations with  Turkey, a reliable and dependable ally. In the case of former  Yugoslavia, the Security Council is also trying to keep  satisfied the Muslim countries, which were angered by the  deployment of Orthodox Russian peacekeepers. Now, with the  arrival of the Turks, there is a balance in the peacekeeping  presence, at least in the eyes of the Muslim world. As for  Turkey, sending troops will help it to promote itself as a  country which works for peace and stability in the region,  despite the increasingly brutal tactics it is using to suppress  the Kurdish revolt in the southeast and the continuing  occupation of Cyprus.    As one foreign ministry official in Ankara gloated yesterday  regarding the sending of troops to former Yugoslavia: "We're  very pleased with this. Yet another confirmation of Turkey's  position as a country which works for peace and stability in the  region."</p>

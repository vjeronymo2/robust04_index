			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sligos' 4.7-percent growth"] </F>   [Text] Last year, Sligos' business turnover has recorded a  slight progress. If Marben Software Engineering firm  (specialized in real time computing and  telecommunications)--consolidated since last July--is also  figured in, total business turnover comes to 3.81 billion French  francs [Fr]. Next to a constant size and rate of change this  growth can be considered practically as being equal to zero  (+0.4 percent). On the contrary, the net profit has diminished  by 7.1 percent (Fr160.6 million against Fr172.8 million in  1992). According to Sligos' CEO, Henri Pascaud, the successor of  Gerard Bauvin--presently presiding over Clio, a holding of  Credit Lyonnais charged with managing the bank's participation  in the computer field: "The engineering (segment), which  represents 35 percent of our business turnover, has decreased by  2 percent." The finances, the second greatest component in  Sligos' income (35 percent of the total), has recorded a  6.5-percent growth. The means of payment activity, fueled by  orders for memory cards and by check processing, has recorded a  boom of 19.4 percent (Fr528 million). For 1994, Henri Pascaud  does not predict any strong growth, unless Sligos gets new  acquisitions.</p>

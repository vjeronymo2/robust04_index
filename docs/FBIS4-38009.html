			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Bishqar from Beirut] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.  The issue of the Palestinian detainees in the jails of the  Zionist occupation authorities continues to be the focus of  public activity in occupied Palestine. A general strike was  observed today in the West Bank, occupied Jerusalem, and the two  Palestinian autonomous areas of Gaza and Jericho to show  solidarity with thousands of Palestinian detainees who reject  the Zionist conditions for their release. They have been on a  hunger strike since last week.    Today's strike was accompanied by massive demonstrations in  West Bank towns and refugee camps and sit-ins in front of the  offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]  in Gaza and Jericho. The protesters called for the detainees'  unconditional release and criticized the PLO leadership's method  of handling the detainee issue.    Hundreds of Palestinian detainees in the Zionist jail in  Nabulus have also assailed the PLO leadership. In a statement  today, they leveled sharp criticisms at Yasir 'Arafat's  leadership style which exploits the detainee issue as a  bargaining chip. The statement affirmed that the detainees will  persist in refusing to sign declarations of support for the  peace agreement with the enemy or promise to halt the intifadah  as a condition for their release.    Ahmad Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] distributed a leaflet in the  West Bank blaming 'Arafat's leadership for the continued  suffering of thousands of Palestinian detainees in the enemy's  jails. The PFLP-GC called on the Palestinian people to continue  their intifadah and express solidarity with the detainees by  demonstrating and holding sit-ins.    The Forces of the Palestinian Alliance that comprise the 10  factions opposed to the peace agreement with the enemy organized  a sit-in today for the second day running in front of the ICRC  office in Damascus to declare solidarity with the detainees.  The protesters delivered a message to ICRC officials, to be  forwarded to the United Nations, calling for the prompt and  unconditional release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli  jails regardless of their political affiliations.    Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front  for the Liberation of Palestine, declared in the Syrian capital  today that the Palestinian detainee issue is the focus of a  fresh popular resurgence inside and outside occupied Palestine.  Hawatimah emphasized that the Palestinians are confident now  that the peace agreement between the PLO and the Zionist enemy  does not serve their interests and cannot survive because of the  complex problems hindering its implementation, particularly in  connection with the issues of Jerusalem, the detainees, and  Palestinian human rights.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Underweight and over here: UK bonds and equities are attractive foreign targets for US institutional investors US investment institutions have been notoriously shy of investing in overseas securities. But with Wall Street putting a value on US corporate earnings and assets higher than that prevailing before the 1929 crash, there are signs that the rest of the world risks catching the fever as US fund managers see attractions in cheaper overseas markets. Indeed, there is a hint of a parallel with the Japanese speculative bubble in the late 1980s. While the monetary symptoms are different, an important shift in asset allocation is under way and the impact is no less significant for third parties - not least the UK, which has almost certainly been the biggest recent beneficiary of the outward flow of funds. Meanwhile, a wider process of international diversification gathers pace, raising questions about how far differences in earnings multiples and dividend yields between individual country markets might be ironed out. First, the data. In 1992, US investors' net purchases of foreign bonds and equities increased by 9.3 per cent to Dollars 51bn. On the crude statistics from the US Treasury, nearly all of the Dollars 19bn earmarked for foreign bonds in 1992 went into the UK, while the UK displaced Japan last year as the biggest repository for US equity investors' money, accounting for Dollars 11.3bn of a Dollars 32bn total outflow. That Dollars 11.3bn compares with net purchases of equities by UK life funds and pension funds in 1992 of Dollars 4.4bn out of a total cash flow of Dollars 35.7bn. In practice, the UK share is probably overstated, in that it almost certainly includes some funds that ultimately find their way into continental Europe. But Dollars 4.9bn is said to have been invested in the UK equity market in the final quarter of last year alone, after the September devaluation added to the attraction of sterling and equities. This compares with Dollars 4.4bn that found its way to Japan in the whole of 1992; so the broad thesis that the London market has been grabbing the lion's share looks plausible. At the same time the flow of portfolio investment from the US into foreign markets in the first quarter of 1993 has accelerated sharply. According to UBS Global Research, a record Dollars 26.6bn went into foreign bonds and equities, compared with Dollars 17.4bn in the previous quarter. But, within those totals, the UK's share of the equity outflow fell from Dollars 4.9bn to Dollars 1.4bn. That turnround clearly helps explain the sideways movement of UK equities this year. The balance of international portfolio diversification is inevitably unequal because the US and Japan, which respectively accounted for 38.7 per cent and 30.8 per cent of the FT-Actuaries World Index at June 30, are elephants in the rowing-boat: while inflows from the rest of the world cannot impact greatly on these two countries' domestic markets, changes in asset allocation that are small for the US and Japan can cause huge upheavals in the large number of countries that make up the remaining 30.5 per cent. Put another way, last year's Dollars 51bn US outflow was equivalent to less than three months' cash flow of the mutual fund industry alone. US insurers and pension funds hold only 4-5 per cent of their assets in foreign securities. But there is a growing awareness of the theoretical benefits of diversification, which increases returns for a given degree of risk; and, as Andrew Garthwaite of SG Warburg Securities points out, most risk analysis models in the US suggest the figure should be nearer 15 per cent. The incentive to raise the portfolio percentage overseas has been reinforced by the beneficial impact of prolonged dollar weakness on the performance of institutions with above-average foreign holdings. The fact that the US equity market remains obdurately overvalued, and that private investors continue to pour money into mutual funds, makes higher-yielding markets in Britain and France look all the more tempting. Increasing integration in world capital markets should be economically beneficial in that it encourages capital to flow more efficiently into investment that promises a high return. Yet in practice the flows are oddly distributed. The UK market, for example, offers less in the way of diversification benefits than any other European market because of the UK corporate sector's disproportionately large direct investment in the United States. Yet it hogs a disproportionate share of international money. The emerging markets in developing countries offer the biggest diversification benefits, because of their low correlation with international market movements: they do not move in step with the fund manager's domestic market. Yet the World Bank calculates that they account for less than a quarter of a per cent of worldwide institutional assets. This highlights the fact that institutional money tends to go to the most liquid markets, rather than to those that offer the highest degree of diversification. And it raises a question about how far integration can go. In theory the scope is immense. The World Bank estimates, for example, that global institutional investment funds are worth Dollars 14,000bn. If the fund managers were to make a modest genuflection to modern portfolio theory and put just 10 per cent into foreign securities, the impact on markets would be considerable. Yet even in the US the constraints on foreign investment are not to be under-estimated. While private sector pension funds enjoy considerable freedom, state pension funds, whose cash flow is still growing strongly, often have restrictions on overseas investment. For US insurers, state rules are often prohibitive. Even where they are being relaxed, as in New York State where the ceiling on foreign investments was lifted from 3 per cent to 6 per cent in 1990, insurers are still prevented from obeying the full logic of risk analysis. In Japan, fund managers formally enjoy sufficient discretion to diversify their portfolios significantly. But in practice official guidance still plays an important part in determining the flow of funds. In continental Europe, there are heavy restraints on cross-border investments, as well as explicit requirements in some countries to invest a given portfolio percentage in government bonds. This means that capital market integration is more of a one-way street; and now the process has in effect been frozen, after a decision to put a liberalising European Community pensions directive on the Brussels back burner last month. As for the developing countries, their capital markets suffer from lack of liquidity, poor information and regulatory restraints on foreign capital. Yet many are beginning to recognise that portfolio inflows reduce the cost of capital for domestic companies. One spectacular result of this change in attitude can be seen in Latin America, where gross equity portfolio inflows have gone from Dollars 434m in 1989 to Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. International bond issues have performed in similarly dramatic fashion. Repatriated flight capital has played a part, as have high-risk, high-return funds. But foreign insurers and pension funds have so far been insignificant contributors. At first sight, a reduction in the cost of capital in the recipient country looks an attractive gain from capital market liberalisation. So, too, does the idea that these flows represent more stable long-term finance for budget deficits and the balance of payments. On this ground alone, the UK might be thankful that US institutions are a little less underweight, internationally, and over here. Yet there is scant evidence that US institutions are building up core holdings in European markets, establishing big foreign companies as permanent features in the portfolio. And there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that cross-border institutional investment is just hot money in another guise - witness the role of pension funds in the currency turmoil in Europe last September. Certainly British institutions take a shorter-term view of foreign markets and generate a far higher level of turnover and activity in overseas securities than at home. All of which points to a greater degree of volatility as world markets integrate further.</p>

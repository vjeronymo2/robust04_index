			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW FOR THE DIFFICULT PART: SHAMIR'S GOVERNMENT WILL WALK A THIN LINE;  </P> <P> ISRAEL: THE PRIME MINISTER NEEDED ONLY THE RADICAL RIGHT TO WIN, BUT TO GOVERN  HE NEEDS SUPPORT FROM BOTH LABOR AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.  </P> <P> For the past six years, Israel has been ruled by a two-headed monster known as  the Government of National Unity. Last week Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir  slayed the beast, replacing it with a narrow-based, Likud-led coalition. The  storybook quality of this victory is flawed, however, by stark political  reality: Unlike the mythic heroes of old, Shamir the dragon killer is not  likely to live happily ever after.  </P> <P> He may well come to miss the beast. Shamir is a man who, in his three terms as  prime minister, has elevated inaction to an art form. The unity government,  which balanced Likud and Labor, hawks and doves, was a perfect vehicle for him  precisely because it provided an excuse for political and diplomatic paralysis.  Shamir's new coalition, whatever its flaws, offers no such option. Sooner  rather than later, the reluctant dragon killer will have to do what he likes  least -- make hard decisions about peace. Shamir's choices will affect  U.S.-Israeli relations, the Middle East diplomatic process and the continuing  influx of Soviet emigres into Israel.  </P> <P> Specifically, Shamir will be called on to decide what to do about the  Palestinian issue. On his left, the Bush Administration and the Israeli Labor  Party -- magically transformed from docile junior partner to a fighting  opposition -- are pushing hard for Israel to renew its peace initiative and sit  down for talks with the Palestinians.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III expressed U.S. frustration with the peace  process last week when he gave out the White House phone number and told  Israeli officials they should call when they were serious about peace. Without  Israel, Baker said, the United States will end efforts to set up talks. The  short-term goal of the peaceniks is a conference in Cairo, followed by West  Bank-Gaza elections and the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. But Shamir  is well aware that there is a long-range aim as well: Israel's withdrawal from  most or all of the occupied territories and the eventual establishment of Arab  sovereignty.  </P> <P> This is something that Shamir, a lifelong hard-liner, opposes. His method has  been to stonewall, but he is already being pressured by at least half a dozen  far-right militants in his coalition to annex occupied land. The super-hawks  want, at minimum, massive Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza -- and no  peace talks.  </P> <P> At the center of the Shamir government is the Likud, a right-center bloc that  has ruled for most of the last 13 years. This time, however, the more  left-leaning Labor partners of the National Unity Government have been replaced  by politicians from the far right, tilting the entire Cabinet in a more hawkish  direction. In the face of such diametrically different demands, Shamir's  problem is simple: He must keep American pressure at a manageable level, while  holding together his narrow coalition. The solution is as tricky: To form a  government, Shamir needed only the support of the radical right; to govern, he  requires the cooperation of the Bush Administration and the Labor Party. It is  difficult to see how he can have both.  </P> <P> This is largely a matter of arithmetic. Shamir's coalition, minus the votes of  the three small, super-hawkish parties that support him, equals 55 members of  the Knesset -- six fewer than the majority he needs to sustain his government.  These parties have made it clear that they will not go along with any serious  diplomatic initiative -- especially not the kind that the American government  advocates. Any attempt by Shamir to freeze settlement, or to revive the peace  process, would almost certainly lead to a walkout.  </P> <P> But there is another set of numbers in the equation. The hundreds of thousands  of expected Soviet immigrants, minus massive American financial support, equal  economic and social chaos for Israel. This is a real possibility. Past American  Presidents have not used foreign aid as a lever against Jerusalem, but the Bush  Administration gives every indication of planning to do so. The United States,  for example, is holding up a sorely needed, $400-million bank guarantee for  immigrant resettlement. Money will be forthcoming only if Israel provides  assurances that it will not be used for housing in the occupied territories.  The Bush Administration defines the occupied territories as including East  Jerusalem, although Israel and the U.S. Congress regard the entire city as its  capital.  </P> <P> This condition is painful, but probably bearable for Shamir. What concerns him  is the precedent. Should the United States make further financial aid  conditional on Israeli agreement to attend a peace conference with Palestinian  delegates it finds unacceptable, or to stop Jewish settlement in the West Bank  -- and especially East Jerusalem -- he could never go along. But without  continued American aid it would be all but impossible to absorb the anticipated  immigrants.  </P> <P> Faced with equally unpleasant alternatives, Shamir has begun sending out  contradictory signals. In his inaugural address, he spoke in conciliatory terms  of his commitment to the Camp David accords, and of his willingness to  negotiate with the Arabs and the Palestinians. Shamir laterdispatched Defense  Minister Moshe Arens to the West Bank as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish  settlers.  </P> <P> Rhetoric will take Shamir only so far. His inclination is to edge toward the  center but to do that he will need the cooperation of two  ex-generals-turned-politician -- Ariel Sharon and Yitzhak Rabin.  </P> <P> Sharon is the leader of the militant wing of the Likud. He is also the minister  of housing in the new government. An ambitious man, he wants to follow the  aging Shamir as prime minister. To do so, he will have to succeed in his  primary task -- building tens of thousands of homes for Soviet immigrants. If  Sharon becomes convinced that this is possible only with U.S. aid -- he could  become an improbable force for moderation.  </P> <P> The former defense minister is less ideological than is often supposed and he  has been known to display flexibility when his political interests are  concerned. With his support, Shamir could conceivably renew the peace process,  albeit at a cautious pace.  </P> <P> Such a move would probably drive the super-hawks out of the coalition. This is  where Rabin comes in. Rabin recently launched a challenge to Labor Party leader  Shimon Peres. If he succeeds -- and his chances seem better than even -- he is  on record as favoring another Government of National Unity, in which he would  play a restraining role.  </P> <P> Any other dragon slayer might be dismayed at the prospect of a new unity  coalition. But for Shamir the Reluctant, under pressure to move in opposite  directions, it would be more desirable than to climb aboard yet another  two-headed monster for a slow ride to nowhere.  </P></p>

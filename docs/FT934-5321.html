			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Court will hear Viacom appeal The Delaware supreme court yesterday agreed to hear appeals by Paramount Communications and Viacom against a ruling last week which blocked the terms of their planned merger, writes Richard Waters. If the supreme court upholds the earlier ruling, Viacom will be forced to raise its offer for Paramount to at least the level of a rival bid by QVC Network if it is to succeed. The hearing has been set for December 9.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> WHEN TAKING ON MORE DEBT IS A SMART MOVE  </P> <P> There's no rest for the indebted.  </P> <P> Donald J. Trump must sell assets and secure more loans before additional  payments come due next month or the boy billionaire will add another "b" word  to his vocabulary -- bankrupt.  </P> <P> Trump, of course, borrowed beyond his means -- and he is certainly not alone.  </P> <P> The past five years, consumer and mortgage debt has increased 9.3% annually,  while personal income has grown less than 5% a year. Today, the average  American -- man, woman and child -- has borrowed nearly a full year's income.  </P> <P> "Whether you are a small-time investor or a mega-investor like Donald Trump, if  you don't use debt wisely, you end up in trouble," said Richard Martens,  executive vice president of retail lending at Security Pacific National Bank.  </P> <P> Does that mean it's time to stop borrowing altogether? Not necessarily.  </P> <P> Using other people's money is still a good way to get rich. The trick is  determining when borrowing will be profitable. Credit experts say there are a  number of rules that borrowers can follow to determine when debt makes sense.  </P> <P> * Borrow when the cash generated by the investment is sufficient to cover the  debt.  </P> <P> An example is the purchase of rental property whose rents will cover expenses  related to the property's purchase, with the exception of the down payment and  closing costs.  </P> <P> "The first rule of thumb is every property needs to have cash flow even after  taking into consideration the mortgage, taxes, insurance, repairs and potential  vacancies," said Richard L. Otterstrom, president of Coast Harbor Realty in  Venice. "If you are not an experienced owner and manager, you should also  pencil in the cost of outside management."  </P> <P> Vacancy rates typically range from 5% to 10%, Otterstrom said.  </P> <P> Cash flow is a product of the size of the down payment and the kind of loan  secured. Fixed-rate loans are more predictable, but adjustable-rate loans are  often less expensive the first few years.  </P> <P> More significantly, the bigger the down payment, the better the cash flow. But,  remember, that money is tied up in a long-term, non-interest-bearing  investment. Consumers must weigh the benefits of generating even better cash  flow against the loss of the use of that money. Generally, investors shouldn't  put more down than required to create break-even monthly cash flow because  excess cash can be better spent elsewhere.  </P> <P> * Borrow when money is cheap.  </P> <P> In inflationary times, it makes sense to borrow because the loan will be paid  off with cheaper, inflated dollars. In the meantime, those funds could be  invested in higher-yielding securities.  </P> <P> Even when inflation is not an issue, people can sometimes earn money by  borrowing and investing the funds at a profit.  </P> <P> "Deferred" wages are one such opportunity. Some companies allow their workers  to lend the corporation cash by deferring part of that year's salary. To  encourage this, the company often pays the worker an amount equivalent to its  borrowing costs -- prime plus 1%, for example. At today's rates, that amounts  to 11%. If the employee can borrow elsewhere at a lower rate -- possibly  through a home equity loan -- the transaction can earn handsome rewards with  little risk.  </P> <P> * Borrow when your monthly income is sufficient to cover the debt and the money  can be used to create greater value.  </P> <P> This is, perhaps, the trickiest rule because what looks like a sure thing  doesn't always pan out. And some people are able to justify virtually any  expense with an argument that it will produce a potentially lucrative reward.  </P> <P> It is easy to justify borrowing to buy a car when it is the only reliable form  of transportation to get to work. But does it make sense to go into debt to buy  an $80,000 Mercedes? Most financial advisers would say no. But there are  exceptions. A few professionals might argue that, to be successful, they must  have some trappings of success.  </P> <P> * Borrow to build equity.  </P> <P> It often makes sense to borrow to buy a first home or fix one up. First-time  home buyers not only save money on rent, they also gain tax benefits and build  equity.  </P> <P> Generally, mortgage lenders say a house payment should not exceed 30% to 40% of  the borrower's gross monthly income.  </P> <P> Spending on remodeling can be rewarding. The rule of thumb is: Spend if  improvements will be worth $2 -- when the home is resold -- for every $1  invested. Home-improvement publications often list the kinds of additions and  remodeling projects that are most likely to pay off.  </P> <P> * Borrow when the money is free.  </P> <P> You're in a department store about to make a purchase. Do you write a check  from your interest-bearing checking account, or borrow by putting the purchase  on a store credit card?  </P> <P> If the store allows a grace period for payments, borrowing makes sense because  the debt is free. Also, stores often have promotions where they'll extend the  grace period.  </P> <P> Earnings on the "float" are small, of course.  </P> <P> The debt should be paid before the grace period expires, however, because most  department stores charge upward of 19% for credit.  </P> <P> * Don't borrow when monthly payments exceed your ability to pay with your  monthly salary, without overtime. When you need more than your monthly salary  to pay debts, you are clearly overextended.  </P> <P> * Don't borrow long term at high, short-term rates. In other words, don't keep  a high monthly balance on credit cards when you could refinance that balance  through a less-expensive home-equity loan.  </P> <P> * When you have insufficient cash flow, don't borrow on equity.  </P> <P> Californians often borrow against equity in real estate, sometimes with the  intention of "turning" properties -- reselling them quickly -- or developing  them.  </P> <P> This may not make sense in today's slower real estate environment. Not only  have home prices stopped rising rapidly, the amount of time required to sell  one has increased considerably.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today the U.S. draft resolution on  phased UN sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK) contradicts an earlier agreement reached between  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The document was distributed at the United Nations Security  Council by the United States on Wednesday [15 June].    Kozyrev told reporters that he was confused by the fact that  "American diplomats had distributed in New York a draft  resolution containing a concrete list of sanctions" against DPRK.    The U.S. move was made contrary to the "absolutely clear"  agreement reached in a telephone conversation between Yeltsin  and Clinton, as well as between their foreign ministers "to act  jointly, to work on the draft resolution together and not to  make unilateral initiative," Kozyrev pointed out.    He stressed that "in any case we shall not support the set  of  sanctions proposed without a preliminary agreement with us."</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Euro Disney considers rights issue to raise funds EURO DISNEY, plagued by financial problems since the opening of its theme park outside Paris in April last year, is considering a rights issue as a way of reviving its fortunes. Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US entertainment company which is its largest shareholder, stressed in an interview with the Financial Times that the financial restructuring of Euro Disney was still at a preparatory stage and the two companies had not yet decided on the final package. Euro Disney announced in July it needed to restructure its finances. The group is expected by analysts to make a net loss of more than FFr1.8bn (Pounds 200m) in the financial year which ends this month, up from a loss of FFr188m last year. Its net debt has risen from FFr18.5bn to FFr20.3bn in this financial year. Euro Disney's shares closed last night down 45 centimes at FFr59.95. Floated in 1989, they have fallen 63 per cent since a record high of FFr164.30 in March 1992. Eisner interview, Page 17 Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Cleared analyst returns to SFA Mr Thorold Mackie, the Scottish investment analyst whose conviction for insider dealing was quashed on appeal last week, has had his registration with the Securities and Futures Authority restored. The move, which was not automatic, followed a meeting of an SFA panel yesterday which concluded that Mr Mackie was a 'fit and proper' person. The decision means he can resume his full duties at stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White. He voluntarily suspended his registration when he was first charged two years ago.</p>

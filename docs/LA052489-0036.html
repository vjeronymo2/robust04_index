			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Motown legend Smokey Robinson urged 1,800 high school students in Pasadena to  swear off drugs. "I hope you'll want to crush the dope man before he crushes  us," Robinson told the John Muir High School students Monday. "Every time you  buy drugs, you're feeding the dope man." Robinson, whose hit singles include  "Tears of a Clown," "Just to See Her" and "Cruisin'," was part of a program  that included Joseph Jennings, a former gang member and addict whose shock  approach and accounts of tragic personal experiences had students  spellbound.Claudia Puig  </P></p>

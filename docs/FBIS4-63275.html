			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Lithuanian Government "On the Homeland </F> Union's Proposal To Adopt by Way of Referendum the  Constitutional Draft Law `On Illegal Privatization, Devalued  Deposits and Stocks, and Law Enforcement Violations'" issued on  10 May in Vilnius]    [Text] Having considered the draft law "On Illegal  Privatization, Devalued Deposits and Stocks, and Law Enforcement  Violations" submitted by the Homeland Union (Lithuanian  Conservatives), and the commentary presented by its Executive  Council Chairman G. Vagnorius [former prime minister], the  Government of the Republic of Lithuania states that this draft  law is just another attempt of the Homeland Union to push  through an unconstitutional law. The enactment of its  provisions would set Lithuanian people against one another,  fool, and impoverish them even more, while the effects of all  this would be blamed on the president and the Government of the  Republic of Lithuania.    The current Lithuanian Government does not avoid fair and  harsh criticism. At the same time, it does not specifically  engage in the analysis and criticism of shortcomings of former  governments. Given such slander and reckless appeals, however,  the government must say to the countrymen what sort of draft law  this is, and what goals the Homeland Union leadership is  pursuing.    The draft law links in a populist manner and deliberately  confuses three problems: Compensation of devalued deposits,  privatization of state property, and long-term property  indexation. Undoubtedly, the key problem is the compensation of  deposits, which inhabitants had in Savings Bank accounts before  26 February 1991. At that time, the Lithuanian population had  almost 2.8 million accounts at the Savings Bank, that is, this  problem is pressing to nearly everyone, particularly to older  people. The total of deposits was 7.1 billion rubles [R].  However, only R0.4 billion were kept in the Lithuanian Savings  Bank accounts, and the remaining R6.7 billion -- in the USSR  Savings Bank. In fact, G. Vagnorius' government did not do  anything to make Russia return those deposits, and it chose the  easiest way for deceiving people by urging depositors to leave  their money intact in savings banks. Incidentally, procuring  cattle from inhabitants and having no real resources, G.  Vagnorius' government also urged inhabitants to leave their  money in savings banks. It promised to change those deposits  according to a more favorable exchange rate when introducing the  national currency.    The program of G. Vagnorius' government, which the Supreme  Council of the Republic of Lithuania approved on 13 June 1991  (the resolution was signed by current Homeland Union Chairman V.  Landsbergis), included a pledge to protect the inhabitants'  deposits in savings banks against inflation -- "by adding the  interest and, thus, increasing it in accordance with the  officially approved inflation rate (in percent) over a period of  interest review." Incidentally, it is this incorrect economic  policy of G. Vagnorius' government that brought the largest wave  on inflation to our country with its rate exceeding 50 percent  in certain months. Therefore, it is understandable why former  Lithuanian officials, V. Landsbergis and G. Vagnorius, who were  fully responsible for restricting the payment of deposits to  inhabitants and for their complete devaluation, have now chosen  such an immoral political method, and they dare and continue to  try to amass a political fortune from this problem.    Misleading the country's population, the Conservatives  are urging it in a populist move to adopt by way of referendum  their proposed draft law, because otherwise illegal  privatization will not be prevented, and inhabitants will lose  the savings that are backed by assets subject to  privatization, while the economy and living standards will  continue to decline. G. Vagnorius stresses in particular  that if "we prevent the distribution of state property without  privatization, it will be possible to exchange the 1991 ruble  for more litas rather than just one." At first glance, this is  a very attractive appeal. It is very difficult for people to  realize why the current government is categorically  speaking out against the adoption of such a draft law.    First, inhabitants lost their savings long ago,  while the proposal to index them and other similar payments more  than a 100 times is not based on any real possibilities.    Compensation of savings and the restoration of the  Lithuanian  Savings Bank assets according to the proposed 100-fold  indexation alone would require about 8 billion litai [Lt]. One  can expect most Lithuanian people, particularly of retirement  age, who were already deceived by G. Vagnorius' government, to  come for their indexed deposits all at the same time. However,  the draft law does not envision the manner in which banks can  unrestrictedly pay indexed deposits until the assets transferred  to them are sold, and the sale of these assets will become  complicated due to their small value. Nor does the law envision  who will cover losses for banks if the property is sold at a  price lower than its indexed nominal value. It will not be easy  to privatize the remaining state property because the objects  that enjoyed the greatest demand (and had the lowest prices)  were sold at the beginning of privatization, when G. Vagnorius'  government was in power.    If the rules for indexing and paying deposits proposed in  the  draft law were applied, the money supply in circulation would  increase almost eight-fold and would exceed Lt9 billion, while  the current money supply is a bare Lt1.040 million. The absence  of an adequate amount of goods and services on the market would  immediately cause hyperinflation (unrestrained price rise) which  would gradually lead to the inevitable impoverishment of all  inhabitants, including depositors. This would have a  particularly painful effect on a large part of the population  which does not keep its savings in banks, as well as on  employees of budget offices, because there would be no chance of  increasing their wages in accordance with the inflation rate.  Hyperinflation would destroy the Lithuanian economy and would  fully devalue the national currency. The same conclusion was  drawn by the World Bank experts after studying the draft law.    Second, while reiterating to the Lithuanian  population about the possible indexation of deposits by using  finances received from the sale of state property, G. Vagnorius  should understand that it is his government that is primarily  responsible for distributing almost the entire state assets for  investment coupons for half price. Under this law, two-thirds  of the property subject to privatization could be sold for  investment coupons, that is, Lt712 million (two-thirds out of  Lt1.068 billion), while the actual sum was Lt1.313 billion, that  is, more than there was property for privatization. Although  people were allowed to use investment coupons to buy apartments  and land, or to privatize the property of agrarian enterprises  (Lt343 million in investment coupons were used for this  purpose), the amount of investment coupons issued for the  privatization of state assets under the law on the primary  privatization of state property exceeded the sum assigned by law  as being Lt257.7 million. Therefore, the possibilities of  commercial privatization are highly restricted in our country.  Certainly, the policy of utilization of investment coupons is  typical of all post- communist countries. However, sums of  investment coupons or other forms of state property payments  considerably differ in various states. For example, they  account for 25 and 20 percent of the entire state assets in the  Czech Republic and Slovenia, respectively. Meanwhile, in our  country, investment coupons account for 82 percent of state  property. Privatization in Estonia and Latvia is exclusively  commercial -- only for money.    Such a mode of state property privatization did not grant  any  possibilities to accumulate larger finances that could be  utilized to compensate devalued deposits. However, it is  already impossible to return to the former stage and change the  privatization of state property, or to nationalize the long-term  property that is privatized, because this would mean nothing  else but a new nationalization. The sacred principle of  property inviolability, contained in the Lithuanian  Constitution, would be violated. This would discredit our  government not only inside the country but also on the  international scene, because private property is preserved and  protected throughout the world.    Third, the deceitful and reckless statement that  "in early 1993, the majority of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party [LDDP] in the Seimas [parliament], as well as the  government, made some inadmissible amendments to privatization  laws and resolutions, which allegedly legalize the appropriation  of state assets and the property of true stockholders for "its  own people".... The denationalization of industrial enterprises  is even simpler. Since last spring, a "group of friends"  [reference to managers linked with the LDDP] has mostly  "transferred them" to stock companies without any privatization,  or without paying either in litas or investment coupons."    Under Article 31 of the law on state-run enterprises adopted  back in 1990 (G. Vagnorius actively participated in its  drafting), and under G. Vagnorius' government resolution No. 51  "On the Increase of Capital Stock at State-Run and State Stock  Enterprises With Their Own Resources," issued on 27 January  1992, enterprises were granted the right to enlarge their  capital stock with residue profits, by issuing free or partially  paid stocks in line with the law. This was the key method for  restoring devalued working capital of enterprises due to  hyperinflation, and for accumulating resources necessary for  investments.    An increase of the stock capital in line with the law on  state-run enterprises changes only the ratio of state and stock  capital, while the total sum of state capital remains  undiminished. Therefore, the change in the status of an  enterprise prevents the privatization of its state property,  because in this case the state acquires the stockholders' rights  defined in Article 14 of the law on stock companies of the  Republic of Lithuania. Such a process cannot be called  privatization or the appropriation of state property.    A commentary to the draft law often mentions a "group of  friends." However, these are not representatives of the  government or the Mafia, but collectives of enterprises that  became lawful stockholders. These are people who, under the  provisions of the law on state-run enterprises, allocated  residue profits for the enlargement of the stock capital, who  did not "eat up" residue profits in the form of bonuses or other  payments, and who did not put any additional pressure on the  consumer market. So, what is their guilt, and why do the  Conservatives propose to take away their amassed property?    Resolution No. 456 "On Privatization Rules for State-Run and  State Stock Enterprises, Non-Residential Facilities or Buildings  Leased From State Offices and Organizations With Private Capital  Investments," issued by G. Vagnorius' government on 12 June  1992, authorized the transfer of leased non-residential  facilities to private capital enterprises as a state property  contribution. The value of those facilities was assessed by the  experts' commission, while the Central Privatization Commission  was allowed to raise it to market prices. Between 1992 and  1993, lawfully leased facilities or buildings were transferred  to 77 private capital enterprises. The residue value of these  facilities is Lt38,400. The experts' commission assessed them  at Lt3.5 million, while the Central Privatization Commission  increased their value to Lt6.2 million. Nine commercial banks  received leased facilities as a state property contribution with  the residue value of Lt78,700, and the Central Privatization  Commission enlarged the latter to Lt10 million. Since this  resolution ran counter to the law on primary privatization of  state property, the current government amended it by resolution  No. 178 on 16 May 1994.    This repeatedly demonstrates that in pursuing selfish goals,  the Homeland Union leadership can bring the most absurd charges  against the Seimas majority and the current government.    Fourth, the Conservatives' proposal to index the  long-term property of enterprises, including that of agrarian  entities, offices, and organizations, in accordance with its  structure as of 1 May 1992, and with the overall rate of  devaluation, is totally unacceptable. With the privatization  process under way, the structure of capital has essentially  changed, and one cannot return to what is nonexistent.    Government resolution No. 206 of 28 March 1994 established  the ratio of property indexation considering the date this  property was acquired, and the fact that the volume of  production in industry and other sectors of the economy have  declined by about 50 percent in comparison with 1991.  Therefore, the effectiveness of long-term property has also  dropped by half, and it would be incorrect to estimate it  according to the full rate of devaluation, which the Statistics  Department is doing. A large part of the country's long- term  property comprises outdated equipment and technologies, which  had to be worn out. However, former government resolutions  continuously reduced the depreciation of the principal means of  production. During the first indexation, the depreciation of  long- term property was reduced twice, while during the second  indexation -- four times. This way, the true value of capital  goods became distorted. Therefore, government resolution No.  206 of 28 March 1994 envisions the indexation of the primary and  residual value in accordance with different ratios, by restoring  relevant depreciation. The surplus of the reviewed property is  ascribed as the state and stock capital registered before 1  April 1994.    The indexation of long-term property is mandatory for  state-run and state stock enterprises, while private companies  are only urged to accomplish this. Stockholders themselves must  demand from their managers the indexation of their long-term  property. Following the indexation of long-term property and  capital of enterprises, stockholders' capital is also indexed,  that is, the nominal value or the existing number of stocks is  increased. Therefore, stockholders will not incur any losses.  Thus, it is totally incomprehensible on what grounds G.  Vagnorius calls the resolution of the current government on the  indexation of long-term property "just another deliberate  deception of people" and impertinent arbitrary rule; why, in  his opinion, the value of the restored property "does not go to  its owners, that is, the true stockholders or the state; and  why is this property transferred in an unconstitutional manner  to a "group of friends," who has recently acquired stock  unlawfully or who has appropriated assets in some other way."  Is it not an attempt to discredit the current government at any  cost and to mislead the Lithuanian population?    Fifth, having done nothing or not having  fulfilled their promises to protect the inhabitant's deposits  against inflation, the Conservatives are now proposing in their  draft law (Paragraph 6 of Article 4) that the government assign  $6 million from the Lithuanian hard currency reserve to fully  compensate the deposits that were kept in the Lithuanian branch  of the USSR Foreign Economic Relations Bank. This is a tempting  proposal. However, we would like to ask G. Vagnorius on this  occasion why his government, which intended to compensate  inhabitants' devalued savings, wasted rather than preserved $5  million before the introduction of the litas by buying some  totally unnecessary medical equipment from the Canadian company  "Asmar." G. Vagnorius' government did not do anything to regain  from the USSR Foreign Economic Relations Bank the deposits of  physical and juridical persons estimated at $148.9 million, with  $95 million among them accumulated for the reconstruction of the  Klaipeda state oil enterprise, even though there were  possibilities for this. Large finances were also wasted to  acquire arms and supply the national defense system and the  government security service. The Seimas Commission for  Investigating Economic Crimes has established that G. Vagnorius'  government distributed several tens of millions of U.S. dollars  without Supreme Council approval. Meanwhile, this money could  be amassed to compensate the devalued investments.    The current government, in cooperation with the Seimas, is  looking for ways to compensate inhabitants' lost savings. In  its 15 December 1993 resolution No. 1-338, the Seimas approved  the rules of indexing inhabitants' savings accumulated before 26  February 1991, and established that beginning in 1995,  compensations for inhabitants' deposits will be estimated and  paid in accordance with the amount of finances saved in the  Income Restoration and Compensation Fund. The Seimas approved  the statute of this fund on 26 April 1994 by its resolution No.  I-444. This fund is formed with budget reserves, as well as  with money earned from the privatization of state property and  the sale of state stocks on the securities market, and with  dividends received for the state capital in stock companies, and  other resources. Under the current rules, by 1 May of this  year, the government has paid more than Lt108 million in  compensations, and it plans to pay another Lt100 million in  early 1995.    Government resolution No. 176 issued on 16 March 1994  defined  the rules of partial compensation for the deposits which  inhabitants kept at the Lithuanian branch of the USSR Foreign  Economic Relations Bank (a similar decision was also adopted in  1993). The Finance Ministry received $1.2 million from the  Government reserve fund to pay compensations to former  depositors of the aforementioned bank. As of 1 May, there were  $845,000 paid out of this fund. After the total assigned sum is  paid out, 1,081 persons (out of the total of 2,107 depositors at  the given bank) would receive full compensation for the  appropriated money.    In addition, the return of appropriated deposits is the  issue  of heated debate in negotiations with Russia.    Sixth, the Conservatives want the draft law to act  retroactively and recognize as unlawful the actions of  enterprises in increasing the stock capital with residual  profits and by other legal measures contained in laws and  resolutions drafted and adopted during the times of G.  Vagnorius' government.    This draft law has quite a number of inconsistencies and  contradictions with the current law of the Republic of  Lithuania. It is also full of inaccuracies and provisions  regulating such relations that cannot be the subject matter of  this law. Moreover, under Part 3 of Article 69 of the  Lithuanian Constitution, this draft law could be presented as  constitutional only if it is included in the list of  constitutional laws, drafted by the Lithuanian Seimas.    Following the universally accepted principle of the division  of powers, the lawfulness of some government actions should be  considered by the Constitutional Court rather than by way of  referendum.    By submitting this draft law, the Homeland Union is seeking  not to restore justice but to set Lithuanian people against one  another even more, to paralyze the economic and social policy  conducted by the current government, to cause chaos in the  country's economy, to impoverish the people, and to discredit  the Lithuanian Government through this.    Realizing the meaningless and absurd nature of this move,  the  Government of the Republic of Lithuania appeals to all  Lithuanian people not to yield to the temptation of Homeland  Union's populist proposals, and not to vote for this draft law.  We can improve our lives through patient daily work rather than  through referendums.    [Signed] The Government of the Republic of Lithuania    [Dated] 10 May 1994</p>

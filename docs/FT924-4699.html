			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: KPMG fee income up 1% KPMG PEAT MARWICK, the accountancy firm, declared fee income up just 1 per cent to Pounds 489m in the UK for the year to September 30, compared with the 12.3 per cent growth of the preceding year. In an indication of the difficulties facing professional practices, it cut its staff by 9 per cent to 9,398, including cutting three partners. It also closed four of its 49 offices. In common with other accountancy firms, Peat Marwick does not disclose its profits. Mr Jim Butler, senior partner, said the firm had been affected by the continuing recession and the strong competition in the market for professional services. Income from audit and accounting fell 3 per cent to Pounds 200m, and from management consulting by 8 per cent to Pounds 78m. This was offset by a 25 per cent increase from the corporate recovery division to Pounds 56m, a 3 per cent rise in taxation to Pounds 102m and a 6 per cent rise in corporate finance to Pounds 53m.</p>

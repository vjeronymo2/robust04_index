			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Betty Wendy Mendieta] </F>   [Text] Mario Boyd Galindo and Alonso Fernandez, legislators  who form part of the Foreign Relations Committee, pointed out  that President Bill Clinton's statements on the transfer of the  canal to Panama hit the nail on the head, while adding that it  is necessary to make certain amendments to the Torrijos-Carter  Treaty.    Legislator Alonso Fernandez acknowledged that the treaty  should undergo certain amendments because it was not discussed  by the people. Meanwhile, Legislator Mario Boyd Galindo said  anything that tends to ease the transition of the Panama Canal  to the Panamanians is appropriate.    It can be pointed out that, according to Legislator Alonso  Fernandez, the amendments to the Torrijos-Carter Treaty should  be negotiated between the Panamanian president and the U.S.  President. Meanwhile, Legislator Mario Boyd Galindo believes  President Bill Clinton is giving Panama the importance it  deserves because it is of vital importance for U.S. trade.    "Clinton's statements are very forceful because he knows  very  well that many Panamanians want the treaties to be amended,  Legislator Alonso Fernandez indicated. Legislator Mario Boyd  Galindo said: "The proposals made by President Bill Clinton to  Congress to reorganize the Canal Commission's corps are fitting  and necessary."</p>

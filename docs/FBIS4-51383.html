			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporters Liu Wei (0491 0251) and He </F> Guanghua (6320 1639 5478): "Looking at Tibet in a New Light"]    [Text] Whenever one mentions Tibet, one usually associates  it with backwardness, with being closed, and with barrenness.  Foreigners would rephrase it by calling it the "world's last  Shangri-la," which means the same thing. However, the reality  is totally different: This "roof of the world" amid reform and  opening up has unprecedented vigor and vitality and has in store  formidable hopes and prospects.....    At one time, Tibet was considered the "rear" of China's  reform and opening up.    No wonder. The blueprint for the 1990's drawn up by Tibetans  themselves does not seem to aim high. It fixes the annual  average growth rate at only approximately 5.8 percent. Of  course, it has difficulties which outsiders have difficulty  understanding. The "blood-transfusion" economy consistently  pursued over the past 40 years alone is a high wall that  destines Tibet to have a very, very long way to go for its  economic development, not to mention the contradiction between  the gradually decreasing farmland and the drastically increasing  population and the numerous restrictive factors such as  communications, energy, and population quality.    But this is no reason for Tibet to be content with the  present situation and not to think of making progress.    After the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his  southern tour was relayed to the ice-capped plateau in early  1992, Tibetans could no longer remain calm. They began to ask  themselves: Can Tibet remain "special" forever and continue to  depend on the state's long-term "blood transfusions"? Is Tibet  willing to accept the label of "being special" and stand at the  rear of reform and opening up?    Backwardness is not terrifying. Being geographically closed  is not terrifying. What is terrifying is rigid and conservative  thinking and the psychology of idleness. Since April 1992, a  big discussion on "changing the way of thinking and finding out  about the difference," which involved everyone on the plateau,  began in this context.    By transforming the "rear" into the "forefront" facing South  Asia and changing an advantage in resources into an economic  advantage, Tibetans this time seized the opportunity to increase  the extent of reform and strive to develop in pace with the  national economy.    At the beginning of July 1992, Tibet introduced a series of  policies and regulations, including those intended to "deepen  reform and increase the degree of openness," "encourage  investment in Tibet from abroad and at home," and quicken the  development of tertiary industry and township and town  enterprises. In mid-July, the ports of Tibet's Burang and  India's Gongci open and close at the same hours. The Yamarong  Border Trade Fair, which had been suspended for 33 years, and  other traditional border markets were restored. In August,  Tibet announced 19 projects to attract a total investment of  over 4 billion yuan. It also set up an office for attracting  investment from abroad and at home. Afterward, border-trade and  export-oriented economic development zones were set up in 10  counties and ports on the Tibetan border. In September,  large-scale economic and trade talks between Tibet and Nepal  solemnly opened in Lhasa.....    With its unprecedented high efficiency, quick tempo, and new  attitude, the "roof of the world" made the world see it in a new  light.    That summer, an unprecedented market wave swept across  Tibet.  In Lhasa, the barriers of government organs on Linguo Road,  Beijing Road, and Jinzhu Road were all pulled down almost  overnight. Half a month later, a metals market was set up on  Linguo Road and Beijing Road was changed into a street of  clothes shops, and deluxe restaurants and hotels were found on  west Beijing road. According to the Lhasa Bureau of Industry  and Commerce, in the June-July period alone, over 500 individual  industrial and commercial entrepreneurs were added, almost 10  percent of the city's total individual and commercial  entrepreneurs. Several bustling commercial streets were also  found in such central cities and towns as Xigaze and Zetang.    Furthermore, local governments introduced "economic and  trade" contents to the numerous ethnic traditional festivals in  the summer and autumn of that year, such as Lhasa's Xuedun  festival, Gyangze's Dama festival, Nagqu's Horse-Racing  festival, Shannan's Yalong Cultural Festival, and Nyingchi's  Spring Festival. At the same time, they also held trade fairs  of different scales so that the Tibetan peasants and herdsmen  could experience a new way of spending the festivals.    In the meantime, governments at all levels in Tibet have  introduced preferential policies, set aside special funds,  quickened market development, and shifted their attention from  the previous trade fairs to all types of multifunction,  multilayer, and multiform special markets. In this connection,  real estate development, capital, labor service, and  old-clothing markets have come into being. Transactions in the  timber, grain, and fruit markets have become brisker. What is  heartening is that peasants and herdsmen have begun to appear in  the market arena. A special market has been set up in Lhasa  specifically for peasants and herdsmen coming into the city to  do business. Today, Lhasa people are beginning to speculate on  stocks now that the Lhasa Securities Exchange has been put into  operation.    Over the past two years, Tibet's national economy has  developed at a higher growth rate each year. As far as its GNP  is concerned, it was 2.535 billion yuan in 1991, 3.27 billion  yuan in 1992, and 3.65 billion yuan in 1993. Calculated at  comparable prices, these figures were 3.7 percent, 7.1 percent,  and 8.1 percent higher respectively than in the previous year.</p>

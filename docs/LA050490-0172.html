			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FLORIDA KILLER ELECTROCUTED  </P> <P> A killer who described himself and his girlfriend as a "modern-day Bonnie and  Clyde" was executed in Florida's electric chair today for shooting two officers  14 years ago.  </P> <P> Jessie Joseph Tafero was electrocuted at 7:13 a.m. at Florida State Prison,  eight hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution, exhausting  his last appeal.  </P> <P> The executioner interrupted the standard two-minute, 2,000-volt electrical  cycle because of the smoke and flames when a wet sponge on Tafero's head caught  fire, said state Corrections Department spokesman Bob Macmaster. But he said  the prison's chief medical officer, Dr. Frank Kilgo, believed Tafero died  quickly.  </P> <P> The killings occurred Feb. 20, 1976, when a state trooper and a visiting  Canadian constable checked on a car parked on the highway where Tafero, his  girlfriend Sonja Jacobs, her two children and traveling companion Walter Rhodes  Jr., were sleeping. Trooper Phillip Black died of gunshot wounds to the head  and neck, while Constable Donald Irwin of Kitchener, Ontario, received fatal  wounds in the right eye and shoulder.  </P></p>

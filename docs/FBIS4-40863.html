			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric] </F>   [Text] In the wake of last week's incident in parliament,  the indignant refugees making their temporary home in the city  of Zugdidi and Zugdidi Rayon have addressed to Eduard  Shevardnadze a brief letter supporting the head of state's  actions aimed at a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian  conflict. "Enough bloodshed, enough casualties, our material  and moral resources have long been exhausted," the letter says.  "The refugees have reached the point where they have begun  begging." The documents [as published] are signed by several  hundred people driven to desperation, they voice their  indignation at the irresponsibility of opposition-minded  deputies and their "jingoist speeches" in parliament. "We ask  you to take all the necessary measures for a timely and  unimpeded bringing in of peacekeeping forces and their  deployment in Abkhazia," the authors of the letter insist.</p>

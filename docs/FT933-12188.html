			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Langbaurgh left in options limbo: The review of local government structure itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy. FT reporters examine the issues ANY CONFUSION over precisely which is the Local Government Commission's preferred option for the Cleveland borough of Langbaurgh is, it says, in the minds of inattentive journalists influenced by hostile publicity. In May the commission announced its preferred Cleveland option was four new unitary authorities, including Langbaurgh, based on existing borough council boundaries. One non-preferred option was to scrap Langbaurgh, splitting its territory between Middlesbrough and a new Yorkshire unitary authority. Then in June the commission announced its preferred option for North Yorkshire, based on the historic Ridings. 'The North Riding would cover the area of the present districts of Hambleton, Richmondshire, Ryedale, Scarborough and (possibly) that part of the district of Langbaurgh which was formerly in Yorkshire,' it said. This, critics say, conflicts with its preferred Cleveland option. Not so, says the commission. 'You have preferred option A, which is with Langbaurgh, and preferred option B without it,' it said. The commission added that while it was obliged to state a preferred option, 'it's still hedged around with a degree of vagueness because further consultation could lead the commission to change its mind'. What Langbaurgh's 143,000 residents think is far from clear. Only 582 returned a coupon in the council's free newspaper, delivered to all 59,000 homes, requesting their views. Of the 582, 35.7 per cent backed the commission's preferred Cleveland option.</p>

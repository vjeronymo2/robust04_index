			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fair access key to financial markets Sir, Frances Williams missed a critical point in the article, 'Unfinished Business in Uruguay Round' (August 16). She characterised ongoing negotiations on financial services as '. . . in essence a bilateral argument between the US and Japan . . .' From the US financial community's perspective, this is incorrect. While it is true that some segments of the US financial service sector still face market access and national treatment issues in Japan, many of the significant problems confronting US financial services providers are in the developing markets of Asia. Simply stated, US financial markets remain wide open to entry by foreign financial firms. On the other hand, US financial firms face barriers limiting their ability to penetrate markets abroad. In many promising markets, they are prohibited from establishing or expanding operations. Other problems run the spectrum from denial of access to local debt markets to discriminatory or unpublished licensing procedures. Singling out Japan misses the point of the financial services negotiations - a successful financial services agreement must achieve substantial liberalisation across a wide range of commercially important countries. At the conclusion of the round in 1993, virtually no meaningful commitments had been made. Acceptance of offers on the table would have locked US financial markets permanently open while foreign markets would have remained closed. CSI Financial Services, a private sector coalition of US financial firms and associations, remains committed to the position it has taken throughout the negotiations - open access to all financial markets sets the foundation for increased economic growth and job creation. That was the goal of the Uruguay Round, and continues to be the goal of the services negotiations.

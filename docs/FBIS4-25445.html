			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Lin Tzu-Chieh (2651 1311 2212): "HIV </F> Carriers Discovered in 22 Provinces in China"]    [Text] At present, 22 provinces in China have reported HIV  carriers and the reported number is 1,159. However, departments  concerned have estimated the actual number of HIV carriers is  between 5,000 and 10,000. There is a tendency toward a gradual  spreading of AIDS in China. According to Ministry of Public  Health officials, shortage of funds and insufficient publicity  and education are two major difficulties in the prevention and  treatment of AIDS at present.    Sun Xinhua, a Ministry of Public Health official, said  during  an interview with this reporter by long-distance telephone  yesterday: Although governments at various levels allocated 10  million yuan for the prevention and treatment of AIDS last year,  the amount was far from enough and there was difficulty in  meeting the needs. Therefore, in some places where increased  investment has been made, special test centers and hospitals  have been set up. However, most patients have to receive  treatment at ordinary hospitals. Some patients stay at home and  are visited by local doctors once a month or once every two  months.    At present, China still has not formulated laws or  regulations on the prevention and treatment of AIDS, said Sun  Xinhua. In 1988, the Ministry of Public Health promulgated a  policy document--the "Law on the Prevention and Cure of  Contagious Diseases," which has been in force until now. The  authorities are thinking of taking further measures to  strengthen management of the prevention and treatment of AIDS  but nothing has yet been put on the legislation agenda. China  is an area in which the spreading of AIDS is not serious but  there is a tendency toward a gradual spreading of the disease.  HIV carriers are concentrated in Yunnan, Fujian, Guangdong,  Shanghai, and Beijing, said Sun Xinhua, and those in Yunnan  account for 80 percent of the total. The main reason why there  are more HIV carriers in Yunnan is that many people inject  drugs. Sexual contact is another way of spreading the disease.  A considerable number of HIV carriers in other cities have been  infected abroad. Some are foreign staff members and workers.  Others have become HIV carriers after working as laborers or  after visiting their relatives abroad.    In view of the actual situation in China, said Sun Xinhua,  the authorities have followed two main principles in the  prevention and treatment of AIDS. One is to take measures to  slow down the speed of the spreading of the disease. The other  is to make great efforts to carry out publicity and education  work by means of the press and to pay special attention to  monitoring the "high-risk groups."    In response to being asked whether or not HIV carriers are  discriminated against in China, Sun Xinhua said: In many places  in the world, HIV carriers are being discriminated against but  the public health administrative departments in China have  demanded that various localities should not discriminate against  HIV carriers and the identities of HIV carriers must be kept  secret. However, in the eyes of the people, these HIV carriers  are beneath pity. The people think that undesirable habits are  the main cause of contracting the virus.</p>

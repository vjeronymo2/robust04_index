			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE DENOUNCES LIBYA INCIDENT  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze today called the U.S.-Libyan  clash over the Mediterranean "unacceptable," and said the incident has poisoned  the atmosphere of this week's international conference on chemical warfare.  </P> <P> "There has been a very disagreeable incident involving Libyan planes,"  Shevardnadze said after his arrival at Orly Airport the day before the start of  the 140-nation conference.  </P> <P> "This is unacceptable. This incident poisons the atmosphere on the eve of the  Paris conference," said Shevardnadze, who is scheduled to meet Secretary of  State George P. Shultz on Sunday.  </P> <P> "There must be no more negative complications in the Mediterranean," he added.  </P> <P> Asked about U.S. claims that Libya is building a chemical weapons plant, the  Soviet minister said, "I think that without proof, no government has the right  to make such an accusation."  </P> <P> The remarks came after Shultz spent the day seeking support from his foreign  counterparts in the U.S. effort to pressure Libya into halting operations at  the plant.  </P> <P> Shultz, who arrived a day earlier, met today with French President Francois  Mitterrand, French Prime Minister Michel Rocard and the foreign ministers of  France, Canada, Egypt and Sweden.  </P> <P> Afterward, France, Canada and Egypt joined in supporting the U.S. contentions  that Libya is manufacturing poison gas in a factory southwest of Tripoli.  </P> <P> Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi has insisted only pharmaceuticals were being  manufactured at the Rabta complex 60 miles southwest of the Libyan capital. But  Shultz contends he has adequate evidence to support the U.S. allegation.  </P> <P> A top U.S. official said Shultz plans to brief Shevardnadze on evidence that  the Libyans plan to make chemical weapons at the Rabta plant.  </P> <P> "He (Shultz) will tell them (the Soviets) more than they know now, but less  than what our allies know," the official said.  </P></p>

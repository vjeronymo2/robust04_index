			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> METS' VIOLA AS HOT AS WEATHER IN ATLANTA  </P> <P> Darryl Strawberry is hitting moonshots, and Mackey Sasser is wielding a  powerful bat, but the New York Mets are the hottest team in the major leagues  because of their pitching.  </P> <P> Frank Viola is the bellwether of the staff that is largely responsible for the  Mets winning 17 of their last 19 games and 26 of their last 31.  </P> <P> Viola, with late-inning help from John Franco, became the National League's  first 13-game winner Sunday when the Mets edged the Braves, 2-1, at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Pitching in 100-degree weather, Viola gave up seven hits in 7 2/3 innings.  Franco got the last four outs -- although he walked two in the ninth inning --  for his 17th save. Viola, who probably will not pitch in Tuesday's All-Star  game because he pitched Sunday, has a 13-3 record.  </P> <P> The left-hander, obtained last July 31 in a trade with Minnesota, was the Mets'  pitching staff early in the season. When the club was a struggling 16-14, Viola  was 7-0.  </P> <P> "It was really too hot to pitch," Viola said. "All I could do was go out there  and throw hard for as long as I could. I was tired and just hoping to make it  through eight so John (Franco) would only have to go one. But I couldn't make  it."  </P> <P> Strawberry's two-out double in the first inning produced one run for the Mets,  and Sasser's single set up the other run in the second.  </P> <P> Houston 5, Montreal 3 -- Pinch-hitter Terry Puhl hit a two-out, two-run double  off Dennis Martinez in the seventh inning, and the Astros finally won another  road game.  </P> <P> The Astros had lost seven in a row and 20 of their last 21 away from the  Astrodome. They were trailing Martinez (6-7) until the hit by Puhl brought them  from behind.  </P> <P> "I don't enjoy facing Dennis in that situation," Puhl said. "He has one of the  best curves in the game. I just went up there swinging and connected."  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, San Diego 1 -- Bob Tewksbury (4-1) gave up three hits in 8 1/3  innings at San Diego, and Willie McGee, the No. 5 hitter in the league in  batting average at .320, had two hits and drove in two runs.  </P> <P> Tewksbury has given up only one earned run in his last three starts, covering  23 1/3 innings. McGee was eight for 16 in the four-game series.  </P> <P> San Francisco 5-10, Chicago 3-4 -- Kevin Mitchell ended a five-for-33 slump  with home runs in each game at San Francisco to help the Giants cut the Reds'  lead in the West to eight games.  </P> <P> Mitchell hit a two-run home run in the first inning of the opener and was five  for eight for the day. He has 21 home runs, 50 RBIs and a .312 batting average.  </P> <P> The Giants' two young pitchers, Trevor Wilson (6-0) and John Burkett (9-2),  earned the victories. Wilson went 5 2/3 innings in the first game, and Burkett  went seven in the second.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, Cincinnati 3 -- John Kruk drove in the tying and winning runs  with singles at Philadelphia and the Phillies avoided a four-game sweep.  </P> <P> Kruk's two-out single in the seventh inning off Norm Charlton (6-3) scored  Randy Ready from third base with the tiebreaking run.

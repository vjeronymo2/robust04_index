			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> KWIZ RADIO DEALS WITH COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> KWIZ radio, which had until today to solve interference problems caused by its  antenna, has successfully addressed the complaints of residents and will  continue to broadcast from a hillside in Orange.  </P> <P> In August, the City Council ordered the station to deal with the complaints or  risk losing the conditional use permit that allowed it to broadcast from the  western slope of Crawford Hills.  </P> <P> KWIZ, operated by Liberman Broadcasting, has broadcast adult contemporary music  for years through the television sets, tape decks and telephones of area  residents.  </P> <P> The station spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to resolve  problems at 73 homes, according to station officials. The company hired  engineers and other personnel to make more than 100 house calls to community  members.  </P> <P> Shirley Grindle, one of the residents who helped bring the problem to the  council's attention, congratulated KWIZ for "taking the bull by the horns" and  addressing the complaints.

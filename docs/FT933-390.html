			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / IMRO eyes marketing claim IMRO, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, is considering possible disciplinary action against Hill Samuel Investment Management for overstating the performance record in marketing literature for one of its most successful products. The literature relates to HSIM's active quantitative fund management product, an investment technique which relies heavily on using mathematical models to select stocks based on analysis of large quantities of data. While HSIM marketed its so-called AVM product using internally generated performance measurement figures calculated by a Datastream software product, most clients had their returns monitored by WM Company, an independent performance measurement firm. 'The Datastream figures tend to be higher rather than lower' than the WM figures, said Mr Richard Bernays, chief executive of HSIM. He said that upon discovering the discrepancies last summer, Hill Samuel brought the matter to Imro's attention itself. The product, whose marketing literature showed it was able to produce returns two to four percentage points above the FT-A All-Share Index, barely matched the index in 1992 and had not performed particularly well this year either, Mr Bernays said. Performance returns are the single greatest determinant in a fund manager's ability to win and keep pension fund clients. Poor performance, or questions about the validity of a manager's performance data, would be a serious blow to any investment firm, pension consultants say. The team which developed the so-called AVM product, widely regarded as among the most successful of its type in Britain, left HSIM last October to work for State Street Global Advisers, a division of the US-based State Street Bank and Trust Co. The move is a blow to Hill Samuel and to State Street, which is about to launch a competing product of its own. It is also a blow to the proponents of active quant techniques, just as they were hoping to expand their toehold in the traditional UK asset management industry. Mr David Miller, managing director of SSAG, said while he knew of no discrepancies generally between the way WM Company and Datastream calculated total returns, 'we generally know of problems of people trying to rebuild performance figures of earlier years'. He said that Mr Alan Greenhorn, the architect of the AVM product now developing a competing product for SSAG, had been asked to assist HSIM in uncovering its problem. But because of a confidentiality agreement SSAG could shed no light on what the problems were. SSAG agreed to confidentiality 'because Alan and two other colleagues were former HSIM employees and there were certain restrictions in their HS contracts which we managed to re-negotiate,' he said. Mr Bernays suggested that some discrepancy might be explained by what the possible existence of what he called a 'bug' in the Datastream software, which affects the way rights issues and tenders are treated. However, Mr Norman Ireland, marketing manager at Datastream, said he knew of no problems with the performance measurement product. 'If that's the case, there are an awful lot of clients who use this service and no one has complained,' he said. He also said he knew of no discussions with Hill Samuel.</p>

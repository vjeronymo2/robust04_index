			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Observer: Guv's old wheels More bad news for Rolls-Royce, motor-makers to the top-drawer. One of their most valued corporate customers is trading down to a Jaguar. Observer understands that Eddie George, taking over as Bank of England Governor next week, has spurned the Roller that traditionally goes with the job. Given that the cost of a new Rolls-Royce can range up to Pounds 167,000 in the case of the Corniche convertible, his decision to stick with his old Jag is a further sign that Britain's number one inflation fighter means business. After all, he has already agreed to freeze his salary for five years. What's next for the chop, one wonders. Afternoon tea, perhaps?</p>

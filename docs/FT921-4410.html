			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Heinz falls 12% in third quarter on restructuring costs HJ Heinz, the Pittsburgh food group, yesterday posted a 12.2 per cent drop in third-quarter net income, reflecting restructuring charges and higher marketing costs. Net income for the three months ended January 29 was Dollars 115.3m or 43 cents a share against Dollars 128.9m or 49 cents a year earlier. Sales were essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.62bn against Dollars 1.61bn. The company said the strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies also contributed to the decline in the latest quarter. Stripping out the impact of currency exchange rates, sales rose 5 per cent in the latest quarter, reflecting volume increases in a number of brands, including baby food, ketchup and cat food. For the first nine months, Heinz's net income advanced 19.6 per cent to Dollars 492.6m or Dollars 1.84 a share, including a one-off pre-tax gain of Dollars 221m from the sale of Hubinger in June. A year earlier, the company earned Dollars 411.9m or Dollars 1.55 a share. Sales eased to Dollars 4.71bn from Dollars 4.81bn a year ago. On Wall Street, shares in Heinz firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 in moderate volume. During the latest third quarter, the company's gross profits fell 3.4 per cent to Dollars 604.9m from Dollars 626.1m. Selling, general and administrative expenses were Dollars 390m against Dollars 388.1m in the 1990 quarter. Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, reiterated his forecast of growth of about 12 per cent in earnings per share and net income for the full year.</p>

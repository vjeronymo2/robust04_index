			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Wace chief blames IRA rumours for decision to resign MR JOHN CLEGG, the young businessman who built Wace Group into the world's largest pre-press printing specialist, resigned yesterday as chief executive, blaming rumours which continued to link the UK-based company with the Irish Republican Army. Security sources said the alleged links between Mr Clegg and the IRA were the subject of an investigation by the Royal Ulster Constabulary last year. No evidence was uncovered of any such links, however, and no investigation into such links is pending. The original investigation is understood to have followed a high-level meeting last June which was attended by a senior officer from the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit and officials from the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange and the Serious Fraud Office. The secret meeting at the Stock Exchange was held to discuss suspicions that individuals connected with Wace had links to the IRA. A large dossier on share transactions is understood to have been presented but enthusiasm for an investigation is believed to have been muted. The SFO declined to take on the investigation which had involved scrutiny of millions of pounds of unusual share transactions. Police in Sheffield and the RUC did pursue the matter but it was later shelved when no evidence of connections to the IRA could be found. Mr Clegg, 33, stepped down even although Wace had denied on Monday that it was the unnamed listed UK company which The Sunday Telegraph said this week was under investigation for laundering funds for the terrorist organisation. Wace's shares fell from 168p to 104p after yesterday's announcement. Mr Brian Dudley, Wace's managing director, said Mr Clegg had left because he was aware potential future press speculation would focus on his family. Although Mr Clegg would deny such allegations, he felt they would be a continuing source of embarrassment to Wace, and he should therefore step down, he said. Mr Clegg, whose mother is Irish, also resigned yesterday as a non-executive director of Anglo-Irish Bank. Mr Clegg's family holds 15 per cent of Anglo-Irish shares. Wace said: 'The directors wish to reiterate that they are not aware that the company, its investors or its directors (including Mr Clegg) have ever had any links of any sort with the IRA.' One institutional shareholder said: 'We are not satisfied with that statement and I don't know any shareholder who is . . . . It wasn't pressure from shareholders that caused him to leave.'

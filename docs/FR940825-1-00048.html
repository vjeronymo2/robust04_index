			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters raised the issue of whether deferral of termination of assistance would be available to persons with ineligible immigration status. The commenters appeared to believe that to obtain such relief, the ``family'' must have children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Temporary deferral of termination of assistance is not limited to families with children. An ineligible individual residing in Federally assisted housing could qualify for a deferral of termination of assistance if the individual could demonstrate that reasonable attempts to locate other suitable housing were unsuccessful. Recognizing that barrier-free housing suitable for mobility-impaired individuals is not readily available in the private market, it is likely that such an individual could make the necessary showing. (More permanent relief, in the form of continuation of assistance, might also be possible for a disabled person who is a member of a multi-person family that meets the special family definition, e.g., a family consisting of a disabled undocumented alien and a citizen spouse.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1988 proposed rule provided that, with respect to a tenant whose termination of assistance has been deferred once, an owner must make a determination of the availability of affordable housing and a decision about whether to extend the deferral of termination of assistance in sufficient time that the tenant can be notified at least 60 days before the expiration of the deferral period of whether termination will be deferred again.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters stated that this notice: (1) Must be given in writing at least 60 days before the expiration of the deferral period; (2) must be given in accordance with formal notice procedures (stating the reasons for any decision not to extend the deferral period, which must be based on relevant factors); and (3) must include an offer of a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD agrees that adequate notice must be given before the expiration of the deferral in all cases, and the 1994 proposed rule adopts this suggestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Availability of Alternative Housing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the deferral of termination of assistance provisions, what is important to an ineligible tenant is the type of evidence necessary to demonstrate that ``reasonable efforts'' have been made to find ``affordable housing'' of ``appropriate size''. Several commenters wanted HUD to provide specific guidelines for these terms to assure that decisions are not arbitrary. Commenter suggestions with respect to ``affordable housing'' were that this term must refer to housing for which the rent does not exceed that amount that would be paid in accordance with section 3(a) of the 1937 Act for a unit in the public housing program, and housing that is required to meet HUD's Section 8 Housing Quality Standards. Another commenter suggested that this term should refer to housing located in the same community as that in which the tenant is currently residing, and that ``appropriate size'' be established with reference to HUD housing programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If ``affordable housing'' and ``appropriate size'' of unit were defined as suggested by the commenters, it is likely that the only housing that would satisfy the test would be HUD-assisted housing. In many markets, housing assisted by HUD under the 1937 Act is the only resource available to poor families that meets those specifications, and, therefore, the test of the availability of other affordable housing would have little meaning. Consequently, HUD declines to define the ``affordable housing'' alternative in the terms suggested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, HUD agrees that some guidance on the subject is needed, and the 1994 proposed rule provides guidance. The rule provides that other affordable housing refers to housing that is not substandard, that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> N. Protection From Liability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter noted that although the 1988 proposed rule protected from liability both project owners and mortgagees who comply with the rule's verification requirements, only mortgagees are affirmatively sanctioned under the rule for noncompliance with the verification procedures. (See &sect;235.13(g) of 1988 proposed rule, and &sect;235.13(d) of 1994 proposed rule.) The commenter asked HUD to extend similar sanctions under part 200 to all project owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD has reviewed ``invalid certification'' language applicable to mortgagees, and notes that under that provision, a mortgagee in the section 235 program who falsely certifies to HUD that it has verified a mortgagor's citizenship or immigration documents, must repay to HUD the full amount of assistance payments made on behalf of the mortgagor. The provision also prohibits any additional assistance payments from being made on the mortgagor's behalf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that while the 1988 proposed rule provides HAs with flexibility in implementation, it also increases their potential liability, and asked that the rule be revised to reduce this exposure. Another commenter asked that HAs be indemnified for any wrongful determinations of eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD has not adopted either of these suggestions, since responsible entities that follow the statutory verification and due process requirements are protected from liability under both the 1987 Act and IRCA. Under section 1436a(e) (added by IRCA), HUD is prohibited from taking: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against an entity  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> with respect to any error in the entity's determination to make an individual eligible for financial assistance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  based on citizenship or immigration status *&blank;*&blank;* (if such eligibility is based upon the responsible entity's complying with the verification and other procedural due process requirements mandated under IRCA.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> And, section 1436a(f)(1), added by the 1987 Act, provides that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no agency or official of a State or local government shall have any liability for the design or implementation of the Federal verification system *&blank;*&blank;* if the implementation by the State or local agency or official is in accordance with Federal rules and regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

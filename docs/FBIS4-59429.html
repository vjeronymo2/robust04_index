			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sever Plotzker: "Do Not Let Fascism Have Its </F> Way"]    [Excerpts] On 10 May, TV mogul Silvio Berlusconi, the  newly elected Italian prime minister, presented the composition  of his government: Berlusconi's popular movement -- which  organized for the election at the record time of 10 weeks and  swept most of the Italian voter's support -- is an alliance of  three parties: Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, a populist  party seeking to turn Italy into a loose north-south federation;  the Northern League; and the National Alliance, which contains  the hardcore Italian neo- fascists. This is the first time  fascists are members of a European government since 1944.  [passage omitted]    Before it is too late -- before the representation of  neo-fascists expands, before the new fascists are again accepted  among the civilized European nations -- my government, the  Government of Israel, the government of the state of the Jews,  must take a demonstrative act against what is happening in Italy  this spring of 1994.    We cannot just let this happen. I urge and expect Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to express the Israeli Government's most  determined protest over the fact that neo-fascists were made  part of an Italian government. I expect Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres to recall Israel's ambassador in Rome for  prolonged consultations. I strongly suggest that the membership  of Italian observers in the Temporary International Presence in  Hebron be suspended for as long as they are subject to a  government the deputy prime minister of which is a neo-fascist.  And, if all the above diplomatic hints do not help, I call on  my government to downgrade the Israeli representation in Italy  from the ambassadorial to the consular level, or even less.    I am aware of the fact that some Italians might view this as  an interference with their domestic matters. Not true!  Legitimizing fascism or neo-post-fascism is no domestic matter  of any country. It is a virus that could spread like AIDS if it  is not abolished at once. Even if the Italians are willing to  stomach their fascists, we, the Jewish government, will scream  and how.    It is not only that we are entitled to do so; it is our  national duty. This is what the State of Israel is there for.  We cannot afford to keep silent. We know the dreadful price of  silence. There is no such thing as humanitarian fascism.</p>

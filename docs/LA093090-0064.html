			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOOTING THEIR OWN;  </P> <P> IN A WAR FOR VIEWERS, CABLE CHANNELS AND THE NETWORKS ARE PRODUCING THEIR OWN  MOVIES IN RECORD NUMBERS  </P> <P> Once a Hollywood runt, the made-for-TV movie has quietly grown into a behemoth.  Thanks to the cable industry's increasing determination to create its own  programming, viewers will be able to tune in to nearly 250 original movies and  miniseries between now and next September.  </P> <P> Even PBS' "Wonderworks" has switched to an all-movie format.  </P> <P> There were eight original movies on TV last week and there are five more this  week -- including two tonight: "Face of Fear" on CBS and "Perry Mason: The Case  of the Defiant Daughter" on NBC. Monday night, NBC airs "Promises to Keep." CBS  serves up "Angel of Death" on Tuesday, then is back Friday with "Children of  the Bride."  </P> <P> "Five years ago, there were fewer than 100 TV movies made, and most were for  the three networks," observes Aaron Cohen, senior vice president of programming  at N. W. Ayer, who chooses the movies that AT&amp;T and General Motors sponsor.  "Now the number of players in the field has tripled."  </P> <P> TV movies are proliferating because ratings show there is an enormous public  appetite for them. But the expansion has brought problems. Producers have to  compete for the services of top writers and actors; then comes the crunch of  finding an audience.  </P> <P> "Viewers are making their decision at 8:58 p.m. as to what they'll watch," says  Allan Sabinson, ABC's executive vice president of motion pictures for  television and miniseries, who will dish out 31 new titles this season. "With  all the different cable outlets, and Fox starting up a movie night, how do you  do something interesting that gets their attention?"  </P> <P> "It's harder than ever to turn out movies that don't look, feel and sound like  what everybody else is doing," says John Matoian, vice president for movies and  miniseries at CBS, which will make 32-37 original productions.  </P> <P> "Maybe there is a glut in the marketplace," concedes Tony Masucci, senior vice  president of miniseries and motion pictures for television at NBC, the  industry's biggest producer with 40 original movies and miniseries planned for  1990-91. "But movies are still a viable programming alternative. They probably  perform better than any new programming. Over the last several years, while the  network shares were declining, the three networks' movie-of-the-week shares  remained constant."  </P> <P> Yet Masucci adds a cautionary note. "Since cable got into movies, our  movie-of-the-week ratings are dropping. NBC may see the demise of one night of  movies (out of two on the current prime-time schedule) -- maybe next year."  </P> <P> Even if NBC cuts its movie production in half, however, Fox Broadcasting will  pick up the slack. The fledgling network will air its first made-for-TV movie  in November and plans to schedule one or two every month in 1991. And both  Lifetime and The Family Channel have launched modest movie schedules. "Since  women watch made-for-TV and cable movies, it seemed the most natural way to  break out," notes Melinda Fishman, vice president of original movies for  Lifetime, a basic cable service that programs for women.  </P> <P> The Family Channel is approaching movie programming more cautiously. "Six  months after a viewer watches a movie, he won't remember where he saw it," says  Paul Krimsier, Family's vice president of programming. "We're making a few  movies, but I'm more anxious to increase the number of original series we do  because they will build network loyalty."  </P> <P> In the cable world, Krimsier's voice is in the minority. "Series are riskier  and more expensive," believes Scott Sassa, executive vice president of  programming for TNT, which will make 33 movies this season. "When we started  TNT in 1988, we needed high-profile programs that would draw attention to us.  We chose films because we could get the most publicity for our money. We hoped  people would say, 'Gee, they have good movies. I should subscribe.' "  Apparently they did. From a 17 million subscriber start-up, TNT now reaches 48  million households.  </P> <P> USA Network, which is now making 30 movies a year, was similarly motivated.  "Last year we felt we needed to have a presence in original production in a  highly visible way, and movies were a way to achieve that goal," says Dave  Kenin, USA's senior vice president of programming. "Wednesday had been a so-so  night for us. Now, as our movie night, it's No. 1 in terms of (audience)  delivery."  </P> <P> HBO, Showtime and The Disney Channel, all pay-cable networks, have made their  own films in the past but have recently decided to step up production.  "Overwhelmingly, original movies are a great influence on retaining  subscribers," Disney Channel president John F. Cooke says. "They also bring  subscribers because people read about them and see them listed. Every year we  make more because our subscribers want them."  </P> <P> "Ratings of HBO movies on average are higher than (theatrical) movies we get  from studios," says Robert Cooper, senior vice president of HBO Pictures. "More  subscribers watch HBO-produced pictures than the average movie on our service.  If you look at the gross rating points, which add up all the times each movie  plays, an HBO picture measures 43 while the average picture measures 31. That  means we have a 39% advantage for our pictures. In homes that get HBO, an HBO  picture gets about a 10% higher rating than network programming when it first  premieres."  </P> <P> Cooper, who made the first original cable movie, "The Terry Fox Story," in  1983, jokes about the current proliferation of product, "I started some of the  trouble. We believed it could lead to a lot of films for HBO. We didn't know it  would explode out of HBO. An HBO movie used to be an event. It is no longer.  Now people want to know, 'What's the hook?' "  </P> <P> Competition for good scripts and top actors is becoming more heated than ever.  "I see a problem in having a lot of good actors who do good work bumping up  against themselves," CBS' Matoian says, referring to such instances as "L.A.  Law's" Michael Tucker starring in his network's "Archie's Wife" and NBC's  "Casey's Gift: For Love of a Child." "Hopefully we'll attract more talent from  outside the TV world. For instance, this season we'll have Glenn Close and  Christopher Walken in 'Sarah, Plain and Tall.' "  </P> <P> Lindsay Law, executive producer of PBS' "American Playhouse," who has been  making high-quality, low-budget movies for a decade, notes, "It's been more  difficult for us casting lately because there's a wider range of choices for  actors." The surge in TV/cable movies comes at a time when the feature film  business has thrown heavy resources into action pictures. "Because small  theatrical production companies are falling on hard times, a whole wealth of  talent that was making interesting independent movies in America is coming to  us," says Colin Callender, executive producer of HBO Showcase, a division of  HBO that makes lower-budget films.  </P> <P> Others are finding projects in someone else's rejection pile. "Some of our  scripts were sitting around," USA Network's Kenin says.  </P> <P> And what of the TV movie's continuing image problem? Since its inception 26  years ago, the form has often been brushed off as merely a modern incarnation  of the old B-movie.  </P> <P> "They are B-movies," NBC's Masucci acknowledges, "but B means budget, made for  a price. B doesn't mean bad."  </P> <P> With so many TV movies being made, programmers increasingly are trying to  pinpoint specific audiences rather than cater to everyone. The major networks,  of course, have a broader mandate than their competitors, but even they have  recognized the importance of niche programming. Following is a breakdown of the  movie-making philosophy of each broadcast and cable network that makes original  films.  </P> <P> ABC -- Philosophy: "This season will be markedly different," says Allan  Sabinson, executive vice president of motion pictures for television and  miniseries. "We're moving toward quality pieces and first-rate original dramas.  We're also dealing with issues -- civil rights, AIDS, rights of the  handicapped, treatment of American Indian natives, the Middle East. We're  moving away from ripped-from-the-headlines docudramas. We've done them ('The  Preppie Murder'; 'Challenger'), and we'll do them again, but for the moment  they've been done to a point where it's a joke. We think audiences are tired of  them."  </P> <P> Audience: Primarily women. "Women are more desirable to advertisers. The male  does more zapping. They are more fickle viewers. They're more apt to go off in  pursuit of sports or cable."  </P> <P> CBS -- Philosophy: "We try to get an incredibly varied slate of movies," says  John Matoian, vice president of movies and miniseries. "We will have comedy,  romantic comedy, horror, science fiction, Westerns and headline movies. We want  to do event movies that attract major casting. We eventually hope to attract a  younger audience."  </P> <P> Audience: Sunday night -- primarily women; Tuesday night -- lead-in is "Rescue  911," which attracts a lot of male viewers, so CBS hopes to attract men and  women to its movie offering. "When you try to please everybody, you end up  pleasing nobody," Matoian says. "But when you're reaching a much larger  audience and an advertiser-supported network base, you're less able to  specialize."  </P> <P> NBC -- Philosophy: "A balanced cross-section of films not weighted to one genre  or another," says Tony Masucci, senior vice president of miniseries and motion  pictures for television. "In terms of content, I do believe that we offer more  substance than most theatrical releases. We have no more or less  headline-driven films than before. Some can make sense dramatically, others  not."  </P> <P> Audience: Sunday night -- entire family; Monday night -- women. "Because of  ESPN football, which attracts a lot of male viewers, and Fox, which has a lot  of younger viewers, Sunday night is starting to look like the Monday-night  configuration," Masucci says. "There's no point in trying to get the male  audience away from football."  </P> <P> Fox -- Philosophy: "We want to offer movies that are very distinguishable from  the normal TV fare on other networks," says Lawrence A. Jones, president of FNM  Co. (for Fox Night at the Movies). "We'll have concept comedies, black  comedies, compelling dramas, Hitchcock-like thrillers and action-adventures. We  may re-make some old 20th Century Fox movies."  </P> <P> FNM, which is owned by Fox Inc., the same company that owns Fox Broadcasting,  will broadcast its first production Nov. 26, "Working Trash," a comedy about  two janitors (George Carlin, Ben Stiller) who work in a Wall Street brokerage  firm and get rich by reading what other people throw out.  </P> <P> Audience: 18-34 males and females.  </P> <P> PBS -- "American Playhouse" philosophy: "In the past, we've made a lot of  personal films that have been very narrow in their point of view," says  executive producer Lindsay Law, whose series returns in March. "Frankly, we're  shifting to stronger plots and more universal themes. We have done a lot of  enjoyable short fiction. We'll be less gentle than we used to be. We're doing  fewer historical pieces and more stories that illuminate the world now. We also  have an enormous focus on multicultural programming, telling stories about  gays, blacks, Hispanics and Asians." Audience: 30s-40s male and female.  </P> <P> "Wonderworks" philosophy: "We're a literature-based series," says senior  executive producer Jay Rayvid. "We deal with rites-of-passage stories with  heroes or heroines from 7 through to late teens. They always learn something.  Our product must be able to be aired on daytime. We have some similarities with  the Disney Channel, but they do things that don't fit our genre."  </P> <P> Audience: families.  </P> <P> Disney Channel -- Philosophy: "Our stories are about families that find  themselves in adversity -- usually some kind of social, political or economic  conflict -- and how they rise above it," Disney Channel President John F. Cooke  says. "There is always a teen, pre-teen or young adult in the setting, and  there is an interrelationship between mothers, fathers and children. The focus  tends to be on people finding themselves and building character. We've been  very successful with period pieces, but we also have contemporary subjects."  </P> <P> Audience: families.  </P> <P> Family Channel -- Philosophy: "Our movies are character-driven, with people  standing up and doing the right thing," reports Paul Krimsier, vice president  of programming. "In our Thanksgiving movie, 'Clarence,' Robert Carradine plays  the angel from 'It's a Wonderful Life,' who comes back to Earth and has another  adventure. One of our goals is that people should feel good after watching  them. They're not just escapism. They should make you think. They aren't so  unique that they couldn't appear elsewhere."  </P> <P> Audience: families.  </P> <P> HBO -- The pay-cable company has two divisions making TV movies: HBO Pictures  and HBO Showcase. "I think of HBO Pictures as Broadway and HBO Showcase as  off-Broadway," says Colin Callender, executive producer of HBO Showcase.  </P> <P> HBO Showcase Philosophy: "We tell stories never told anywhere else or we tell  them in a different way," says Callender, who'll turn out six films this  season. "We're trying to break the rules in terms of content, form and  execution. We want to do work that entertains but challenges. I have a brief  that doesn't require me to deliver massive ratings. If a project could have  been done by someone else, I don't want to do it.  </P> <P> " 'Lockerbie,' coming in December, is not a narrative drama focusing on one  character. Instead, we're saying the Pan Am 103 tragedy could have been averted  if the people doing their jobs actually did their jobs. We haven't  fictionalized anything.  </P> <P> Audience: couples rather than families, "people who have found the sort of  material they enjoy in less commercial parts of the cinema and theater."  </P> <P> HBO Pictures Philosophy: "We seek out interesting stories, and part of that is  they're controversial," says senior vice president Robert Cooper, who has 10  movies on his agenda. "We don't want to be PBS, but we also don't want to be  NBC. We can tackle political and controversial issues others are not willing to  tackle. 'Judgment' (coming Oct.13) is based on the true story of a couple in  Louisiana whose child was molested by a priest while in a church day-care  center. The networks have dealt with child molestation, but have they dealt  with the Catholic Church?  </P> <P> "We put risky material in the hands of experienced filmmakers, often feature  film directors. Nudity will be included if it's an integral part of the story.  Our shooting schedules are at least 30 days, compared to the average 17-21 days  for a TV movie."  </P> <P> Audience: over 21.  </P> <P> Lifetime -- Philosophy: "We strive to be the network (that) women will turn to  first," says Melinda Fishman, vice president of original movies, "so we'll  present material (that is) female in sensibility. Actresses are very responsive  to what we want to air. 'Storm and Sorrow' (airing in November), a true story  about rock climber Molly Higgins, who takes part in an ice-climbing expedition  in Russia, had been developed at both ABC and CBS. We worked on it, and it  became a Lifetime movie."  </P> <P> Audience: women.  </P> <P> Showtime -- Philosophy: "If the movie could be on a commercial network or basic  cable, we wouldn't be interested," says Steven Hewitt, senior vice president of  original programming and production. "We'll delve into all kinds of subject  matter, such as the supernatural, that the networks won't go near.  </P> <P> "We want pictures to look like theatrical motion pictures, and we pay a premium  for that. We will make action-adventures, psychological thrillers, mysteries,  comedies, subject matter that delves into nudity. 'Psycho IV' will air in  November, and we're now making 'Paris Trout' (based on a 1988 National Book  Award-winning novel about a white man who kills a black girl and how his life  disintegrates, starring Dennis Hopper, Ed Harris and Barbara Hershey). We give  writers more freedom to explore subject matter, plus movies don't have to be  designed for commercial breaks.  </P> <P> "While we're still in our start-up mode, we'll comb theatrical movies for  unreleased product. 'Fear' (which aired last season with Ally Sheedy) was on  the shelf. Subscribers don't care where a movie came from. We're practical and  realistic: If we can find something that's original and has never been seen,  we'll show it. But we'd love to get to the place where we produce all our  movies."  </P> <P> Audience: over 21.  </P> <P> TNT -- Philosophy: "We're developing a good niche for up-market movies," Scott  Sassa, executive vice president of programming, says. "Ted Turner's philosophy  is to do things designed to enlighten and inform rather than pander to the  lowest common denominator. However, we don't want to become a soap box. Barbara  Cartland movies are my idea of the edge of the envelope. I prefer 'Young  Catherine' or 'Chernobyl: The Final Warning' or 'Orpheus Descending,' the movie  version of the Broadway play. That's really out there.  </P> <P> "Ted's tastes are more Middle American than you might expect. He doesn't read  scripts, so I run all movie concepts by him in a monthly half-hour meeting. We  go into development with 4-6 movies a month. There is no project Ted has ever  said no to if we really wanted to do it. There are four of us who make  decisions, and if one of us likes a project enough, it'll probably go. Ted  says, 'If everybody agrees, maybe we'll be producing movies that are watered  down.' "  </P> <P> Audience: No particular demographic target.  </P> <P> USA Network -- Philosophy: "We do movies that are pure entertainment," says  senior vice president of programming Dave Kenin, whose channel airs new movies  every other Wednesday night. "They're essentially mystery movies ('Web of  Deceit,' 'Nightmare on the 13th Floor'). Usually when you hear the description,  you can begin to anticipate. There's not a lot of teaching in our movies.  They're not going to appeal to critics.  </P> <P> "We have the same approach as the networks to sex and nudity, although our  language has been more restrictive. This fall we're looking to see if we're too  prudish."  </P> <P> Audience: adults, young adults.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHO'S DOING WHAT: THE NEW SEASON'S TOP PRODUCERS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:1.89IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> NETWORK  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> MOVIES  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> MINISERIES  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> NBC  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TNT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> CBS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 30-35  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> USA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> ABC  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 27  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Home Box Office  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 16  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Disney Channel  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fox  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 10-12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lifetime  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> PBS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 22  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Showtime  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Family Channel  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 230-237  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Plus: Assorted British TV movies that air on PBS (under the "Mystery!" and  "Masterpiece Theatre" umbrellas, for example) and some cable services.  </P> <P> SOURCE: Network Executives  </P></p>

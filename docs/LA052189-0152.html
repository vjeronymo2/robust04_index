			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COLORADO GOVERNOR'S PLANE COMES TO AID OF INJURED FALCON  </P> <P> Gov. Roy Romer's state airplane was pressed into service as an air ambulance to  transport an injured peregrine falcon to a bird clinic.  </P> <P> The governor's pilot, Lt. Lloyd White, was asked if he could carry the falcon  from Lamar to Denver on Thursday, said Bryant Will, district manager of the  Colorado Division of Wildlife.  </P> <P> "No problem," White told Will. "It will be nice to have a real aviator fly with  me."  </P> <P> The falcon, which had a cut on its right shoulder, was captured Wednesday by  falconer Dale Eddleman, Will said. The falcon could have suffered the injury by  hitting a fence or telephone wire.  </P> <P> "The peregrine hadn't eaten for so long it was too weak and too hungry to be  wary as Eddleman walked up and captured it by hand," Will said.  </P> <P> The bird was taken to the Birds of Prey Rehabilitation Foundation in  Broomfield. The governor's plane was needed when a flight by a local flying  service was canceled.  </P></p>
